Treasury Laws Amendment (Enterprise Tax Plan No. 2) Bill 2017 Reference to Federation Chamber Ms MARINO (Forrest-Chief Government Whip) (09:31): I declare that the Treasury Laws Amendment (Enterprise Tax Plan No. 2) Bill 2017 is referred to the Federation Chamber for further consideration. Competition and Consumer Amendment (Competition Policy Review) Bill 2017 Consideration of Senate Message Consideration resumed. Senate’s amendment(1) Schedule 6, item 1, page 31 (lines 1 to 5), omit the Schedule. That the amendment be agreed to The reforms in the Competition and Consumer Amendment (Competition Policy Review) Bill stem from the Harper Competition Policy Review. This is the most comprehensive review of our competition law in decades, and the government are implementing the measures that are contained in this very significant review following the outstanding work done by Professor Harper, who now sits on the Reserve Bank board. The bill is a key part of the government's economic agenda and we're progressing many of those measures and these measures are contained in this bill. They complement reforms to strengthen the misuse of market power provisions, known as section 46, that the parliament passed in August, and with the passage of this legislation today both sets of amendments will be able to come into effect in the coming weeks. These reforms will strengthen Australia's competition laws, ensure they are fit for purpose and ultimately benefit consumers, business and the economy. We're back here today to finalise this bill because the Labor Party chose to amend it to protect their union mates from tougher penalties when they break the law. That's why. We shouldn't have to be here to do this, but the Labor Party want to protect their union mates from tough penalties when they break the law. The government opposed this amendment in the Senate; however, we supported the passage of the remainder of the bill, as we will do here, to ensure that these important reforms and related reforms to section 46 come into law as soon as possible. All the reforms originally put forward as part of the bill are sensible and should not have been controversial. We have not heard a peep from the opposition against any of these reforms since responding to the Harper review in late 2015 or as we drafted this bill and consulted on it. Now, suddenly and without notice, the opposition has cynically chosen to oppose schedule 6 of the bill in its original form. The original schedule 6 to this bill simply proposed to align the penalties for breaches of secondary boycott provisions of the Competition and Consumer Act to the same level as other breaches of the competition law, as recommended by the Harper review and the Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption. Incredibly, in debate on this bill in the other place Senator Pat Dodson said that Labor welcomed the government's announcement that it will align Australian consumer law penalties with the rest of the act by increasing them to $10 million and then condemned the government for doing exactly the same thing with secondary boycott penalties. Instead of supporting this sensible reform, Labor are doing what they always do-seeking carve-out options for unions that commit serious breaches of the law that are completely unrelated to industrial conditions that affect their members. Once again, Labor are happy to protect their union mates, break the law, at the expense of small business, workers, consumers and the wider economy. They do a disservice to the Australian economy. Dr LEIGH (Fenner) (09:35): Labor is pleased that the government has dropped its attempts to raise the penalties on secondary boycotts. The House has just heard the Treasurer suggest that this was a Labor measure in the Senate, and indeed it was Labor that moved not to have an increase in fines for sympathy strikes. But it wasn't just Labor. We were joined by the entire crossbench with the exception of One Nation senators. The vote in the Senate was 33 to 25, a resounding defeat of the coalition's attempt to raise the penalties on secondary boycotts. That reflects the strong view of the crossbench that this is a bad reform. The",22,Private Members Business
7,Mr Morrison (Cook,"Treasurer) (09:32): I move:government should now formally announce that it is dropping plans to raise penalties on secondary boycotts, given the clear view of the Senate. The Treasurer mentioned earlier Labor's support for tougher penalties for anticompetitive and anticonsumer conduct and sought to suggest to the House that if Labor support higher penalties for anticompetitive and anticonsumer conduct we should by rights support higher penalties for secondary boycotts. But the distinction here is international best practice. Australia's penalties for anticompetitive and anticonsumer conduct are below those elsewhere, and that's why Labor called for the penalties for anticonsumer conduct to be raised to $10 million. We took that policy to the election last year and we were pleased when the government adopted it in their budget this year. We are continuing to call on the government to adopt Labor's policies for tougher anticompetitive penalties in line with the European Union system. But in the case of secondary boycotts Australia's rules are out of step with international norms. International law-specifically International Labour Organization Convention 87-permits sympathy strikes provided the original strike is lawful. There is, as the House would be aware, a long tradition of secondary boycotts moving in and out of competition law. It was the Fraser governments of 1977 and 1980 that introduced secondary boycotts into the Trade Practices Act with the intention of targeting trade unions. The Hawke government, in the 1980s, sought to remove those provisions from the Trade Practices Act but was defeated in the Senate. It was the Keating government, in 1993, that moved some secondary boycotts into the Industrial Relations Act, only for the Howard government to return them to the Trade Practices Act in 1996. If enacted, the maximum penalty for a secondary boycott would have been nearly 800 times higher than the maximum penalty for unprotected industrial action. There can be no possible justification for unprotected industrial relations activity under the Fair Work Act 2009 to be subject to a penalty of 60 penalty units, $12,600, while the penalty for a secondary boycott is $10 million. Or we can look at the penalties for non-compliance with a section 155 order: 20 penalty units, $4,200. The measure that the government sought to sneak into this bill was a measure that would've been made it harder for workers to organise. At a time when the union membership share in the economy is falling, the last thing Australian workers need is a further attack on their right to collectively organise from a government that is supporting cuts to penalty rates and supporting attacks on unions, because we know that one of the reasons inequality has risen in Australia is the decline in union membership share. Work by Jeff Borland suggests that about a third of the rise in Australian inequality is due to the decline in union membership share in the economy. Attacking unions undermines Australian egalitarianism. Attacking unions makes Australia a less equal country. This attack on unions, attempted under the guise of competition and consumers amendments, would have increased inequality in Australia. With inequality at a 75-year high, the last thing Australians need is a government attacking unions and workers' right to bargain collectively. Labor, again, calls on the government to abandon these ill-conceived provisions that have nothing to do with competition law and everything to do with this government's ideological attack on unions and its attack on the Australian fair go. Question agreed to. Treasury Laws Amendment (Enterprise Tax Plan Base Rate Entities) Bill 2017 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Ms O'Dwyer. Bill read a first time. Second Reading Ms O'DWYER (Higgins-Minister for Revenue and Financial Services) (09:41): I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill clarifies that passive investment companies do not qualify for the lower company tax rate. The amendments in this bill will introduce a clear test that enables companies to determine whether they are eligible for the lower rate of tax of 27.5 per cent. Companies that derive more than 80 per cent of their assessable income in passive forms will not be able to access the lower company tax rate. The 'passive income' test replaces the 'carry on a business' test as a requirement for access to the lower company tax rate. The new test will have effect from the 2017-18 income year. It will make it easier for companies to determine which tax rate applies, thus providing companies with greater certainty about their taxation liabilities. The Turnbull government is reducing company tax to make Australia a more attractive location to do business. A lower rate will enable companies to reinvest more of their profits, grow their businesses and increase employment. The consequential amendments in this bill will align imputation arrangements with the new test. Full details of the measure are contained in the explanatory memorandum. Debate adjourned. Proceeds of Crime Amendment (Proceeds and Other Matters) Bill 2017 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Keenan. Bill read a first time. Second Reading for Counter-Terrorism) (09:42): I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Proceeds of Crime Amendment (Proceeds and Other Matters) Bill 2017 will make amendments to the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 to further enhance the proceeds of crime regime. The amendments in the bill will allow proceeds authorities, such as the Australian Federal Police, to restrain and forfeit property where illicit funds are used to make payments on that property. The bill does this by amending key terms in the act, including 'lawfully acquired', 'proceeds', 'instruments', 'improvements' and 'derived from an offence'.",24,Bills
8,Mr Keenan (Stirling,"Minister for Justice and Minister Assisting the Prime MinisterThese amendments are necessary as recent developments in case law have indicated that a person's interest in property is fixed at the moment of initial acquisition, and that any subsequent payments on the property are irrelevant to determining if the property is lawfully acquired or derived from crime. This is a loophole that could allow organised crime groups to use a web of financial arrangements and asset protection structures to avoid forfeiture of property. For example: criminals may be able to avoid the current proceeds of crime regime by funnelling money into ongoing property maintenance and restoration costs, mortgage repayments and improvements. The existence of this loophole is contrary to the central purpose of the act, which is to undermine the profitability of criminal enterprise. The amendments in the bill support this central purpose by allowing proceeds authorities to restrain and forfeit property where illicitly obtained money is used to service repayments on loans taken out on the property or fund improvements to the property. The amendments are designed to function alongside existing provisions in the act which protect individuals who unknowingly acquire proceeds of crime or do so lawfully. These individuals can continue to draw on robust protections which allow them to: exclude their property from forfeiture or restraint, transfer forfeited property back to themselves or obtain compensation for the proportion of the value of the property they obtained lawfully. This bill demonstrates the government's commitment to making our communities safer by taking effective steps to combat the effect of serious and organised crime, which is estimated to cost Australia and Australians $36 billion every year. Debate adjourned. Migration Amendment (Skilling Australians Fund) Bill 2017 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Dutton. Bill read a first time. Second Reading move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Migration Amendment (Skilling Australians Fund) Bill 2017 amends the Migration Act 1958 to provide for the collection of a nomination training contribution charge from employers nominating overseas skilled workers. This measure is a critical element of the government's employer sponsored skilled migration reforms, which ensure that Australian workers have priority for jobs in this country. I now turn to examine the bill in more detail. Concurrent with the introduction of the Temporary Skill Shortage visa, the government is introducing a nomination training contribution charge, to be known as the Skilling Australians Fund levy. The purpose of the Skilling Australians Fund levy is to require employers seeking to access overseas skilled workers to contribute to the broader skills development of Australians.",26,Bills
9,Mr Dutton (Dickson,"Minister for Immigration and Border Protection) (09:46): IFrom March 2018, it is intended that the Skilling Australians Fund levy will be payable by employers nominating workers for the:  Temporary Skill Shortage (TSS) visa;  Employer Nomination Scheme (ENS) (subclass 186) visa; and  Regional Sponsored Migration Scheme (RSMS) (subclass 187) visa. The Skilling Australians Fund levy will replace the current training benchmark requirement, reducing the regulatory burden on employers and providing improved training outcomes for Australians. Since 2009, employers sponsoring an overseas worker for a subclass 457 visa have been required to demonstrate expenditure of at least one per cent of their business's payroll annually on the training of Australians, or alternatively, pay an amount equivalent to two per cent of their business's payroll into an industry training fund. This system is overly complex and lacks transparency. The Skilling Australians Fund levy will fully replace these training benchmark arrangements. The creation of the Skilling Australians Fund aligns with recommendations by the 2014 Azarias review of the integrity of the subclass 457 program, and the 2016 Senate inquiry into the exploitation of temporary workers in Australia (temporary worker Senate inquiry). The Skilling Australians Fund levy will offset expenditure from the Skilling Australians Fund, a training fund administered by the Department of Education and Training (DET), to support the skills development of Australians. The levy is expected to generate $1.2 billion of revenue for the training of Australians over the forward estimates. As the levy will not be charged until March 2018, the government will provide an additional $261.2 million in 2017-18 to the Skilling Australians Fund. From 2018-19 onwards, the Skilling Australians Fund will funded by revenue raised from the levy. The establishment of the Skilling Australians Fund will create a direct link between skilled migration and the training of Australians. The government is committed to skilling Australians so they can get jobs at all levels and occupations across the Australian economy. With matched funding from the states and territories, the Skilling Australians Fund will support up to 300,000 more apprentices, trainees, and preand higher-level apprenticeships and traineeships. Spending from the Skilling Australians Fund will be prioritised toward projects brought forward from state and territory governments which support training in key areas, including:  occupations in demand  occupations with a reliance on foreign workers  industries and sectors of future growth  trade apprenticeships  rural and regional areas  people from targeted cohorts, and  industries experiencing structural adjustment. All project proposals will need to demonstrate engagement with, and support from, employers and industry. This represents a significant government commitment to ensuring that Australians can gain the skills to fill Australian jobs and succeed in a valuable career. Employers will be charged the Skilling Australians Fund levy for each overseas worker nominated to fill a vacancy in Australia. The amount of the levy will depend on the size of the business and the type and duration of the visa that the worker is nominated for. It is intended that small businesses-that is, those with annual turnover of less than $10 million-will be required to pay:  $1,200 per year for each temporary overseas worker  a one-off Skilling Australians Fund levy of $3,000 for each permanent overseas worker. Businesses with an annual turnover of $10 million dollars or more will be required to pay:  $1,800 per year for each temporary overseas worker and  a one-off payment of $5,000 for each permanent overseas worker. Whilst the Skilling Australians Fund levy will vary depending on the size of the business and the intended length of stay of the overseas worker, it is in the order of magnitude of $4,000 per worker recommended by the temporary worker Senate inquiry. The Skilling Australians Fund levy for the entire proposed period that the temporary worker intends to work in Australia will be collected at the time the employer nominates the overseas worker for sponsorship. There will be no levy exemptions, reflecting the policy intent that employers seeking to access overseas skilled workers contribute to the broader skills development of Australians. However, the Skilling Australians Fund levy will be tax deductible, and it will not be applied retrospectively-employers will not be liable to pay a levy for existing overseas workers unless the worker is nominated by that business for a new visa. It is intended that refunds of the Skilling Australians Fund levy will be made in certain circumstances, such as where an employer's sponsorship application is refused. The bill also includes amendments which will improve the visa application process. Specifically, the bill amends the act to formalise the current practice of accepting nominations for temporary overseas skilled workers by businesses that have applied to be a sponsor or entered into negotiations for a work agreement, rather than waiting for the outcome of that process. These amendments will result in improved efficiency for both employers and the Department of Immigration and Border Protection. The bill also amends the act to provide that the minister may prescribe the manner in which labour market testing (LMT) must be conducted. The act requires that evidence of LMT must be provided with a nomination by a standard business sponsor unless:  an exemption applies due to a major disaster;  an exemption applies on the basis of the required skill level and occupation for a nominated position; or  it would be inconsistent with Australia's international trade obligations. The bill amends the act to provide that the minister may, by legislative instrument, determine the manner in which labour market testing in relation to a nominated position must be undertaken and may determine the kinds of evidence of LMT that must accompany a nomination. The matters to be prescribed in an instrument are expected to include the language in which a job advertisement must be written, the method of advertisement, the period the advertisement occurs in, and the period the advertisement must run for. This bill will ensure a uniform approach to LMT from employers seeking to access an overseas worker. It will also ensure that the quality of the LMT being conducted is properly assessed. This amendment will help ensure that, where LMT is required, businesses properly test the labour market before nominating an overseas worker for a prescribed visa and provide evidence of that LMT. The Skilling Australians Fund is a further demonstration of the government's commitment to Australian businesses and to Australian workers. It will support targeted investment in critical skill needs in key regions and industries in the economy. The administration of the Skilling Australians Fund levy will also increase the transparency and accountability of training contributions made by employers utilising the skilled migration program. This will increase public confidence that skilled migration, and the businesses that bring in skilled migrants, are doing their part to help Australians prepare for the workforce. I commend the bill to the House. Debate adjourned. Migration (Skilling Australians Fund) Charges Bill 2017 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Dutton. Bill read a first time. Second Reading move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Migration (Skilling Australians Fund) Charges Bill 2017 imposes the nomination training contribution charge, as payable under new section 140ZM of the Migration Act.",27,Bills
10,Mr Dutton (Dickson,"Minister for Immigration and Border Protection) (09:55): IThis charge is to be known as the Skilling Australians Fund, or the SAF, levy. The bill is a complementary measure to the Migration Amendment (Skilling Australians Fund) Bill 2017, which amends the Migration Act to provide for the collection of the SAF levy. The bill provides that the amount of the SAF levy is the charge set in the regulations. The bill also provides that the SAF levy must not exceed the charge limit. The charge limit in the financial year beginning on 1 July 2017 is $8,000 for a nomination relating to a temporary visa, and $5,500 for a nomination relating to a permanent visa. In subsequent financial years the charge limit will be indexed by reference to the consumer price index. This charge limit provides flexibility for the Australian government to make increases to the SAF levy in future while providing certainty for business as to the limited scope for a potential increase. For temporary visas, the intention is that the SAF levy payable will be calculated according to the number of years, or part thereof, set out in the nomination. The charge limit for temporary visas is therefore calculated with reference to the SAF levy for a large business, $1,800 for each year of nomination, for a total of four years. I commend the bill to the House. Debate adjourned. National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits-Budget and Other Measures) Bill 2017 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Hunt. Bill read a first time. Second Reading That this bill be now read a second time. The National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits-Budget and Other Measures) Bill 2017 amends the National Health Act 1953 to implement measures negotiated with the pharmaceutical and pharmacy industries and announced in the 2017 budget. 1. Industry agreements-savings and policy stability The amendments reflect compacts with Medicines Australia, the representative body for the innovative medicines sector in Australia; the Generic and Biosimilar Medicines Association, which is the representative body for generic and biosimilar medicine suppliers in Australia; and the Pharmacy Guild of Australia. The compacts are underpinned by a range of shared principles to create a world-class health system, transparency in decision-making, accountability for reforms, and stability and certainty with regards to government investment. Together these agreements will generate savings to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) of around $1.3 billion over four years from 2017-18, and $1.8 billion over the five-year",30,Bills
11,Mr Hunt (Flinders,"Minister for Health and Minister for Sport) (09:57): I move:term of the agreement with Medicines Australia. This in turn will support cheaper medicines for consumers, better value for money for Australian taxpayers and improved access to product innovations. And while these savings are vital for current and future spending on medicines, the government recognises that they must be achieved in a way that works for industry and supports a viable and sustainable pharmaceutical industry in this country. It is real reform which delivers better access to more drugs while saving money and reinvesting that in new medicines. The measures in the Medicines Australia agreement do that by delivering certainty for the medicines industry through a stable PBS environment, where funding for new listings is further supported through delivering price reductions for on-patent medicines that are reaching the end of their patent life, and when these medicines come off patent and become subject to competition. This certainty will strengthen the medicines ecosystem by encouraging companies to continue to bring innovative, life-changing medicines to Australia, build partnerships with Australian researchers, and encourage investment in local clinical trials and manufacturing. This will ensure Australia remains at the forefront of the launch of new and innovative medical treatments. 2. Pricing policy changes-anniversary statutory price reductions The first of the main pricing changes in the bill extends, for another two years, the existing five per cent price reduction that applies for single brand drugs on the F1 formulary on their fifth anniversary of listing. This measure was due to end in 2020, but now will apply until April 2022. The second of the changes introduces two new anniversary price reductions for drugs on F1. These are a 10 per cent reduction after 10 years of listing on the PBS; and a further five per cent reduction after 15 years of listing. There will be a catch-up special reduction day on 1 June 2018 to apply these reductions to medicines that have already reached their 10-year or 15-year anniversary by that date, and subsequent anniversary reduction days will occur on 1 April of each year. The F1 formulary has been the fastest growing part of the PBS by price for individual medicines, and by cost to the PBS. Every new drug is an additional investment by the government in companies in the innovative medicines sector, and each contributes directly to that sector's growth. I give as examples Stelara, Entresto, Opdivo and Ibrutinib. These are critical drugs that are life-saving or life-changing. The Australian government continues to invest in new medicines by accepting all positive recommendations of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC). This is a significant and continual pipeline of reinvestment and revenue for the innovator medicines sector. It is reasonable that after a period of time, a small percentage is recouped to help support further new listings. That is the principle behind this fundamental reform. Delaying the first of the reductions until at least five years after PBS listing recognises that manufacturers need time to recoup their investment in developing and bringing new medicines to market. 2.1 Pricing policy changes-first new brand statutory price reductions The third pricing change will increase the price reduction that applies on listing the first additional new brand of a medicine. Under PBS pricing policy, when a first new competing brand lists alongside an existing brand of an F1 drug, an immediate price reduction occurs for the new brand and the existing brand. The reduction is also flowed on to other related brands and strengths of the medicine. The new measure will increase this reduction from 16 per cent to 25 per cent on such an occurrence. 2.2 Ministerial discretion for price reductions Under the new pricing arrangements, previous price reductions can be taken into account before a statutory price reduction is applied. For example, new anniversary reductions may be able to be reduced in part or waived in full by considering the net total of reductions since January 2016. As is the case for new anniversary price reductions, the increased price reduction to be applied when a new, competing brand lists on the PBS can also be adjusted, taking into account previous price reductions that have applied to the medicine. On this basis, a statutory price reduction can be applied in full, in part, or not at all-depending on the amount of previous eligible reductions. The new method will adjust, taper and cap reductions to ensure that price reductions since January 2016 do not exceed certain maximums. For example, where previous price reductions for a medicine are already equivalent to 40 per cent or more of the price on 1 January 2016 the reduction will be reduced to nil. Where previous price reductions are between 15 and 40 per cent of the January 2016 price, the reduction will be less than 25 per cent. It will be adjusted and capped so that the final reduced price is 40 per cent of the original. And where previous reductions are 15 per cent of the January 2016 price or less, the new brand reduction will be the full 25 per cent. In addition to using previous reductions to reduce listing anniversary and new brand reductions, the amendments include other provisions for discretion in applying statutory price reductions. These provisions reflect the undertakings in the Medicines Australia agreement and include that any relevant matter may be taken into account in deciding to reduce or not apply a reduction. 2.3 Price disclosure-increased price disclosure price reductions threshold Continuing the theme of considering pricing history and context in applying PBS pricing policy is a new measure for price disclosure. Under PBS price disclosure arrangements, drug companies are required to report data on sales to wholesalers, pharmacists and other suppliers. The information is used as the basis for adjusting the price for all brands of a medicine to the weighted average price. If the weighted average sale price in the market is at least 10 per cent below the PBS price, the PBS price is adjusted. Over time, PBS prices are maintained, or reduced every six months in line with average market prices. The new measure provides that after a medicine has had seven full cycles of price disclosure data collection and reduction days, the threshold for price disclosure price reductions will increase from the current 10 per cent to 30 per cent. This move should provide some relief from price disclosure reductions for medicines which may already have had repeated market-driven price reductions. It will mean that, as long as the weighted average discount for a medicine in this category is less than 30 per cent, there will be no price disclosure reduction to the base price for any related brand of the drug after the seven cycles. This will help to protect the price of medicines where there is little room left for competition or where a price reduction could affect the viability of the medicine. To ensure this measure is correctly targeted, the amendments also include that, if there are two consecutive cycles where the price disclosure reduction is at least 30 per cent, the threshold will revert to 10 per cent. 2.4 Listing of new presentations-not as new brands A specific measure welcomed by the pharmaceutical sector is that a company will be able to list a new presentation of its own originator brand without being subject to a new brand price reduction. The new presentation must be listed within five years or, with discretion, within 10 years of the original listing of the drug on the PBS. These new provisions will benefit consumers and companies by encouraging the early listing of products which are innovative new versions of already listed medicines. 2.5 Funding future medicines The government is committed to making fiscally responsible investment decisions that are informed by the best available evidence about patient safety and improved patient outcomes. That is why this government came to office promising to respect the independence of the PBAC but to improve listing times on the PBS. The agreement with Medicines Australia enables the government therefore to continue its commitment to list all medicines with a positive PBAC recommendation. Since the budget the government has made significant new investments in medicines:  $1.1 billion for Opdivo for lung and kidney cancer  $378.5 million for Stelara for Crohn's disease  $466 million for Ibrutinib for leukaemia and lymphoma 3. ACPA and pharmacy location rules I now want to turn to pharmacy location rules. Pharmacy location rules have been in place since 1990, when the Fifth Community Pharmacy Agreement was signed between the Pharmacy Guild of Australia and the Commonwealth of Australia. The location rules are also a fundamental component of the Sixth Community Pharmacy Agreement. The location rules are in place to ensure a suitable geographic spread of pharmacies approved to supply PBS medicines, including in rural and remote regions of Australia. The Sixth Community Pharmacy Agreement terminates on 30 June 2020, at which time all legislative provisions in the National Health Act 1953 relating to the rules and the ACPA are scheduled to cease. This bill will remove the cessation of operation provisions from the National Health Act 1953, preserving the existing arrangements and providing ongoing assurance and certainty for pharmacies, particularly those in rural and remote communities. Conclusion In conclusion, the landmark compacts announced in the budget reflect the government and industry's shared desire to maintain a world-class health system. They also reflect the outcome of extensive negotiations, which could only occur due to the positive and strong relationship that the government has and has been able to establish with these organisations. I would like to thank all stakeholders who have worked collaboratively with the government in recent months to develop the industry agreements and the measures in this bill. In particular, I want to acknowledge Medicines Australia, and the strong leadership of its chair, Wes Cook, supported by the CEO, Milton Catelin. Wes has been an extraordinary person to work with. He asked his industry to accept very significant reductions in remuneration in return for the listing of new medicines, and the creation of a fund and a contingency for those medicines with the savings that were otherwise made. So all of the savings are being reinvested in new listings. I want to thank all of the members of the Generic and Biosimilar Medicines Association; and the Pharmacy Guild of Australia, led by the extraordinary George Tambassis and David Quilty. This agreement, again, gives stability to the sector. In particular, it allows them to be able to plan on a long-term basis and it provides security for those pharmacists with their gearing and banking ratios. I also want to acknowledge Alex Best from my office, who played such a critical and fundamental role in the negotiation of these agreements. He has been a source of immense guidance, wisdom and counsel, as we've achieved them. We were able to achieve five major compacts at the time of the budget, with the RACGP, the AMA, Medicines Australia, the GBMA and the Pharmacy Guild of Australia. Most recently-only last week-we were able to add to that the agreement with the Medical Technology Association of Australia, which will, in turn, contribute to the stability and the affordability of private health insurance going forward and the ability to list new devices at an earlier time, giving Australian patients better access. All of these compacts together represent the first and the second wave of our current health reform program. The amendments in this bill, therefore, deliver a responsible and necessary response to growing pressures on the PBS. They provide for a fair outcome for pharmacies, the pharmaceutical industry, government and consumers. They also represent the value of taxpayers' dollars, which provide the funding for the PBS. The aim of this government is to ensure that Australians have access through the PBS to affordable medicines when and where they need them. Contributing to a more sustained and more sustainable PBS allows us to respond sooner to the increasing demand for innovative and often costly medicines. All up, this is an outstanding outcome for the medicines industry and, more importantly, for the patients of Australia. I commend the bill to the House. Debate adjourned. Health Insurance (Extended Medicare Safety Net) Determination 2017",31,Bills
12,Mr Hunt (Flinders,"Minister for Health and Minister for Sport) (10:12): I move:That in accordance with section 10B of the Health Insurance Act 1973, the House approve the Health Insurance (Extended Medicare Safety Net) Determination 2017 made on 15 August and presented to the House on 4 September. Question agreed to. Treasury Laws Amendment (2017 Measures No. 6) Bill 2017 Second Reading Consideration resumed of the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. Dr LEIGH (Fenner) (10:12): I wish to begin my contribution on the Treasury Laws Amendment (2017 Measures No. 6) Bill 2017 in a somewhat unusual way for a tax debate by noting that this is the day on which girls take over parliament. The Girls Take Over Parliament movement is grounded in the fact that in 2017 we are still in a situation where women hold less than a third of the seats in the federal parliament. With the House and the Senate combined, the share of women is just 32 per cent. There are, of course, differences across parties. That share is 44 per cent for the Labor Party, House and Senate combined; 21 per cent for the Liberal Party; 14 per cent for the National Party; and 50 per cent for the Australian Greens. But, as in Australian business, women are underrepresented in the parliament. Equally troubling, we have statistics showing that girls as young as 10 often feel as though they don't have the same chances in life. A survey by Plan International Australia and Our Watch found five out of six girls believe they're not given the same chances in life to get ahead as boys. One hundred and fourteen years after women were able to vote and stand in federal elections in Australia, we still have this entrenched gender inequity. So the Girls Take Over Parliament movement is the principle that women should have a greater say in Australian politics, that we need to ensure that the women leaders of the future have an opportunity to engage in this parliament. It's a movement which is taking place across the world, from Peru to Japan and Canada to Australia, in which young women and girls are stepping into the shoes of parliamentarians for a day. I accept that working with me may not be quite as sought after as the job of the young woman stepping into Justin Trudeau's shoes as part of this movement! Nonetheless, I'm grateful to have Yasmin Hassen, a PhD student at the Australian National University's Crawford School of Public Policy, working in my office. When I was speaking with Yasmin about this particular bill, she emphasised the importance of making sure that cryptocurrencies, like bitcoin, have an important role in the future. She is passionate about start-ups and sees a vital role for Australia in the entrepreneurship economy of the future. Her views have informed my speech today and the comments I will make on this bill. The Treasury Laws Amendment (2017 Measures No. 6) Bill ensures that the GST treatment of bitcoin is the same as for other supplies of money. This means that entities that are paying consideration in money are not liable for GST on the supply of money. This entrenches the notion that money is a medium of exchange, not consumed, and therefore not subject to GST. This accords with the principle that GST effectively applies tax to final private consumption. The treatment of bitcoin under this bill would bring Australia into line with the way the United States and the United Kingdom approach digital currencies. Neither of those jurisdictions apply value-added taxes to digital currencies, and the European Union has ruled that bitcoin is exempt from value-added tax. The measure has the support of legal and tax professionals and the fin-tech sector. States and territories have of course been consulted on the reform, given that it affects the GST, and they have agreed to it. The Senate Economics References Committee and the Productivity Commission, in separate inquiries two years ago, both recommended this measure. And concerns about the use of digital currencies for criminal activity and money laundering are addressed in the anti-money-laundering and counterterrorism financing reforms, according to the advice we've received from Treasury. As Yasmin Hassen put it when I was speaking with her about this bill, it is important that we tackle the questions of money laundering, but it ought not be beyond our wit to do so while allowing the opportunity for digital currencies, such as bitcoin, to grow. The second schedule of the bill amends the tax act to provide deductible gift recipient status for the Centre for Entrepreneurial Research and Innovation. The Centre for Entrepreneurial Research and Innovation is located near the University of Western Australia, in Nedlands, and was established in 2015. The centre is currently headed by Dr Carolyn Williams, a distinguished researcher in this field. Again, as we speak about girls taking over parliament, it's important to note that in the business sector we have not seen the same number of women becoming CEOs as men, so it is pleasing in the context of this bill to see the DGR status being provided to a centre that is headed by a prominent Australian woman researcher. As we look at the question of tax adequacy, however, it is important to recognise the tax reforms that are being left undone under this government. This is a government that has failed to tighten debt deduction loopholes used by multinational companies and a government that has failed to provide the level of transparency that Australians demand. Australians want to see more tax transparency, not less. Yet the threshold for disclosure of tax data by private companies has been raised from $100 million to $200 million, effectively taking two out of three private companies out of the tax transparency net. The government has patted itself on the back for the Chevron judgement that secured an additional $340 million for the budget bottom line. But, extraordinarily, these are laws that the coalition voted against in 2012. Minister O'Dwyer has attempted to claim credit for Labor laws that she and her colleagues opposed. The chutzpah is extraordinary. The coalition, if they'd had their way in 2012, would by now have left the budget $340 million worse off, and net debt would be rising even faster than it is already. Rather than dismissing Labor's policies to close tax loopholes, Minister O'Dwyer should accept that she was wrong in 2012 to vote against these laws. She's now praising their application in the Chevron decision, so she should issue the Australian people a mea culpa and say that she was wrong to vote against these laws and will now adopt Labor's sensible proposals to tighten debt deduction loopholes by moving to a worldwide gearing ratio rather than an arbitrary thin cap threshold. This would be an important way to boost the budget bottom line, crack down on multinational tax dodging, stem the growth of debt and ensure that we're able to fund the important investments in schools and hospitals that Australians demand. An article written by The Guardian correspondent Greg Jericho refers to a new study by the IMF examining the impact of the sorts of tax cuts which benefit the very top. It makes clear that the strategy, being pursued by the Liberal Party of Australia, of cutting taxes on the top two per cent of Australians while raising taxes on Middle Australia won't boost growth. The increase in taxes on Middle Australia that the government brought down in its budget is going to hurt growth, but the tax cut to the very top will do little to help, given that those at the very top have such high saving rates. No less an authority than the IMF has pointed out the error of the government's ways in attempting to cut taxes on those who have done the very best out of the Australian economy over the last generation. The last generation has seen the top one per cent's share almost double, yet that's a group that gets nine-tenths of the benefit from the government's decision to reduce the top tax rate by two percentage points. Ninetenths of it goes to the top one per cent, a group which has done extraordinarily well over the past generation. By contrast, the government's budget increases taxes on Middle Australia and everybody earning over about $20,000. This retrogressive measure will see taxes on Middle Australia rise while taxes on the very top fall. There are many sensible tax reforms that could be put in place. Labor has pointed out the way in which negative gearing disproportionately benefits those at the very top of the distribution. We've pointed out that without reforms to trusts Australia is seeing revenue flow away to the most affluent. Labor have had our policies carefully costed by the Parliamentary Budget Office. They have been carefully modelled. We know the benefits to the Australian economy of closing these tax loopholes. In the area of multinational tax, Labor is committed to providing protection for whistleblowers, reporting on entities evading tax and allowing whistleblowers, where their information results in more tax being paid, to collect a share of the tax penalty up to $250,000. It's an approach that has been used effectively in the United States and could bolster our coffers here in Australia. We've committed to mandatory shareholder reporting of tax haven exposure-that is, companies must disclose to shareholders as a material tax risk whether the company is doing business in a tax haven. We've committed to introducing public reporting of Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre data and requiring the annual public release of international cash-flow data. We've committed to requiring government tenderers to disclose their country of tax domicile for contracts worth more than $200,000. If you want a government contract, Labor believes that you should have to state your country of tax domicile so that the Australian public clearly know where government tenderers are located. Labor are committed to developing guidelines for tax haven investment by superannuation funds. We will work with the Australian Tax Office, in collaboration with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, to develop guidelines for responsible investment by superannuation funds. We will introduce a publicly accessible registry of the beneficial ownership of Australian listed companies, allowing everyone to find out who really owns our firms and preventing shareholders from using complex structures and sham ownership to avoid complying with corporate transparency rules. Finally, Labor would require the Australian Taxation Office's annual report to provide information on the number and size of tax settlements. Labor will support the modest measures contained in this bill, but we do believe there is a deep and important tax reform agenda which must be pursued. We call on the coalition to move beyond these worthy but modest measures to much more significant reforms to our tax system to reduce inequality and build a more egalitarian Australia. Debate adjourned. Reference to Federation Chamber leave-I move: That the Treasury Laws Amendment (2017 Measures No. 6) Bill 2017 be referred to the Federation Chamber for further consideration. Question agreed to. Treasury Laws Amendment (Reducing Pressure on Housing Affordability Measures No. 1) Bill 2017 First Home Super Saver Tax Bill 2017 Second Reading Cognate debate. Consideration resumed of the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. to which the following amendment was moved: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""The House declines to give the bill and related bill a second reading as: (1) the First Home Super Saver Scheme will do nothing to address housing affordability but will instead work to undermine Australia's world class superannuation system; and (2) any housing affordability package that does not include reforms to negative gearing and capital gains tax is a sham."" Ms TEMPLEMAN (Macquarie) (10:27): My 26-year-old daughter moved house yesterday. She and her flatmates have been through the hunt for a property in Sydney's inner west. They found one, were given verbal approval and then were gazumped when someone offered $150 more a week. They found another one, got approved and then had to find replacement tenants for their current home, which young people reckon is easier than trying to go through the tedious bond recovery progress. These rental properties are not bargains. They take a huge chunk of weekly earnings even when shared between as many people as can comfortably fit into a property. The owners of these properties are not looking to provide a long-term home for anyone most of the time. They're looking to return a profit or benefit from negative gearing and make a capital gain, which hasn't been hard to do in the Sydney market. This is my daughter's fourth house in as many years, and her story is pretty typical of what young people from my electorate of Macquarie who gravitate to the inner west for study or work go through. So what? They're young-they can do it. In fact, many of us would have had a similar nomadic experience in our 20s as we got through study and our first jobs. But unfortunately the likelihood is that this pattern will be repeated throughout my daughter's 30s, 40s and even 50s, given how unaffordable homeownership is becoming. In fact, far fewer people in their 30s, 40s or 50s own their own home, in spite of having steady relationships and steady jobs. Women nearing retirement who don't own a home are in an extremely precarious position.",35,Regulations And Determinations
13,Mr Ciobo (Moncrieff,"Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment) (10:26): byThe past five years have seen national home prices rise by 19 per cent while household incomes have risen by half that, at 9.2 per cent. Right now we're seeing the lowest wage growth on record. The 13th annual Demographia international housing affordability survey: 2017 shows that all but seven of 54 Australian markets that were studied are rated as either seriously unaffordable or severely unaffordable. There are the options of Karratha, Kalgoorlie, Gladstone or Port Hedland, which are rated as affordable, but they won't necessarily match up with people's employment options. By contrast, in the early 1980s every market except Sydney was rated affordable, which is actually how I came to live in the Blue Mountains on Sydney's fringe. The 2016 census confirms that over the last decade home ownership rates have fallen significantly for all age brackets below the age of 55. Prices in my electorate have certainly risen fast. Analysis by the Grattan Institute shows that this will lead to generations of Australians becoming permanent renters. A report in August this year from the Committee for Economic Development of Australia called for 10-year or five-year lease agreements, acknowledging that an increasing percentage of Australians will become lifetime renters. The report also warns that the affordability crisis is likely to continue for another 40 years, unless there are major changes. That means it's not only the generations of Australians who are currently under 55, but many more to come, who will struggle to save enough to access the housing market, and the dream of home ownership may remain elusive. So, this is the issue we face, and here we have a scheme by the government that purports to be trying to improve the affordability issue for first home buyers. But, without addressing the key driver of demand-namely, the investors competing in the market-it is doomed. Australian Bureau of Statistics data shows that investors make up 47 per cent of mortgage demand nationally, and in New South Wales it's 55 per cent. So, in New South Wales, a home is more likely to sell to an investor than an owner-occupier. What's more, the measures being proposed by the government undermine the integrity of the superannuation system. It's a bit like building a new road: they simply shift the problem to another stage of the journey-in this case, retirement. I remember the first time in this place that I heard about superannuation. It was the early 1980s-in fact, it was in the old parliament. As a 21-year-old I had just begun in the Canberra press gallery. The then Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, his Treasurer and the ACTU leader, Bill Kelty, talked about employers paying three per cent of wages into superannuation. I don't think we'd even shortened the word superannuation to 'super' at that stage. I'm not really sure I cared about it, and that's the problem. When you're in your early 20s, and just starting out in a job, the least of your worries is how you will fund your retirement. But Prime Minister Keating recognised that we needed to talk about super. In 1991, he proposed a retirement income scheme where the age pension was augmented by a privately funded and employer related national scheme. Superannuation accounts are supposed to be secured savings for generating retirement income, and not for use by governments for other reasons. This government is contradicting its own stated primary objectives for superannuation-that is, to provide income in retirement. The problem with this legislation is not just the exemption it is creating for first home buyers but the precedence it sets for many other possible exemptions. How many are you going to make? Will the government let someone access their super when their house burns down and they are under-insured, when they want to upgrade to a new home, or when they want a pool? This so-called First Home Super Saver Scheme will actually work to undermine Australia's world-class superannuation system. If it's about encouraging young people to save, you can create other incentives for them to save for their first home, if you think that's a game-changer. But what I hear from young people is that they are barely able to cover their costs, let alone put away any savings. According to experts, including National Shelter, super saver accounts will make the housing crisis worse by pushing up prices. So this on its own is not going to help with housing affordability, and may make things worse. As for the other measures in the bill, let's look at the measure about contributing the proceeds of the sale of a home to superannuation. I have no problem with the principle of helping people to downsize. Large family homes designed for children, and then visiting grandchildren, may not suit people's lifestyles and they may want to downsize. If this measure were split from the First Home Super Saver Scheme, we would be open to supporting it. However, does it really reduce pressure on housing affordability? Labor piloted this idea in 2013-14, trialling a means test exemption for age pension recipients who downsized their family home. Up to $200,000 would have been put in a fund exempt from the pensions means test for up to 10 years. Sadly, this government scrapped that pilot program, so we don't really have a number of years of watching it to see what the impact might have been. And this version 2.0 has no data from Treasury to support its impact on housing supply-not a piece of evidence to show that it will make a difference. Industry Super Australia says the measure will be used by self-funded retirees rather than age or veteran pensioners because there are no changes to the pension income or assets test, and the numbers won't add up for people who, right now, would qualify for a pension. Typical of this government-a half-baked idea, poorly executed. When it comes to tackling housing affordability, there is no doubt that there is urgency to act. If we want our current generations, who are looking at housing prices rising, to aspire to have a home, then this parliament does need to do something. But, if the government doesn't act on changes to capital gains tax and negative gearing, it is just going to make the situation worse. It really can't run away from that as a general principle. I'm reminded-and I think this bears repeating-that John Daley from the Grattan Institute described it really well when he said, with regard to this package of measures that the government has put up, 'You'll need a scanning electron microscope to see an impact on prices.' I gather that they help you zoom in and look at really tiny changes. That's what needed to see whether this would make any difference. Mr Daley says you won't see a discernible difference in the number of young people that buy a house. That's a tragedy, because we have a responsibility to make sure that every 26-year-old who moved house yesterday, no matter where there are in this country, can aspire to own their own home. Many of us would appreciate the benefits of home ownership: the security of knowing that you actually have a place to age in and the security of knowing that you don't have to have three-monthly inspections where someone comes along and tells you whether you've been keeping the house neat enough. These are the sorts of invasions that people face. A common situation for so many renters in New South Wales is that you can't have pets in your home, unlike the situation under the Victorian government(Time expired) Macquarie. She did make some very good points about the importance of housing affordability and giving all Australians, especially young Australians, an opportunity to own their own home. But I am confused as to why, if the member for Macquarie believes in all of those things, she will not be supporting the Treasury Laws Amendment (Reducing Pressure on Housing Affordability Measures No. 1) Bill 2017. The member for Macquarie was correct when she said that young people often find that, after they go through all their living expenses and pay their rent, they don't have enough left over to make significant savings contributions to build up savings to pay for the deposit for a home. That's exactly correct. That is what this legislation tackles exactly. So I'm at a loss as to why members of the Labor Party, including the member for Macquarie, acknowledge that that is a problem but will not actually support this bill. It shows a difference in the concept of superannuation between the coalition and the Labor Party. On this side of the House, we understand that every dollar that gets put into someone's superannuation account has to be earned first. The money doesn't come from some mythical magic money tree. That money must be earnt. The wealth must be created. The money that would otherwise be in a person's salary gets taken out of their salary and put in a compulsory super contribution. I am in my mid-50s and when I first started to work-before there was any superannuation scheme of any significance-I was able to take 10 per cent of my salary and save that up as a deposit for my first home. We tell this generation: 'We're sorry; you can't do that. Of the total wealth that you earn or create in the job that you do, we're going to take around 10 per cent of that and force you to put that into compulsory savings that you cannot touch until you are 65 years of age. And when you are 65 years of age you can then go and invest that money in a house.' Unless a person owns their own home when they reach the retirement age of 65, they will be reliant on the pension scheme from the government. The best savings that any Australian can have is to own their own home. That is what we are trying to do with this legislation. We do have an issue with housing affordability in this nation. It is clearly more difficult for young Australians to get into the market today than it was a generation ago. If you look at the raw numbers, the actual mortgage repayments as a percentage of salary may not be that much higher but what is significantly higher is the cost of the deposit that they must pay. That is exactly the problem that we are attacking. With this bill, from 1 July 2017, individuals will be able to make voluntary contributions of up to $15,000 per year and $30,000 in total to their superannuation account to purchase their first home. These contributions, which will be taxed at 15 per cent, along with the deemed earnings, can be withdrawn from a deposit. Withdrawals will be taxed at the marginal tax rate, less 30 per cent offset and allowed from the 1 of July 2018. For most people, the First Home Super Saver Scheme could boost the savings they put towards a deposit by at least 30 per cent compared with savings in a standard deposit account. This is exactly the way that this parliament can help young people get into their first home. If they can get into their first home, the greatest forced savings is their ability to pay off their mortgage. But those on the other side of the chamber say no, because they don't want to let people have control and make a decision about how they can best use their superannuation savings. They would rather that money go to some union controlled fund. That is what their",39,Bills
14,Mr Craig Kelly (Hughes) (10:37,"I am very pleased to follow the member foropposition against this is all about. Those opposite don't want individuals to have a say about where their savings should go and how their savings should be used. They don't want anything that affects the money that flows into their union controlled funds and which their union mates get control of. That is what their opposition is all about. They're putting their union buddies ahead of young Australians and the opportunity for young Australians to get a deposit and get into the housing market. Support for their union buddies is more important. The second part of this bill deals with the issue that we find in our society when many couples who own their own homes look to downsize when their kids move out of home. They're couples who were able to buy a house many years ago and have enjoyed a massive appreciation in the value of their house. When they look to downsize-which would normally be the common-sense thing they would like to do-and they do all the sums, the taxation arrangements and the superannuation arrangements deter them from making the decision to downsize. So we find in many of our suburbs a lot of housing stock-fourand five-bedroom homes in the outer suburbs of Sydney-and we have couples in retirement, aged over 65, that, all things being equal, would prefer to move to a smaller unit but don't do so because of the taxation and superannuation arrangements. If we were able to allow the market to work normally and people who lived in a fouror five-bedroom home who preferred to live in a twoor three-bedroom unit could do so, that would free up supply in the market. Freeing up supply is one way that we can get downward pressure on housing prices and make housing more affordable for young Australians. But, yet again, we see the Labor Party opposing this. These are the principles we are proposing to help couples that have fourand five-bedroom homes downsize. From1 July 2018, people aged 65 and over will be able to make a nonconcessional, post-tax contribution to their superannuation of up to $300,000 from the proceeds of selling their home. The existing voluntary contribution rules for people aged 65 years and older-work tests for 65to 74-year-olds, no contributions for those aged 75 and over-and restrictions on non-concessional contributions for people with balances above $1.6 million will not apply to contributions made under the new special downsizing cap. This measure will apply to a principal residence held for a minimum of 10 years. Both members of a couple will be able to take advantage of this measure for the same home, meaning that $600,000 per couple can be contributed to superannuation through the downsizing cap. These new contributions will be in addition to any other voluntary contributions that people are able to make under the existing contribution rules and concessional and non-concessional caps. This is another sensible measure from this coalition government to try and get some downward pressure on housing, to try and change the supply and demand mechanisms that work in the market, to try and give young Australians greater opportunity to get into the housing market. Yet, like we see time and time again from this opposition, it puts its vested interests ahead of the interests of young Australians wanting to get into the housing market. I will leave my comments there. I hope that members of the Labor Party will give some thought to this before they vote against this bill-will give some thought to those young Australians that are struggling to get into the housing market for the simple reason that the current superannuation laws that we have in this country force them to invest the money that they earn, the wealth that they create, in a way the government tells them, and it cannot be put into their house. Anyone who is over 55 or 60 and has a house will know that that is the best form of savings that they have had in their life. If we are talking about giving young people the opportunity to save, to build wealth for retirement, the best thing we can do is to give them the opportunity to get into their own home. SoI ask members of the opposition to please put aside your union ties and think of those young Australians that this legislation will help save for their deposit. I commend this bill to the House. Dr CHALMERS (Rankin) (10:49): That is 11½ minutes that we are never getting back, unfortunately! These housing bills have all of the things that we have come to expect from those opposite, all of the ingredients that characterise and comprise the policy failures of a struggling government-a government so out of touch that it has only just dawned on them, entering their fifth year in office, that there's a problem with housing affordability in this country. Housing affordability is at 60-year lows, and disproportionately it is young people who are finding it harder and harder to get a toehold in a very important market, a very important part of the economy. It is a government so dysfunctional that, having finally worked out that it's an issue, it has absolutely no idea of how to go about fixing it, a government so prone to overpromising and underdelivering, a government so incompetent that it introduced these bills 68 days after the initiative was supposed to begin. It announced the initiative in the budget in May. It was supposed to start on 1 July, and 68 days after 1 July the Treasurer got around to introducing the bills. It is a government so divided that it can't agree to pull the most important lever of all, which is the negative gearing and capital gains tax lever, even though we know from credible, authoritative reports that both the Treasurer and the Prime Minister were in favour of doing so but got rolled in the cabinet room. It is a government so held hostage to the knuckle draggers and naysayers in the party that it is unable to do anything meaningful at all lest it be vetoed by the people who gather around the member for Warringah. It is a government so determined to shower largesse on the top end of the town, running a protection racket for a system that gives the biggest tax concessions in our budget and in our economy to those who need them the least. It is a government so welded to extreme ideology that it is compelled to threaten, diminish, undermine and tear at the foundations of superannuation, which is one of Australia's proudest policy achievements. All these elements, which poison its approach across the boardwhether it be energy policy or whether it be the budget and the economy or, now, housingare here in the bill we are debating today. The bills implement two of the government's budget measures-the First Home Super Saver Scheme and contributing proceeds to super, allowing people to use the proceeds from one sale of their main residence to contribute up to $300,000 to their super if they are 65 or older. Other speakers have made it very clear that we on this side don't support the First Home Super Saver Scheme, and we don't think the downsizing measure is the best way to genuinely deal with barriers to downsizing. But we're always prepared to be constructive. If the government were to separate the two measures, we would likely not oppose the downsizing measure. To truly understand what we are trying to deal with here, we need to go to the factual basis of the problem we're trying to address, because that will show how inadequate the measures contained in the bill are in dealing with a crisis in housing for a lot of people in our country. Homeownership is at a 60-year low. Just one in four young people aged 18 to 39 now own a home, which is down from more than 35 per cent 15 years ago, a fall of more than 10 percentage points over that 15-year period. Rates of property investment are at record highs, and rates of first homeownership are at record lows. That gives you a sense of the problem this side of the House is trying to address. We have the most generous tax concessions in the world, which preference property investors who are purchasing their fifth or sixth residential properties over young first home buyers trying to get their first crack in the market. At the same time, more broadly, living standards are under pressure, household debt is at record highs, underemployment is at near-record highs and wages growth is at record lows. All of these factors are combining to make it hard if not impossible for a lot of people to buy their first home. In response to this, having finally discovered that this problem that has developed over the last few years is an issue, the government-true to form-overdid it. Before the May budget, some of those opposite were promising that their housing affordability package would be extraordinarily large, that it would be an impressive package, a well-received package. Talk about setting yourself up for failure! It's like a parent promising a kid a brand-new bike for Christmas and instead giving them a toothbrush or a pair of socks. This is the policy equivalent of a pair of socks. We get this package where the only retail item, the first home super saver package, won't work. It will undermine superannuation and obviously isn't even enough of a priority for the Treasurer to introduce it in time for it to be implemented by the start date that was promised in May this year. It can't be that great if the Treasurer can't be bothered getting around to introducing the legislation until 68 days after the thing was supposed to start. When young Australians desperate for information, told that this is going to be some extraordinary breakthrough in housing affordability, they go to the ATO website, they are told, 'Legislation is currently being developed for this measure,' months after it was supposed to have started. And we have those opposite spruiking it as some kind of big policy triumph. That is embarrassing enough, but it's worse than that. It's worse than embarrassing for those opposite: it is a very dangerous development. They want to undermine superannuation. They don't believe in it. They say from time to time that they do, but they go out of their way to diminish it, to threaten the foundations of superannuation, to try to take the 'compulsory' out of compulsory super in lots of different ways. In this instance, they are ignoring the fact that super is supposed to be for retirement. It is not supposed to be for allocation at the whim of a government looking for something meaningful to say about the big and persistent problem that we have in our society with housing affordability. This really does reveal a deep obsession with superannuation. They can't understand what a proud achievement superannuation is not just for this side of the House-and we are proud of our role in developing and designing the system and making it a reality-but for the entire country, and it shouldn't be diminished and it shouldn't be undermined by those opposite playing their usual extreme-right ideological games. Perhaps the biggest failure in these bills is what is not in them. The measures that they're proposing as they relate to superannuation are dangerous and we don't support them. What is even worse is that these bills show what the government are not prepared to do: they are not prepared to pull the most meaningful lever when it comes to dealing with housing affordability, and that is dealing with negative gearing and the capital gains tax concessions. They refuse to pull the lever. They will not do anything meaningful about negative gearing and capital gains, and, as a consequence, they will not do anything meaningful about housing affordability in this country, particularly for young people. On this side of the House we are serious about levelling the playing field between first home buyers and investors. We don't think it's fair for a young couple, for example, to front up to an auction and to be competing against someone who might already own five or six homes and who is being subsidised by the Australian taxpayer in a way that makes it very difficult for that young couple to get into the market for the first time. That's why we announced our policies back in 2015-well ahead of an election, to give people the opportunity to hold our policies up to the light. We announced those policies on negative gearing and capital gains more than two years ago now. We took the reform out of the toohard basket. We put it on the table and we said, 'Judge us on this policy,' and the Australian people responded. The Australian people appreciate that at least one side of this parliament is having a genuine crack at addressing housing affordability in this country. And it wasn't just the Australian community that backed us in. A long line of people supported our policy on negative gearing and capital gains: former Reserve Bank governor Glenn Stevens; global organisations like the IMF and the OECD; the government's own Financial System Inquiry; the Grattan Institute; ACOSS; the Australian Institute of Company Directors; CEDA; Saul Eslake; and even a raft of Liberals, including Jeff Kennett and former New South Wales premier Mike Baird. Indeed, the former Treasurer from just over there in this House said in his valedictory speech that he wished he had dealt with negative gearing in this country. On Friday we had a very important intervention in this conversation about negative gearing. At regular intervals the Reserve Bank puts out the Financial stability review, and we got one on Friday. The Financial stability review said something that is very troubling and that everyone in this House should be cognisant of: The number of investors with multiple properties has grown relative to those with a single property … Indeed, the number of investors with five properties grew by 7½ per cent in that one year, compared with average growth of 4½ per cent over the previous nine years. So there has actually been a substantial growth, a troubling and concerning growth, in people with a number of properties-in this case, people with five properties or more. That number is growing faster than the number of people with one property. That gives you a sense of the problem. When the taxpayer subsidises the investors and the speculators, that is the inevitable outcome, and that's what we're seeing. The new data from the Reserve Bank showed that negative gearing increasingly does favour the most wealthy investors with multiple properties. That is more justification for our approach to negative gearing, so that first home buyers aren't going up against people with multiple properties who enjoy those big tax breaks from the government. In a tight budget environment it makes absolutely no sense to give the biggest tax concessions to the Australians who need them least. It's dumb. It's daft policy, and we need to fix it. We need to fix it not just because of its impact on housing affordability-although that's its most important objective-but also because doing so will help repair the budget. There are not that many policies which can do a terrific job in pulling a policy lever and getting a good outcome and, at the same time, deliver substantial savings to the bottom line of the budget. We're talking about raising something like $37 billion over the medium term, $2 billion of that in the forward estimates. The budget needs that kind of savings. It needs that kind of strengthening. If we can do that at the same time as satisfying a policy objective on housing affordability, we'd be mad not to take up that opportunity. Apart from negative gearing and capital gains, we've led the broader conversation on housing affordability on this side of the House. I pay tribute to Senator Cameron and to the shadow Treasurer and the Leader of the Opposition, who earlier this year put their heads together and announced what I think was a very substantial package of housing reforms on top of what we are proposing to do on negative gearing and capital gains. These were some of the elements. We said we should limit direct borrowing by self-managed superfunds, which was another recommendation of the government's Murray inquiry. We said we should work with COAG to get a uniform vacant property tax across all major cities. We said that we should establish a bond aggregator to increase investment in affordable housing. We said that with a bit of effort we can get better results from the National Affordable Housing Agreement. We said we should increase foreign investor fees and penalties. We said we should boost homelessness support for vulnerable Australians and that we should re-establish the National Housing Supply Council and actually have a minister for housing so we don't have this situation develop, as it has on that side, of a government which has taken until its fifth year in office to finally work out that Australians are hurting and struggling in the housing market, particularly those who can't get into it for the first time. When all of our measures on negative gearing and capital gains and that Senator Cameron, the shadow Treasurer and the leader announced earlier this year are combined, we think we might be able to shift the needle, and we might be able to shift the needle to favour people who are working and struggling to get into the market for the first time. Our measures and our policies will help give people a real chance. They'll give people the opportunity to realise that great Australian dream of homeownership, not the nightmare of housing unaffordability that they have been experiencing under the Turnbull government-a government which is so out of touch, dysfunctional, incompetent and divided, so desperate to favour the top end of town and unable to lead on important economic policies like this one. We have provided the alternative. We have shown that you can develop substantial, meaningful policy from opposition. We're happy to compare our policies on housing with the rabble of those opposite. And we're happy to fight an election, whether it be on housing or the mess that the minister has made on energy. We are prepared to put our policies up against theirs any day. Ms PRICE (Durack) (11:04): I rise today to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Reducing Pressure on Housing Affordability Measures No. 1) Bill 2017 and the First Home Super Saver Tax Bill. The aim of this legislation is very simple-to give Aussie families a better shot at realising the great Australian dream. The dream of owning your own home is being cast as being incredibly unobtainable, but this should not be the case and it does not have to be. This legislation aims to assist those seeking to buy their first home by enabling individuals to put money into their superannuation account with the specific intention of using that money as a deposit to purchase a home. This contribution will be capped at $15,000 per year and $30,000 in total. These contributions can be withdrawn for a deposit at the marginal rate, less a 30 per cent offset. This measure is estimated to reduce revenue by some $250 million over the forward estimates period. What this means is that $250 million will be left in the pocket of those Australians saving for and buying their first home. That's a quarter of a billion dollars extra over the forward estimates period that this government will set aside to free up support for first home buyers, and this is a significant contribution from this government. This government is delivering for those younger Australians not only with this bill but also in many other ways, and let's just look at our recent record. The PaTH program is offering avenues to employment across a range of industries and allowing young people, in particular, to engage with the industry to get the skills needed to advance their careers. Revitalisation in education with the New Colombo Plan is strengthening that sector and broadening the horizons of our students. We are increasing the number of medicines and vaccines available or supplied to young people, ensuring their health as they age, and our innovation and science agenda, along with the NBN actually being delivered, is transforming and empowering our economy. Unlike those opposite, rudimentary economics is not lost on us on this side. We know that the best way to lower the price of a commodity, be it electricity, raw materials or housing, is to increase the supply of that commodity. Therefore, to complement the First Home Super Saver Scheme initiative, people aged 65 and over will be permitted to make an exempt nonconcessional super contribution of up to $300,000, or $600,000 for a couple, after selling their main residence that has been held for at least 10 years. This reduces the barrier for older Australians to downsize from the home they no longer need, helping to free up existing stock of larger houses for those younger, growing Australian families. This bill will help those younger Australians buy their first home by helping them save for and better access a deposit, which we all know is increasingly difficult to come by. It will also increase the supply of housing by helping older Australians downsize, if they choose to do so, into more appropriate dwellings without those front and back lawns we all despise on weekends. We are upping the number of available rental properties with a foreign-resident vacancy tax. This will incentivise foreign investors to make their property available to the Australian rental market. Further, foreign ownership in new developments will be limited through the introduction of a 50 per cent cap of the number of properties that can be sold to foreign investors through development pre-approvals. We are also providing $117.2 million to support frontline services to address homelessness. The fact is, if you are homeless, you simply cannot get a job let alone get a housing loan, so this is critically important for this particular sector. As you can see, this government is putting in place measures by which outcomes across the entire housing spectrum will be improved. It would be remiss of me, at this point, to not at least touch on the subject of negative gearing. Negative gearing as a mechanism does contribute to keeping rents lower than they would otherwise be, and Labor plans to tamper with this mechanism, as we heard from the previous speaker. Labor's plan to abolish negative gearing will push up rent and impact on investments for millions of Australians, including those in my electorate of Durack. Within Durack, 15 per cent of constituents reported a net rent loss on their financial-year returns for the years 2014 and 2015-that is, 15 per cent of taxpayers in Durack own a negatively geared property, which is markedly above the Australia-wide level of 10 per cent. Within Durack, almost half-some 49.7 per cent-of occupied private dwellings were rented in 2016. That is far higher than the Australian-wide level of some 31 per cent. This number skyrockets when you head to the more remote parts of Durack, as you would expect. Within the Pilbara region of Western Australia, for example, which is wholly contained within my electorate, as you well know, Mr Deputy Speaker Vasta, over 80 per cent of occupied private dwellings are rented. So Labor's reckless negative gearing policy, as you would understand, Deputy Speaker, will disproportionately harm my constituents in Durack. The only changes that the coalition are making to negative gearing-and these are contained within the housing tax integrity bill of 2017-will be to disallow travel expenses associated with investment properties, reining in an incredibly high-growth deduction, and also a redefinition of which plant and equipment can be depreciated. This, in stark contrast to Labor's policy, will expand confidence in the negative gearing system and will have no impact on rent prices and investment levels, and it is welcomed. We are aware that the amendments contained within the bill represent a marked change in superannuation policy in this country, and we know how fond those opposite are of the current superannuation arrangements, for a number of reasons. Firstly, there are the millions of dollars from their union mates that they are able to take from it-and we know what a rort that is. Secondly, and most importantly, they like superannuation because it's someone else's money. Nothing excites those opposite more than the prospect of deciding how to spend large sums of other people's money or, for that matter, telling people how to spend large sums of their money. So, when looking at these proposed amendments, it's worth reflecting on the purpose of superannuation. As we know, it's designed to provide a means by which people can support themselves in their retirement. If an individual feels that a house of their choosing may be a better investment than a government-mandated super account, which they often have limited control over, as we know, why should we stand in the way of that? The amendment bill that we are discussing today will give Australians the option to boost the savings they can put towards a deposit by 30 per cent compared to saving through a standard deposit account, which we know is becoming increasingly hard to achieve. This is not something which should be opposed. Those opposite should realise that, by doing so, they are making it harder, not easier, for people to buy their first home. Some have referred to the current high house price situation as an affordability crisis. I doubt those who own homes and are looking to sell their homes would consider that to be a crisis-but I guess that's a debate for another day. While this bill will allow those who are trying to break into the housing market another more effective avenue to save for the deposit, whilst also increasing the supply of the housing, there are other ways that people seeking to break into the housing market can find affordable housing. WhatI refer to here is housing stock in regional Australia. In my electorate of Durack, in the thriving and beautiful regional hub of Geraldton, a three-bedroom, one-bathroom house can be found for under $200,000. In the Wheatbelt town of Merredin, a three-by-one or a four-by-one house sells for under $200,000. In Carnarvon, which is a beautiful town on the Coral Coast of Western Australia, a three-by-one can be sold for under $200,000 and a four-by-two for under $500,000. I appreciate that in the Deputy Speaker's own electorate the same would be the case, as indeed it would in many other parts of regional Australia. I would just like to put on record that all parts of regional Australia would welcome first home buyers should the need arise. So, Deputy Speaker, you could argue that there is no housing affordability crisis if you bothered to look outside the capital cities. We know on this side of the chamber that there is more to Australia than just Sydney and Melbourne. Certainly, in the electorate of Durack, there are many opportunities for affordable housing. In summary, this proposed amendment will increase the supply of housing. It will put more money into the pockets of first home buyers, it will enable first home buyers to save for their first home and, at the same time, it will support empty-nesters. It should be supported on its merits. I call on those opposite to support this bill, and I commend the bill to the House. Ms McBRIDE (Dobell) (11:14): I rise today to oppose the Treasury Laws Amendment (Reducing Pressure on Housing Affordability Measures No. 1) Bill 2017 and the First Home Super Saver Tax Bill 2017 and to support the amendment moved by the member for McMahon. Schedule1 of the bill implements the First Home Super Saver Scheme announced in the 2017 budget. We oppose this measure because it simply fails to address the real problem with housing affordability in Australia-the government's failure to address negative gearing and capital gains tax reform. Until these issues are addressed, the system will continue to unfairly advantage investors over first home buyers. Schedule2 of this bill implements a budget measure to allow people aged over 65 to contribute the proceeds of downsizing to superannuation. We don't have any objections to the principle of helping people to downsize. If the government were to split this measure from the First Home Super Saver Scheme measure, we would be open to considering it. However, this is not the best option in terms of actually reducing pressure on housing affordability. In the 2013-14 Labor budget, we had a pilot program that aimed to do just that-by trialling a means test exemption for age pension recipients who were downsizing from their family home. Up to $200,000 in proceeds would have been put in a fund which would have been exempt from pensions means tests for up to 10 years. Of course, this short-sighted government got rid of it. Some important factors in the decision to downsize, such as the age pension income and assets tests and stamp duty issues, are simply not addressed by the government's measure. The government's super scheme will do nothing to address housing affordability, but it will work to undermine Australia's world-class superannuation system. This system, underpinned by the superannuation guarantee introduced by the Labor government in 1992, is designed to generate improved retirement incomes for Australian workers. It is not there to be a plaything of the government of the day. It is not there to be white-anted to provide the government with an alibi, to pretend that it is addressing an issue when it is failing to face up to the real problems its own policies are creating. As previous speakers on this side have noted, in the absence of any measures to improve the supply of new homes, any extra money in the pockets of first home buyers is simply eaten up by price rises. If you look at the details of this measure, you see that it offers a paltry level of assistance for first home buyers. If you divide the cost of this measure in the budget by the number of first homes sold each year, the government, with great fanfare, is allocating an average of $565 for each first home. This is the government's solution for first home buyers struggling to compete with investors who have a major tax advantage-$565. Labor will not support this hoax, but we will deliver on our plan for affordable housing, addressing the unfairness created by the capital gains tax discount and negative gearing. Labor will drive the construction of 55,000 new homes over three years, creating 25,000 jobs every year. We will commit to more public housing, including for women and children fleeing family violence. Before entering this House, I worked as a pharmacist in mental health at Wyong hospital for almost 10 years. One of the most difficult things that I saw when people were recovering from mental illness and taking their first steps to transition back into the community was social workers giving them a phone book, pointing them to the phone in the unit and saying, 'You have to try to find yourself a place to live.' I won't forget that. People with an enduring mental illness, taking those steps back into the community, would be standing at a phone in a public place with a phone book in their hand and dialling through, trying to find somebody who would take them, who would give them a chance in a competitive rental market. Often they didn't have a rental record or the documentation that was necessary or the means to compete in the private rental market. Over the school holidays, I bumped into a young family I'd seen a few months before, who are expecting their next child. When I first met them they showed me a picture their youngest child had drawn. It was of their house, with a dog. This was because the child always wanted to have a pet, but, because of their circumstances-they had to move, as they weren't in long term accommodation-they couldn't have a pet. The child had started at a local school but, because of the competitive rental market and their circumstances, the child had done only one term at school before having to move to another school. These are the types of families in my community and in communities across Australia who aren't being helped by these measures. Affordable housing is not just about being able to buy your home. It's about affordable rental housing. A Shorten Labor government will establish a bond aggregator to help community housing providers to access cheaper finance for new affordable rental housing. Giving community housing providers a new source of low-cost, reliable financing will boost the supply of affordable rental housing options for low-income families and vulnerable Australians, like those I have just mentioned. This is particularly relevant to my electorate of Dobell, on the New South Wales Central Coast, where almost a third of households live in rental properties and the proportion of households paying over 30 per cent of their income in rent is higher than the national average. In pockets of my community, combined household income is about $600 a week and, commonly, rents, particularly for homes for families, are nudging $400 a week and above. How can families meet this? I want to tell you about something a constituent of mine, Amy, let me know. Amy has lived on the Central Coast for 20 years, working and raising her two children. In 2010, she became ill and last year began to receive the disability support payment. When her father died suddenly, she moved in with her mum to help out, but her mum is struggling on her own to make ends meet. This family's search for an affordable rental property has been fraught. Amy says agents and landlords are reluctant to accept her, as a DSP recipient. But, for the housing department to assist, she has to find a property for rent at half her weekly income, or less. There simply aren't properties at this price for housing a family of four. Amy said, 'I didn't ask to get sick or not to be able to work. Life on the disability support pension is not easy, each week struggling to decide what is more important to spend money on. I don't have fancy clothes, equipment or phones or anything like that. AfterI pay rent of $430 per week, I'm left with $10 a week out of that pension. Rental properties have got higher and the waiting list for affordable housing is a joke. I don't want my kids to miss out or live like animals just because I have an illness that stops me from working.' Another constituent, Lilly, who is 18 years old, wrote to me about predictions that young people will be forced to save for 40 years to purchase their first home. This is what Lilly has to say: 'As a young person I find this deeply upsetting. The issue, however, does not seem to be entirely economic. Policymakers have favoured negative gearing, made university much more expensive, axed the first home buyers rebate and casualised the workforce. This has made it impossible to get a fair go as a youth and made it difficult for wealth to flow freely within the economy, allowing children of the wealthy to grow their wealth while children of the poor are denied the same opportunities.' She continues, 'To me this is about more than housing. It is symptomatic of a parliament that no longer cares about youth.' It is not surprising that a young person like Lilly, from my electorate of Dobell, on the New South Wales Central Coast, comes to this conclusion when you consider the additional barriers the government is putting in the way of young people starting out in life and saving for a home of their own-their first home. As a result of the government's proposed changes to higher education funding and higher education loans, students will face higher fees, which they will have to pay back sooner. These policies will create considerable financial stress for many young people completing higher education and entering the workforce. How will these policies help young people save for their first home? And what about young people working on weekends? They won't be getting penalty rates to help them save for a home of their own. What's this government doing to help them? Nothing. Members of the Turnbull government campaign for cuts to weekend penalty rates, and the Prime Minister hasn't lifted a finger to stop these cuts from coming into effect-just as the government hasn't lifted a finger to address the real issue around housing affordability. To put housing affordability into perspective, in 1981-82 the median dwelling price was around three times the median annual household income. In 2016 it was over eight times. In the 20 years between the 1995-96 census and the 2015-16 census, homeownership amongst younger households declined from 44 per cent to 36 per cent. Labor is once again leading on housing affordability. Only Labor has a comprehensive policy to tackle this crisis. For years the Abbott-Turnbull government have ignored warnings to act on unfair and distortionary housing tax concessions and on the risks associated with increased borrowing in superannuation funds. They have simply failed to act. Building on our existing proposals to reform negative gearing and capital gains tax, Labor have announced policies to improve affordability, increase supply, boost jobs and reduce the economic risks associated with distorted investment decisions. Labor have a clear housing affordability plan. It will reform negative gearing and capital gains tax concessions, facilitate a COAG process to introduce a uniform vacant property tax across all major cities, limit direct borrowings from self-managed superannuation funds, increase foreign investor fees and penalties, establish a bond aggregator to increase investment in affordable housing, boost homelessness support for vulnerable Australians, get better results from the National Affordable Housing Agreement, and re-establish the National Housing Supply Council and a minister for housing. A Shorten Labor government will establish a COAG process to coordinate and facilitate a more efficient and uniform vacant property tax across all of Australia's major cities. Australia's housing stock should be used to put a roof over people's heads, not to allow property speculators to lock up assets. Labor will also restore the general ban on direct borrowing from superannuation funds, as recommended by the 2014 financial system inquiry, to help cool an overheated housing market partly driven by wealthy self-managed super funds, which has seen an explosion in borrowing from $2.5 billion in 2012 to more than $24 billion today. We will also further help level the playing field between first home buyers and property speculators by doubling the screening fees on foreign investment and financial penalties that apply to foreign investment in residential real estate. Labor will also provide $88 million over two years for a new safe housing fund to increase transitional housing options for women and children escaping domestic and family violence, young people exiting home care and older women on low incomes who are at risk of homelessness. This will reverse the Liberal cuts made in the 2014 budget. RecentlyI was talking to a constituent of mine who has worked her whole life and found herself having to remortgage when she was unexpectedly let go. She was trying to work out how she was going to meet her volunteer requirements under Newstart. It reminded me of another woman I met in a shopping centre. She had a shopping trolley containing a saucepan, cutlery and the basics for setting up a kitchen. I asked her what she was doing, and she said: 'Well, I looked after my grandchildren. That was a decision that was made and it was in the best interests of them and their well-being, but now that the youngest is grown I don't have any means anymore. As one of the conditions, I wasn't able to do anything other than look after them.' So she had been out of the workforce for nearly two decades. She asked, 'What am I to do now?' She was buying the basics to set up a kitchen in a local caravan park. This is a mother and grandmother who dedicated her life to raising her family and particularly supporting her grandchildren, who were born into very difficult circumstances-and this is how we, as a society, are looking after her. We need to do more. It has to be fixed. Labor's plan seeks to restore some of the important housing initiatives that were cut by the Abbott-Turnbull government while outlining new policy actions which Malcolm Turnbull and Scott Morrison refused to take. Labor's package will see the construction of 55,000 new homes over three years and boost employment by 25,000 new jobs every year. Only a Labor government will tackle the housing affordability crisis and put the great Australian dream back within the reach of middleand working-class families. today on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Reducing Pressure on Housing Affordability Measures No. 1) Bill 2017. I say 'insightful' because it paints the picture of a government that, in an Orwellian manner, has labelled this bill as addressing housing affordability, but when you examine the bill and the government's response there is no answer for housing affordability. On this side of the House we understand the issues that have been outlined comprehensively by the member for Dobell-in particular, the personal stories of the effect of not being able to access housing. It's important to note that, when you address the issue of housing, you're talking about not only those who aspire to homeownership but also those who are simply seeking to obtain shelter. This is of more than just peripheral relevance to the health of our communities; it's of vital importance to the health of our communities. There has been much work done, at both academic and practical levels, in joining up all the dots surrounding housing, education and",42,Bills
15,Mr Hart (Bass) (11:29,"I thank the member for Dobell for her insightful contributionhealth outcomes, particularly with respect to the social determinants of health. We know that, in circumstances of housing stress, whether it be access to social housing, access to a home that you are purchasing or the impossible rental market that the member for Dobell was describing in her contribution, there are real consequences. Those consequences don't just rest on individual families and individuals; those consequences are visited upon entire communities. I am very fortunate to represent a community in northern Tasmania that has disadvantages and profound opportunities for the future, but, within those areas of disadvantage, housing is of prime importance. As the member for Dobell outlined, access to housing will affect your future employability, your access to education and your health outcomes for the long term. If we don't address in a real manner, with a proper comprehensive plan, the question of housing affordability and the issues of people that are mired in generational disadvantage then we will be making a greater problem for the future that will need to be addressed, certainly in the area of health, with overcrowded emergency services at our public hospitals, but also with long term health outcomes, which are predominantly worse where there are significant issues with respect to housing stress, access to employment and the like. I'm grateful that today I have the opportunity to rise and speak on this legislation, but I need to put on record my concerns about the measures that are being put forward in these bills. The bills seek to implement two of the government's 2017-18 budget measures which ostensibly relate to housing affordability. As I indicated in my outline, this government has a knack of, in an Orwellian fashion, saying one thing but delivering something completely different. The bills implement two key provisions. The first measure is the First Home Super Saver Scheme, which allows individuals who are saving for their first home to take advantage of the concessional taxation arrangements that apply to the superannuation system. Under this scheme, first home savers who make voluntary contributions into the superannuation system can withdraw those contributions up to certain limits and an amount of associated earnings for the purposes of purchasing their first home. Under this scheme, concessional taxation treatment applies to amounts that are withdrawn under the scheme. The second measure, something that Labor is prepared to consider if the bill is split, allows for the contribution of the proceeds of downsizing of housing accommodation to superannuation, which would allow an individual to use the proceeds of one sale of their main residence to make contributions of up to $300,000 to their superannuation provider if they are aged 65 years or over. This is called the downsizer contribution. These downsizer contributions could be made regardless of the other contribution caps and restrictions that might apply to making voluntary contributions. As I said earlier, this is something that Labor's prepared to consider, if the bill is split. As I indicated earlier, there is a prime importance associated with the question of housing and housing affordability. It's obvious that something needs to be done with regard to housing affordability in this country. It had been a matter of national pride in recent decades that Australia enjoyed some of the highest rates of homeownership in the world. It's equally obvious that those days of record homeownership are long gone. It is a very telling statistic that close to 70 per cent of Australians are very concerned, or somewhat concerned, that they will never own a property in their lifetime, according to recent research undertaken by the Australian National University. The Committee for Economic Development of Australia released a research report last month investigating whether or not it's time for Australians, as a community, to let go of the great Australian dream of homeownership. The report indicated that Australia's housing affordability crisis is likely to continue for another 40 years-40 years!-unless there are major changes to the market. Historically low interest rates, an unprecedented period of continuous economic growth and strong levels of migration have contributed to increased demand and escalating house prices. The CEDA report concluded that demand pressures and supply problems are likely to continue for the foreseeable future. Between 1996 and 2006 Australian average house prices, relative to income, almost doubled. Indeed, this trend has been apparent for more than 20 years. While income doubled in the years 1985 to 2004, there has been a four-fold increase in house prices in the same time frame. The impact of higher housing costs is most strongly felt by lower income groups, particularly low-income renters, for whom homeownership is increasingly out of reach. As I said earlier, this will have profound consequences for inequality in the future. This is an issue that this government denies is even a problem, while Labor wants to put inequality front and centre in the development of policy. There is, of course, a good reason for this. The government fails to understand or simply doesn't care about the interrelationship between inequality and health and education outcomes. In turn, education, housing and other factors, as I said earlier, are fundamental aspects of the social determinants of health. Labor's focus on jobs, health and education is designed to address the issue of inequality. Similarly, combating homelessness and addressing housing affordability is a constructive and practical measure in ensuring the health and economic security of our communities throughout Australia. Labor wants to give those who are low paid and in insecure employment access to housing, including the opportunity to aspire to homeownership, whilst this Liberal government's policy favours those who are using negative gearing to acquire multiple properties. An estimated 875,000 households are experiencing housing stress-that is, they are paying more than 30 per cent of their income in housing costs. This is a contributing factor to increasing disadvantage and inequality, something the member for Dobell outlined in her speech. At the same time, these individuals and families who are struggling to afford their first home are being saddled with debt, ever increasing living costs and wage growth that has stagnated at the lowest level in decades. In contrast, those who are highly paid can, under this government, rely upon a tax cut, access to negative gearing and the capital gains tax discount. Indeed, those with access to family trusts can effectively elect how much tax they wish to pay with respect to investment or business income, unlike in the position adopted by Labor. So, in the face of all this, what is this government going to do to address the housing affordability crisis that we are currently facing, which is an issue of profound concern to many Australians? A responsible government would listen to the concerns expressed by those who aspire to home ownership, but who are fearful that home ownership is, or will be, beyond them. A responsible government would look at the underlying supply-and-demand drivers of housing prices and deliver a comprehensive response-a plan for future home ownership. We have the government's grand plan before us in this bill, and I'm sorry to say that it does nothing to address the issues at hand. It only serves to undermine Australia's world-class superannuation system whilst at the same time failing to address housing affordability. As a matter of public policy, superannuation accounts are supposed to be locked boxes to generate retirement income, not the playthings of a government of the day to give access to super savings for whatever priority they wish. Labor is justifiably proud of its track record in establishing and growing our system of compulsory superannuation-might I say, against the resistance of those opposite and the dead hand of successive Liberal coalition governments for over 20 years. Only Labor can be trusted to protect the national savings pool which is represented by our compulsory superannuation system. The Treasurer's dodgy super scheme laid out in this bill will do nothing to address housing affordability. In fact, it will most likely have the exact opposite effect. Anyone with a basic understanding of economics knows that, if you stimulate the amount of money people have, it'll drive up demand-particularly if there's no further supply-and housing prices will consequently increase. The shadow Treasurer, the member for McMahon, explained this most succinctly in his speech on the bill just yesterday: They don't understand that if two bidders, for example, at an auction-because this would be available to more than one person-come to that auction and said, 'We've got access to our superannuation, so we're going to bid higher', they're going to bid against each other, and they're going to bid the price up. The only winner in that scenario is the vendor, who can get more for their house. The actual person who purchases the house, having used some of the money that was set aside for their retirement income, is no better off. The person who missed out on the house is no better off. The person who is better off is the vendor, and that is making housing affordability worse. Whether it's an auction or whether it's just sold in the normal fashion through a real estate agent, the laws of economics are the same. Only this Liberal government could so incompetently manage public policy as to introduce a housing affordability measure that does exactly the opposite of its intended effect and drives up prices. But there are other problems in principle presented by this absurd legislation. The government purports to be a friend of business and a supporter of the free market, but it makes clear with this bill and others that it indeed favours intervention, which will also have the effect of driving up prices, and it is not opposed to undermining our national savings. Labor will oppose this legislation as the party that supports superannuation and as the party with a comprehensive plan to deal with housing affordability. Labor's plan to reform negative gearing and the capital gains discount will mean that a first home buyer does not have to compete with an investor who may be buying their fourth or fifth property. A reform of this kind creates a fairer tax system and a positive return to the budget. Yet those opposite refuse to even entertain the idea of such reforms, so concerned are they with protecting their mates from the top end of town, with their agenda based upon tax cuts for the well-off and cuts to Medicare and education. I do make the point, as I said previously, that if the government was to separate the two measures in this bill, Labor would not oppose the downsizing measure. However, I emphasise that any housing affordability package that does not deal with negative gearing and the capital gains tax discount is a sham. Labor has been leading the way on housing affordability, and only Labor will properly deal with a system that advantages investors over the first home buyers. This is an area of public policy that we absolutely must get right. It's vitally important for our communities, particularly our disadvantaged communities, that we provide secure and affordable housing. If we don't provide secure and affordable housing, we will condemn future generations. Ms BRODTMANN (Canberra) (11:44): I rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Reducing Pressure on Housing Affordability Measures No. 1) Bill 2017 and the First Home Super Saver Tax Bill 2017. Over time the phrase 'the great Australian dream' has meant different things to different people, but for the better part of a century any reference to this phrase meant owning your own home. In his 'The Forgotten People' speech to a radio audience 75 years ago, Menzies said: The material home represents the concrete expression of the habits of frugality and saving ""for a home of our own."" Your advanced socialist may rave against private property even while he acquires it; but one of the best instincts in us is that which induces us to have one little piece of earth with a house and a garden which is ours; to which we can withdraw, in which we can be among our friends, into which no stranger may come against our will. During his time as Prime Minister, there were a number of federal and state housing schemes that made buying a house more affordable and accessible. By 1966, the number of Australians who either owned a home or were living in a house that they were purchasing was significantly higher than in the early 1950s. At one stage, the dream was sold as a red brick home on a quarter-acre block with a Hills Hoist in the backyard. How things have changed! For many, owning a home is now becoming increasingly out of their reach, with the current state of the housing market meaning that many are missing out. The September Domain State of the market report revealed the median house price here in the ACT reached a record high of $723,980, and we have reports that the median house price in Sydney is now $1 million. Despite the challenges facing first home buyers, an Australian National University report titled Attitudes to housing affordability: pressures, problems and solutions found that nearly three-quarters of Australians weren't prepared to give up the dream and viewed owning a property as part of the Australian way of life. Just seven per cent believe that owning a house is not all that important-just seven per cent from this ANU study. While views of the great Australian dream remain the same, confidence that it can actually be achieved continues to decrease. Close to 70 per cent of the participants said they were very concerned or somewhat concerned about whether they will own a property. For those who own a home, the poll highlighted the difficulties they face. One in five Australians reported difficulty keeping up with a mortgage or a rental payment, saying they're either falling behind with their payments or struggling to make their payments. Nearly a quarter said they would face financial stress in the event of a two percentage point interest rate rise, and to combat this they're spending less on essentials, they're working multiple jobs, they're working longer hours, they're delaying starting a family and they're even selling household items to make ends meet. The government's cuts to penalty rates do not help this one bit. With housing affordability spiralling out of control, the government believes that part of fixing the problem is allowing first home buyers to take advantage of the concessional taxation arrangements that apply to the superannuation system. Under the First Home Super Saver Scheme, first home buyers who make voluntary contributions into the superannuation scheme can withdraw those contributions and an amount of associated earnings for the purpose of purchasing their first home. What this fails to acknowledge is that superannuation was created to generate retirement income. It was created to ensure that Australians had a comfortable retirement. It was not created for buying a house. The government's scheme has received fanfare, particularly when it was announced on budget night, but it allows people to put away only $15,000 a year extra through contributions to their superannuation pre tax, and it can be used for only two years, equating to a maximum saving of $30,000 for singles. The government also jumped the gun when the Treasurer talked up the scheme on social media in July, well before any legislation was introduced. Labor has long argued that the focus of the government should be on reforming negative gearing and the capital gains tax discount because 50 per cent of the benefit of negative gearing goes to the top 10 per cent of income earners and 70 per cent of the benefit of the capital gains tax concession goes to the top 10 per cent of income earners. Those figures are staggering. They clearly show that the current arrangements aren't to the benefit of first home buyers. The other measure in this bill is about contributing the proceeds of downsizing. This will allow people aged 65 and over to make a non-concessional contribution of up to $300,000 from the proceeds of selling their home. If this measure were split from the First Home Super Saver Scheme there is a chance that Labor would consider this measure, because we're not opposed to the principle of helping Australians downsize. That's why when we were in government we made a multibillion dollar investment-historical investment-in social housing, to get those Australians who were in large family homes and who were emptynesters into social homes, to free up that market for new families. I've got areas in Rivett, I've got them in Curtin, I've got them in a range of suburbs right across my electorate, where we built these new social houses that were the brand new townhouses that assisted people in downsizing. These houses provided them with all the facilities they needed-a lovely terrace garden out the back; facilities allowing them to transition as they aged-and it freed up family sized social housing. It was an historic investment in social housing, the largest investment in social housing in Australia's history, all thanks to Labor when we were in government. So we understand the importance of downsizing, and we put our money where our mouth is. We did it when we were in government. In the 2013-14 budget we also had a pilot program aimed at helping people downsize. We had that program that was designed for social housing; we also had a pilot program where people on aged pensions who wanted to downsize from their family home could do so. It's a means-test exemption. Up to $200,000 in proceeds would have been put into a fund that would have been exempt from the pensions means test for up to 10 years. It was this government's own short-sightedness that saw this measure scrapped. And questions on notice about the government's own downsizing measure saw Treasury fail to answer how many households would be expected to downsize as a result. It speaks volumes about where this government's priorities lie in this space, in terms of downsizing, housing affordability, negative gearing and capital gains tax, and just in terms of appointing a minister for housing and homelessness. The top recommendation from a Senate committee on housing affordability in 2015 was: … that the Australian Government appoint a Minister for Housing and Homelessness, with the portfolio to be located in a central agency such as the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet or the Treasury, or in the Department of Infrastructure with formal links to the central agencies. This advice is two years old now, and what have we got from the government? Complete and utterly deafening silence. The government has ignored this advice, instead placing the responsibility for housing affordability and homelessness with the Minister for Social Services-and, right now, access and affordability just doesn't seem to be high on the priority list. I am very concerned about where this government stands when it comes to housing affordability, particularly for those who are the most vulnerable in our community. This is a significant issue right across Australia, and it's a significant issue here in the ACT. It's a significant issue that was discussed at yesterday's ACT housing and homelessness summit. Community organisations, through that summit, are looking to the future when it comes to the types of affordable housing options being offered to Canberrans. We have to start looking at a range of options. We had that social housing model, the traditional family house I mentioned earlier, where we assisted with downsizing. That is one option, but we need to start getting creative and innovative in our housing options for the future, because one size won't fit all. We need a range of solutions and a range of options for the many and varied families that we have in Australia. We have single women-I will speak about them in a motion later in this speech-and there's a significant challenge for older single women. In fact, this is one thing that keeps me awake at night: the tsunami of homelessness that is going to come for aged Australians, particularly older Australian women who have very little super and are currently in very low paying jobs. They are usually divorced and renting in the private rental market. The thing that keeps them awake at night is: 'What's going to happen to me when I retire from work? I own too much to be in social housing, yet I have limited super.' Facing being in the private rental market on a pension is a pretty grim future. That is the thing that keeps them awake at night, and it keeps me awake a night too. Every time. I speak about this issue, I have women coming up to me after my speech, in tears, saying: 'You are speaking about me. You are talking about my future. I am worried; I am scared witless about what retirement means for me.' The options that we have at the moment are very limited for women like this. Options were discussed at the homelessness and housing summit. There's the Nightingale option-the Nightingale model-which is a housing option that's growing in popularity. It was discussed as a possible alternative to lower the cost of housing in Canberra. It originated in Melbourne, and it focuses on sustainability and affordability. It cuts out the traditional developer, who limits investor profit margin, in an architect led model. The construction of the first Nightingale building in Brunswick is expected to be completed next month, so I look forward to hearing about the outcome of that. Another model that I'm very attracted to is the model that the YWCA here in Canberra implemented a number of years ago, called Lady Heydon House. It is working very successfully. It's a housing arrangement for five older single women. Each woman has her own unit and her own access to her unit and carport, but there's also a communal living space. The units are metered and billed separately, but the cost of living in those units is not prohibitive; it's not crippling. As I said, these women are on modest incomes, have little super, are usually divorced and are still in the private rental market. This gives them the option of dignity in their retirement, and also the option of not being socially isolated by living in a one-room bedsit. How many of us, when we were students, lived in little one-room bedsits? Is that how we want to spend our time at the end of life? It was difficult and challenging enough as a student. That's not what I want for Canberran and Australian women in their retirement. I want them to have a dignified retirement, where they still feel they are contributing to the community, they are engaged and they are not socially isolated. That's why Lady Heydon House is very attractive, but there are other options for cooperative housing. We need to start exploring this and start getting far more innovative in this space. As I said, the Equality Rights Alliance did a report a number of years ago where they were talking about this tsunami of homelessness for Australians. From memory, about 600,000 women in the next five to 10 years are potentially facing homelessness as they age, because of the circumstances that I outlined before. There are also 300,000 men. This is going to be a big problem and we need to start addressing it now. This is why the government's lack of a minister for housing and homelessness is a real concern. There is no-one actually focused on addressing this issue-this tsunami that is going to hit Australia in years to come of older Australians who have contributed all their lives to our society. Here they are, and how do we repay them? We repay them by making them homeless. It is a very, very big concern. In the short time. I have left, I want to underscore the fact that we have a significant issue with homelessness, potentially in older women, in years to come. We know that on the night of the 2011 census, 44 per cent of Australia's homeless population were women. The YWCA has been calling for appropriate, affordable and stable housing for women for a very long time now. It's why it's important that the government appoint a minister dedicated to housing and homelessness. It's why this government needs to show leadership on the housing affordability and homelessness issue-not tomorrow, not in the near future, but yesterday. Ms RYAN (Lalor-Opposition Whip) (12:00): I rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Reducing Pressure on Housing Affordability Measures No. 1) Bill 2017. I'm pleased to rise, following the member for Canberra, to speak on such an important issue, an issue that is alive in the electorate of Lalor-alive in the communities that I represent. Just this weekend I was in a conversation with a local person who wanted to talk to me about her family, her adult children, who she believes are locked out of ever affording their own house. She thinks the days of Australians owning their own home in communities like mine are over. Where does she get that impression? She gets that impression because the cost of buying a home in this country have spiralled out of control. With this bill, this government is putting an absolutely sham suggestion before us-the suggestion that allowing young people to access part of their superannuation for a short time, which would only create the possibility of a deposit to let them enter the market and only if they were already in recipient of superannuation payments, will somehow affect housing affordability. Well, it won't affect the cost of housing. It will have limited impact on young people in my electorate being able to break in to buying their own home. This is the great Australian dream. It is a sad day when we have a Treasurer, the member for Cook, a Treasurer who comes up with the sham notion simply to get past the headlines, simply to kick this can down the road, at a time when we know that inequality is above 70year levels. When wage growth is slowed and company profits are up, it is a sham to bring before this House a proposal that is next to useless. We know that Labor created compulsory superannuation with a specific purpose: so that early contributions to superannuation will grow your investment over the long term to make for a dignified, comfortable retirement. That is the purpose of superannuation. This piece of legislation seeks to undermine that by encouraging young people to access that superannuation. There are a few problems I have with this from the get-go. The first of them is that it's not 12 months since I stood in this chamber to condemn the government because they were seeking to reduce the penalty for businesses who did not make superannuation contributions for their employees. We've gone from that to a government who says, 'We have a solution to housing affordability-it's allowing access to superannuation.' I have another local story. Quite recently I was in a conversation with a local young person working in retail in my electorate who was telling me about her two-year pursuit of a company she had worked for-a two-year pursuit, and she was still not in receipt of the superannuation that she was owed for a period of three years. What hope is there for her to access superannuation to get together a housing deposit when the superannuation hasn't been paid in the first place? It was taking longer than two years; it had been two years at the point I was speaking to her that she had been trying to chase down these funds and have them put into her superannuation. We know that in this country we have a serious situation in term of housing affordability. No-one knows that better than me, because I represent the communities in Victoria that have the highest rates of mortgage default and tenancy evictions. People in rental properties in my electorate are doing it tough to keep up with paying their rent. The Victorian state Labor government has made changes to the tenancy act. They had a review and announced changes that they want to bring into the tenancy act. But really the only way to impact on both the number of evictions that are happening in tenancy and the mortgage stress that's happening in our community is to address housing affordability. Yet this government comes in here with a piece of legislation that will have no impact on housing prices in this country. This proposal is a disgrace. It first encourages Australians to use superannuation for things that it was not intended for and second seeks to kick this can down the road and hope that headlines around housing affordability won't come back, while in a community like mine the number of renters massively increases and fewer and fewer young people can afford to break into the market. If the government were serious they would be addressing this issue. As the member for Canberra put so clearly, not having a minister for housing and homelessness speaks volumes about the care factor on the other side of this chamber about this issue and about the people in my electorate and electorates like mine. No action-this government's inaction-will see the housing affordability crisis worsen. In contrast, Labor have clear policies, which we would dearly love those opposite to take with both hands and implement, that would have a real impact on the housing affordability crisis. Those opposite want to make an announcement with this piece of legislation that won't work, but it will take years to assess its effectiveness. Meanwhile, the housing affordability crisis will worsen. Fewer and fewer young people in electorates like mine will be able to afford to get into the property market at all. Labor have no problem with the plan, under the downsizing elements in this bill, to allow people over the age of 65 to make contributions of up to $300,000 to their super fund. If it were separated from the rest of this bill, Labor would support that measure. But we have real issues with the fact that this bill will not tackle housing affordability. We need to be really clear in this place today that the government have many options. One of the ways in which they might support people in an electorate like mine would be to desist from their attacks on the take-home pay of the people who work in my electorate, which are best exemplified, of course, by the cuts to penalty rates that are occurring. In the electorate of Lalor 8,860 retail workers and 4,600 workers in food and accommodation, in total over 13,000 workers, have had their ability to afford a house directly affected by the inaction of those opposite towards stopping the cuts to penalty rates. If those opposite wanted to help housing affordability they could start there. We're in the fifth year of this government, so over the past four-year journey they could have not walked into this place and dared Holden to leave. They could have assured the 4,000 workers in my electorate whose jobs are linked to the auto industry, and the many more in Melbourne's west, that they would ensure the Toyota manufacturing plant in my electorate didn't close, with the consequential threat of the closure of many of the components-making factories in that industry. They could have done that. They chose not to. In fact, this week we've heard them try to whitewash history by suggesting they took no part, made no decision, that impacted on those things. We all know that's not true. We all remember being in this chamber when the Treasurer made that call to Holden and dared them to leave this country, which set about the closing down of not just Holden but Toyota as well. And their response to that closure has been far from satisfactory. Those workers who are in my electorate are not getting the level of support they had come to expect from federal governments when an industry closed. They are now scrambling to find jobs that will pay them a decent salary. Most of them will ultimately be looking to work in the transport and logistics field in my electorate because they see that as a growth industry. Unfortunately, that industry is dominated by labour hire practices which will not see them in secure work and will not see them receiving the rates of pay they were accustomed to in the auto industry. If this government were serious about addressing housing affordability and, therefore, serious about addressing homelessness in this country, they would be taking a very different tack. Addressing housing affordability will help to alleviate some of the pressures that force people into homelessness. The shadow minister responsible, Senator Cameron, has visited my electorate. He has sat with people who are going through homelessness, who have fallen off that cliff into homelessness. He understands clearly housing affordability-what it means in terms of rent and what it means in terms of homelessness and the growing number of homeless in my electorate. Next month, West Justice, the community legal centre in my electorate, will be releasing their report on couch surfing. I find it absolutely incredible that I am on my feet in Canberra talking about changes to superannuation to supposedly have a positive impact in this space while knowing the numbers of young people who are already unable to find employment and who are already technically homeless or casually homeless-in that they are moving from place to place with no fixed address, reaching out to community members for support, with no clear support from this government. These things are now going to compound, one after the other, as this government's inaction causes all these issues to be worse. Achieving the Australian dream and owning a home is continually slipping from the reach of young first home buyers. As a mother of three adult children, I know this first hand, and I speak to families in my electorate who do as well. The capacity to save for a house deposit while you are in the casual workforce is absolutely untenable. It is untenable that we would think that young people can be in those circumstances and save for a house. As they move from job to job, from workplace to workplace, and then spend time checking to see if their superannuation is actually being paid, we're a far cry from the stability of some of the communities those opposite may live in, where people have well-paid jobs, where people are not in casual employment and where people are having their superannuation paid in the first place. We know that a former Reserve Bank governor, Bernie Fraser, has spoken against the current housing tax arrangements, calling them 'manifestly unfair'. Labor has put policies before this government that could assist in decreasing the cost of housing in this country and could allow young people to not be bidding against investors at every auction across my electorate. These are policies that this government should adopt. Two-thirds of those who negatively gear are on a taxable income of $80,000 or less. While they represent a large proportion of those who negatively gear, they only represent eight per cent of the population and only make up to 58 per cent of the negative gearing benefit. The top 20 per cent of income earners receive around half of the negative gearing benefit, and the top 10 per cent of income earners merely receive 70 per cent of the benefit. We can see that negative gearing disproportionately benefits a small wealthy minority. Changes, therefore, would manifestly assist the large majority. Limiting the use of negative gearing to newly built homes would result in a boost to housing supply while slowing the explosion in housing prices in established areas. As someone who represents a growth corridor, I can say that this policy would work for our community. We would see people continue to be employed in the housing building industry, while pressure on the middle wing of suburbs would be reduced. These changes would provide an extra $32 billion to the budget bottom line over 10 years. This government continues to ignore the needs of the majority of Australians in order to support big business. This piece of legislation is about kicking the can down the road on housing affordability. It is about hoping that the headlines go away. Those opposite are living in a dream. The number of young people who can afford a house is dwindling every day, and the number of those in my electorate who are worried about this, concerned about this and prepared to talk about this is growing every day. I urge this government to adopt Labor's policies, to do something real about housing affordability in this country. this place, I went out with my now wife to look at buying a house. I'd previously bought a unit in Parkville, Melbourne, where I live, and we were then looking for a larger place around Melbourne. We went to quite a few auctions. As we went to those auctions, we kept seeing one person pop up every time. Every time this person was at the auctions, just when it got to the point where someone who, you could tell, was going to move into that house was about to buy it, she'd stick up her hand, increase the bid and say, 'I'm going to bid even more.' At one auction, she sat there, sticking her hand up time after time, buying on behalf of someone else, pushing the price up and up. We went to half-a-dozen or a dozen of these auctions, seeing the same person or similar people there every time. You could sense and tell that all of the people who wanted to buy a house to move into were sitting there and thinking: 'What can we do? We can't outbid this person. We don't know who they are, but we can't outbid them.' It became apparent that this person doing the bidding, and winning these houses by pushing the price beyond where people could afford, wasn't about to move into the house; it was a property agent. They were there buying it on behalf of someone else. It became clear to us that they were bidding up the price of housing so that first home buyers couldn't get in, because they were buying on behalf of someone who could then take the house, rent it out and, if they made a loss on renting it out because they'd paid too much, write that loss off for a",53,Bills
16,Mr Bandt (Melbourne) (12:15,"About seven years ago, not long after being elected totax discount. Then in a few years time-so the agent was advising them-they could sell the house and get a tax break on that as well. It was becoming crystal clear, as we were going around auction after auction and being outbid, that we were being outbid by people who had no intention of coming and living in these houses, starting a family in these houses, perhaps living close to where they worked. They were being bought by people who could rely on a tax system, which this place presides over, that would write them out cheques for buying their second, third or fourth house, at prices that put it out of the reach of first home buyers. Meanwhile the people who wanted to live in the house and buy their first home weren't able to do it. That's what we have in this country. We have a tax system that rewards people who already have a house and says, 'We will give you billions of dollars in subsidies every year for you to buy your second, third, fourth or fifth house, and we don't care if that pushes up prices so much that aspiring first home buyers can't ever even buy their first.' This is coming from someone who's on a politician's wage, and my wife was working at the time as well. If a politician, earning the very good money that we do, whose partner is also working, can't even afford to buy a place near where they want to live, because the government is subsidising someone else to come in and buy that very same house as a tax write-off, at a cost to the federal budget, then the system is broken. It is no wonder that I meet people in my electorate every week who have just given up on the hope of ever being able to afford to buy a house and those who have given up even being able to rent a house in inner-city Melbourne, near where they live or study. It's because we have this massive bubble that the tax system is pumping up and up, driven by negative gearing and capital gains tax. It means you can come in and buy a house and pay as much for it as you want-if you are lucky enough to have the money for it-because you can write-off your losses from it as a tax write-off, and then when you sell it you can get a tax break at the end, as well. It keeps the property agents, the accountants and the tax planners in business, because they develop these schemes that price everyday people out of the market. It means that if you have a couple of houses already you're doing all right. AndI will tell you what: there are lots of people in this place who have quite a few houses and who take advantage of that lurk. But it comes at the expense of first home buyers. In the 1990s the average house price was six times an average young person's income. If you finished university and went out and tried to buy a place it was about six times your average income. Fast forward to 2013 and it's 12 times an average young person's income, and it's gone up and up since then. At the same time, over a very similar period, the share of wealth that young people have in this country has gone down from about 10 per cent to about five per cent, and that's falling as well. So we've got a huge problem in this country. The pea under the mattress that means no-one will get a good night's sleep until we remove it is the tax system-the tax system that rewards those who already have by giving them more at the expense of first home buyers. So we need to get rid of negative gearing and we need to get rid of the capital gains tax exemption which says that if you have the misfortune of having to earn your income by working you have to pay the full freight of tax but if you are wealthy enough to earn your income by being able to buy or sell houses or shares we will give you a 50 per cent tax break. We've got to get rid of that. That is going to start to make housing more affordable for people and it will mean the government will find more money for paying for things like schools and hospitals, to the tune of about $5 billion a year, if we do it right. If we wind it back right, we could find ourselves bringing in an extra $5 billion a year. What should we do with that money? Well, it's time for a mind-shift in this country-not to do the kind of measures that the government is talking about in this bill, which is not to take away the tax breaks but to add more tax breaks into the system in the hope that somehow that will fix it. No. We need a mind-shift. We need to start thinking about housing the way we think about schools and hospitals. If there were 200,000 children being turned away from schools because not enough schools had been built, we would think it was a national scandal. If there were 200,000 people who couldn't get into the hospital in their local area because there weren't enough hospitals, we would think that was a national scandal. We need to start thinking about housing the way we think about Medicare. We need a Medicare for housing. Housing is a human right. It is not an opportunity to make a huge amount of profit. It is not something on which this government should be spending $5 billion a year giving tax breaks to people who have already have a house to go and buy their second, third or fourth. No. Let's think about housing the way we think about schools. Everyone deserves to have a roof over their head, in exactly the same way as every child has the right to go to a government school. In the same way as we would say that if you can't get into school we should build more schools and if you can't get a bed in a hospital we need to build more hospitals, it's time for the government to say that if you can't get an affordable house and a roof over your head it's time for the government to step in and build them and to make sure it happens. We need to think about housing the way that we think about Medicare. That's what the Greens are campaigning on in Queensland at the moment-a home for all. We need to start thinking about housing and a home for all as a human right. They're pushing for a new Queensland housing trust that will start building a million affordable homes, that will create 16,000 jobs per year for 10 years and that will give people a home for life, and when you build the homes you get the rent that people pay on those homes and you plough that back into the system so that the system can continue. In states like mine, in Victoria, we've suffered from the mining boom that drove up the dollar and put huge pressures on manufacturing. We've got 40,000 people, nearly, on the waiting lists for public housing, and if you're in the top category in Victoria you could be homeless for a couple of years before you find yourself a spot in public housing, but we haven't built more public housing on any large scale since the 1960s. What better way to deal with high youth unemployment and a rising homelessness problem than to engage in a large scale build of affordable housing for people who are currently being locked out of the market? We've got factories in Brooklyn and elsewhere in western Melbourne where they're creating modular homes on, largely, assembly lines in many places and doing amazing stuff. I've been down to Morwell where they've got a potential crisis facing them with unemployment, and we have the closure of Hazelwood Power Station and the potential closure of other power stations. Why not say that in the Latrobe Valley we will fund you to build affordable homes-perhaps even modular homes that we might ship up to Melbourne to house the people who are currently without an affordable home-creating jobs and homes in the process? So Australia becomes a place where everyone gets a roof over their head and where we do the two things that could start to make a real difference to housing affordability, not adding more tax breaks into the system for the wealthy as this government is proposing. It would actually do something real. Firstly, we'd get rid of the tax breaks in the system that are pushing up prices to the point where people can't afford it anymore. Secondly, we'd do something that would start to drive rents and prices down, which is to increase supply of low-cost stock. At the moment, in my area of Melbourne, the general rule seems to be that if you find an old place, especially if it's an old warehouse in the city, knock it down and build on it the biggest, most expensive thing you can find. So we're getting more oneand two-bedroom units but they're out of the price range of many people. Let's start building properties that get rented out at less than market rent or that are sold only to people on lower incomes. IfI as a member of parliament with a partner who is working full-time find ourselves getting out-bid at auctions for very modest properties, then someone who is a cleaner coming into the city to clean the buildings at night-or a firefighter who works at a station or a nurse who works at a hospital-has almost no hope. Why don't we start building properties in the inner city for the key workers of the inner city, and say, 'You can only buy one of those properties if your income is below a certain point,' and the condition on it is it has to be resold at a certain amount? Why not start building some of the properties in the inner city and say we will only rent them out to people whose income is below a certain amount, and we'll rent them cheaply? We've got a couple of trillion dollars floating around in superannuation funds. What a good place to invest them, in building affordable housing in the inner city. And then, when the government says, 'Well, we couldn't possibly start to think about housing the way we think about schools and hospitals and make it universally available for everyone,' I will remind them that there's $5 billion a year we could save by not giving tax breaks to people who've already got a house. Let's not give tax breaks to people who have a house so that they can buy their second, third or fourth house. Put $5 billion extra into the system and build more affordable housing. It will put housing back in the reach of young people and put renting a house back in the reach of young people. That's what a proper housing affordability strategy would look like. Instead, because the government hasn't got the guts to tackle its base-the big donors who donate to it and the members of parliament who sit here with over a dozen properties in many instances under their name, while some people don't even have one; that's who this government is speaking for. Well, we will stand up for young people. The Greens will stand up for young people. The Greens will stand up for those who are being screwed over. The Greens will close the wealth gap that exists at the moment and push for real action to make housing more affordable for renters and for buyers. We will stand up to those vested interests, but the government clearly won't. homeownership feels completely out of reach. I speak with them every day in my electorate in Melbourne's west. A generation of young Australians have watched property prices break away from wages. They are a generation who, no matter how much they save, see property prices growing faster than the deposit they need to get a foot on the property ladder. They are a generation who wonder how they can afford to live near their jobs and near their families. They are a generation who have been failed by this government.",63,Bills
17,Mr Watts (Gellibrand) (12:30,"For many young Australians today, the dream ofUnfortunately, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Reducing Pressure on Housing Affordability Measures No. 1) Bill 2017 and the First Home Super Saver Tax Bill 2017, which are before the House today, represent a continuation of this failure. Labor does not support them. They won't improve housing affordability, because they duck the main problems in our housing market in favour of a grab bag of bandaid solutions. This represents, it's fair to say, progress of a kind on the part of the government. At least the Turnbull government is no longer actively denying there's a housing affordability problem in this country or telling young Australians that they need to just get a good job that pays well in order to break into the property market. The first bill does seem to show that the government at least understand that they have a political problem with housing affordability-it being named the 'reducing pressure on housing affordability measures bill'. It's a bit of a giveaway in this respect. But the measures in this bill are little more than a fig leaf for a lack of real action on this front. There's a long way to go before young Australians will see a comprehensive plan to deal with the pressure on housing affordability from their government. We should say from the outset of this debate that we have a housing affordability crisis in Australia today. For 25to 34-year-olds, only four in 10 own a home today, compared to six in 10 who owned a home in 1982. It's a big change that has consequences throughout the housing market for first home buyers, renters, people in public housing and, indeed, the homeless. It's a problem that is being felt particularly acutely in Melbourne. The Demographia International Housing Affordability Survey: 2017 found that Melbourne was the sixth least affordable city in the world. Current ABS statistics show that Melbourne's median house price has risen to a record $880,902-an increase of more than $100,000. The Grattan Institute has found that housing prices have increased by over 40 per cent over the past five years. If you already own your home, particularly if you bought it 20 years ago, this is all to the good; for everyone else, though, this has big implications. By the end of last year, 37 per cent of average disposable income would be taken up by the monthly mortgage repayments on a median priced home, after a 25 per cent deposit had been put down. That's 20 percentage points higher than the equivalent call on disposable income in 1997. In Melbourne, 35 per cent of families are suffering from rental stress. Ten years ago, around one in three rental properties in Melbourne was considered to be affordable for a struggling family, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. Today, just 5.7 per cent of rental properties are considered to be affordable for these families. The impact on the number of Australians who live in homelessness is obvious. These market conditions demonstrate just how lazy it is to bash generation Y Australians in this debate, to blame them for their inability to break into this market. All too often, young people's aspiration for homeownership is met with condescension from their government and from far too many people in our general community. They're frequently told that, if they want a house, they should stop eating smashed avocado on toast or stop buying take-away coffee. To put down a deposit on a typical house in Footscray, in my electorate, you would need to forgo about 38,000 coffees or 150 years worth of weekly smashed avo brunches. It's a nonsense. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, generation Y already spends less on food and recreation and much more on housing than their predecessors, their equivalent generation, did in 1989. That is hardly surprising, given that they also confront an employment market with the lowest wage growth on record and very high rates of youth unemployment. If they were lucky enough to go to university, young Australians today also carry debt repayments for their higher education that are orders of magnitude higher than the debt faced by previous generations. We should be clear: this isn't a morality play of lazy young people refusing to make the same sacrifices that previous generations did to break into the housing market. Instead, young Australians are confronting a housing market that is structurally different from the one that confronted their parents and indeed their grandparents. There are a number of reasons why Australia's housing market has evolved in this way, but one reason is the fact that the Turnbull government continues to insist on giving a tax break to people buying their second, third, fourth or fifth investment property but nothing to young Aussies trying to buy their first home. These tax breaks cost the budget $10 billion a year, and almost half of the benefit goes to the highest 10 per cent of income earners. More than 90 per cent of the lending for property investment of this kind goes into purchases of existing housing stock, so it doesn't even increase the stock of housing in the market in a significant way. It has helped growth in property prices outstrip growth in people's incomes in a way that the current prevailing low interest rates can never offset. It has empowered a new investor class in our housing market that has muscled first home buyers out of the market. As a result, home ownership is at a 60year low and the proportion of first home buyers in the market fell to a record low of just 13 per cent in July 2016, before moving up slightly in the last quarter, thanks to stamp duty concessions for first home buyers given by the Victorian and New South Wales state governments. There are a number of things that governments should be doing to respond to these changes in a holistic way. The federal Labor Party released a comprehensive housing affordability policy before the last federal election. We committed to reforming negative gearing and the capital gains tax concessions for property; limiting direct borrowing by self-managed superannuation funds; facilitating a COAG process to introduce a uniform vacant property tax across all major cities; increasing foreign investor fees and penalties; establishing a bond aggregator to increase investment in affordable housing; boosting homelessness support for vulnerable Australians; getting better results from the National Affordable Housing Agreement; and, finally, re-establishing the National Housing Supply Council and reinstating a minister for housing. Our reforms to negative gearing would limit future negative gearing concessions to new housing stock, and we would reduce the capital gains tax discount from 50 per cent to 25 per cent. These are responsible changes that would moderate the growth in housing prices and target tax concessions to where we need them-for investment in new housing stock, increasing supply. Indeed, the McKell Institute estimated that a 10 per cent increase in construction as a result of these changes would lead to up to 18,500 new homes being constructed per year. It's a smart, responsible policy that backs in young Australians wanting to buy their first home. In this changed housing market governments also need to do more for the larger number of Australians who will be spending a longer time in the rental market. That is why I was very pleased to see the Andrews Labor government's recent package of reforms to make renting fairer in Victoria. This package gives tenants more rights, longer leases and smaller and fairer bonds. The Victorian government has committed to banning rental bidding, a practice where potential tenants are asked to bid against each other for the privilege of renting a property. Rental increases will only be allowed on an annual basis, to deliver financial stability for long-term renters. Landlords will no longer be able to force tenants to vacate their leases for 'no specified reason'. Renters will be given basic human dignities, like the right to own a pet unless there's a good reason for the landlord to deny them consent for a particular property. Renters will also be given the right to make minor modifications to rental properties, like installing hooks for picture frames, and when tenants are forced to make urgent repairs to the property landlords will be required to reimburse them more quickly. Bonds will be capped at one month's rent where the rent is twice the median rent, and bonds will be required to be released to tenants more quickly at the end of tenancies when there has been no dispute lodged by the landlord. These are important reforms that strike a new bargain for renters in the radically changed new structure of the modern housing market in Australia. Housing should not be thought of as just another investment category. It's a foundation of human dignity. While successive governments have created a situation in which property investors have been given an unfair advantage in the market over people seeking a home for their family, it's important in this context that government provides these basic protections for people who are unable to buy their own home and are forced to rent for increasingly long periods of time. Federal Labor's changes to the tax treatment of property and Victorian Labor's fair renting reforms are the kind of holistic approaches that we need to address the housing affordability crisis. The bills before the House, on the other hand, are little more than ineffective bandaids. The so-called First Home Super Saver Scheme will do nothing to tackle housing affordability. What it will do is undermine Australia's world-class superannuation scheme, in a further attack on the future of young Australians. The government's plan on this front would mean that first home savers who make voluntary contributions into the superannuation scheme for their retirement could then withdraw these contributions, up to certain limits, and an amount of associated earnings for the purpose of purchasing their first home. Concessional tax treatment would apply to amounts that are withdrawn for this purpose under the scheme. The effect of this intervention on housing affordability would just be to pour further fuel on the housing market. Anything that first home buyers will be able to pull out of this scheme for a deposit to increase their bidding potential in the auction market will quickly be factored into the price of properties for sale on the market. The other measure in this bill is about contributing the proceeds of downsizing to superannuation. The government proposes to allow people aged 65 or over to make a nonconcessional contribution of up to $300,000 from the proceeds of selling their home. These contributions would be exempt from the age test, the work test and the $1.6 million balance test for non-concessional superannuation contributions. There's nothing wrong with this in principle and, if the government were to split this measure away from the First Home Super Saver Scheme measure, we'd be open to considering this measure. Indeed, in the 2013-14 budget there was a pilot program that had the aim of doing just this, trialling a means test exemption for age pension recipients who were downsizing from a family home for their retirement, freeing up that housing stock for young families who need that space for their new young children. Up to $200,000 in proceeds would have been put into a fund in which would have been exempt from the pension's means test for up to 10 years. But of course this short sighted government axed this pilot program. So it's back to have another crack at the same issue in the bill before the House today. This proposal would be worth taking more seriously if it tackled related issues to this downsizing question, issues like the age pension income test, asset tests and stamp duty issues taken together. But as it stands this measure will have a minor impact on addressing the housing affordability crisis in Australia. What's needed to tackle the housing affordability crisis in Australia is leadership. We need recognition of the scale of the problem and its causes. We need a government that's willing to go in to bat for young Australians and recognise the legitimacy of their aspirations for homeownership. We need a government with the vision required to outline a policy alternative that over time will create a new structure and a new bargain for young Australians trying to break into the housing market. We need to reconceptualise the way we think about housing. For too long housing has been a topic of reality TV shows and a topic of investment speculation rather than the foundation stone of human dignity, particularly the dignity of families living in our communities. We should not countenance a tax system that privileges property investors-some of them may be property speculators-over young families trying to build some financial stability and some home life stability for their young families. This is an intergenerational inequality issue. If we want to have equity between the generations, we need to ensure the latest generation coming up the ladder aren't being kicked off-aren't being prevented from climbing aboard the property ladder that previous generations in Australia climbed aboard. In the past, homeownership has been the great Australian dream. It has been the foundation for families to invest in the new generation, to invest in the children coming up behind them and give them that stability of home life and that financial stability they need to thrive and reach their full potential. We need to get back to that. We need to address the housing affordability crisis in a holistic, comprehensive way, and, unfortunately, the bills before the House do not do that. Pressure on Housing Affordability Measures No. 1) Bill 2017, can I say that I support the amendment moved by the member for McMahon in this place yesterday. This legislation is the government's shallow response to the housing affordability crisis that exists throughout Australia and has existed now for some years. It contains two measures. Firstly, the First Home Super Saver Scheme, whereby a person can downsize their home, if they're 65 years or over, and place some $300,000 into their superannuation account. The other measure is the one dealing with the super scheme whereby a person can put money from their income additionally into super and then use that money to purchase their home. As the member for McMahon has quite rightly pointed out, if the two measures were split Labor would not oppose the downsizing measure. But the measure relating to the First Home Super Saver Scheme is one that we don't support. The great Australian dream of homeownership is rapidly fading away for most Australians. To put that into some perspective, in 1970 in Sydney the average house price was around $18,700. In Adelaide, my home city, it was $11,900. Today in Sydney the average home price is $1.1 million and in Adelaide it's $436,000. The average wage in 1970 across Australia was somewhere between $5,000 and $6,000. Today it's $78,000. So we have a situation where the average wage has gone up around 15 times since 1970, whereas housing prices have gone up some 60 times over the same period in Sydney and 36 times over that period in Adelaide. Regardless of whether it's 36 times or 60 times, housing prices have gone up many more",66,Bills
18,Mr Zappia (Makin) (12:45,"In speaking on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Reducingtimes than the average wage increase over that period. Understandably and logically, it's becoming more and more difficult for a person to buy their own home. That has been reflected in other statistics that are also available. We saw in a report only yesterday in The Age by Clancy Yeates that Australian house prices have risen on average 8.1 per cent a year, for a cumulative rise of 6,556 per cent over a 56-year period. The 2016 census shows that some 31 per cent of Australians own their home outright. Some 34 to 35 per cent are in the process of paying off their home-that is, they have a mortgage over it. So between 65 and 66 per cent of Australians are either owning their home or paying it off. In 1966, 50 years earlier, 71.4 per cent of Australians either owned their own home or were paying it off. We have seen a reduction of around six per cent over that period. Six per cent may not sound like much, but it's actually quite significant. It's been on the decline pretty much ever since, and it continues to fall. I suspect it will start to fall at even greater rates in the years ahead unless governments address this issue through sensible policies that will have some effect. As I pointed out earlier, housing prices continue to rise. In the last five years alone, housing prices have increased by 35 per cent. Notably-and I found this statistic very interesting-the highest home ownership rates in the world are in China, where 90 per cent of the population own their home, and in Russia, where 87 per cent of people own their own home. I thought that was quite interesting given that neither is what we would refer to as a capitalist country. A fifth of households with a mortgage are now paying more than 30 per cent of their income on their repayments, and that in turn is causing housing stress. When we go back to the people who are currently in the process of owning their own home because they have a mortgage on it-they've taken out a loan and are repaying it-one-fifth of them are now also under financial stress and finding it difficult to continue to pay off their mortgage. That should be of real concern, because if those people cannot pay off their home they will be left even worse off, because they will probably make a loss out of the investment they've made in their home. Not only are housing affordability and higher house prices lowering home ownership rates in Australia. Because prices are at such a high level in comparison with incomes in Australia, when people want to rent a home, because they cannot afford to buy one, they're also faced with excessively high rental charges. The rental charges have to reflect the cost of the house in the first instance, and people who invest in homes want a return on their investment that is commensurate with returns they might get if they put their money elsewhere. Higher housing prices not only mean that people cannot afford to buy a house but mean that many people are no longer able to afford the rent that is being charged for them to have a roof over their head. I said earlier on that housing prices are continuing to rise. I understand that as at the end of June the mean housing price across Australia was $679,000. That's an enormous amount of money for an average income earner to try to raise or to pay off if they're able to put a deposit down and get a loan. Not surprisingly, because of that mean housing price we now have some 105,000 people who are homeless. They can't afford to buy a home or even to rent a home. I don't have the figures for 2016, because I believe they haven't been released as yet, but my expectation is that the figure could be even higher than 105,000. Were it not for the fact that so many young people are living with their parents because they cannot afford to buy their own home or pay rent, the figure would be much worse. We're seeing the trend where young people are not leaving home when they reach 21 or 18-in fact, many of them are staying with their parents well into their 30s-because they cannot afford to live outside of their parents' home. There are several factors for the housing stress and the homelessness, and pricing is one. But one of the others is that there has undoubtedly also been a reduction in public housing across the country. In 1991 public housing peaked. Some seven per cent of the housing was public housing, or social housing. In 2016 the figure was 4.2 per cent-just over half of what it was in 1991. We've seen state governments selling off public housing in order to pay down debt, but as they sell off public housing, of course, the people who are in desperate need have nowhere to go. I want to refer to a report put out by the St Vincent de Paul Society only last year. I will quote a passage from their report that talks about the crisis I've been referring to. The report says: A measure of the housing crisis is the number of people around the country on waiting lists for social housing: 217,000 families in 2014. Moreover, for those several million Australians on Centrelink benefits, only 1 per cent of private rental properties are affordable. Reflecting this, more than 157,000 households in Australia are paying over 50 per cent of their income in rent, and therefore live in severely unaffordable housing. The most recent estimate is that there are 875,000 households in Australia that are experiencing housing stress. The report goes on to say: As at 2011-2012, 90 per cent of government expenditure on housing policies (direct expenditure and tax concessions such as capital gains tax exemptions) was received by homeowners (about $36 billion each year) and residential property investors ($6.8 billion). This compares to federal and state/territory governments spending around $5 billion on social housing. So, we have nearly $43 billion being rebated in the form of tax concessions to investors in residential property, compared with only $5 billion going back into social housing from the state governments. Therein lies the real problem. There is a housing affordability crisis in Australia, and public housing is unable to even meet the crisis we're facing. And the Turnbull government's response is to do two things, as I pointed out at the beginning of this debate-that is, to use super funds to help people get into housing and to allow people to downsize once they reach the age of 65. Those measures are not adequate and will not address the real problems we face. Time will tell, but I'm reasonably confident that they will not address the serious crisis in housing affordability in this country. This is a coalition government that comes from years of never having truly been committed to the superannuation process in this country. We saw that they opposed superannuation when it was introduced into law and into society by Labor. But more recently we saw this coalition government freeze the contributions at 9.5 per cent until, I believe, the year 2021. The people they're saying might benefit from the scheme are being asked to put money into superannuation where they will get a tax benefit so they can then take it out with perhaps some of their other contributions and put it into housing. The truth of the matter is that people cannot afford to put extra money into super in the first place. The people we're trying to help and who need help are the very people who are at the low-income end and do not have spare money to put into their super fund. But if they are fortunate enough to do so, and they can access that fund, it will mean that they will have a lower return on their fund when they reach retirement years, because they will have had less money in it. So they will lose out at the end of the process. The truth also is that most Australians aspire to two things in their life. Yes, to own a home has been one of the great Australian dreams. But the second has been to have a reasonable retirement, some stability in retirement-something they can look forward to. What we're saying, as the member for McMahon quite rightly pointed out in his own contribution to this debate, is that the government is saying to Australians: 'You can have one or the other, but you cannot have both. Either you can have a home and no retirement, or you can have retirement but no home, but you cannot have both.' And that is on the assumption that all the rules relating to the assets test and so on that relate to home ownership and entitlement to pensions and other concessions when one reaches retirement don't change between now and the years ahead. It's very likely that, having taken the steps the government wants people to take right now, the rules will in turn be changed years down the track, which will mean that they've made their decisions to no avail, because they will lose out in other ways. Lastly, it is true that many factors have contributed to rising house prices in this country. But undoubtedly, and as the St Vincent de Paul Society report highlights, negative gearing and capital gains tax discounts have added considerably to the price of houses in Australia. This government refuses to address that issue. Labor has put forward some sensible policies that have been supported by independent analysts demonstrating that those policies will make a difference to housing prices. Yet this government refuses to concede what is an obvious and glaring contributor to the high prices in this country by refusing to tackle the negative gearing associated with investment in housing. And it refuses to do anything about the discounts that apply to capital gains tax when people do invest in housing. There are better measures than this, and the government should have the courage to face up to them and do what it knows is right. Ms OWENS (Parramatta) (13:00): I rise today to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Reducing Pressure on Housing Affordability Measures No. 1) Bill 2017 and the First Home Super Saver Tax Bill 2017. Housing affordability matters in communities all across Australia and in my community surrounding Parramatta. It's raised with me by parents and by young people, perhaps more than any other subject, when I'm out in shopping centres and out doorknocking. Housing affordability matters. This government, in its fifth year now, has finally been dragged kicking and screaming to the table to do something-anything-on housing affordability. We've heard them in recent years say 'get your parents to help out', as if buying a $1.2 million median-priced property in Parramatta would be in the range of most parents in Parramatta, let alone their children. I've heard in this debate in the last few days members opposite talking about the problem for young people getting into housing being getting a deposit. How out of touch is that? Really, homeownership is at a 60-year low. Homeownership by 25to 34-year-olds has collapsed from 60 per cent to less than 40 per cent in 30 years. Prices have accelerated far more than wages, and that acceleration in prices has been driven largely by tax concessions that are paid for by the rest of the community. This response to what is a crisis-late as it is, in the government's fifth year-is rather pathetic. There are two measures here on the table. The first, the First Home Super Saver Scheme, allows individuals who are saving for their first home to take advantage of the concessional taxation arrangements that apply to the superannuation system. Under the First Home Super Saver Scheme, first home savers who make voluntary contributions to their superannuation account can withdraw those contributions up to certain limits and under certain conditions. We on this side of the House have been staunch allies of compulsory super since it was first introduced by a Labor government decades ago. We have defended itMr Snowdon: It was opposed by them. Ms OWENS: It was opposed by the opposition, I am well reminded, thank you-by the opposition of the day, the current government. We have fought to protect superannuation ever since, and here we are once again defending Australia's great superannuation system against a government that really doesn't have great affection for it. They have slowed down the increase in contributions. Contributions should have been going up by 9½ or 10 per cent. They have now slowed that down, or paused that. And here the government are now suggesting that people should be able to dip into their super to buy a home. What that does is two things. It increases demand. Fighting accelerating prices with another tax concession would be risky at any time, but actually allowing people to dip into their super-which in later years will reduce their retirement savings-is foolish. It pushes the problem further down the road. We oppose it. The second measure is one we would be willing to talk about, which is about allowing seniors to use the proceeds in relation to the sale of their main residence to make contributions of up to $300,000 to their superannuation provider, provided they're over 65 years of age. We'd be prepared to talk about that because we actually introduced a pilot scheme that allowed seniors to downsize, when we were in government just over four years ago. The government that was elected under former Prime Minister Tony Abbott scrapped that. Here they are back again with an idea that is similar-not the same. We don't believe it's as effective, but we would be prepared to talk about it if the government was prepared to separate these two measures rather than bundle them together, because we will not support allowing people to dip into their superannuation for the purchase of a property. I know that, on the government side, they think it's a good idea, because they believe that the deposit is the problem. I want to talk through some of the figures for Parramatta, just to try to point out to them exactly how out of touch they are. In Parramatta the median price for a home has now reached $1.2 million. Parramatta is the heart of Sydney. It's the middle of the west. The median rent is now over $500 a week, and the growth has been 17.3 per cent. That means that every year the increase in the value of a property is $21,675, which means that, if you are saving for a deposit, for every year of the price increase of the house, you need an extra $4,335 on the deposit you were saving for. Not only are we talking about $240,000 for a deposit of 20 per cent for the median house in Parramatta but we're also talking about that deposit going up by nearly $4,500 every year, because of the increase in prices. Parramatta is not a particularly poor area. Only 15 per cent of the population in my electorate are in a lowsocioeconomic group. Very few people in Parramatta can afford the median house price of $1.2 million, particularly those that work there. Over 80 per cent of people that work in Parramatta come in from elsewhere. They come in from an hour further out to work in Parramatta-incredible distances to travel to work. I want to stop there and talk a little bit about why housing affordability matters. It's not just about owning a house or security in retirement. I don't want to talk about the good old days, but there were aspects in past decades which produced benefits for a community and which we're losing because of changes in the way our communities operate. Back in the days when we had full-time work, large companies that employed large numbers of people in a community, local media and local ways of meeting with each other, and people lived and worked in the same suburb that their parents lived and worked in, there was a baby in that bath. We've lost the bath in many ways, but the baby was the social cohesion. People knew their community well. They lived near their parents. They lived near their grandparents. They knew the parents of the kids that went to school with their children. They knew each other. They met after work. They built relationships which supported families through good and bad times. When a partner went back to work, people in the area assisted with looking after the kids. There was a cohesion. Small country towns still have it. In a few suburbs of Sydney occasionally you'll find small pockets where it still exists, largely because those pockets didn't boom and are still as they were. As the boom times came through, the price of housing went up so much and people had to live further and further away from their parents and where they worked, we lost this important cohesion. When we talk about housing affordability, we're not just talking about people buying a house 1½ hours away from where they work or from their family; we're talking about having communities in which people can live and work in the same communities, close to their family support structures. If you do that, a whole range of other social issues are alleviated by the community connections that protect people in their worse of times. The neighbour that has lived beside you for 50 years is there for you when you're 85. Again, I've seen even unit blocks where the residents have been consistent over time and where, as people age in place, there are support systems for them. If we don't deal with housing affordability in a very real way, not just in the ability to buy a house but in the ability to buy a house in a community in which you live and work, then we are losing the important part of home ownership, which is that baby: the social cohesion, the connection you get when a community works very well. It is incredibly important that we have this discussion, and it's a great shame to me that, on the other side, this government walked away from so many of Labor's policies when they first came to government. We knew that housing affordability was a problem, as this government should have on the first day they were elected. They should have known about it in opposition and should have watched the policies we had. They did watch them, but when they came in they scrapped them. We had the National Rental Affordability Scheme, which has been praised by many in the community for doing incredibly good work in Parramatta. It provided $622 million over four years from 2008-09 for the development of up to 50,000 affordable rental properties by mid-2012. It was to deliver an additional 50,000 properties onwards, but, of course, it was scrapped. We produced The road home white paper on homelessness and developed national strategies and targets to reduce homelessness. We committed to the Housing Help for Seniors pilot, which was an earlier version of the second part of this billscrapped, of course, by the Abbott government. We provided $6 billion to the states and territories for affordable housing. Those who live in areas like mine will have seen the building that went on in those years of new housing stock. We negotiated the National Partnership on Homelessness, which saw the Australian state and territory governments provide over $1 billion for reducing homelessness. We established the National Housing Supply Council-of course, scrapped. We appointed a dedicated minister for housing and homelessness-again, scrapped and not replaced when this government was elected over four years ago. So the work that was being done in the housing space was undone and then we had four years of nothing and, in fact, denial that it was a problem. The government said it was a problem of a deposit and young people should borrow it from their parents. They ignored this massive-over 17 per cent-rise in housing prices in my community every year. They ignored the absurdity of a person on a median wage being able to buy a median house at $1.2 million. Who is buying them? I don't know. But certainly nobody on the median wage, which sits at $60,000 a year, is buying properties like that. No, they're not. And those who are buying properties are at great risk of interest rate rises. We've heard that recently from the Governor of the Reserve Bank also. We've had a government that's basically cut what was happening and has done very little or nothing in the meantime and has now come up with something that is really quite ineffective at best and, to be honest, damaging. Recently the Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute published a review that found: … there is almost no effort within high-level policy thinking at the federal level that is dedicated to constructing and articulating a systematic conceptual understanding of the links between housing policy objectives, housing policy instruments and mechanisms, and their effect on the economics of housing systems or economic productivity. That is really a damning indictment of a government that's been in power now for four years on an issue that was absolutely obvious when we were in government, which is why we acted on it-to get into government and ignore something this basic in the community! You can't go to a shopping centre or a school or anywhere without finding a parent who will tell you how scared they are that their children will not be able to buy a home or are talking about how they dipped into their retirement savings to provide that possibility for their children, which means, by the way, that as those parents reach retirement age it's more likely the taxpayer will be subsidising their retirement than we would be if housing affordability were not such a major issue. In the couple of minutes I have left, I want to talk about Labor's policy. Before the last election we announced that we would act on negative gearing on new stock. You only have to go to an auction and look at what's happening in areas like Parramatta, where there is so much building going on, to see that the new properties coming onto the market are almost exclusively going to investors. You can see the prices going up and up. You can see properties that are specifically built for investors. They're built for the return. They're built to be negatively geared. They're built for the tax-advantage system we have. And we're not seeing properties coming on to the market in areas like Parramatta that are designed and built for people on the median wage or even twice the median wage. We're just not seeing it. We know that, in order to slow down the speed of the price rises in housing in areas like Sydney, we need to tackle the tax concessions that are turbocharging the housing market, that are driving the massive increases that are putting the price of housing out of the reach of average Australians week after week after week. We need to tackle negative gearing and we need to tackle the concessions on capital gains tax. If at any time in the foreseeable future we want people on the median wage or even double the median wage to be able to afford to buy houses close to where they work and close to where their parents are in our major capital cities, we have to act on those levers because they are putting housing affordability out of the reach of most Australians and every month this government delays on acting on that they make the situation worse. This bill is at best a fig leaf. Housing affordability really matters and this bill will only make the situation worse. Ms SHARKIE (Mayo) (13:15): There is merit in trialling the First Home Super Saver Scheme and the downsizer super contributions provisions. However, we all know that they are not holistic solutions to the housing affordability crisis, and I and my Nick Xenophon Team colleagues call on this government to show greater leadership on the issue of housing affordability. BeforeI talk more broadly about the sheer scale of the housing affordability challenge in Australia, I will briefly mention some of the concerns I have in relation to the First Home Super Saver Scheme. Firstly, most of the benefits under the scheme will accrue to those who are in higher tax brackets, as those in lower tax brackets are unable to obtain the full advantage of the differential in tax paid between their marginal tax rate and the super contributions tax. Secondly, it is a demand-side measure when we do not have a demand-side problem with first home buyers. The problem facing the housing market is a combination of too much demand by investors in existing property and not enough supply. Australia saw the effect that the first home buyer grant had on housing prices-much of the benefit from the grant was simply transferred to the sellers through inflated prices across the market. There is no guarantee that this measure will not simply create the same outcome, although by a more convoluted mechanism. But, as I say, the trial has merit, and NXT reserves its right to come to a final position in the Senate. I would like to talk more broadly about the housing crisis facing Australia. Our homelessness levels are growing and our young adults are now delaying or avoiding having children because they cannot afford to buy a home in which to raise a family. Housing affordability is causing massive distortions, not only economically but socially as well. Having a roof over your head is recognised by social service agencies as one of the four key factors in determining how well a person will negotiate life. It has also rapidly become a factor that divides the haves from the have-nots in Australia-a divide that is growing wider generation by generation. But 'affordable housing' means different things to different people. Sadly this is not an issue just on the eastern seaboard, although I do acknowledge that Sydney and Melbourne are incredibly expensive cities. It is something that affects people right across Australia. There are fewer employment opportunities and lower wages in regional areas, and rental supply is often quite tight. In 2011 the census found that over 105,000 Australians were homeless, a massive increase of 17 per cent since the previous census. That figure is expected to rise when homelessness figures from the 2016 census are released. The St Vincent De Paul Society's recent report The ache for home notes that housing affordability is hitting the poorer sections of our population the hardest, with women over 55 being a group that is over-represented in homelessness statistics. Domestic violence is a piece of the puzzle, with the report noting that this social ill is a factor in 36 per cent of homelessness cases. Indeed, family violence is the leading cause of homelessness in my electorate of Mayo, where we have more people without homes than the state average, at 48 persons per 10,000 compared to 38 per 10,000 across South Australia. But you don't have to come from a violent home to find it hard to break into the housing market. Aided by our taxation and financial systems, richer families with properties are able to bequeath or otherwise help their children get a financial head start in life so they can get a foot in the housing market door. It is a head start that poorer families have no way of matching. With each passing generation, capital continues to be concentrated in a property class, and inequality rises, and the policy measures required to bridge the gap will become more onerous upon government finances. The problem only compounds as the population ages, because, in the past, paying off your own home had been the predominant pathway to financial security, particularly in retirement. Today, too many of our young people cannot afford to buy their first home-not even a bedsit. Worse still, many have given up because the cost of housing is considered so far beyond their reach. In simple terms, the up-front cost of housing for the ordinary Australian has increased from almost three times their household income in 1980 to almost 9½ times their household income in 2016. Homeownership is declining, falling from 57 per cent of adults being homeowners in 2002 to just over 51 per cent in 2014. This decline is more marked among first home owners, with the rate of homeownership dropping from 38.7 per cent in 2002 to 29.2 per cent in 2014. Just recently, the consumer advocate group CHOICE and its partners National Shelter and NATO released the report Unsettled: life in Australia's private rental market. This report showed that in the decade to 2013-14 the number of Australians renting rose from 25 to 31 per cent, nearly 40 per cent of renters are under 35 and half of them have personal incomes of less than $35,000. More than 80 per cent have a no-fixed-term lease or leases that are for 12 months or less, and 20 per cent are on month-to-month rolling leases. This is incredibly instable housing. CHOICE claimed that this was leading to greater insecurity among renters, with half of those surveyed admitting that they were reluctant to exercise their rights, such as asking for household repairs, because they were worried about being blacklisted and they were worried about not being given another extension on their lease. Housing insecurity is a documented factor in entrenched poverty. Low-income private renters are more likely to move frequently, which affects their employment and their social networks. It also affects children's schooling because children are moved from school to school as families try to find an affordable place to live. Where does this all lead? Again, I say that it leads to a growing divide between the haves and the have-nots that is arresting the full development of our country. Some might argue that there have always been haves and havenots and it is not the role of government to intervene. This view presumes an equality of opportunity that doesn't exist. I cannot help but notice that in the generation since 1984, when negative gearing was introduced, we've seen a huge distortion in the housing market. The government intervened in Australia's financial markets then, and it needs to do so again now. What that leadership will look like and what it will take into account in the reality of today's market are yet to be decided. Certainly, there is much discussion by the public on how we can address this. The government most certainly needs to play a greater role than the limited measures before us in these two bills. An increasing number of Australian people are missing out on the social and economic benefits of homeownership, and as a country we are all suffering from their lack of prosperity. This merit has trial, but, as I've said, much more needs to be done, and I look to government to work with the entire parliament to address housing affordability. (Reducing Pressure on Housing Affordability Measures No 1) Bill 2017. As other speakers have outlined and as many of the speakers on this side of the House have mentioned, Labor will be opposing this bill. We know that the dream of owning your own home is pretty much completely out of reach for too many Australians. Workingand middle-class families are being priced out of the housing market. The evidence shows this very clearly. Ownership rates for young people aged between 25 and 34 have tumbled in recent years from 60 per cent to 48 per cent. Just as disturbing is the fact that young people are being forced to take on levels of debt unimaginable just a few decades ago. You'd be forgiven for finding our opposition to this bill surprising, given the name of the bill-the so-called measures to reduce pressure on housing affordability. That name would lead you to believe that the government had recognised the problem and was taking the appropriate action. Why shouldn't we support that? But the devil is in the detail. While this bill purports to address the issue of housing affordability, it does nothing more than pay lip service to one of the greatest issues and challenges facing the Australian economy. We had to wait several months to see this legislation and get across the detail. What we got was nothing more than a collection of half-baked ideas and thought bubbles. Make no mistake: the measures contained in this bill are ineffective and will solve nothing. We were told that the government was going to rescue first home buyers-they were going to come in and be rescuing superheroes. The member for Deakin, Super Sukkar, was going to fly in-he's here todaytheir correct titles. But what did we get? We got thought bubbles and half-baked ideas. The first schedule of this bill, particularly, is one of the most egregious parts of the proposal. It would allow first home savers who make voluntary contributions in the superannuation system to withdraw them up to a certain limit, and an amount of associated earnings, for the purpose of purchasing their first home. The concessional tax treatment would apply to amounts that are withdrawn under the scheme. I understand why this would be tempting to many. But the proposition to undermine the retirement future of Australians not only has the potential to make housing less affordable; it will also compromise the financial security and the dignity in retirement which superannuation has been designed to provide and has been such an effective part of our nation's policies. Let me be clear about this: the Treasurer's superannuation scheme will do nothing to address housing affordability. Superannuation is supposed to be sealed-deposited to generate retirement income-not the plaything of the government of the day to give access to super savings, undermining the very important concept of mandatory accumulation and the promotion of compound earnings. This shouldn't be touched or tampered with for whatever priority they have on that particular day or to get themselves out of trouble. It was Labor who built that world-class superannuation system all those years so, against opposition from the other side. We won't stand idly by while this government tries to tear it apart.

They carped and criticised at its introduction under the Hawke-Keating government and they have been attacking it ever since. It's in that Liberal-National coalition DNA to attack the great initiatives that Labor has put in place over this nation's history. Indeed, those opposite loathe Medicare as much as they resent universal superannuation. SoI echo the calls of previous speakers and ask the Senate to reject this measure and send a clear message to the Turnbull government that it's time to get real on housing affordability. The failure of this government on housing affordability is being felt by so many people across my electorate, where property prices are skyrocketing. According to the CoreLogic report commissioned by the Real Estate Institute of Victoria, the median house price in the suburb of Brunswick in my electorate is $1.1 million-$1,110,000. Until last weekend I lived in that very suburb, in Brunswick. I have to confess that I have a personal interest in this issue, as so many other millions of Australians have. My family and I were renting our home in Brunswick. Our landlord decided to put the property on the market and we were told we had 60 days to find a new place to live. Life as an MP, as we all know on all sides here, is very difficult with a young family. I thought, rather than going house hunting I will see what they want for this property. It doesn't really leave us a lot of time for house hunting when we have to fly to Canberra all the time. We tried to buy the house, or rather asked them what they wanted for it. When I was told the asking price, my jaw literally hit the floor. We make a good salary in this place; but they were asking for somewhere around $2 million for a small three-bedroom house in the suburb of Brunswick. There is no way we could afford that. We loved that home and we loved Brunswick as a suburb, but I can assure you that was far from a palatial home that we were living in, that we were renting. We are fortunate enough to earn a good salary, yet we found the prospect of buying an ordinary home in our area obscenely unaffordable. This is the experience of millions of Australians around the country in the struggle that they go through. SoI understand better than most on the other side the struggle that many Australians have who are trying to achieve the dream of homeownership. Labor has led on this with its policies to reform negative gearing and the capital gains tax discount. Those policies were immensely well received by the electorate, and for good reason. They are likely to work and are likely to deliver real outcomes for people trying to enter the housing market. They say that no party has a monopoly on good ideas but, make no mistake, this policy lever is available to the government. They can do this; they can adopt the reforms. with standing order 43.

She's been on the pill since she was 12. She said: Doctors would judge me and make insidious comments about my sexuality. I wish Australian students and women were educated about the disease and spoke openly about the mental and emotional implications associated with endo. From Caitlin: This hidden disease has turned my body into a torture chamber that has impacted my ability to be a leader. Often, I am incapacitated for one or two weeks a month and require hospitalisation or codeine to reduce the pain, which in most cases doesn't work. Every day, one in 10 women live with this disease, and many unknowingly go through their lives without help because they've been told to 'suck it up'. We've got to end the silence on this, and we've got to end it now. Finally, I want to acknowledge Caitlin Figueiredo, who wrote this speech, and-like most women on the Plan International scheme-doesn't take any credit for it. Also, Watawieh to Norfolk Island primary school. Welcome to Canberra! Forrest Electorate: Margaret River Regional Business Awards 2017 Ms MARINO (Forrest-Chief Government Whip) (13:31): Congratulations to the Margaret River Chamber of Commerce and Industry on their 2017 business awards. This acknowledges outstanding achievements by small business. Over 200 people attended the night; we had beautiful service from the Margaret River TAFE hospitality students. The crowd was wowed by performances by Freespirit, Trapeze, Volare, Wildstar and the Margaret River high school jazz band. They do a great job. Congratulations to the following winners: Big Valley Campsite had two wins; Nudge Psychological Assessment and Consulting; Ocean Grown Abalone; Margaret River Cracker Company; Chic Rustique; Arrows; Rustico at Hay Shed Hill; Margaret River Hemp Co.; The Beer Farm; Margaret River Surf School, which won the People's Choice award; and Margaret River Cracker Company, which won the Rising Star award. There were three special awards to the Cape to Cape Explorer Tours, which also received the Business of the Year award. This involves some funding from the Shire of Margaret River in their award. I commend all of the winners to the House but would particularly like to acknowledge the great work done by those Margaret River TAFE students. Their service is outstanding; they take it very, very seriously. Each year I go, I compliment them on what they do to make that evening such a success. Broadband Mullumbimby in my electorate of Richmond. I would like to thank the shadow minister for regional communications, the member for Whitlam, for attending the forum and listening first hand to the concerns of my constituents. Many residents from Mullumbimby and the surrounding area came along to express their frustration and dissatisfaction with the NBN and with the Turnbull government's appalling record when it comes to the rollout. I convened the meeting because I had been contacted by so many locals with complaints about the NBN. These complaints include the huge blowout in rollout times, the lack of",80,Statements By Members
23,Mrs Elliot (Richmond) (13:33,"Recently, I held an NBN crisis meeting inaccess, the slow and poor quality connection, the lack of communication between NBN Co and providers, and, of course, the usage of second-rate copper for the NBN. Indeed, some locals even have the continuing problem of paying for a service that is not yet connected or a service that runs on slower speeds than they've been promised. Also, as of August 2017, 40,000 premises in Richmond have no NBN connection, and some residents, including those in Ballina, are not set for completion until 2019. People tell me they are missing out on a vital service and business as a result of poor or non-existent telecommunications. Young people are unable to complete basic work for their primary, secondary and tertiary commitments as a result of poor downloads, slow speeds and constant dropouts. And in regional areas like mine there's great concern for the elderly and those with disabilities, who have limited or no access to crucial communications when they need them. This is unacceptable, and it's completely due to the Turnbull Liberal-Nationals government's poor rollout of the NBN, and it's not good enough. (Time expired) Barker Electorate: Mount Gambier Chamber of Commerce Awards Commerce annual Gala Awards Night, at which winners of the 2017 Mount Gambier Chamber of Commerce Outstanding Business Awards were announced. The Mount Gambier Chamber of Commerce strives to improve business within Mount Gambier. It's a fantastic organisation. It holds breakfasts and networking events across the year. Mount Gambier has some of the most amazing entrepreneurial talent, which was made clear on Friday night, when the very best and brightest were on show. A big shout-out to the president and vice-president of the chamber, Lyn Martin and Ben Hood, for their organisation of the event. But the real stars of the night were of course the award winners, and in the time. I've got left I'd like to mention them. Employee of the Year is Mick O'Donohoe of Avis Car Rental. Not only is he a great employee but he's the father of seven and a foster carer for four-an amazing man. Young Business Person of the Year is Georgia Quick. The environment and sustainability award went to the environmental team at Tenison Woods College. The new business award went to Key2 Sale. The building and manufacturing award went to Adam Fosdike at Mates Rates Mount Gambier. The tourism, hospitality and accommodation award went to the Old Mount Gambier Gaol-to Jamie and Mel Stephenson at that facility. Mark and Casey Allen at Sonic Vision got the business service award, and the agribusiness award went to the Splendid Egg group. The small business award went to Morris Dickins of Dickins' Delights. Grow Systems Australia took out the innovation award, and the retail business award went to Mel Von Stanke and the team at Vanity hair and make-up. (Time expired) Girls Take Over Parliament Ms OWENS (Parramatta) (13:36): Last Wednesday was International Day of the Girl, a day to celebrate girls and encourage their leadership potential. In that spirit, today 17 young women have taken over parliament as part of the international girls' parliamentary takeover. Yep, today they experience a day in the life of a politician, a wonderful opportunity for these young women to see that their parliamentary aspirations are attainable. Taking over my office today and having written this speech is Isabelle Franklin, a young woman studying neuroscience and law at the Australian National University and currently completing her honours thesis on gender equality in the law. She is here with me today to provide insight into",81,Statements By Members
24,Mr Pasin (Barker) (13:34,"Last Friday night I attended the Mount Gambier Chamber of the report released by Plan International Australia just this morning and to highlight their recommendations for a more gender-equal future. The She can lead report gives really quite shocking insights into how girls' leadership aspirations diminish as they become older. Fewer young women than men aspire to leadership. Shockingly, the report reveals that half of young women in Australia believe that their gender is the biggest factor holding them back from becoming leaders. Plan Australia is calling for a gender-equal federal election in 2018-19, and the Australian Labor Party's gender figures are living proof that targets work. The She can lead report is a call to action to all those in power-in media, in business, in politics-to stand with girls and help create the change they want to see. Thanks, Plan International Australia, for creating this opportunityand go, Isabelle! Space Exploration Ms PRICE (Durack) (13:38): I rise to acknowledge the government's recent announcement of the creation of a national space agency. Australians have a long history as explorers and adventurers, and this announcement fits perfectly with that proud tradition. Looking around Australia, I believe there is no place better suited for the future Australian space agency than my electorate of Durack. You would be hard pressed to find any region in Australia with such a high concentration of satellite ground stations or with as much expertise in the field as is found in the mid-west. We've demonstrated that we have the capacity to support this industry, and we also have the rolled-gold NBN in Geraldton to support such an agency. We also have the Square Kilometre Array project in the Murchison, which is a nextgen mega-telescope. Within the mid-west we have the Universal Space Network ground station, the European Space Agency Deep Space Earth Station, the Swedish Space Corporation Ground Station and the Australian Defence Space Communication Station. Neil Armstrong's first steps on the moon were relayed through the tracking station in Carnarvon in my electorate, which is still part of the Birmingham Solar Oscillations Network. The Australian space agency is indeed an exciting step forward for our nation, and I hope Durack will expand its important role in all things space. Workplace Relations Ms TEMPLEMAN (Macquarie) (13:39): When I started working in the media in the 1980s, in commercial radio, it was a given that as a woman I ultimately should not expect to be paid as much as a man. To me as a junior press gallery journalist, it was pretty clear that the high-profile blokes got the big bucks and that women came second. It wasn't just that the upgrades through the cadet system wouldn't be as fast; it was also that women would get allocated to do all the soft stories, the fluffy stories, the colour stories. If there was an announcement on the economy, there'd be a whole lot more men at the news conference than for an announcement on education policy. As a consequence I've met the Queen, Prince Charles and Princess Diana. I'm not sure that we've come very far in the 30 years in between. The latest gender pay gap report by Women in Media, an initiative of my union, the MEAA, gives example after example of gender inequality. Only two per cent of those surveyed thought that there was parity. This is reflected across so many sectors. The gender pay gap in ASX 200 companies is 28.7 per cent. Of course there are exceptions, but they don't change the facts that most women face. I applaud Lisa Wilkinson for not being afraid to walk away from inequality and to call it out. High-profile women have to take a stand on this so other women feel they even have a right to demand equality. Grey Electorate: Crystal Brook Primary School opportunity to congratulate the Crystal Book Primary School on winning two prizes in the 2017 ANZAC Day Schools' Awards. The school has displayed great initiative and creativity in the way it commemorates ANZAC Day, helping students to understand more deeply the significance of our wartime history and the sacrifices of those who served. Crystal Brook is a beautiful little town on the southern edge of the Flinders Ranges, and the primary school has 186 students, so it's a reasonable size and a very successful school. A group of upper primary school students created the ANZAC committee to focus on remembering the local fallen in World WarI and ANZAC Day commemorations. The coordinator, Davina Bellman, said she was delighted the school had been recognised in the awards for the second time. These students spent many lunchtimes researching the history of the ANZACs and the Gallipoli campaign. From this they established a list of 31 local fallen soldiers from World WarI and gathered photographs of most of them. The committee decided to create a memorial garden where the names of the local fallen would be on an engraved path. It's a place of remembrance, and a place for the school and the students to reflect. I congratulate them on winning the award and on their commitment to making sure that we never forget the service of those who have gone before. Girls Take Over Parliament Ms SHARKIE (Mayo) (13:42): TodayI join a global movement for girls' leadership. Across the world, more than a thousand girls and young women are being promoted to positions of power for a day. Here in Australia 17 young women are stepping into the shoes of members of parliament. The takeover was organised by Plan International Australia in celebration of International Day of the Girl and in support of women in politics. My office has been taken over by Asha Clementi, an 18-year-old high school student from Canberra, who is passionate about politics and empowering young women. The Plan International She can lead report that was released today found that 0.3 per cent of young women-just one in 297aspire to be politicians. This is truly unacceptable. Women need to be encouraged to go into politics and taught that they have a right to be in this place and on the front bench. Nearly half of the young women surveyed felt there were not enough opportunities for them to become politicians, and one in three young women felt that gender was a barrier to them. I encourage every member of this House to support young women's political aspirations and encourage their participation in democracy. Asha, thank you for writing this speech today. Thank you for being part of my team, and good luck with your year 12 exams that start next week. In the words of Hillary Clinton: … to all the little girls who are watching this: never doubt that you are valuable and powerful and deserving of every chance and opportunity in the world to pursue and achieve your own dreams.",82,Statements By Members
25,Mr Ramsey (Grey,"Government Whip) (13:41): I'm very pleased to take thisDonohoe, Sam member of the Gold Coast community, Sam Donohoe. Sam is a courageous 11-year-old boy who has shown great leadership in the face of substantial adversity. I met with Sam and his family recently to present Sam with a leadership medal and a certificate. Sam is fighting every day to conquer the challenges that come with having a seven-centimetre brain tumour. Through this challenge Sam inspires immense love amongst members of our local community. The greatest demonstration of this comes from his parents, Jenny and Steve, and his sister, Indi, who I had the great privilege to meet along with Sam to celebrate his achievements. Sam also motivates great acts of grace and compassion within his local school community, St Francis Xavier Catholic Primary School in Runaway Bay. I would particularly like to thank the principal, Kathy Fuller, for her tremendous support of Sam and his family, and, likewise, the Hope Island Resort Fitness Centre for all of its great support of Sam. Few people will ever measure up, in my view, to the levels of courage and bravery demonstrated by young 11-year-old Sam. I'm truly humbled by this young man. Sam deserves a place in the annals of our great parliamentary history for his sheer courage in the face of adversity. He's a true leader, an artist, a runner, and a reminder to us all about what's really important in life. On behalf of my community, I commend Sam Donohoe and his compelling story to this parliament. We proclaim him a great leader. Sam, Jenny, Steve and Indi, we will always hold you in our thoughts and prayers. Gender Equality Ms RYAN (Lalor-Opposition Whip) (13:45): It's interesting to note today the number of women on this side of the chamber who are talking about the Girls Take Over Parliament event. It's interesting that the women are talking about it, and it's also interesting that the women let the girls take over-surprise, surprise! I rise today to shine a light on the gender pay gap between men and women in this country. Lisa Wilkinson's actions this week have shone a very clear light on this issue, and for that I thank her. It is really important that we as a country address this issue. In the world I come from in education, we have a couple of truisms that we work with. One is that we measure what we care about. We measure what we care about so that we can set targets to improve. Yet, in Australia, only 27 per cent of employers have conducted gender pay gap analysis. Until the companies in this country demonstrate that they care about the gender pay gap by measuring it, we will get no firm action and no firm commitment. If we are serious about this issue, we will stop, we will measure it and we will set targets to improve this. I would like to say all the girls out there: be like Lisa, and close the gender pay gap. Gilmore Electorate fundraised and celebrated. Firstly, the Country Women's Association of Milton District celebrated 70 years.

Nowra Hill Public School celebrated their 150-year anniversary and hundreds attended their fair and colour run. There were games, petting zoos and all sorts of things, but the most important was dunking Mr Parrish! I did face painting with the magnificent McDonald's South Nowra crew to raise money for McHappy Day. They had a tutu theme-I didn't wear one! They were joined by the local radio station, 94.9 Power FM. Thanks to all the team for helping our community in every single way. Saturday night was the traditional cancer fundraiser Light the Night at the Sussex Inlet RSL Club. The event is held every year to support the Leukaemia Foundation and sufferers of cancer and their carers. The room was filled with pink wigs and costumes-I did wear a pink wig! Well done to Wilga Crehan and the Cancer Support Group for a great night, and thank you to Todd, as always, for being the emcee.

Lisa Wilkinson has got the issue of the gender pay gap on the front page of the newspapers, and I'm so excited for that. She's raised an issue that is very relevant to her at the top of the labour market. But we know, when we look at the statistics, that this is an issue that affects women who are at all stages and all levels of their careers. We live in a country today that thinks of itself as being very equal. But, when we look at the numbers, what we see is something quite different-that is that there is a full 16 per cent difference in the average pay of men and women in this country. That averages out to about a $13,000-a-year difference. This is a very significant issue facing the country. We heard from a government body earlier this year, in a parliamentary committee, about the belief that this gender pay gap may close in about 50 years. There are girls sitting up here in the public gallery today, and I want them to know that Labor takes this issue incredibly seriously. We were very pleased to have our Labor leader talking on this issue yesterday. We have heard a deafening silence from those on the other side of the House today on this important issue, and I have to say that they have got some gender issues to address in their party room: 20 per cent of their members of parliament are women. It's not good enough-and that's another problem we need to address. Forde Electorate: Senior Citizens tribute to the seniors in the community of Forde. It was a great delight that, at our Beenleigh Senior Citizens Centre last month, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull toured their new facilities. Funded with a $90,000 grant from the federal government, the centre has recently upgraded its kitchen and Meals on Wheels office space to help streamline this vital service to many local families in need. During the visit, the Prime Minister and I also presented the centre with a $10,000 grant to update its IT facilities. This was also gratefully received.",85,Statements By Members

I always enjoy the robust Q&A at the end of this event, and this year was no exception. Perhaps as expected, energy was the topic of the day, with many local residents keen to know what the government was doing not just to lower electricity prices now but also to strengthen the sector for future generations. I'm very pleased to say that we announced yesterday a comprehensive plan that will ensure that we work towards achieving these goals for the constituents of Forde and people right across Australia. Girls Take Over Parliament Dr LEIGH (Fenner) (13:51): Today marks the world's largest girls takeover event-an event which I'm proud and delighted to be part of. Working with me in my office today is Yasmin Hassen-a woman who is studying her PhD at the Australian National University's Crawford School and has been working with me in parliament. Women and girls are taking over parliaments throughout the world, from Canada to Peru to Australia. It recognises that we all need to do more to champion successful women in Australia. The share of women on Australian boards is only 19 per cent, up from eight per cent in 2010 but still lower than it should be. The share of women in parliament is still less than a third: 44 per cent on the Labor side and some 20 per cent on the coalition side. We have a gender pay gap in Australia of 15 per cent-too wide. We need to do more to build gender equity in Australia, but we also need to champion great Australian women, to recognise the successes of women such as Liane Moriarty, Elysse Perry, Marianna Tolo and Lisa Di Vanna, as well as innovators such as Ellie Watson, Angela Vithoulkas, Kristy Chong, Katy Barfield and Felicity Zadro. Australian women are changing the world, and the Girls Take Over Parliament event is an important insight for me and my office. I thank Yasmin and her colleagues for all they are doing today. Bonner Electorate: Lindum Station Level Crossing electorate who have had to deal with the notorious Lindum Station level crossing for too along now. I need your help to gather as many signatures as possible for a community petition in support of an overpass for Lindum Station. Yes, it has been promised before. For years, we have had finger-pointing about the blind spot and the all-round terrible design of the Lindum, North and Sibley roads intersection. Many promises have been made but have fallen short at each level of government. It's time we put aside politics and got an overpass built. There's strong support in the community for a solution. In my time as a member, I have lost count of the number of accidents and near misses I have heard about at the crossing. In my latest Biggest Survey, an overwhelming number of people called for an overpass. My community petition calls for three levels of government to work together to fund this vital project. I know it is possible. To local residents and businesses listening: adding your voice to the chorus will help make things happen. If you can get others to sign the petition as well, even better. I'd love to hear from those wanting to help. Please contact my office for copies of the petition to hand out. Together, we can fix the station crossing once and for all.",86,Statements By Members
29,Mr Vasta (Bonner) (13:53,"Today I'm asking for help. I need help from locals in myPrime Minister power bills, but we all know that the only bloke he really cares about is himself. If there are blackouts this summer, don't worry about the Prime Minister in his harbourside mansion. The champagne is still going be cold, the oysters will be on ice and the pool will probably still be heating. That's because he spent thousands and thousands of dollars putting in his own solar power system. There are reports that it's so big it generates three times as much electricity as is consumed by the average Australian home. Did he get subsidies from the government for this? How much did the taxpayers pay to keep Point Piper pumping? This Prime Minister just doesn't get it. He's never had to struggle to pay a power bill. He'll never get it, because he can't get it. Today he was asked how much his power bill is and he couldn't answer! There's a reason for this-he's probably never opened the envelope because it's not an issue for him. Regular people can't afford to be as relaxed as the Prime Minister when it comes to their energy bill; while the Prime Minister is sleeping soundly at night, power bills are keeping them up. He is the most out of touch Prime Minister in Australia's history and he'll never understand the issues that Australian families are facing. Fisher Electorate: Kawana Waters State College State College, in my electorate of Fisher, and see their new health education unit in action. The unit is an impressive example of how a secondary school can combine traditional, handson experience with digital technology to create a powerful learning experience. The health unit includes a full simulation of a hospital ward, where students get experience using the standard equipment they'll find in their future work environment. While working closely with real hospital beds, heart rate monitors, syringes and drips, the students also have access to tablet computers and other digital aids that support learning and create a more sophisticated simulation. The health education unit has been operational since June and already has 50 students studying Certificate II and Certificate III in Basic Health Care. By 2018 there will be 120 students using the facility, including students from other Sunshine Coast schools. Kawana Waters State College partners with Sunshine Coast Technical Trade Training Centre and has links with Sunshine Coast University Hospital. These kinds of partnerships and innovative training facilities represent an exemplary model of what we need to prepare today's year 11 and year 12 students for their future careers. I thank Principal Colin AllenWaters and Cindy Steele for showing me around and I congratulate them on this great initiative.

Robertson Electorate: Roads their desire to see better, safer roads in our community, and this was evident last Saturday when, despite the pouring rain and the wind, dozens of local residents joined me at Wamberal surf club for a community barbecue to discuss newly announced safety upgrades at Willoughby Road. Last year, the coast was devastated after 17-year-old Jackson Williams was killed on Willoughby Road at the notorious dip. Following a community led petition of more than 5,000 signatures, which I presented in this place, we secured more than $500,000 from the New South Wales government for safety upgrades. I'd like to pay tribute to the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport; to Adam Crouch, the member for Terrigal; to Michelle Williams, and Mark Williams; and to Lindy Hewitt, a local resident, for their work on the issue. While this is an important first step, at our community barbecue I also heard from other locals who have additional concerns. Kate told me that pedestrian access on Willoughby Road was a huge issue, particularly for mums with prams, and she said that the road desperately needs a footpath. Leanne, an avid cyclist, told me it can be just as bad for those on bikes. Others raised the possibility of the installation of speed cameras and guardrails. The thing I was struck by was the passion our community have for this issue and their determination to make our roads safer. As a result of the community meeting, RMS representatives have agreed to meet with Wamberal residents at a roundtable next month. I'd love to hear from anyone who would like to join us at that roundtable. Thank you to each and every resident of Wamberal who joined us on the weekend.

Can the Prime Minister confirm that the government has not modelled its impact on business, has not modelled its impact on renewable energy jobs, has not modelled its impact on the broader economy and has not modelled its impact on households? Why should Australians believe anything that this Prime Minister says about a lousy 50c saving in people's power bills? Opposition stood in front of some solar panels. For a little while he was talking sense, and then a beam of sunlight struck the panel and he was transformed, not into a werewolf but into an economic fantasist. He said, 'Renewable energy is getting cheaper and will continue to do so.' He did. He said, 'It's correct to say we've been moving down the renewable energy path and we're seeing the benefits.' And then he said, 'It needs to be subsidised.' This is the bit that we're struggling to understand. His comrade in arms, defying economics, was the member for Sydney. She's even more emphatic. She said to Kieran Gilbert that renewables are becoming cheaper all the time and are already cheaper than coal. Kieran Gilbert was not asking an unreasonable question when he said, 'So why subsidise it?' Fairly obvious! She said, 'It's not about subsidies; it's about certainty.' This is the Labor Party: 'It's about certainty.' I'll tell you what the certainty is: $66 billion of costs loaded onto Australian families and Australian businesses in order to subsidise technologies that are already the cheapest alternative, according to the Labor Party. If Labor were remotely fair dinkum or consistent about this, they would welcome the level playing field our Energy Guarantee offers-the level playing field! There are two constraints in the Energy Guarantee plan recommended by the Energy Security Board. One is to keep the lights on. Most people regard that as a very high priority-not the Labor Party, obviously. We do. The other one is to ensure that you meet your Paris commitments. That's very important, too. And then you've got to do so in the least-cost manner. That's the triple bottom line. That's what the Energy Security Board has recommended-a plan to deliver. It's about time Labor started becoming consistent and principled and rational and supported the advice of the experts.

Audrey Zibelman was the energy market operator in New York. And then, of course, you have Paula Conboy, who was a regulator in Ontario. This group of people, assembled expertise, was put together as recommended by Alan Finkel, and we went to them for advice. And this is the advice we got: what this will deliver is cheaper electricity, lower wholesale costs, savings for households and reliability. That's the triple bottom line we're delivering. It's the triple bottom line Labor is destroying and defying. They failed. We've got the answers here from the ESB; Labor should adopt them.

They have no conception of the engineering and the economics that we need to deliver a reliable and affordable energy plan. As for Dr Schott, I can say to the Labor Party: Eddie Obeid couldn't intimidate her and neither can any of his friends opposite. Kerry Schott is one of the finest public servants in this country. This is what she said: 'The guarantee is about providing a reliable power system and meeting the emissions targets set in the Paris Agreement. What will happen when those mechanisms are put in place is that prices are likely to come down and they're likely to keep coming down.' That is exactly the same advice that we received in the letter from the Energy Security Board-the experts that we've been called on to listen to and take advice from. What did they say? They said: 'Wholesale prices are expected to decline by 20 to 25 per cent over the same period-from 2020 to 2030-and that could lead to a reduction in residential bills in the order of $100 to $115 per annum. Compared to the clean energy target as specified in the Finkel review, this guarantee can be expected to lead to wholesale prices that are on average eight to 10 per cent lower over the 2020 to 2030 period.' We've seen the Leader of the Opposition morph from a plausibly rational person to being completely irrational and saying that the cheapest energy source needs to be subsidised. That is unusual. That is 'Shortenomics'; it really is! We'd like to see a bit more of the nice Leader of the Opposition, the genial, bipartisan one who wrote to me and said: The most effective policy for investment certainty in the energy sector is bipartisanship. … … … … we believe it is time to put an end to the 'climate wars' … … … … … Labor calls on the Government to work with us in a bipartisan approach … Well, we have a recommendation from a bipartisan appointed expert(Time expired) Energy Will the Treasurer advise the House on the action the government has taken to provide certainty for investment in Australia, including in our energy sector, by guaranteeing an affordable, reliable energy supply for hard working families and businesses?

In the budget we said yes. We said yes to $75 billion in nation-building infrastructure investment to drive investment, whereas the Labor Party continue to say no. They said no to the East West Link. They said no to WestConnex. They've even said no today to the extension in southern Sydney. They've said no to their own electorates, like the shadow Treasurer did on the Western Sydney Airport being in Fairfield. They are saying no to these projects. We said yes to cutting taxes for the small and medium sized businesses-and legislated to do that-that now cover half of the Australian labour force. The Labor Party said no to cutting those taxes-they're saying no to ensuring that Australian businesses have a competitive tax rate right across the board. That's necessary because of taxes being cut in France, in the United Kingdom, in the United States and also in China, where they're looking to do the same thing. In the budget we said yes to all of these initiatives to drive investment. Yesterday we said yes to providing certainty for investment in boosting energy supply through the National Energy Guarantee that will make power more affordable and more reliable and achieve our environmental commitments. Business and industry have said yes to that. Economists have said yes to that. The Chief Scientist has said yes to the National Energy Guarantee. What have Labor done again? Labor have said no. Labor have no plans for investment certainty. They only have a plan to say no on every single occasion, as this government works to drive investment that supports jobs, that supports certainty, that supports higher paid jobs and that supports a growing economy. What they do is look for any excuse to say no-any and every excuse. They will sink to seeking to discredit and bully even an Energy Security Board with people appointed by Labor state governments on it. We've seen them in interview after interview seeking to undermine those independently appointed members of that boardseeking to bully and intimidate like the unions whose behaviour they defend and protect in this place every single day. The recipe from those opposite is higher taxes and higher subsidies-$66 million in higher costs for Australian business and consumers, which means less investment. (Time expired) Energy Prime Minister. Last night on Lateline, Kerry Schott stated: I don't think anybody can guarantee a price reduction. Was the Chair of the Energy Security Board correct? Security Board has accurately described the advice that she has given, which is that a consequence of having a level playing field-combining climate and energy policy and getting rid of the subsidies-is likely to result in a 20 to 25 per cent reduction in wholesale prices. I quote from the board's letter: 'Wholesale prices are expected to decline by 20 to 25 per cent per annum over the same period.' The pathetic thing about the opposition in this field today is that they have called repeatedly for us to take the advice of experts.

What she said on Lateline is absolutely correct and what honourable members opposite know is the case. The fact of the matter is this: as she said, and as we know, there are many impacts on a household's electricity bill. Wholesale prices are one important factor. But there's also the matter of the price of fuel, which is not affected by this policy. There is the price of gas. What did Labor do to gas? They sent the price through the roof through not protecting domestic demand. What have we done? We've brought the price of gas down by ensuring that Australians are protected and can get the gas they need. Another big factor, too, is the cost of networks. That is not affected by the Energy Guarantee; it's a separate issue. That is being attacked by the abolition of the limited merits review, now through the parliament. The reality is, as Rod Sims said, as Kerry Schott said, as John Pierce has said, and as we all know-except those in this parallel universe of ideology and political stupidity opposite-energy prices are affected by many measures. This National Energy Guarantee will deliver lower wholesale prices than any alternative, and that's what Australians need-reliability, affordability and responsibility We have a plan.

How does this compare to the risks associated with the alternative approaches? thank the member for Chisholm for her question and acknowledge her deep interest in and concern about the energy sector and rising power prices and the importance of taking action on a number of fronts to reduce the pressure on family electricity bills. The Turnbull government's been taking action on a number of fronts, including in reining in the power of networks, in ensuring a better deal for families from the retailers and in ensuring that Australians get access to gas before it is shipped overseas. Our announcement of the National Energy Guarantee is a credible, workable, pro-market policy that will deliver lower power prices for Australians and a more reliable system. Unlike the policies proposed by those opposite, this involves no taxes, no subsidies and no emissions trading schemes. It will see, on the basis of the advice and analysis of the Energy Security Board, savings of up to $115 per annum for an average Australian household. Since the announcement by the Turnbull government, there's been enormous widespread support, including from Australia's largest manufacturer, BlueScope Steel. Paul O'Malley said, 'It turns the game around,' 'It re-tilts the playing field,' and 'It's fair'. Australia's Chief Scientist Alan Finkel said it's a 'credible mechanism'. That is from the country's most authoritative voice in energy matters. AGL described it as an 'important step'. Energy Australia said it was a 'serious proposal'. Origin said, 'We look forward to working with the government and energy market bodies to progress it.' Energy Networks Australia welcomed it. The Grattan Institute described it as 'the last piece in the complex jigsaw puzzle of a credible energy and climate change policy', and said it 'should be supported, not only within the Coalition but by Labor, the states, the energy industry and by electricity consumers'. Energy Consumers Australia welcomed it and said it 'integrates the need for reliable power and emissions reductions in the electricity sector, at least cost for consumers'. The BCA, which represents one in ten Australian workers, through the companies, says that it provides 'greater investor confidence than a more complex CET may have'. The Australian Industry Group, which represents more than one million employees, said the plan gives the electricity sector a 'great deal of flexibility'. (Time expired) Energy Prime Minister.

Doesn't this make an absolute mockery of the Prime Minister's so-called guarantee? which the Leader of the Opposition is squirming on this issue. I can understand his embarrassment. Having called for bipartisanship, having called for us to listen to experts, having supported the establishment of the Energy Security Board, then, when these independent experts, authorities in the field, give advice that doesn't suit him politically, he wants to attack them personally. He wants to challenge their integrity. Yesterday, he was having a go at the integrity of the Energy Security Board, muttering to himself. He was; I could hear him muttering away to himself, talking to himself. I think that may well have been the case. He will always get an attentive audience when he does that. What we have is the advice from the Energy Security Board that will deliver affordable and reliable power. What it does is ensure that the Energy Market Operator will not have to be, as it is every other weekend, intervening in the South Australian energy market, calling on expensive gas-fired generation just to keep the lights on because there is not enough dispatchable power in the South Australian market. What this will do is ensure that we have reliable power that is affordable and that we meet our emissions reduction obligations under the Paris agreement. What the experts have done is given us that advice, and we know that that is advice from the most qualified people in the nation. Their establishment was recommended by Alan Finkel. Their recommendations have been welcomed by Alan Finkel, they've been welcomed by the industry and they've been welcomed by distinguished commentators, like Tony Wood of the Grattan Institute. This is seen as the best chance we've had for years to achieve a bipartisan energy policy that will restore investment certainty into the market. I refer honourable members to the Energy Security Board's letter to the government-it is a public document. It says: Under this scheme, the wholesale price would be expected to be lower relative to today and lower compared to a certificate-based scheme. So they've carefully considered the recommendation of the Finkel review for a clean energy target and what they have come up with is a mechanism that works even better, that does a better job on reliability and does the same job of reducing emissions-very importantly.

No, these people understand that we have a plan to bring forward power to make sure the baseload power stays on the system, that the coal-fired power keeps going. Our plan is backed by the National Energy Guarantee, supported by the National Irrigators Council, BlueScope, AGL, Energy Networks Australia, the Grattan Institute, the Australian Industry Group, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Business Council of Australia, the Australian Energy Council and the Energy Users Association of Australia, because they know that this is a diligent plan.

Before coming to office, the Liberals promised Australians their power bills would drop by $550. They didn't. This year, the Prime Minister promised that wholesale gas prices would halve. They haven't. And yesterday it was revealed that the Prime Minister's latest energy policy might only reduce the power bills of Australians by a lousy 50c a week in three years time. Why would the Australian people believe anything this Prime Minister says about energy prices? thank the member for Sydney for her question. I can read from an ACCC report, which says about the abolition of the carbon tax that the Commonwealth Treasury's estimated $550 cost saving to households is reasonable. So there we go-the Labor Party is at it again, telling a mistruth like the one that they have repeated in this House about a $1,000 increase. That goes against the advice of the Australian Energy Regulator and other agencies, and they haven't had the courage to repeat it in this place. We have been very successful not just in abolishing the carbon tax; we have also seen the wholesale spot price for gas come down from about $12 at the beginning of this year to about $7 right now. We have been putting pressure on the Queensland Labor government to rein in CS Energy and Stanwell, who are engaged in uncompetitive bidding practices. As a result of that direction, we have seen wholesale electricity prices in Queensland fall by about 25 per cent. Then, of course, there is the work the Prime Minister did with retailers. I can inform the House that a family of four from Turramurra in Sydney with electricity costs of just under $2,800 a year used the government's Energy Made Easy website to switch suppliers, and as a result they will save around $650 a year. A family with three students were living in St Kilda, in Melbourne, and they had electricity costs of about $1,420 a year. They used the Victorian electricity website and they saved around $230 a year. A family of three living in Ashgrove, in Brisbane, had electricity costs of $2,850 a year, and as a result of the Prime Minister's intervention and promotion of the ability to switch retailers and contracts, they used the government's Energy Made Easy website, they switched suppliers and as a result they will save about $630 a year. Under our proposal, recommended to us by the Energy Security Board, the savings to households will be better than the ones that were promoted by the clean energy target-which the member for Port Adelaide himself described as a second-best option. The Labor Party are isolated. They are standing alone in opposition to the recommendation from the experts. The industry, the big users and the industry organisations have all come around to support this initiative as being one that will deliver reliable, affordable power.

69,Mr Drum (Murray,"Chief Nationals Whip) (14:38): My question is to the Minister for the House on the importance of a reliable and affordable supply of energy to Australia's rural and regional hospitals? member for Murray. Labor loves higher power prices, Labor believes in higher power prices, and their policies at both federal and state level are designed to deliver higher power pricesand that is bad for our hospitals. That is bad for Echuca hospital, which the member for Murray believes in, supports and has been an advocate for throughout his time in parliament. Why is this important? It's important because there are not just two policies but two fundamental approaches here. One side of parliament consistently advocates for higher power prices, and then puts in place policies to drive them up, and one side believes in lower power prices and has taken steps to that effect. For the people of Murray, this matters in the real world, because what we saw at Echuca hospital is the real world. The chief executive said only a month ago that the consequence of the changes in Victoria's power system is a $375,000 a year cost to Echuca hospital. When Hazelwood was deliberately knocked out by the Victorian government, the people of Echuca and the hospital in Echuca paid that price. As the chief executive said: It's significant and it's a serious issue for the whole communityin terms of the power price hikebut in the context of public hospitals it has a material impact on our budget in this current financial year. In other words, Labor policies are deliberately driving up the cost of electricity and the cost of operations for hospitals, not just in Victoria but around the country. By contrast, we abolished the carbon tax and it did drive down electricity prices. We have abolished limited merits review, and that will have an impact. The Prime Minister has specifically worked alongside the energy minister with the gas companies, and the wholesale price of gas has dropped from $12 to $7. Now there is the energy security guarantee for Australia, and that is the next step. All are about bringing down power prices. What we see now, though, is what happens when Labor gets its hands on the levers of power. In Victoria it knocked over the Hazelwood power station. In South Australia it literally blew up the Northern power station. Last time at national level it introduced a carbon tax, and next time it is going to introduce a $66 billion hit on bills for families, on bills for pensioners and on bills for our hospitals. If you believe in the security of our hospital system, you will not believe in Labor's approach to power pricing. It's a threat to pensioners, it's a threat to families, and, above all else, it's a threat to our hospital system. Energy Ms MACKLIN (Jagajaga) (14:41): My question is to the Prime Minister.

One needs only to look directly at the Labor Party's fiscal plan in its election document. In that, there is a very long list of what are known as 'reversals', on page 30. The list of reversals is long; but there is one thing suspiciously absent from the list of savings reversals, and that is the energy supplement. What then happened was the Leader of the Opposition was asked about the energy supplement and about Labor's fiscal plan. He said in an interview that the Labor position on savings measures after the 2016 election would be 'consistent with what was in the fiscal plan before the election'. Ms Macklin interjectingsupplement, banking it and spending it? It absolutely was. Is the position now consistent? That is absolutely anyone's guess. But what the member for Jagajaga does is get up here and criticise the government for making a savings measure which Labor has made, banked and already spent. And, in the process of doing so, the member for Jagajaga criticises the fact that the energy guarantee has the capacity to deliver savings each year, from 2020, of up to $115 a year. Now, the criticism of that is that it's not enough. In fact, Senator Dastyari tried to make that criticism today with a cheeseburger. I understood he was more of a Chinese food aficionado! But the fact is that $115 a year as a potential saving to Australian households is actually significant. It mightn't be significant to members opposite, who prefer Chinese food and fine Chinese restaurants, but a potential $115 saving a year is very significant. It is absolutely significant when you compare it with the potential cost increases in the average electricity bill that will occur if you try to put $66 billion worth of taxpayers' money into subsidising renewables-which members opposite also say don't need subsidisation because they are competitive as it is.

77,Mr Pyne (Sturt,"Leader of the House and Minister for Defence Industry) (14:46): Ithis answer is for both the member for Fairfax and the member for Boothby. They, like all members on this side of the House, recognise the transformational nature of the industrial base of Australia because of the Turnbull government's commitment to the national defence industry project, driving billions and billions of dollars in investment, thousands and thousands of jobs right across Australia. Just last week, in fact, we announced 600 new jobs in construction at the Osborne shipyards and 150 new jobs in combat management systems at Saab Australia because of this government. That's just the tip of the iceberg-future frigates; offshore patrol vessels; the Joint Strike Fighter, which has a big impact in states like Queensland; surface-to-air missile defence systems; and satellite ground systems. Right across defence and defence industry we are driving the economy. But one of the things all these projects have in common is that they need reliable and affordable power, and that is what the National Energy Guarantee provides. It means more capacity in the system, more supply-driving down the price, working with the other elements of the government's energy policy that are also driving down the price and driving up reliability. Who could be against a policy that ensures reliability and drives down the price of energy? No sensible person would, and that's why, as the Minister for the Environment and Energy pointed out, there have been so many third-party endorsements of this policy in the last 24 hours. Well, there are two people who are against it. There's the Leader of the Opposition, who's like the dog that caught the car on this policy. He's been demanding a policy on energy that would drive down prices and reliability, and now that he's caught it he doesn't quite know what to do with it, and he's leading the Labor Party into a very bad policy position, because he's like the dog that caught the proverbial. The other person is the Premier of South Australia, who just wants to pick a fight with Canberra. He's not the least bit interested in affordability or reliability. He's the one who's given us the canary in the coalmine that is South Australia. We've seen what Labor's policy does: it means blackouts and it means unaffordable power. Jay Weatherill wants to continue that, and so does the other side of the House. They want to put $66 billion of subsidies into something they have already decided is competitive with coal and gas.

Given that the opposition has received absolutely no other documentation, modelling or evidence from the government, can the Treasurer confirm that the cabinet and the joint party room considered and adopted a major government policy based purely on 'the vibe'? such a terrible, sad sook. Here are the papers the government has available to it and that are available to the opposition: the ACCC's inquiry into gas-the interim report, and it's some 75 pages; the ACCC's report into retail electricity pricing-it's some 175 pages; the Electricity Statement of Opportunities prepared by AEMO, which I tabled; and the advice to the Commonwealth government on dispatchable capacity, which I'm happy to table.

They are just some of the documents which I tabled which are available to the shadow Treasurer to peruse. Over this entire debate, he has shown an inadequacy of understanding when it comes to energy issues. This is the shadow Treasurer who, yesterday, came into this place and went on about regulatory impact statements when his own party, his own government, failed to produce a regulatory impact statement for cabinet for the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill, the fair work amendment bill, the national broadband network implementation bill, labour market testing for 457 workers and tax laws amendment bills brought by the shadow Treasurer when he was the Assistant Treasurer. It includes the monty of them all-the minerals resource rent tax, which the member for Lilley will remember well. The private health insurance rebate has been denied for Bowen therapy.

Will the minister update the House on the importance of strong and consistent border protection measures? Why is it important that policies be informed by advice and experience? And is the minister aware of any alternative approaches? want to say thank you very much to the member for Tangney for his question. Like all members on this side of the House, we want strong border protection policy in this country. It is essential that we have a consistency of policy, because recent history demonstrates to us what happens if you fail to take the expert advice. What we know is that, when Mr Rudd came into government in 2007, there were four people in detention and no boats were arriving. We know what happened when the Labor government was elected and changed the policy settings and threw out the expert advice on how to deal with the scourge of people smuggling-50,000 people arrived on 800 boats, 1,200 people drowned at sea and 8,000 children ended up in detention. That is what happened when Labor ignored the advice of the experts. That is what happened when Labor listened to the Left of their party, went after Green seats and Green votes in capital cities and denied an opportunity for common sense to be heard. That is the recent history of denying good advice. Now, Mr Speaker, you might be forgiven for believing that there's an air of deja vu in the public policy debate at the moment on energy, because the Labor Party have received, as we have, expert advice on how to provide reliable energy so that the power doesn't go out and we don't have blackouts like we've seen in South Australia. We've received expert advice about how to deliver power at the most affordable price and we've received expert advice about how to reduce our emissions at the same time. This government is acting on that advice-the same as it did when it came to border protection policy.",101,Questions Without Notice

I'll guarantee you something else: under Labor, as we've seen with state Labor governments, energy prices will be higher and there will be more blackouts for families and small businesses, because they ignore the advice, they are captured by the Left, they are trying to please people in Greens seats in capital cities around the country, and they are doing it at the human expense of families and small businesses around this country.

Is the Prime Minister aware that the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman's annual report, released today, reveals that the number of complaints about the NBN has more than doubled and that internet services are now the highest source of complaints?

It is going to be completed for $30 billion less than Labor would have spent, every dollar of which would have had to be repaid by higher fees to Australian customers. And it will be completed six to eight years earlier. The Minister for Communications and I are very keenly aware that a number of Australians-a relatively small figure in percentage terms, but because of the scale of the network it amounts to increasing numbers of people-are having bad experiences with installation and are not getting the speeds they have paid for. We are addressing that every day. We're in touch with the company dealing with it and ensuring through the ACCC that people get the plans they've paid for and that the installation experience is improved. The NBN was a complete and utter train wreck when we came into government. There was no transparency, and billions of dollars were wasted under Stephen Conroy's appalling leadership.

Will the minister outline to the House how the Turnbull government is assisting hard working Australian exporters maintain their competitiveness in global markets by guaranteeing an affordable and reliable energy supply? Is the minister aware of any threats to our competitiveness? the member for O'Connor for his question, because, like those on this side of the chamber, he's passionate about opening up those opportunities for Aussie exporters, knowing full well that opening up those overseas markets has been critical to driving economic growth and making sure we're creating jobs for Australians. That's part of the reason why, under this coalition, we now have a record amount of exports-some $365 billion. Export volumes are up 5.4 per cent year on year, thanks to the coalition's free trade agreements. We're now operating an annual trade surplus-something we haven't seen for a while-as a consequence of the coalition's free trade agreements. Whether it's abalone farmers in Esperance or wine producers in Manjimup, the fact is the coalition is delivering better market access, which makes a difference to exporters in the member for O'Connor's electorate and, indeed, in electorates all across Australia. It's no secret that in order for us to remain competitive, which I know is a concern that the member for O'Connor raised, exporters have to have access to affordable and reliable electricity. In fact, the president of the National Farmers' Federation, Fiona Simson, said only yesterday: Farmers across the country-dairy farmers, fruit and vegetables producers, irrigators-are hurting from spiralling electricity prices and unreliable power supplies. Fiona Simpson goes to the very core of what the coalition's policy is aiming to address: affordability and reliability. And it's the coalition's National Energy Guarantee that we put forward that will address that and ensure Australian exporters remain competitive in an international context. For that reason, the coalition is not going to back away from a policy that we know will produce good outcomes. And, in fact, it's not just exporters in Esperance; it's also, for example, the CEO of BlueScope Steel, Paul O'Malley, who said of the National Energy Guarantee, 'It turns the game around.' Steel exports are worth something like $2 billion to the Australian economy. So, we have great support from the member for O'Connor's electorate and great support from people like Paul O'Malley. But who stands in the way? Who stands in the way of a policy that delivers more reliability and delivers more affordability?

Why? Because the beneficiary was the Queensland Labor government. So, it is no surprise that the Queensland Labor government wants to stand in the way of more reliable and more affordable energy, and no surprise that the federal Labor Party wants to stand in the way as well. Broadband Ms ROWLAND (Greenway) (15:03): My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer to the Prime Minister's previous answer. Does the Prime Minister appreciate that the majority of new NBN customers previously had a working internet service? Is the Prime Minister so out of touch that he doesn't understand that people are complaining because his second-rate copper NBN is slower, more expensive and less reliable than the Prime Minister promised? for her question, because it gives me an opportunity to update my earlier answer. As of 12 October, the latest numbers are: 6,188,000 premises are able to connect to the NBN and 3,024,650 are activated, paying customers. Nearly 40,000 premises were activated on the NBN in the last week. Labor, remember, did 50,000 in six years. The reality is this: as the honourable member knows, and she should know this, what has been going on is that retail service providers-Telstra, Optus, TPG-have not been buying enough bandwidth to provision their customers. That is being investigated by the ACCC. It has been called out. They've been given three months to get their act together and ensure that, what they promise, they deliver. It has nothing to do with whether the network is fibre to the premises, fibre to the basement, fibre to the node or hybrid fibre coaxial; the problem of underprovision by retail service providers is common across all technologies on the NBN. The honourable member should recall that she was part of a government that completely and utterly failed this project. They left us a train wreck. We've turned it around. We're getting it built. Over six million premises can connect, over three million are connected and are active, paying customers, and it'll be finished by 2020.

On this side we know it is a good idea. We know that reliable and affordable energy is so crucial to low-income earners and to families, to small businesses and to manufacturers in towns like Casino and Grafton, Lismore and Yamba. Bill Collingburn at Yamba Welding& Engineering knows that, if it takes some of the pressure off his energy bills, it's going to mean he can employ more people in that beautiful part of the world.

Mr Conroy: Rubbish! blue-collar workers in this place. The member for Page asked me about an alternative approach. There is an alternative approach. The modern Labor way is to vilify power station workers. It's not to stand up for blue-collar workers; it's to come into this place and sell out for Greens votes. Those opposite are hopelessly compromised when it comes to blue-collar workers. I challenge those opposite, particularly those from regional areas, like the member for Hunter, the member for Shortland and the member for Herbert, to finally stand up for some blue-collar workers, like old Labor members used to.

96,Mr Pyne (Sturt,"Leader of the House and Minister for Defence Industry) (15:09):Poverty and Inequality Jagajaga proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The failures of the government to tackle poverty and inequality in Australia. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their placesMs MACKLIN (Jagajaga) (15:10): I have to say that it is very disappointing, in this AntiPoverty Week, that the Prime Minister is leaving the parliament. It is a week for all Australians, including all of those opposite, to actually focus on the needs of the far too many people in Australia who are living in poverty. In fact, according to the Australian Council of Social Service, there are around three million Australians, including 730,000 children, living in poverty. Unemployment and underemployment, of course, are the greatest drivers. They remain persistently high, and all of us know that without a decent job it is very hard to make ends meet. There's only one job available for every 10 people who are out of paid work or who want to work more hours. That is what is happening under this government. We saw earlier this month-and the member for Gellibrand, I know, will talk about this later-the closure of the Toyota factory in Altona. Six thousand workers lost their jobs. Of course, as the member for Wakefield knows only too well, this week we will see the closure of Holden in Elizabeth, in South Australia, leaving thousands more people out of work in a part of Adelaide that already has very high unemployment. We're going to see the end of car manufacturing in Australia, after 70 years, on this government's watch, and we will see so many families driven into poverty as a result of this government's inaction. On this side of the parliament our goal is to make sure that everybody who is able to work can find work and is able to get a decent job. We actually believe in making sure that our economic policy delivers full employment, that people get a stable job with decent pay and conditions. We know it's that decent job with decent pay and conditions that leads to a good life. By contrast, what we see from those opposite is not only this huge loss of skilled manufacturing jobs but the abolition of weekend penalty rates for many thousands of lowincome workers across this country. We have company profits skyrocketing, which those opposite are the cheerleaders for, while wages for workers are stagnant. That's the reality for thousands of people in this country. Young people in Australia are being driven into insecure work, into casual work, and are finding it very difficult to earn enough money each week to pay their bills. They're finding it even more difficult to get into the housing market. For the people who are dependent on income support, being able to afford housing is at crisis level. In most of our capital cities, rental vacancy rates are below two per cent. All of us know-particularly those of us who care so much about those who are struggling the hardest-that the social housing system is no longer providing an adequate safety net for the people who really need it. One of the biggest issues driving poverty in this country is, of course, that Newstart is too low. We on this side",106,Documents
97,The Speaker (15:09,"I have received a letter from the honourable member forof the House acknowledge and understand that. It is leaving people in poverty. As the Business Council of Australia has said, it is acting as a barrier to employment. That's why at the last election Labor said that we would do a detailed, in-depth review about the adequacy of Newstart. Amidst all these signs of increasing inequality and worsening poverty, what's been the response from those opposite? What is this out-of-touch Prime Minister actually doing to address these serious issues? One of the worse things that he's doing is continuing to push to get the age pension age up to 70. Mr Hawke interjectingMs MACKLIN: I want to go through a few very important facts about how this is a demonstration of increasing inequality, which obviously the Assistant Minister for Immigration and Border Protection at the table has no understanding about. Between the years 2001 and 2014, the life expectancy of the richest five per cent of Americans increased by roughly three years-so the rich people got to live longer. For the poorest five per cent there was no increase whatsoever. If ever you wanted a demonstration of inequality, there it is. Mr Hawke: That's America; it's not Australia. Ms MACKLIN: In Australia-in Australia!-we know that this change to the age pension age unfairly hurts in particular those people in rural and remote Australia. I know the member for Mallee, who I'm glad to see is in the chamber, understands this issue. He's the only member of the National Party that's actually spoken out on this matter, although, like all members of the National Party, he did actually vote to increase the age pension age to 70. The median age at death for people living in remote Australia is around 73, compared to 82.3 years for Australians living in the major cities-so around 10 years difference. Once again I reinforce that if ever you wanted an indication of inequality it would be inequality in living a decent, long life. What else is this Prime Minister so out of touch about? Of course, we know he wants to axe the energy supplement that goes to 1.7 million Australians, including carers. Government members interjectingMs MACKLIN: You've all voted for it: $365 a year out of the pockets of pensioners and carers. They want to cut payments to families. And-can you believe it?-they actually want to cut the bereavement allowance. When a pensioner's husband dies and they're finding it very hard to pay all the bills, that pensioner will be $1,300 worse off. Are you proud of that, government members? That is exactly what this government are doing. At the same time, they want to give massive tax cuts to big business-$65 billion to big business. Of course, they've already delivered tax cuts to millionaires and high-income earners. Once again, this is the story of this government: cut the payments to families, cut the payments to pensioners and carers, and at the same time give $65 billion to big business. We know the government have tried over the last four years to rip up the social contract that exists between Australians. Remember how they wanted to say to young people who are unemployed, 'You'll be on nothing, absolutely nothing, for six months if you don't have a job'? We managed to defeat those horrific cuts, but all of us on this side know we cannot be complacent. We are not 'a nation of lifters and leaners'; Australians actually believe in a fair go. What Australians know is that we need to pursue full employment. We need social investment in our people and in health and education, inclusive growthMr Hawke: What does that even mean? Ms MACKLIN: 'What does that mean?' he says! What does it actually mean to invest in our people? What does it mean to actually invest in our little children? What does it mean to invest in our schools? What does it mean to make sure young people can go to university? Of course, not surprisingly, these people opposite have no idea. All they want to do is demonise the unemployed, demonise those people who can't find a job and demonise those people who find it so difficult to get out of poverty. No Australian wants to live in poverty. We're about making sure we do everything to help them. All those opposite want to do is demonise them. (15:20): Well, the member for Jagajaga certainly knows how to bring a room down, doesn't she? With the member for Jagajaga, the glass is always half empty. It's as if Australia doesn't already redistribute more wealth than almost any other country on earth. It's as if Australia doesn't already have an enviable record amongst nations of sharing more wealth amongst more people than almost any other society constructed in human history. And the facts bear this out in government policy. To the member for Jagajaga, everything in Australia is terrible. The Labor Party need to wake up to some real realities about the economics of opportunity versus the economics of socialism, which the member opposite has just put forward. Eighty per cent of income tax in this country already goes to paying the welfare bill. For those members opposite who don't care enough about budgeting, 80 per cent of all income taxes pay the welfare bill at the moment. Ms Burney: Your point? government spends money on before we spend a dollar on anything else is the welfare budget. It is the No. 1 largest item of the Commonwealth budget. So to say that this is not a fair society, to say that we don't take account of those who can't do things for themselves and that we don't look after people is completely false. We already have one of the highest rates of personal income tax in the world. The only formula that the member for Jagajaga and the Labor Party put forward to this parliament-the constant refrain-is to increase taxes, increase spending and send out more welfare, and somehow that will lift people out of poverty. The Turnbull coalition government knows that the economics of opportunity relies on getting people off welfare. It relies on the enterprise of Australians, of our citizens, of our small and medium businesses, of our families and of those corporations that the member for Jagajaga wants to demonise-those Australian corporations started here, founded here, by Australians, for Australians. That's the only pathway for the government and for our society to get people out of welfare and into jobs. It's the only avenue that will work. That's why this government, the Turnbull coalition government, has cut tax-not for the big corporations, as the member for Jagajaga would have you believe, not for the big end of town. We have cut the company tax rate for every single small and medium business, every family run and owned and operated business in Australia. The member for Jagajaga, as she's famous for, would want to claw back that tax from Australian small and medium businesses.",107,Matters Of Public Importance

99,Mr Hawke,"As the member for Barton does not know, the No. 1 item that the federalSo how would the Labor Party ever get someone off welfare and into a job? We don't need more government jobs, Member for Jagajaga. We already have debt and deficit thanks to the Labor government. We have a debt and deficit that they never help us recover from. How are we going to get people into work? Well, it's by cutting company tax for Australian businesses, for those people that can employ more people. And it is working. You don't have to take my word for it. You don't have to take the word of the government for it. You just have to look at the facts in the real world right now: 245,000 jobs created in a single year-the highest job creation on record since the global financial crisis. The vast majority of those-80 per centare full-time jobs. The member for Jagajaga says inequality is rising. Well, inequality is not rising when we create 245,000 jobs in a year, 80 per cent of which are full time, getting those people off welfare. The member for Jagajaga put forward a list of welfare items that we have cut, saying that she would somehow restore them. Well, that's not what her Labor Party budget policy figures say, by the way. That's not what she said at the election. It's not what the Labor Party said at the election either, as we heard in question time today. So they come in here and say, 'We're going to restore all those cuts,' but in the budget line items of the Labor Party's financial costings they've agreed with us on so many of those costings. We in this government know from the recent budget update that we are making progress on reducing welfare in this country, and that is good for people-a $5 billion reduction in the welfare bill in Australia. It is still the No. 1 item that we spend money on, but our goal is to get people off welfare and into work. We're committed to doing it. Every time we propose a genuine policy here to get young people into jobs we're opposed by the Labor Party. Remember when we said that we would say to young people aged 18 to 30-people who don't have a disability, or don't have other issues in their life, excluding virtually half of those young people in the Australian population, but everyone else-we will pay you to study. We will pay you to earn, we'll pay you to get out there and get a job, but we won't pay you welfare. Of course, the Labor Party opposed us on that measure and said we were being cruel and unusual to young people, cruel and unusual to say that you should be in study, you should be in work, or you should be looking for work. These are sensible principles that most Australians would absolutely back us on. The alternative from the Labor Party to these sorts of policies for getting people out into either training or work is more and more welfare. I ask the member for Jagajaga, I ask the Labor Party here in this MPI debate: how can it be fair? How can it be equitable to condemn people to intergenerational welfare? That is the thing that didn't touch the member for Jagajaga's lips in her presentation. What is happening now when the Labor Party gives up on people, when they don't recognise that the priority of a government must be getting people off welfare and into work? It is condemning generation after generation to real poverty, and real poverty starts with intergenerational welfare. It is something the Labor Party will never acknowledge and never tackle. It is something on which they will never come to this parliament and say, 'We want to get people off welfare and into work.' The best the member for Jagajaga can come up with is, 'Labor policies will look to get people towards full employment in this country.' How, Member for Jagajaga? If you've never thought about the how, you don't have a plan. This is one thing we know about the Labor Party, and the Leader of the Opposition admits this in his interviews when he is asked, 'What are your policies for job creation?' As the Prime Minister has said, the Leader of the Opposition answers, 'Well, we've got a plan for public transport in Melbourne,'-or something along those lines. The Labor Party has no plan for jobs or for growth. Instead, they should acknowledge that this government is cutting company tax for Australian companies, Australian businesses-not big businesses and not large multinational corporations. We're taxing them more than you ever did. We are cutting the tax rate for small Australian family businesses, and it is working. More jobs are being created. More full-time jobs are being created. More people are getting work. More people are getting off welfare. Getting off welfare is the best chance for someone to escape poverty in this country. And it's this government that is doing it. But then we hear from the member for Jagajaga that the glass isn't half empty; it's completely empty-it's not as if we have great growth in this economy and the biggest and strongest record of job creation since the global financial crisis. Her only refrain, her only policy that she is prepared to put forward, is putting more welfare on the table. I don't believe that that will get people out of the poverty that she is talking about. The real people who face the challenges of poverty need to be given every support to get off welfare. They need to be given training, skills and real opportunity. The economics of opportunity is what the Treasurer talks about all the time; it is what this government brings forward. We recognise the need to reduce welfare, to give people the skills and training they need, to give them the opportunity to go and get that job, and to give employers the incentives to employ people. Our Try, Test and Learn policy was opposed by the Labor Party. Why would you oppose any policy that says, 'Let's get young people into jobs, let's get them off welfare, let's assist employers to take them off welfare and put them on a pathway through into jobs'? Let's take those policies and support them in a bipartisan fashion, because there shouldn't be opposition to governments when they say, 'Let's do what we can to get young people off welfare, because we know if we don't get young people off welfare early they have a high chance of staying longer and longer on welfare and higher poverty outcomes in their lives.' It's a vital concern of this government. It's the policy pursuit of this government. The economics of opportunity are what we are about. We reject this MPI. We reject the Labor Party's approach, because it is the ultimate poverty trap to condemn generation after generation to stay on welfare, with no hope of a job and with no hope of training. And it's the Turnbull coalition government that is growing the economy, putting the incentives in place for Australian businesses-that golden seam of commerce in this country of small and medium family owned businesses-to create the jobs and give young people the opportunity. We're doing the real work for it. It's paying the dividends. It is the largest job-creation year on record since the GFC. We're seeing the dividends. We thank those enterprises for doing it. We know the economics of opportunity and the economics of hope are the way forward for this country. Ms BURNEY (Barton) (15:30): This morning, in this Anti-Poverty Week, the member for Jagajaga and I, and a number of other Labor members of parliament, attended a forum put on by Catholic Social Services Australia. It was about the economy, and they spoke very clearly. I'm very glad the minister's in the House to hear that. I thought he would have been there, but he wasn't. If I'd been the minister I would have been there, because it's crucial to that portfolio. The forum spoke primarily of people who are desperately poor. It spoke about this government. It said the government is demonising people in its desperate search for a narrative. It also spoke about people who should be lifted up by government, which is not what this government is doing; this government is using punitive measures, scaring and scandalising people into submission. It spoke about providing people who are poor-and the gap is getting wider-with a frugal and dignified life. It spoke about a robust safety net. This minister and this government are doing everything they can to undermine these things. Growing inequality is a reality in this country and it would be helpful if the government would come to understand that. Instead, there are $65 billion in tax cuts to big business, while they are privatising Centrelink jobs and putting people on rubbish wages to do it. In Centrelink, Minister, there are 42 million missed calls a year, and who knows what it has been over the last 12 months. And there are false accusations of fraud. But let's be clear: poverty is a reality in this country and this government would do well to have a look at what it actually means for people. Foodbank in the ACT made a statement this week that the rising cost of living means parents are having to make the choice about eating and putting food on the table. How can this be, in a first-world country like Australia? It is because this government does not care about poor people and it certainly has no idea what inequality means. The Turnbull government's policy response to all of these signs, rising inequality and worsening poverty, is to make people work longer. It is, as the member for Jagajaga said, removing the energy supplement. It is cutting family payments. It is refusing to support people who have lost a partner. Households are praying about ever-increasing power prices. The fact is that there are people in this country who cannot afford to pay power bills, who cannot afford to have a home-and we know that many families are one or two pay cheques between homelessness and having a home. But this government says that everything's fine and, somehow or other, it's not its responsibility. For any decent government, the first priority should be the poor and inequality. It should absolutely be about lifting people up, not putting people under their heel and pushing them down. We also know that the energy debate that's been going on is a falsity. They are going to provide people with a cheaper energy bill in three years time by 50c. What is that going to mean for people today who don't know where their dinner is coming from? What is that going to mean for people today who have no idea how they're going to put food into their schoolkids' bags tomorrow so those children can go to school? The last speaker from the government said something about entrenched inequality, intergenerational inequality. Education is the way in which you deal with that, and we know that we will be investing in school funding. We know that proper investments in infrastructure and a fair tax system are the ways to deal with intergenerational poverty. It is not by scaring people, Minister; it is not by telling people they owe money that they don't owe; it is not by privatising and outsourcing government jobs. It is not by putting people so far behind that they have lost hope. How can it be that you are overseeing a system where people cannot even imagine a future? That is a shocking thing and a shocking indictment of this government. Yet again I find it amazing that those opposite that sit there and talk-whilst they were in power unemployment benefits were growing at 13.5 per cent per annum. Since we have come to power, they are now growing at 3.7 per cent per annum. Why? Because people are getting",109,Matters Of Public Importance
100,Mr Laundy (Reid,"Assistant Minister for Industry, Innovation and Science) (15:35):jobs. That's the best answer to inequality. It's often been said that the best form of welfare is a job. Under this government, since it came to power, some 750,000 jobs have been created; in the last 12 months, 327,000-80 per cent of those being full-time jobs. Why? Because business is doing what it does: it increases profitability and employs more people. I note-I suspect he may even follow me-the member for Wakefield, who so eloquently described me as a 'big gun'. He may talk about the closure of Holden. I find it interesting that those opposite stand at any forum you can get and want to death write Australian manufacturing, when the facts fly in the face of everything they say. In the last 12 months in this country there has been a net increase of 15,100 jobs in manufacturing. Of those jobs, 6,300 have been in Victoria and 3,700 in South Australia. I have said this often: where is the equality embedded in our way of life in this country as it should be? It is in our progressive taxation system. The top three per cent of taxpayers pay 30 per cent of the revenue-as they should. We are now fast approaching 50 per cent of households in this country that will be net recipients of taxation revenue-as they should be. That's fair. A millionaire will pay $444,000 in tax, an effective rate of 44c in the dollar. Someone on $18,250 will pay nothing. I note too that the member for Jagajaga wanted to talk about penalty rates but very effectively left out EBAs. There is my favourite union, the SDA-what a wonderful bunch they are-whose EBA has now been struck out for 2014 and 2011, for those working for Coles. Why? Because some 54 per cent of the workersMr Champion interjectingI know Penny Vickers very well, who led the claim, who signed a form telling her that those who were signing up would be better off, when 54 per cent-the SDA's recipient that signed the form signed it fraudulently and admitted under oath that he signed a stat dec that he knew was false. In itself that is something that can be prosecuted. Mr Champion interjectingare not bad as long as they pass the BOOT test-the BOOT test that you put in. Not us-you! This is the hypocrisy of those opposite. Yes, we want equality; we want increased levels of equality. It comes through progressive taxation. And then there is the last point, about South Australia. The member for Durack, who was interjecting somewhat in the last speech, mentioned a report in yesterday's paper, or two days ago, in South Australia about 102,000 people taking food parcels because they can't afford to pay their electricity bills. Why? Because the experiment has gone wrong. Everything this government has done has been aimed at delivering jobs. Why? Because jobs are the best form of welfare. The member for Grey, up the back there, came in and fought hard for Arrium. Why? It is because it means jobs. Mr Gupta has come in and worked with my department to secure a deal that will ensure the livelihood of some 10,000 people both directly and indirectly in his electorate alone-let alone those simple deals with government on preordering rail lines moving forward where we can help with procurement. I've said it three times but I'll say it again: the best form of welfare is a job. This government has created 750,000 jobs in the past four years-327,000 in the past 12 months, and 80 per cent of those are full time. That's the part that those opposite don't get.

102,Mr Laundy,"The member for Wakefield says, 'Do you want the end of EBAs?' EBAsprogressive taxation system-the way it has always been handled since this country was formed. for all Australians to focus on the three million of us, including 730,000 children, who currently live in poverty. I want to talk today about the most important bulwark we have against poverty, as the previous speaker was harping on about: high-quality, secure work. It's something that's been on the minds of my constituents recently as 2,500 high-quality, secure jobs have been lost at the Toyota Altona plant this month as a result of the actions of the Abbott-Turnbull government. Unfortunately, this is just one example of how secure work is currently being challenged by the policies of the Abbott-Turnbull government. In recent times, we have begun to see the emergence of an insidious new form of poverty, which was previously alien to the Australian way of work-the emergence of the working poor in our society. My electorate in Melbourne's west is home to the gates of the old Sunshine Harvester factory. It is a physical monument not only to the labour of the thousands of people who passed through their gates before the factory gave its name to the surrounding suburb but also to the landmark 1907 Harvester judgement that marked the beginning of a universal minimum employment standard in Australia and an international beacon for workplace rights for decades to come. The IPA once labelled the Harvester judgement as the second-worse decision in Australian history, so that should tell you a little bit about the merits of this policy intervention. The Harvester judgement was founded on a concept of a 'civilised community' and the notion that workers needed to be treated as a human beings, not simply as commodities in a system. It's the spirit that we need to recapture in this building at a time of record low wages growth and skyrocketing underemployment. The symptoms of the emergence of the working poor in Australia are everywhere you look. One in five Australian households currently lives on less than the age pension and less than the single minimum wage. There are 2.3 million Australians who earn the lowest legal rate of pay for the work that they perform, including 450,000 more people than two years ago. Those are the jobs that the previous speaker was talking about. The Productivity Commission has found that between 10 and 15 per cent of Australians-2.3 million to 2.8 million Australians-are income poor. That is, they are living in households earning less than half the median income or, to put it in practical terms, living in households that are unable to get a car loan, to get a home loan, to plan ahead financially for their children's needs and to deal with the ordinary financial vicissitudes of life of accidents, illness or a car crash. There are now 1.1 million unemployed Australians-people who are capable of working more and who want to work more but who don't have the opportunity. That's up from 170,000 in the 1970s. There are currently 750,000 Australians working second or third jobs as a result of this. It's unsurprising in this context that inequality is at a 75-year high. Too many of our fellow Australians can no longer see the link between hard work and a fair reward. There are a number of causes of this phenomenon but the key cause lies in the rules of our workplaces. As the member for Gorton told the National Press Club today, 'We cannot tackle inequality or build a system of inclusive prosperity unless Australia has a workplace relations system that is both productive and fair.' Essential to that task is striking the right balance of power between workers and employers, and the tilt of bargaining power away from workers",113,Matters Of Public Importance
103,Mr Watts (Gellibrand) (15:40,"This week is Anti-Poverty Week. It should be a weekand to employers has gone too far. In Australia, workers' bargaining power has been undermined by the enormous growth of what the Chief Economist of the Bank of England recently called 'divisible work'. Non-standard employment, casual jobs, fixed-term contracts, self-employment, labour hire, internships and temporary visa holders-these are forms of employment that undermine workers' ability to negotiate collectively and that circumvent many of the conditions of formal full-time work. This is a big reason why, despite productivity having grown by 20 per cent in Australian workplaces over the past decade, wages have grown by only six per cent. Thinking that a $65 billion corporate unfunded tax cut will help fix this is not neo-liberalism; it's neo-Martianism. The ministers of this government might as well be on another planet if they think this is going to work. What we need to fix this is for government to stand up for workers: to change the rules to put an end to sham contracts; to stop phoenixing of companies that cut wages and conditions; to ensure labour hire firms comply with basic employment conditions; to end the rorting of casual work definitions to avoid providing basic workplace standards; and to crack down on the exploitation of temporary migrant workers, an epidemic and a moral stain on our country at the moment. We need a government that will make Australian workplaces work for Australian workers. Thankfully, my constituents and the Australian people have that option. A Shorten Labor government will deliver this. We will fight poverty with the greatest bulwark we have against poverty: secure work at fair wages. bringing this subject matter to the House's attention today: poverty and inequality. It brings me to question some of the driving motives of those of us who are brought to this place, and the differences between the government and the Labor Party. I listened to the last speaker's words with interest, and I suspect that while he parrots the word 'jobs' he lacks the policy detail to actually understand what generates jobs in the economy. In the coalition, we recognise that a job is the best form of equality. Labor governments entrench inequality. They support positive welfare measures which, in the end, damage individuals and communities. In South Australia. I'm responsible for all of the remote Indigenous communities. If you want to see what passive and entrenched welfare does to a community, you should come with me for a drive-you, Mr Deputy Speaker Coulton, and perhaps the members of the Labor Party as well. I can tell you that the answer to equality is not eternal welfare; it is to get people a job. The coalition government works to support people to stand on their own two feet. Labor governments prefer their constituents to be dependent on them. The coalition believes that people's lives are better when they strive for independence. Labor are delighted when constituents cannot survive without their largesse. They're delighted when they keep them on the drip, so the Labor nannies can tell them how to live their lives and put stipulations on their lives. That's what keeps people poor. That's what keeps people in poverty. In the Liberal Party, we believe that those who are unable to manage their own affairs should be assisted to do so. We should do everything to help those people who aren't able to help themselves, which is why we moved to fully fund the NDIS. To put it beyond doubt, we will move to help those people who cannot provide for themselves. But we also believe that those who have the ability to manage their own lives should be allowed to do so, and the less interference the better.",114,Matters Of Public Importance
104,Mr Ramsey (Grey,"Government Whip) (15:45): I thank the member for Jagajaga forOn jobs and inequality, if we look at jobs alone and look at the way the Turnbull government is managing the economy, the economy that the Turnbull government has provided has produced an extra 240,000 jobs in the last year. These are the best figures in eight years-the best figures since the GFC. If we turn to the discussion point of the weekelectricity-this is the figure we heard just a few moments ago: 102,000 people in South Australia are on food parcels. What is the main cause of that? It is the price of electricity. I can take you through the foibles of the South Australian government and how we have ended up with the most unreliable and expensive electricity in the country and, possibly, in the civilised world. But when we bring solutions to this place, as we did yesterday, at the behest of an industry body of experts recommended by Finkel, we are opposed by those on the other side, who prefer to see higher electricity prices for people. Today we couldn't get one of them to stick their hand up and say $115 a year would actually be an important saving to people who are in poverty. So while you parrot all this rubbish, all this rubbish about your care for inequality, we on this side of the parliament work to deliver the most equal Australia we can. We reduce taxation so people can afford to pay for themselves. We support the NDIS to the extent that has never been done before. We provide an economy that is generating more jobs. Then we have aspiration. Once there was a Labor leader, who those opposite now despise, who talked about the ladder of opportunity. He was right on that issue-the ladder of opportunity, where we help those at the bottom to get started. My colleague a few minutes ago took us through Australia's progressive taxation system. It works out that, as you climb higher up that ladder, you provide more back into the system for those who can't provide for themselves. (Time expired) important MPI to the House. She probably knows more about the interaction between the social security system and the wages system and about combatting poverty than any other member of this House. The government should listen to what she has to say and think about what she has to say, instead of going on ideological meandering efforts like we heard from the member for Grey. I heard many times that a job is the best form of welfare, but I think the Being unemployed is the strongest overall predictor of poverty, with higher rates of poverty amongst this group than any other group. We hear time and time again that the best form of welfare is a job. In fact, unemployment is the sole cause of poverty. It is the cause of poverty and we should think about it that way, not this other way, because frankly it affectsMr Tudge: It's not a tricky concept-we want to get them into work. important fact: right as we speak the car industry, with the last car slowly moving through the line of GM ElizabethMs Macklin: Creating unemployment. and deliberately shut down the car industry.

107,Mr Champion,"They are creating unemployment. The government set out to violentlyMinister and a Treasurer brag about shutting down the car industry, so I don't know why you're shrugging your shoulders and asking the Deputy Speaker for protection. I remember the Phil Coorey article saying that they were bragging in cabinet about who put the torpedo in the water. That is an actual quote-they were bragging about shutting down the car industry, just like they were tough guys on the shipbuilding industry when they were going to send submarines to Japan and supply ships to Spain. What does that cause? It causes unemployment, with 1,000 jobs lost out of ASC-1,000, with another 200 or 300 to go. It is not just a great cost to those individuals; it is a great cost to the manufacturing base and a great cost to future building. Guess what-those tradesmen will lose their skills and abilities and then we'll have to put that workforce all back together again. Guess what's going to happen to car industry workers come Friday. Many of them will be out in the labour market seeking work. Some of them will get work but some of them won't. So unemployment, this cause of poverty, is what this government has set out to create in the car industry; it's what they have set out to create in shipbuilding. And we've seen what they have set out to do with wages growth. They are against wages growth. They have only ever had one idea-feed the donkey less and whip him harder. That's the sole reason to be conservative in this country. It is the only idea they've ever had. We've seen it in the penalty rates cuts; we've seen it in their dealings with unions. We know what they're all about-they're about tearing up wages agreements, they're about tearing up enterprise bargaining that generates higher wages and they're about tearing up penalty rates. That is what they set out to do on Work Choices and now they're applying the onion cutter-bit, by bit, by bit, by bit. Guess what happens when you set out to have a low-wage economy. It causes unemployment, it causes underemployment and it creates desperation at that working level because if you're unemployed or you're seeking work or you're underemployed, guess what? Employers have got the whip hand and you don't ask for a pay rise in that sort of economy, you don't get a pay rise in that sort of economy and you don't enter the middle class in that sort of economy. And look at what else they're doing. They turn a blind eye to sham contracting. They turn a blind eye to shams in the visa system. They create a housing affordability crisis. They create an energy crisis through their division on carbon emissions, through their division on renewable energy. They cut energy supplements. They create a low-wage, high-poverty, highunemployment system. Then they come into this House and say, 'Oh, well, the best form of welfare is a job.' Well, congratulations! You've just created a system where people can't get jobs, can't get wage rises, can't get a fair go, can't join the middle class. And then you have the temerity to come in here and ask for the Speaker's protection. Well, you're not going to get it, and you're not going to get it at the next election, either. What you're going to get is a kick in the pants. Ms PRICE (Durack) (15:55): I rise to speak against, once again, a ridiculous motion moved by the member for Jagajaga. If there's one thing the last 100 years have shown us here in Australia it is that the greatest creator of poverty and inequality is socialism-that is, the guiding principle of those opposite. So their motion today on poverty and inequality is once again laughably hypocritical. In contrast, what do we on this side stand for? We stand for free trade, economic liberalism and democracy, which have led to unprecedented levels of growth,",116,Acoss Report Poverty In Australia 2016 Says It S The Inverse
108,Mr Champion,"I don't know what the minister finds offensive. You had a Primewealth and unemployment. That is what we on this side stand for, every minute of every day of every year. Employment is a key point here, because-and we've heard it here many times today, but it's worth saying one more time-the best form of welfare is a job. The hypocrisy of the member for Jagajaga is galling, considering Labor's policies and the decisions made while she was a minister in the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd governments, which would have led to homelessness services being defunded-just one example. Labor's heartless contribution to inequality was to not leave one single cent in the budget for the National Partnership Agreement on Homelessness. They had the chance to fund the expiring national partnership agreement in their last budget, and they chose to leave not one single cent. They left only uncertainty. Labor not only left this program without a penny but also created an affordable housing program with no way of measuring whether any affordable houses were actually delivered-typical, but still very disappointing. On this side, we're redesigning this program so that for the first time it actually has some measurable outcomes. This government believes in a welfare system that tackles poverty and inequality, principally by helping individuals achieve independence and move off welfare. Our welfare reforms, including the cashless welfare card-and it's good to see the minister here today-which we're trialling in my state, in the Kimberley, and also in the eastern goldfields, as well as our drug testing trials, all contribute to this goal. They will help to reduce poverty and inequality in this country. Already in the last financial year the Turnbull government has created some 240,000 jobs, the largest increase in job creation since the GFC. The Leader of the Opposition talks a lot about inequality but doesn't have any policies to create jobs, to help people move into jobs or to reduce the cost of living for Australians. The policies of those opposite will lead to job losses, reduced investment and increased energy costs. This obstructionism regarding power policy will delay, and deny Australians, a reliable and affordable energy supply and will deny Australians a reduction of, on average, $115 in their energy bill at the end of the year. We have seen Western Australian Labor go a step further, with an ideological thought bubble of an independent RET. This thought bubble will place Western Australia at a huge comparative disadvantage. What about the 120-odd food parcels in South Australia we've been hearing about today, due only to a reckless power policy of the South Australian Labor government? I spoke earlier about how Labor failed to fund the National Partnership Agreement on Homelessness. But a few weeks ago they were given the opportunity to vote on an increase to the level of Newstart. The member for Jagajaga even mentioned that today. Despite making numerous vague statements about the adequacy of this payment, they did not vote to increase the rate; no, they did not. We're aware that many in the community feel that things are not getting better. We are acutely aware of that as the government. Wages are stagnant and many people haven't seen a significant pay rise in a long time. We on this side understand that, and we are working hard to improve the lives of all Australians. That's what you do when you're in government. All the Leader of the Opposition can do is make speeches, voice platitudes and talk of raising taxes. He and his colleagues employ the economics of envy and the economics of politics. Our approach is different. We want to create more jobs. We don't just want to talk about it. It's not just words. We actually want to create more jobs. We want to support people to get the skills they need to move into a job. It was this government that made the $100 million investment in the Try, Test and Learn Fund, which found new ways to help disadvantaged individuals. Of course, we have fully committed to the NDIS. We are exempting low-income earners from the Medicare levy, while higher income earners will contribute the most. Those opposite love to make statements like they have today, despite history and despite our record. We are tackling poverty and inequality and I am very proud of our record. (Time expired) Dr FREELANDER (Macarthur) (16:00): Anti-Poverty Week is a good time to reflect on how this country and this government is tackling the growing number of people living in poverty and the increasing inequality in Australia. The Australian Council of Social Services states that around three million Australians are living in poverty, including about three-quarters of a million children. Australia is fast losing its egalitarian roots, which made this country the home of the fair go. We are for the first time seeing a generation who will be worse off than their parents. We're seeing one-third of Australian pensioners living in abject poverty. We are seeing consistently high unemployment and underemployment rates, increasing casualisation and decreasing job security. We're seeing increases in the cost of living, including skyrocketing power bills. We are seeing Australians have increasing difficulty in accessing the health care they need. And we're seeing this government make it consistently harder for the most disadvantaged in our society to get ahead-to get one step ahead. The reason I decided to enter politics was that, after working as a paediatrician in my electorate of Macarthur for 35 years, I was increasingly confronted with issues now more commonly described as the social determinants of health. As the world has changed over that time there have been many people left behind, and increasingly governments have had to adopt policies to prevent societal polarisation. In order to deal with this division into haves and have-nots, politicians must understand the issue, and it's clear to me that the TurnbullJoyce-Abbott government has little understanding of the difficulties housing, health, education and employment cause for people of limited means. It almost seems to me that this government would be happy to have a class based society with a hereditary peerage, perhaps bringing in Prince Philip as Governor General. In health I'm often asked to organise specialist appointments for my constituents, as they cannot afford the increasing gap payments or large up-front fees to see specialists. Many people avoid appointments with specialists because of cost. It's estimated that in my electorate around a third of referrals to specialists are not taken up, because of cost. Ms Brodtmann: Back to the fifties; what an achievement! Dr FREELANDER: Yes. For example, people with intractable heart failure, who need to see a cardiologist, or people with multiple sclerosis, who need to see a neurologist, do not go to their appointments, because they can't afford it. And that's a fact; that's occurring every day in Australia. Certainly in our medical visits around the countryside, from places as far south as Devonport in Tasmania to Rockhampton in Queensland, we see similar things occurring time and time again. This is a real difference in Australia now compared to the Australia. I grew up in and it's something that we need to address. This government has shown absolutely no inclination to do so. Some newer treatments that are world's best practice and some investigations, such as MRIs for prostate cancer, which are much less invasive, safer and better investigations for men suspected of having prostate cancer, have been waiting to get a Medicare rebate for years and nothing has happened. That leaves men-in particular older men, who often are of very limited means-having to pay an up-front fee of around $600. This is happening every day in Australia. In health, the future is all about health data. Data collection is a major part of our health system now and will be increasingly so in the future, yet this government has sold off the Australian cancer registry, the first database in Australian health care of national significance and importance. They sold it to private enterprise, meaning that there will be fees involved in accessing that data in the future. It's another discriminatory health practice that this government persists in. In housing, many people of retirement age still have large mortgages and many young people see themselves as permanent renters, yet investors are given enormous tax advantages by this government. It's terrible, and it needs to change, yet this government has shown no understanding and no willingness to do this. IfI can mention, very quickly, one last thing-our foreign aid budget has been cut, leading to significant changes in some of the most disadvantaged countries in our neighbourhood, yet this government has shown no inclination to improve it. (Time expired) egalitarian nation. This place should be a great parliament, but sometimes it can be a depressing place, and it becomes all the more depressing when I walk into this chamber, sit down and listen to the lazy politics of envy-when I hear those opposite simply pull the drawer open, pull out the class card and put it on the table. It's not the parliament that those who've taken the time to listen to debate in this place want to hear. They want the battle of big ideas. Bring the big ideas forward; don't simply find the lazy class card and lay it on the table. Ours is a great egalitarian nation. For those people who come in here and use their favourite word-equality-and misappropriate it, let me say: this nation wasn't built on equality of outcome; this national was built on equality of opportunity. We need to do everything we can every day to make sure that every Australian citizen has the same opportunities. My father came here in 1961 as an 18year-old lad with nothing more than the clothes on his back and an education in a foreign place. He didn't even have the language of English to his name, but this nation gave him opportunities. He took up those opportunities, and he's lived a very fruitful life-and I hope he lives it for much longer. But there were similar people in my father's cohort who came to Australia and who were presented with the same opportunities that he was but who didn't take advantage of them. Those opposite would say that our nation has failed those people and that what we need to do is, in some way, create an equality between the outcomes my father has achieved and the outcomes of those who haven't been so positive, because otherwise this nation has failed. Quite frankly, that's rubbish, and those opposite know it. It's about equality of opportunity, not equality of outcome. In the time. I have left, I do want to address poverty. Quite obviously I'm a South Australian member of parliament, and I think one of the single largest drivers of people into poverty are cost-of-living pressures. As a South Australian, I will go immediately to energy costs because",117,Acoss Report Poverty In Australia 2016 Says It S The Inverse

In a week when this place-particularly those on this side-is trying to do something serious about meeting the energy security challenge this nation faces, in a week when those of us on this side are trying to do something to confront the failed experiment that is the South Australian energy market, I would have thought that those opposite wouldn't want to be talking about poverty, particularly less than five hours after the Premier of South Australia was out there, loud and proud, saying: 'I don't want to be part of your solution. I've created the problem, but I'm having none of your solution.' Those opposite need to come with me into the homes of those on fixed incomes in my electorate, those who have had their electricity switched off because they can't meet the cost of it, and tell them they're pontificating in this place about poverty. What those opposite should do is spend less time worrying about MPIs of this nature, where they are playing cheap politics, and get on the phone to Labor state premiers and first ministers and say, 'Get on board. Get on board a plan that is all about affordability, that drives reliability into the marketplace and that will meet our international obligations.' Do that, not for the Prime Minister's sake, not for the member for Barker's sake and not for their own sake but for the very people they propose this MPI to address: those who are either suffering or being driven below the poverty line. Please, pick up the phone and ring the premiers and tell them to get on board. concluded.

111,The Deputy Speaker ( Mr Coulton) (16:11,"The question now is that thedebate on the so-called reducing pressure on household affordability measures. I was talking about how I as an MP with a good salary was priced out of my own suburb in my electorate. The asking price for the house we were renting was almost $2 million, and we just couldn't afford that. So you can imagine the difficulty facing millions of Australians: young Australians, first home buyers, workingand middle-class Australians who have worked hard but can't get anywhere near the dream of homeownership. No party has a particular monopoly on good ideas. We hear that all the time. But let's make no mistake here: this government has the policy lever in its hands to reform negative gearing and the capital gains tax discount, but it is unable to do so-unwilling to do so. They can act and deliver relief to so many millions of Australians who are trying to get into the housing market, but they have actually refused to do so. Among all of the advanced economies, Australia has some of the most generous taxation concessions for housing investments. In recent years this has helped fuel an investor-driven property boom, leaving more and more young people-first home buyers and even young families-unable to purchase a home. The interaction of negative gearing and the capital gains tax discount has also encouraged speculative behaviour, exposing the economy to unnecessary levels of financial risk. I would like to quote from a Grattan Institute report on housing policy: The combination of capital gains tax rule changes in 1999 and negative gearing has strongly increased the demand for investment properties. Investors compete directly with potential homebuyers, particularly for established houses. This makes it harder for first home buyers to secure a property. From all the anecdotal stories you hear, that is certainly true. When young couples or young couples with a family-their first kid or even two kids-go to an auction, they're competing with someone who is going for their third, fourth, fifth, sixth, or even seventh investment property, and they are just unable to compete. On that basis, I unequivocally support the amendments moved by the member for McMahon as they acknowledge that the First Home Super Saver Scheme will do nothing to address housing affordability but will instead work to undermine Australia's world-class superannuation system. Any housing affordability package that does not include reforms to negative gearing and capital gains tax is a sham. Fairness is at the heart of this debate-at least on our side. I believe Australia tries to be a fair society. We expect our tax system to align with this value. Most Australians have taxes withheld by their employer in a pay-as-you-go scheme. Of course, the more you earn, the more you pay. The progressive nature of the way most Australians pay tax doesn't apply to some other aspects of the tax system. Tax subsidies, like negative gearing, disproportionately favour wealthy people who have large amounts of capital at their disposal. And it has to be understood that a dollar of tax avoided in one case is probably an extra dollar of tax paid by everyone else. It's simply unfair. I now want to turn to schedule 2 of this bill, which provides for a scheme for profits achieved through downsizing a property to be placed into superannuation to achieve a tax efficiency. As some speakers noted, there is a legitimate debate around this issue. While I do not believe that older Australians should ever be coerced into selling a beloved family home because they fear being financially penalised if they do not, there are many cases in which a large family home is not required later in life, once people's kids have moved out and",121,Bills
112,Mr Khalil (Wills) (16:11,"I am pleased to be able to resume my contribution to theretirement is upon them. Labor has looked at the interaction between downsizing and the pension and looked at people on low and middle-class incomes who might consider the need to downsize. The government is concentrating on the superannuation side of things, proposing to allow people aged 65 or over to make a non-concessional contribution of up to $300,000 from the process of selling their home. These contributions would be exempt from the age test, the work test and the $1.6 million balance test for non-concessional contributions. This measure would overwhelmingly impact on people at the highest end of the spectrum when it comes to savings, not those who are concerned about the interaction with the age pension. While there is a debate to be had on that score, it is a flawed premise that this will promote the release of housing stock and thus ease pressures on property values. I note that the member for McMahon put questions on notice to the Treasurer to provide an estimate of how many people may opt to downsize as a result of this proposal. As we've heard, the Treasurer appears to have no idea of how many people would in fact choose to downsize. How on earth can the Treasurer conclusively say that more housing stock will be available in the market without any indicator on this front? It's blind faith at best. It's nothing more than guesswork. This debate is an opportunity to highlight the government's capricious disregard for the budget bottom line, which has grown worse under the weight of this government's mismanagement. Reckless tax subsidies are unsustainable and unaffordable. Indeed, several tax subsidies, including negative gearing, are growing at a rate that is unsustainable. Quite simply, the budget position today and over the medium term cannot afford both these generous subsidies and the necessary investments required to boost growth and jobs. It is appropriate that every budget line item that is growing rapidly undergoes close scrutiny to ensure that the subsidy is achieving its stated objectives and that the quantum is appropriate when evaluated against competing policies. Two specific deductions-negative gearing and capital gains subsidies-are both significant calls on the budget and are growing at such a rapid rate that they need to be addressed. It is undeniable that negative gearing and the capital gains discount have not achieved their aim to boost housing supply and encourage the building of more new houses. In fiscal year 2016-17 they cost the budget over $10 billion. As an illustrative comparison, that's more than the government spends on higher education or child care. The capital gains discount subsidy is growing so rapidly, with revenue forgone doubling from $4.2 billion in 2013 to $8.6 billion by 2018-19. The repeated claims by the government-the justification for the immense cost to the public purse-that the benefits of such tax subsidies go overwhelmingly to lowand middle-income earners are simply incorrect. The government uses income data after deductions have been applied. More reliable data that uses gross income shows that the benefits go overwhelmingly to higher income earners. We see on this side, and it is there for all to see, that this is where the skewed priorities of this government come into sharp focus. this debate on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Reducing Pressure on Housing Affordability Measures No. 1) Bill 2017. I'm going to say that from my point of view the greatest disappointment in this year's budget, in the Treasurer's pathetic speech, was the sheer lack of understanding shown by the government towards young people looking to buy their first homes. I say that's a big call because there was a lot that was disappointing in this budget.",122,Bills
113,Mr Hill (Bruce) (16:18,"I'm going to make a big call at the outset of my contribution toMainly, though, I think you can say they were bad calls: a tax cut for everyone in this chamber and a tax rise for everyone else in Australia, $65 billion of unfunded company tax cuts, cuts to education-I could go on. But I say that this is disappointing because in the leadup to the budget the newspapers were full of speculation. Government ministers were on the telly talking up the big housing reform package we were going to see. Did we see a strategy? Do we have a minister for housing? Still-in the fifth year of this government-there is no minister for housing. Did we see anything real? No. Like the Prime Minister-who has now lost, I think, 21 Newspolls in a row-the housing reform package is a fizzer. There is nothing substantial in the budget. There's a mishmash of teeny, tiny, little measures that don't do much harm but don't really do anything. We've had a few bills through to give effect to this 'nothing much' of a package. Most are actually integrity measures. You might remember in June, for those avid listeners at home, the foreign resident capital gains withholding payments bill, which apparently was part of the housing reform package-innocuous, but it didn't do anything in relation to housing reform. It was honestly described as an integrity measure. When we finish this debate, the next couple of bills to be debated cognately are three measures. Two are actually described, in a moment of honesty by the government, as 'integrity measures'. I won't breach the standing orders by debating those bills now, but I just note the impact, because it is relevant to the second reading amendment. Those two measures are travel deductions and previously used asset deductions. I am entirely unclear on what the impact on housing affordability might betighten up the tax system? Sure. There's a vacancy tax. It might pop a few more houses into the supply. Great. But there's negligible impact on housing affordability. But those bills that masquerade as a housing affordability package are more evidence that the government has no clue. They are not listening to experts. They are not listening to people in the community. they have no idea. They are seriously out of touch. In fact, they've given up, as we've seen this week with the energy package, any pretence of actually governing. Just do whatever the member for Warringah says in the party room. I notice there's a bill on the Notice Paper as well that talks about new offences for impersonating a Commonwealth officer. I'd be very worried the Prime Minister might actually be charged under that bill for impersonating the Prime Minister! This is a housing affordability sideshow-say some words and maybe someone will believe you're doing something. The re-election strategy has started to become clear this week: burn coal for higher power prices, spread copper for slower internet, and spin crap for-well, I don't know, just because. Context, however, is important. As our second reading amendment makes clear, the government's housing affordability package is a sham and Labor's policies are superior. The context in this country is house prices keep going up, year after year, quarter upon quarter, faster than incomes. Meanwhile, homeownership rates have plummeted to record post World War II lows. You simply cannot be credible, as speakers before me have said, on housing affordability unless you're prepared to tackle the distorting, unsustainable, regressive and damaging tax concessions. These tax concessions, negative gearing and capital gains taxindeed, the deadly, toxic combination of the two-are fuelling investor demand for established housing, and they are pricing first home buyers, people who actually want to live in the house and create a home, out of the market. The fact is it is still easier in this country to buy your second, your third, your fourth, your fifth, your 10th or your 39th investment property than it is to buy the most important one-the first. We hear about supply and demand. It is a market, so there is supply and there is demand. But the government point blank refuses to look at demand. I say it's damaging, because no society, no sensible society, no decent society, wants to see house prices keep rising faster than incomes. The party of Menzies, the mob opposite, get very sensitive when you talk about their patron saint, Menzies. I think it's the 5,000th year or something, so we've heard all year from his seminal 'forgotten people' speech. He had a vision for a nation of homeowners, versus today's vision for a nation of landlords and renters, with the landlords on that side of the House and the renters being everyone else. The fact is we have too much growth in prices driven by investors. This is not a leftie, communist, socialist plot; it's what every sensible economic commentator and every sensible academic tells us. The fact is that, for a high-income earner in this country with a bit of spare cash in their pocket-perhaps due to the government's tax cut of two per cent that we got in the last budget, when we're the least deserving people in the country of getting a tax cut-the most rational thing to do on a Saturday morning after having your coffee and reading the paper is to trot down the street to the nearest auction and, with your spare cash, bid up the cost of an existing property because you get a great big tax concession which means more to you than anyone else in the country. I say it's unproductive and distorting. You'd think, with the current investment levels in the productive part of the economy, you'd want to re-engineer the tax system to encourage people with a bit of spare money to do something productive with it, like invest in a business, or a start-up, or shares-something apart from bidding up the cost of an existing property, which does nothing for the economy. I say it's unsustainable, as has been said, because the cumulative cost of these regressive tax concessions is tens of billions of dollars to the budget when we're lectured that fiscal responsibility and structural repair is needed, and I say it's regressive because overwhelmingly the benefits go to those who have the most. This is perhaps the clue, as many speakers before me have wondered, as to why the government refuses point-blank to address these glaring problems in the budget. Every sensible economist, economic body and policy expert says change is needed, and even Joe Hockey-remember him?-and the person impersonating the Prime Minister, when he was old Malcolm, used to know that. Just like we saw with superannuation, when you strip away the pretence of care for the middle class, when you get past the waffle about, 'Oh yeah, we care about poor people; inequality is not a thing, but we're kind of a bit sympathetic to people in poverty,' they are the party of the rich. They are the party of the people who have the most. They have wealth and privilege, and reducing inequality runs against their very purpose. It is at the core of Liberal Party DNA that its members and donors jack up if it does anything to make a structural change that reduces inequality and makes things a little fairer, or if it takes away any perk or loophole that helps money flow back to those who have the most and levels the playing field. We saw this most clearly in the last couple of years when they wrestled pathetically with the need to reform the unsustainable superannuation tax concessions-those concessions that meant you could have $15 million in an account and pay not one cent of tax. We've made that point for years and we've been clobbered over the head. We put forward sensible policy in an election. At the last minute the government went, 'All right, okay, you've got a point; let's not talk about it, but we'll pocket some savings,' and then all hell broke loose, to put it politely, in the Liberal Party. They lost donors, they lost volunteers, and they say they almost lost the election through that stopping of the flow of cash from people who pay no tax. And now the poor member for Higgins is under siege and may not even be here if the preselection challenge is successful, because Jack Rush QC left the Liberal Party and has started up the 'anti the member for Higgins group' because he thinks he shouldn't have to pay any tax. That is exactly the kind of thing that happens to those opposite, so I do understand it's difficult for them when they try to make things a little bit fairer. I said at the start that most of the housing affordability package is a nothing package; it's actually integrity measures. That relates directly to the second reading amendment we have moved, suggesting that this is a sham. Unfortunately-and this goes very directly to the billnot all of the housing measures are innocuous. Indeed, some of them, the supposed budget centrepiece, are truly ridiculous. They're worse than a sham because they're actually damaging, like the ridiculous scheme to bastardise the superannuation scheme. We have the first home buyer super saver tax scheme. It is a mouthful. It's like the government thought, 'We'll throw as many fun words as we can into one policy and that will be appealing to young people.' It's a bad idea. It's a bad idea because, firstly, it fuels demand-remember that old supply-demand thing we touched on earlier? It puts more cash in buyers' pockets. It gives a tax break, which again is regressive, to save up to $30,000 to put towards a house. If you increase the demand for housing in an already hot market, it can only increase housing prices. The scheme will make matters worse for young people trying to buy their first home, and the only people this scheme really helps are those who want to see prices rise even further. I say this tax break is regressive, that r-word-making things better for people who have most and worse for those who have least-because the scheme, by its very nature, through the tax break, delivers the greatest benefit, surprise, surprise, to the highest income earners. Who knew? From the Liberal Party! It's fundamentally inequitable for those who are at the bottom of the income ladder and still dreaming of buying a home one day. The government's answer, and we've heard this story before, is to blame young people for not saving enough. At the same time that the government is already asking young people to put up with cuts to schools and universities; to pay more for a university degree; to run up bigger debts to go to uni or TAFE and then to pay their loans back earlier, when they start earning $42,000, which apparently is wealthy for this mob-who knew?-it is getting them stuck in a debt trap as they are trying to climb up this ladder of opportunity we keep hearing about, this mythical ladder. It is now asking young people to raid their retirement savings just to try to buy a house in a market that is already warped by investors. In a sensible world-the one where you listen to the economists and your advisers and all that kind of stuff-this is not only bad economic management but also ethically wrong. We are a parliament and a generation that is at serious risk of handing a lower standing of living to the next generation. That is shameful. It's no accident though. This government is complicit in this and is driving it. This scheme is also dangerous, as it undermines Australia's world-class superannuation system and hurts young Australians whose future is already uncertain, and I'm pleased and proud that the Labor Party is standing against this bill. Labor, of course, created Australia's superannuation guarantee and we will not see it undermined by the Liberal Party. Here is a fun fact as I drift towards closing: it was this government that introduced the Superannuation (Objective) Bill 2016 to parliament, and that bill proposed to legislate that the primary objective of the superannuation system was to 'provide income in retirement to substitute or supplement the age pension'. It doesn't say anything about providing a tax break or a tax rort for people to save $30,000 towards housing, to push up the cost of housingeven though that's about one-quarter of the median price rise in the capital city markets over last year. But that bill seems to have quietly dropped by the wayside. In the last couple of minutes of my time. I'll add a couple of comments about the proposed downsizing incentives for older Australians. I'm supportive of the notion that we should encourage downsizing. My mum was one, like many, who sat in her big house that she didn't need primarily because of the stamp duty barrier. I know that some state governments are starting to think about this, but I'm not convinced that the government's current policy as expressed in this bill will achieve the desired objective. The cruel hoax in this policy was laid bare in an excellent essay by Richard Denniss, in The Monthly a few months ago, called 'Grandfathering the Australian dream'. It looks at the consistent wealth transfer to those who already have property and are in the market away from those who are trying to get a foothold as the next generation. He said: There is some logic to encouraging older people to downsize their residence. But to suggest that allowing older Australians to tip some of their multimillion-dollar capital gain into tax-free superannuation accounts is an effective or equitable way to help young people buy or rent a house is yet another cruel hoax. If Australia is to be a genuinely fair nation we need to have genuine policies that are achieving genuine solutions to the housing affordability problem. First and foremost, residential property must be for providing affordable homes for people to live in, and policy has to be organised around that central objective. Fuelled by the tax system and those opposite we've ended up in la-la land, where housing has preferred tax treatment and is the destination of choice for spare capital. This is profoundly dumb economic policy by the economic geniuses opposite. The Australian people had a clear choice in this area at the last election and will have a clear choice at the next election. We will reform the unsustainable, regressive, damaging, distorting tax concessions that overwhelmingly benefit those who already have a foothold in the property market and who continue to work to push up prices faster than incomes and so lock out young people from the hope of ever owning a house. would like to thank all members of the House who made contributions in this debate, with some exceptions. It is quite shocking to see any political party take a view that a tax cut for first home buyers is something they cannot support-so, instead of paying money to the Australian Taxation Office, having that money redirected to savings towards a deposit for a house-and this is quite surprising to me. Nonetheless, I thank everyone on our side of the House and members of the crossbench for their contributions. I also want to note the misconceptions-very deliberate, I suspect, in most cases and, in some cases, born out of ignorance-put forward by some members opposite. Firstly, the First Home Super Saver Scheme is not an attack on superannuation. It just provides individuals with an opportunity to save more money, voluntary contributions that wouldn't otherwise",123,Bills
114,Mr Sukkar (Deakin,"Assistant Minister to the Treasurer) (16:33): In summing up, Ienter superannuation to be put into superannuation for the purposes of a first home deposit. Individuals' retirement savings are not a target of this measure, despite the quite disingenuous or ignorant scaremongering of some opposite. With average fund returns exceeding the deemed rate of return under the scheme, the average user will likely end up with more super in their account, not less, even after they have withdrawn those amounts to purchase their first property. And, of course, in the unlikely event that there is a market downturn, individuals' retirement savings will be protected, as they will have full control over the amounts that they withdraw. Secondly, this is not an inflationary measure. In fact, it's obviously Labor's ill-thought-out negative gearing housing tax that will actually push more first home buyers out of the market, because that, as we know, will hike up rents and will confine all new developments, which are typically the province of first home buyers, as being the only place that investors will go, being the only place that tax-preferred status will exist. So it will do quite the opposite. Thirdly, members should be assured that all contributions will be tracked by the ATO through monthly reporting requirements. I want to reassure members that this measure did commence on 1 July and voluntary contributions made since then will be eligible for release after 1 July 2018. It's clear from his statements that the member for McMahon just doesn't understand the measure, because his focus has not been on the legislation but instead on the Facebook posts of the Treasurer, which was one of the more curious contributions to the debate. In summing up, the First Home Super Saver Scheme will of course help young Australians to get into the housing market by letting them build up a bigger deposit inside superannuation. Every dollar less that they have to pay to the tax office, which they can put into that superannuation account that will then be used as a deposit for their first home, is surely something that every single person of good conscience in this House should support. The scheme is based on providing a tax cut to additional voluntary savings and the additional benefit of higher earnings inside superannuation, compared with what you can get through a standard saving account, which we know is what prospective first home buyers use when saving for their deposit. Again, it won't negatively impact on first home buyers' retirement balances, because it's not based around the release of existing contributions: it just relates to voluntary additional contributions of sums that would never find their way into super in the first place. We know Australians are entering the housing market later in life than in previous generations, and with house prices high difficulty saving a deposit is clearly the biggest barrier to getting into the market. That's why these changes are essential and why we need to act now. The second aspect of this bill, which I was quite surprised to hear negative comments about from those opposite, is that older Australians will also be given flexibility to contribute proceeds of the sale of their home into superannuation. This, self-evidently, will help free up housing stock, in particular larger homes, for younger, growing families, because it will reduce the barriers for older Australians downsizing from homes that no longer meet their needs. The downsizing measure is intended to assist people aged 65 and over who are currently unable to contribute proceeds from the sale of their home into superannuation because of the restrictive existing caps. Fiscal restraints make allowing any exemption from the age pension means test much more difficult to achieve than this measure. These changes were announced in the budget and this bill gives effect to those announcements. I therefore enthusiastically commend these bills to the House. this the honourable member for McMahon has moved as an amendment that all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting other words. The immediate question is that the amendment moved by the member for McMahon be agreed to. The House divided. [16:44] (The Speaker-Hon.

119,Mr Bowen (Mcmahon) (16:58,"Here we have, for the second time this week,equipment deductions to outlays actually incurred by investors, and introducing an annual charge on foreign owners of under-utilised residential property. I will deal with each of these three measures in turn. The government's big idea when it comes to negative gearing reform-the government's big agenda, their bold and aggressive approach to negative gearing-is not to reform it, limit it to new properties or make sure it's fit for purpose but to say you can't claim for tax purposes the travel cost to get to your holiday house or your rental property under negative gearing. That's it; that's all they've got! It is a joke. It will do nothing to make housing more affordable. We don't oppose it; in fact, we think it's serviceable. But, of course, our policy is to completely reform negative gearing and actually add substantial amounts to the budget over the forward estimates and the decade. What we are seeing here is the most minor of tinkering which will do nothing to impact on housing affordability. Often you have a mixture of investment housing and holiday houses, and there's nothing wrong with that. Landlords can visit their investment house and check on it. There's nothing wrong with that, and it shouldn't be tax deductible, but to suggest that this is part of a wideranging housing affordability policy is a sick joke. Those who are struggling to get into the housing market look at the government's agenda and say: 'Seriously? This is what you've got? You're going to abolish the tax deductibility of travel to investment properties and you think that helps me get into the property market?' Young people across the country will look at this and shake their heads, and well they might, because the government's agenda is devoid of anything substantial. If this is the best they've got then people are entitled to be very cynical. The second measure involves limiting deductions for assets in residential premises, denying deductions for the decline in value of previously used depreciating assets used in gaining or producing assessable income from the use of residential premises for the purposes of residential accommodation. Again, this is minor tinkering. We don't object to it; we support it. We're all for ensuring that tax concessions are targeted. But they need to do much, much better than this. This is not a housing affordability measure. Treasury, in answer to a question on notice, said so. They said it's an integrity measure-an important thing, of course, but it does nothing to reduce the pressure on housing affordability. The final measure in these cognate bills is the charging of foreign owners of residential property when the property is not occupied or genuinely available on the rental market for at least six months of the year. The government estimates this will generate $16.3 million over the forward estimates. That's it-$16.3 million. Again, we don't oppose this but we have a better plan. We announced in our housing affordability policy that what we would do is coordinate through COAG a nationally consistent vacant property tax. To be clear: we would not be seeking the revenue. The revenue would go to the states. But we think it should be done in a nationally consistent fashion. Some states have gone down this road. Victoria was the first to introduce a vacant property tax-and congratulations to Tim Pallas, who's a very good reforming Treasurer of Victoria, because we do think it's appropriate that there be a vacant property tax. If a property is held, for whatever reason, and is not being rented out or lived in, it's doing nothing for the social fabric or to help people into the housing market, so there should be a price signal, a disincentive to do that. But it shouldn't just be about foreign owners; this should apply regardless of ownership. There are varying reports as to the number of vacant properties, but it's a surprising number. Many people would be surprised at how many properties are held vacant. It's not a particularly economically rational thing to do but some people do it, so sending a price signal is important. But why is it limited to foreign owners? In other jurisdictions it's not limited to foreign owners. Other places have done this and haven't limited it to foreign owners. It would make more sense to do this reform properly and work with the states cooperatively to coordinate a consistent rate. We should encourage states to take up a vacant property tax and have a consistent rate so that we don't have the regulatory disharmony of different rates but have one consistent rate across the country, with the revenue going to the states. Again, Treasury admitted in an answer to a question on notice that the states and territories weren't consulted in relation to this measure. It's also notable that the Treasury confirmed, in answer to a question on notice, that there wasn't a direct assumption about how many foreign owners of residential property would decide to make their properties available for rent as a result. No modelling-a theme emerges in the government's approach. So, again, this is really pretty ordinary tinkering on the part of the government. As I mentioned, we will not be opposing these bills. But this is Clayton's reform. This is the reform that you have when you have to pretend to be reforming. You can just imagine the Prime Minister talking to the Treasurer and saying, 'We've got to have an announceable; we've got to have something we can announce.' They might have said, 'It doesn't have to be real, it doesn't actually have to have any impact, but we've got to have some measures that we can talk about in the budget, and then we can talk about our housing affordability plan.' We haven't heard the Treasurer say much about these since the budget, and there's a good reason for that. These are just so minor and so tangential to the reform task that's necessary across the country that you would be surprised if he spent much time talking about them. I'll talk about our negative gearing reforms at any opportunity, as my colleagues know. My colleagues will talk about our negative gearing reforms at any opportunity, because they're all proud of them, as the Labor Party should be, because we're leading the debate; we're actually taking on the difficult issues. We know that not everybody agrees with us. Whenever you engage with sensible but big tax reform you're going to have people who are against it, who run a scare campaign or who don't like it in the context of their personal circumstances. But we're being honest with the Australian people about our agenda. We want to win the next election with a mandate to do big and important things-not the sort of tinkering we see from this government, which has run out of puff and run out of a reform agenda. SoI move: That all the words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the bill and related bill a second reading, the House notes that any housing affordability package that does not include reforms to negative gearing and capital gains tax is a sham"". And that's what it is. We have from this government a housing affordability package that is a sham. The Treasurer has a big lever at his disposable. That lever is negative gearing reform and capital gains tax reform. Does he pull on the lever? No, he doesn't. He casts around looking for something small that he can then use to pretend he has an agenda when it comes to housing affordability, and that's what we're seeing in this legislation today. Well, we'll get on with the job. We'll pull the big levers available to us to improve housing affordability for young people in particular-that is, reforming the most generous property investment tax concessions in the world that we have in Australia, putting a more level playing field in place for first home buyers, getting rid of the situation whereby we provide more support for people buying their fifth, sixth or seventh home than people receive to get their first home and making our budget fairer, making our tax system fairer and improving housing affordabilitynot this sort of pathetic tinkering that we're seeing from the government. Mr Brendan O'Connor: I second the amendment. time. To this, the honourable member for McMahon has moved as an amendment that all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting other words. If it suits the House, I will state the question in the form that the amendment be agreed to. The question now is that the amendment be agreed to. I call the honourable member for Fairfax. take his tie and shirt off and start beating his chest during his contribution on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Housing Tax Integrity) Bill 2017 and related legislation. Such bravery: the big silverback from the Labor Party drags his knuckles across to the dispatch box and tries to claim-and this was the entire theme of his contribution, and he said it I think three times-'This all you got?' Says the big, brave silverback, 'This all you got?' The problem is that what the silverback is suggesting would actually give an entire backhander-not to the government, but to the Australian economy. It would completely smash long standing, proven tax principles while, by the way-in true Labor form-introducing new taxes. It would totally crash property prices and completely destabilise rental markets. So I'm glad the silverback kept his tie and shirt on. And for the sake of the Australian economy, thank God he is not the Treasurer of this country. I rise today to support this bill. We're talking about homeownership and property investment. For the past 20 years it has been difficult to imagine a topic that is more consistently talked about around the dinner tables across Australia. The footy and the cricket all have off-seasons, but not this topic. Obsession with residential real estate rolls on and on, following every twist and turn and every up and down of the market. It's a roller-coaster. It seems that the almost irresistible lure of property, whether for occupation or speculation, is a shared characteristic found deep within the DNA of most Australians. However, times are changing. Today, the great Australian dream of owning your own property, and in particular owning your own home, is slipping beyond the grasp of many Australians and is becoming a distant dream. The recent Grattan Institute analysis of the 2016 census data shows a continual decline in homeownership in all but the 65-plus age group. There has been a steady decline over the past 30 years, coupled with an unprecedented increase in housing prices. This has resulted in an extraordinarily high mortgage-to-income ratio of 25 per cent for 25to 34-year-olds. Those who have traditionally transitioned to homeownership by their 30s and 40s are staying longer in the rental market, placing increased pressure on the reliable supply of affordable rental properties, especially around locations where employment and career prospects are best. While it has long been the norm in Europe, and to a lesser degree in the United States, for there to be a far higher proportion of long-term and even lifelong tenants",131,Bills

122,Mr Ted O'brien (Fairfax) (17:08,"I'm surprised that the member for McMahon didn'tthan owner-occupiers, this is a relatively new challenge for Australia, one that flies in the face of our traditional aspirations and, perversely, is at odds with the sense of boundless space that has come to define us as the only people on earth with an entire continent to ourselves. While these observations are demonstrably true, it must be said that the Australian real estate market, both for sales and rentals, is inherently patchy. In Australia, not all markets are equal, and not all locations experience the same phenomena at the same time. You could, in fact, liken the Australian residential property market to a rolling earthquake, with powerful epicentres in Sydney and in Melbourne and shockwaves radiating outwards, striking satellite and secondary markets later-sometimes much later, if at all. There is one key observation here, which is that the challenge of housing affordability is most critically acute in Sydney and Melbourne, followed at quite some distance by Canberra and still further by Brisbane. This is such a crucial point, as it highlights the danger of taking a heavy-handed, silverbacklike, one-size-fits-all sledgehammer approach when addressing this problem, because it's a problem that runs the full gamut of market variability, all the way from a full-blown supplydriven affordability crisis in middle to inner Sydney to almost the reverse situation elsewhere around the nation. That is why this government has sought to introduce a suite of measures through a targeted and comprehensive plan to reduce pressure on housing affordability, as opposed to dangerous market manipulations involving the removal of negative gearing and capital gains provisions, as is currently being advanced by an economically hapless opposition and hapless shadow Treasurer. The Turnbull government prefers to take a more sophisticated and sensitively nuanced approach to addressing housing affordability and supply in both the selling and rental markets, especially in those markets that need it most. The bills before the chamber today further reinforce a package of measures proposed by the government, reforms squarely aimed at improving housing affordability and rental availability by implementing key provisions of the 2017 budget. There are three key reforms in this bill. The first two seek to strengthen the integrity of the tax system, while the third goes to boosting the supply of rental properties in key markets. The housing tax integrity bill makes changes to the Income Tax Assessment Act to tighten existing laws and remove tax deductions relating to travel expenses for individual investors when visiting their residential investment properties. Frankly, I think we all know that some residential property investors have been rorting the system, some for many years, by claiming expensive annual holidays as tax deductions on the pretext of inspecting or maintaining their conveniently located investment property. Well, the jig is up. This bill makes a very welcome amendment, removing this deduction for individual investors without affecting genuine claims for third-party property management services. Aside from the expectation that this reform will reclaim an estimated $540 million over the forward estimates, small business is also set to gain, with likely increased demand for local property services-everything from professional property managers to handyman service providers. This means jobs. We in the coalition just can't help ourselves: by instinctively helping small business, we help those businesses to grow and create more jobs, even when the direct aim of a reform, such as this one, is in fact something else. The second proposed amendment to the Income Tax Assessment Act closes another loophole by limiting depreciation deductions on plant and equipment assets, such as dishwashers and air conditioners, to only the original purchaser of that asset. Under the current system, depreciation may be claimed by consecutive property owners, in many cases to an amount well in excess of the value of the asset. In provisions allowing some relaxation for new residential property investments purchased within six months of completion, and providing a grandfathering mechanism for existing investments, the benefits of extensive community and stakeholder consultation on this and related measures is plain to see. These changes make perfectly good sense. They will remove another obvious abuse of the tax system and better target deductions for residential investment properties. Complementing these reforms, which improve taxation integrity and assist housing affordability, is a crucial amendment to the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act-a reform to help unlock the supply of rental accommodation right where it is needed most and reduce pressure on housing affordability. First, some context. The 2016 census revealed that 11.2 per cent of homes were unoccupied on census night. That is over one million empty homes. Granted, many of these would have been unoccupied holiday homes, homes under renovation or those belonging to people on holidays; however, when seen in the context of a 14.3 per cent rise in the national occupancy rate over the decade-conceding market variations and vacancy rates across state capitals-this strongly suggests many investment properties are being deliberately left unoccupied, particularly in supply-depleted state capitals. The Turnbull government is responding to genuine community concerns on this issue. We are acting to improve the supply of rental accommodation in key capital city markets, and this measure is intended to do precisely that. By amending the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act to establish a significant annual vacancy charge on foreign owners of residential properties who leave them unoccupied for six months in any 12-month period, the government is providing a strong financial incentive to have the properties tenanted. This is good news on two fronts: firstly, for those looking to rent, and secondly, and perhaps less immediately, for those looking to buy. By releasing supply back into the market, either for rent or for sale, housing affordability is expected to be improved, particularly in strained inner-city markets, which have traditionally seen higher levels of foreign investor activity in recent years. Unlike Labor's own ill-conceived housing affordability plan, designed to disrupt the long standing principles of taxation, to smash property prices and to completely destabilise the rental markets across Australia, the coalition prefers to utilise a comprehensive suite of subtle targeted reforms that will assist pressured markets to self-correct and return to balance. However, it must be said that even the Labor Party can find little fault with this reform. That is why, despite their poor attempts at mockery, they stand with the government in wishing to support this bill. There is also a fine balance to consider here, where the government must ensure adequate, affordable housing for Australians while at the same time continuing to encourage sustainable, job-creating foreign investment. That's what we are doing with this bill. By creating the right incentives to strengthen the integrity of Australia's tax system, while helping to unlock supply, this government is delivering on its commitment to improve housing affordability for all Australians. For that reason I'm delighted to commend this bill to the House. two bills, which seek to implement three of the government's 2017-18 budget measures,",134,Bills
123,Mr Thistlethwaite (Kingsford Smith) (17:20,"I'm speaking in support of theseostensibly related to housing affordability. Schedule1 of the Treasury Laws Amendment (Housing Tax Integrity) Bill 2017 amends the Income Tax Assessment Act to ensure that travel expenditure incurred in gaining or producing assessable income from residential premises is not deductible; and not recognised in the cost base of the property for capital gains tax purposes. This particular amendment seeks to address concerns that some taxpayers have been claiming travel deductions without correctly apportioning costs or have been claiming travel costs that were for private purposes. The amendments are not intended to affect deductions for institutional investors in residential premises, nor are they intended to affect deductions for travel expenditure incurred in carrying on a business. That's a very important distinction to make. It's clearing up an area of our law where tax concessions have been too generous, but this bill doesn't go far enough in respect of those generous tax concessions that exist in housing, particularly when it comes to investment properties. I'm speaking, of course, of negative gearing and the capital gains tax discount, which this government has allowed to stay in place and refuses to tackle, fuelling an explosion in house prices, particularly in Sydney and Melbourne. Basically, although we are supporting this particular measure, the bill simply doesn't go far enough. If the government were fair dinkum about tackling housing affordability and taking the upward pressure off house prices, particularly in markets like Sydney and Melbourne, they would look at this issue of negative gearing. If two people rock up to an auction on the weekend to compete for a house, and one of them is an investor, who may be going to negatively gear their seventh or eighth investment property, they get more support from the government than the other, who is going along to seek to buy their first home and get a foot in the door of the market. That is simply unfair and something that Labor stands against. Schedule2 of the bill amends the Income Tax Assessment Act to deny income tax deductions for the decline in the value of previously used depreciating assets used in gaining or producing assessable income from the use of residential premises for the purposes of residential accommodation. These bills will implement an annual vacancy fee on foreign owners of residential real estate where residential property is not occupied or genuinely available on the rental market for at least six months in a 12-month period. The Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Fees Imposition Amendment (Vacancy Fees) Bill 2017 imposes the vacancy fee and establishes the amount payable. Broadly, the fee which will be payable when the dwelling is left vacant is the fee that was payable at the time of the foreign investment application. Labor support these measures, and we won't oppose them. It's clear, however, that these aren't about housing affordability. These are, plain and simple, primarily integrity measures. When it comes to housing affordability the government is unwilling to do what's necessary to tackle these issues of negative gearing and capital gains tax. That represents just how out of touch the government is. In the electorate that I represent not a week goes by where I don't get a complaint or a concern from a constituent, predominantly a parent or grandparent, worried and concerned about the fact that their kids will never be able to afford to buy a home in the community that they grew up in around their family networks and friends. In modern-day Australia, that's a great shame. It represents a failing of government. It's incumbent upon governments to ensure that housing is affordable for Australians as really housing is a human right. I've discussed in this place in the past the reality of attempting to buy a home in the community that I live in. In the last three years-2014 to 2017-the price of a home in the suburb of Malabar has grown by a whopping 46 per cent to an average of $2 million, adding $635,000 to the value. That equates to an increase of $580 every single day. That is how much the value of properties in Malabar has gone up every single day, on average. In Coogee the case is no different: on average, prices there have grown by $592 every day to just under $2.4 million. These are the eye-watering facts about the area that I represent. As you can imagine, it's causing considerable concern among people struggling to enter the housing market and struggling with the soaring costs of rents associated with that generally high cost of living. The seriousness of this issue requires a serious approach. Unfortunately, the government are not giving that serious consideration. Their total indifference to the fact that they're completely out of touch on this issue has left Australians facing unprecedented financial pressures when it comes to housing affordability. This week we've seen the government fail to alleviate another area of cost pressure for households, with their so-called plan for energy. They've come up blank when it comes to dealing with this issue. All we're going to see is household electricity prices continuing to increase into the future. Investors have been given a leg up for too long by this government when it comes to the housing market. It's absolutely unacceptable that a person going along to an auction this weekend to purchase their seventh or eighth investment property will get a tax deduction from this government to negatively gear over the years to come and gets more support from the government than a young couple that may be just married and are seeking to buy their first home. Australia has a progressive taxation system, and improving the fairness of that system should be a key priority. Currently the way that system works is unfair, because 50 per cent of the benefit of negative gearing goes to the top 10 per cent of income earners. The people that are benefiting from this outdated system, the most generous tax concessions in the world for property investors, are the wealthiest Australians. The top 10 per cent are absolutely getting the benefit from this. Fifty per cent of those benefits go to the top 10 per cent. When it comes to capital gains tax concessions and discounts, the problem gets even worse, because in terms of the capital gains tax discount-the 50 per cent discount on the capital gain that you make from selling an investment property-70 per cent of that benefit goes to the top 10 per cent of income earners. That says everything about the inequity that exists in the housing market at the moment which is fuelling outrageous increases in prices. When it comes to superannuation we have a similar scenario, where 30 per cent of the benefit of superannuation tax concessions goes to the top 10 per cent of income earners. If you're fair dinkum about tackling some of those issues and bringing a bit of equity into the system, you need to look at that system of negative gearing and capital gains tax discounts and who's benefiting from them. Ultimately, you're shrinking the pie of homeownership for the majority of Australians by providing a tax concession that encourages the few to invest in more. First home buyers now only make up around 13 per cent of all home purchasers-well below the historic average of 20 per cent. This is quite an alarming trend. With housing making up 60 per cent of all assets owned by Australian households, it has become a source of great frustration and misery for those who are missing out in our society. For many, home ownership has transformed from a dream into a nightmare. That's something that Labor have been listening to the community about and are serious about changing. We want to end some of the imbalance that exists in our taxation system at the moment when it comes to overly generous, massive concessions that benefit the most wealthy in our country at the expense of the majority. Labor will build on our existing proposals with new policies to improve housing affordability, to increase supply, to boost jobs and to reduce economic risks. We've announced a housing affordability policy. It's been there for some years. We announced it in the lead-up to the last election, and we haven't been a small target on this issue. We have been willing to listen to the community and willing to do the necessary legwork when it comes to the economic modelling and working out how changing the system would affect the market. We've announced the policy, and we've had the policy independently modelled and independently costed, importantly, by the Parliamentary Budget Office. That has indicated that the policy raises additional revenue-not only over the forward estimates but over the medium term-that we can put back into the budget to ensure we properly invest in schools and hospitals. It will also create 25,000 new jobs per year in Australia and over 55,000 new homes over three years to boost those employment numbers. The elements of the policy are quite simple. Firstly, we'll reform negative gearing and ensure that it's restricted to new housing stock. Anyone that's currently in the system will be grandfathered. So, it's an orderly transition. There's no dramatic change for people who are currently in the system. If you're negatively gearing a property, you'll be able to continue to do so. But, from a particular date in the future, if Labor is elected, negative gearing will be restricted to those people seeking to buy off-the-plan developments. That will boost the housing supply and create jobs in this sector. We will reduce the capital gains tax discount on the sale of investment properties by half-reducing the generosity of a policy that, when it was introduced by Peter Costello as the former Treasurer of this country during the Howard government years, was unfunded. That says everything about the profligacy of that particular government and the spend-at-all-costs approach that they had-which we are all paying for now. It was that government that introduced policies like the 50 per cent discount on capital gains tax, the changes to superannuation and uncapping payments for people. Those policies were unfunded. In other words, there was no source of funding for them in the budget. We are all paying for that now. Not only were they bad policies; they were irresponsible fiscal policies and Australians are paying for them now. But we will fix that. We will: reduce the capital gains tax discount on the sale of investment properties by half; facilitate a COAG process to introduce a uniform vacant property tax across all major cities; limit direct borrowing by self-managed superannuation funds that invest in property; increase foreign investors fees and penalties; establish a bond aggregator to increase investment in housing affordability; boost homelessness support for vulnerable Australians; get better results from the national rental affordability agreement; re-establish, importantly, the Housing Support Council; and, importantly, make sure that there's a seat at the cabinet table for a minister for housing who can advocate on behalf of Australians about the importance of this issue. That is a set of policies that demonstrates a party is fair dinkum about the issue of housing affordability in this country. That's a serious housing affordability policy. That's what a serious housing affordability policy looks like. It is fully costed, it is independently verified that it will work, it will create 25,000 jobs in the economy and it will boost housing supply by 55,000 dwellings over the course of three years. It is independently costed and independently modelled, and it is something that will work. That's what Australia needs if we're going to tackle this housing affordability crisis. Only Labor are fair dinkum about making sure that we tackle the issues of negative gearing and capital gains tax and that we produce a bit of affordability in the housing market in Australia to ensure that particularly those young families who are seeking to get into the market have the opportunity to get a dwelling and a roof over their head and to live, importantly, close to their families and in the communities which they grew up in. Laws Amendment (Housing Tax Integrity) Bill 2017 and the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Fees Imposition Amendment (Vacancy Fees) Bill 2017. The legislation before the House takes practical steps to ensure that we have a strong rental market and that people are not taking advantage of our tax system. The Treasurer outlined an array of measures in his budget speech earlier this year to ensure integrity and stability in the real estate market. Yesterday, I spoke on key legislation that will help first home buyers supercharge their savings as they plan to purchase their first home. I also spoke about incentives for older Australians to downsize, opening up the market for growing families. Today, I rise to speak on legislation that is aimed at improving our rental property market and the integrity of our tax system. I'll outline, firstly, measures that impose the framework of our tax system with regard to deductions for rental properties and assets and, secondly, measures that ensure the rental market increases the number of homes available to Australians. The bill focuses on individuals who claim travel expenses when visiting their rental properties. I was speaking to one constituent who was telling me that he owned and managed his properties in Bundaberg, approximately 340 kilometres from his home. He was very concerned about the discontinuation of his ability to claim a deduction for travelling to and from his rental properties; he felt that it would not be financially viable to continue managing his properties. These proposed amendments don't prevent investors from engaging third parties to provide property management services. These services will still remain deductible. Yes, this bill does limit people travelling to their property and claiming deductions for travel. That's no longer going to be available. SoI would say to people, if you're going to drive 340 kilometres return to visit your house to do a bit of maintenance on it, it's probably more viable to ensure that a local handyman, plumber or gardener-for whatever it is that you need doing-in that area services the property for you. That would make a lot more sense. Unfortunately, we've seen some people take advantage in relation to this claim when they've actually been on holidays and so forth. They have been treating the system unfairly. For example, a person living in New South Wales who owns a home on Queensland's sunny Gold Coast may decide to take a trip up to their unit once or twice a year to inspect it, replace a flyscreen or put some mulch on the gardens. However, the primary purpose of their trip was a holiday; it was to enjoy the beaches and maybe do just a little bit of handyman work. That's fine. They can still have an investment property there, but their airfares to fly or to drive there and return won't be tax deductible. So from here on in it might be worth it getting a real estate agent to manage that property and to use the services of local tradespeople in that area. I noted",136,Bills
124,Mr Howarth (Petrie) (17:35,"It gives me great pleasure to speak on the Treasurypreviously-and I want to emphasise this to property investors-that maintenance is still fully deductible, but I encourage all people to employ a local tradie and help boost the economy and then claim those expenses back on their tax return. You can still maintain your rental properties. However, you can no longer claim your airfares or any associated travel costs for your trip. The bill also tackles another integrity measure regarding generous valuations for plant and equipment purchased. We are cracking down on property owners claiming depreciation of assets that were part of their original contract when they purchased the property. So if you've bought a new property and the dishwasher was included or some type of vehicle or machinery was included, you've really purchased that as part of the property price. You've really got that as part of the value. You won't get to also depreciate that asset when it's being purchased as part of that property. I'd like to expand on some key aspects of the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Fees Imposition Amendment (Vacancy Fees) Bill 2017. The government is very aware of the importance of foreign investment. However, we want to discourage foreign investors from buying real estate in Australia and leaving it empty for months or even years on end. If a person from overseas, perhaps living in Europe, bought a house in Australia, firstly they would need to seek approval through the Foreign Investment Review Board, commonly called FIRB. Key to this approval is that foreign investors are allowed to purchase only new properties in Australia-not renovated homes but brand-new houses, townhouses or units. This legislation we are debating today ensures that owners of non-residential foreign investment homes prove that their property in Australia is being rented out for at least six months a year. Otherwise, they will be charged a vacancy fee. The fee will vary depending on the property. For example, a $600,000 property would be charged $5,500, whereas a property valued at $2 million would be charged $22,300 if the property is left vacant. The purpose of this is to ensure that these properties are not left vacant. It's to free up accommodation for Australians to rent, to make sure that there is plenty of supply for Australians. And this is very important. New properties have to be bought so that the supply increases, but we also want to make sure that those properties are rented out. I want to stress that these amendments do not apply to Australians. So, for Aussies who own a home, wherever in the country it is-in Townsville or Cairns, or in Western Australia-and who use that home only during school holidays, for a few months a year, that is okay. That is up to them. They can continue to do that if it's a holiday home and they can afford to do so. So it doesn't affect Australians. We are serious about ensuring that strict regulatory practices are in place to protect Australia's real estate. There are multiple cases where investors have had to sell their property because they didn't have the correct approvals through FIRB. The Treasurer has ordered the forced sale of 61 houses since the coalition was elected, totalling over $107 million. Labor cannot be trusted with foreign investment. The member for McMahon, who spoke earlier, when he was the Assistant Treasurer made changes to the foreign investment legislation to make it easier for foreigners to buy property without any scrutiny at all. He dumped the screening arrangements for temporary residents to notify the Foreign Investment Review Board of residential purchases. When the opposition was in government, not one divestment order for a property was issued for illegally acquiring a property-not one. There have been 61 since we came in, totalling over $107 million. And the shadow foreign minister wants to change the Foreign Investment Review Board requirements for the purchase of agricultural land-wants to put it through the roof. The coalition brought it down to $15 million, and the Labor Party want to put it back up. In my electorate, people do not support that. They want to make sure there is a register that is accountable so that the government knows how much of our land is foreign owned. I remember that when the Kidman cattle station came up for sale people wanted to make sure it was majority Australian owned. They'd been very, very clear about that. So, taking that $15 million combined level-an aggregate level-and increasing it through the roof, as the shadow minister for foreign affairs, Senator Wong, wants to do, is not supported by my electorate and I suspect is not supported by the people in the electorates of many of those on the other side of the House. The coalition has been at the forefront of ensuring that foreign investment is regulated. As I said, we want to ensure that we know how much foreign investment we have in this country. It was a Liberal government that established the FIRB back in 1976. This non-statutory body was established to monitor foreign investment proposals and compliance within its policies. The coalition government have continually moved to improve our foreign investment framework. The government have also introduced tough new laws to ensure capital gains tax is paid by our foreign investors and those who purchase property whilst living in Australia on a visa. We want to ensure that taxes owed to the Australian government are paid here and not taken overseas, and this is a very important area that the coalition are also cracking down on. We have continually taken measures to ensure we know who is buying our land and to restrict the types of properties foreign investors are able to buy. This legislation is just another example of our government always looking to protect Australia's interests. Our government is committed to affordable housing. Ensuring our community has affordable housing and making sure that supply increases, and that the current supply is available for rent, provides options and ensures that there's much more housing available for those who need it most. Our goal is to increase the number of rental properties available for Australians to live in. I believe Labor's policy to try to fix the property market through abolishing negative gearing will only push house prices down and rental prices up. As an example, in my electorate, someone like Lisa and Todd might purchase a home for $450,000 up in Burpengary East in my electorate, or perhaps in Griffin in my electorate. They put a $35,000 deposit down. They don't have 20 per cent, so they'll probably be up for mortgage insurance as well. They currently would owe $415,000. Labor want to abolish negative gearing on existing homes. Lisa and Todd have got a new home, an existing home, and they will owe 415 grand on it, having purchased it for $450,000. If the value of that home drops by just five per cent when Lisa and Todd go to sell, it will be worth $425,000. That means, because of Labor's policy of abolishing negative gearing, they will have lost $25,000 of their own deposit. I see a lot of young couples in my electorate in this situation, with less than 20 per cent deposit. It would be great if they had a bigger deposit, but Labor is voting against our super saver scheme that will give those people and everyone in their electorate a $6,000 tax break. They're voting against young people who want to be able to do that, and I fear their policy could mean that people who buy a house and have to sell in a reasonable time frame will see the value of their house fall and, when they pay out their loan, there goes their deposit. The other thing, which we didn't campaign on in the last election-the coalition was very positive in the last election-concerns the people in my electorate, in Deception Bay, KippaRing and Clontarf, who rent. I've continually said that there are a lot of low-income people who won't buy their own home. They can't afford to buy their own home. There is always a percentage of Australians on lower wages and there needs to be lots of rental stock available. If people can't negatively gear then I like to say they'll have to positively gear. They'll have to make sure that the rent is covering the loan on that property. Right now interest rates are low-God help these people if the interest rate goes up. If interest rates go up, rents will go up significantly and you'll see a real housing crisis for the people in this country who can least afford it. Labor don't like this bill and the bill we introduced yesterday because they go a long way to addressing some of the excesses in the rental property market. People going on holidaystravelling-because of rental properties will be gone, and we will be making sure that people can't claim deductions for things when they were bought as part of a house. Sure, if the dishwasher or the air conditioner breaks down and they need to buy a new one, great, then they should be able to claim that as a deduction-but not when it has been purchased as part of the house and it's already part of the deal. The coalition has been moving on that. We also see Labor wanting, as I say, to not have the records that the coalition have kept in relation to foreign investment, which will see more foreign investment. They talk about wanting to make sure Australians have a big deal-this is important. It's good that the opposition is actually supporting this bill, as the shadow Treasurer has said. These bills are important steps in making sure that housing is more affordable and that there are more rental properties available-and they're good for our housing market and for my electorate in general. member for Petrie for confirming exactly what Labor's policy will deliver, when he said, 'If Labor's policy was adopted, prices would go down.' We know that at the moment that, for young people to get into the housing market, it is not the Australian dream; it is the Australian nightmare. We know from listening to middle Australia and listening to people who want to own their own home that the best way and the fairest way is to make sure there is a government in this nation that recognises and gives a tax break to people who want to enter the housing market, not one that rewards those who are looking at buying their eighth, ninth or 10th property. As we heard from the member for Kingsford Smith, Australia has the most generous negative gearing in the world when it comes to taxation. The government continues to dance around the issue of housing affordability whilst a generation of Australians face the prospect of simply being locked out of the housing market. Before the House tonight, we have the Treasury Laws Amendment (Housing Tax Integrity) Bill 2017 and the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Fees Imposition Amendment (Vacancy Fees) Bill 2017, both of which will do nothing to address the housing affordability that this government likes to claim it is doing something about-but which, by the way, are opening the door for young Australians to reduce their own superannuation savings. That was a debate we had last night in this chamber, so it's a bit like groundhog day when it comes to talking about housing affordability. But it is a really important issue for the constituents I represent in this place.",140,Bills
125,Mr Dick (Oxley) (17:50,"I rise to enter the debate today, and I want to thank theI know, from representing one of the fastest growing corridors in Australia, the battle-and it is a battle-that young people face to get into the housing market. I mentioned last night, here in this place, the submission from Industry Super Australia, in which they say that the First Home Super Saver Scheme-which we just heard about from the member for Petrie'potentially exacerbates the housing affordability problem' rather than does anything to address it, and 'also undermines the important goal of the superannuation system as a provider of adequate retirement income'. I said in my address to the House last night when dealing with this scheme that, since superannuation came into force-since the legislation was first enacted under the leadership of the Keating government, under the leadership of John Dawkins-the coalition have opposed it, and now they are undermining it. The government continues to tiptoe around the issue and put forward bills such as these. Make no mistake; these measures have nothing to do with housing affordability. Any housing affordability package that does not deal with negative gearing and the capital gains tax discount is a sham. That's why I am a strong supporter of the member for McMahon's amendment, which we will be voting on. I will be strongly supporting it, and I will be asking members of the government to think about and consider the measures before us tonight, but, more importantly, the amendment, which says: ""whilst not declining to give the bill and related bill a second reading, the House notes that any housing affordability package that does not include reforms to negative gearing and capital gains tax is a sham"". I say that very deliberately because, within the community I represent, I see the struggle that young people have with housing affordability. I note that, when my friend the member for Lindsay is out in her community, when any single Labor member is out in their community, and they talk to residents at shopping malls, markets, cafes, community groups and town halls-just as the Leader of the Opposition, Bill Shorten, does week in, week out, sitting down, rolling his sleeves up and listening to middle Australia-the issue of housing affordability comes through crystal clear. We've heard the message on this side of the House but, sadly, the government, with its tin ear and its out-of-touch Prime Minister, is sitting on its hands. We just heard about Tom and Lisa, constituents of the member for Petrie. I want to imagine that it's four years from now and, as a 22-year-old who maybe recently graduated with a degree in engineering, they've worked hard, their parents have supported them, and they can't wait to take the skills and knowledge that they learned, perhaps through university, a trade or TAFE, and now apply it to the real world. Maybe the last four years of study has been tough. Since moving out of home they've had to fork out for the expensive rents that come with living near enough to perhaps the closest capital city university or regional centre. They've been working more than 20 hours casually to support themselves through study, but it's all made tougher, we know, since the government has cut penalty rates. Sundays used to bring in that bit of extra cash to help with the groceries and increasing rents, or maybe the electricity costs or paying off your car or just getting out and about with your friends. Nonetheless, you have graduated from university and you're ready to take on the world. However, you quickly learn that the job market is very tough and finding employment in your field isn't as easy as you thought. The youth unemployment rate for people aged 15-24 is still double that of the national average. You're desperately keen to get your foot in the door, so you take an admin role, perhaps in a leading engineering firm, until something opens up for you. The starting pay is just $48,000 a year, but it's better than nothing. You soon learn that, because the government has cut the threshold for HELP repayments, your take-home pay is now even less. On top of that, you're hoping to land an entry-level engineering job. You also have hopes of saving up for the elusive home deposit. The government are proud to say that they're happy to do nothing about negative gearing. House prices have continued to rise, and the average home on the outskirts of a capital city has an asking price, if you're lucky, of $500,000. This issue has been bubbling around since the government, now in its fifth year, came to power. The previous Treasurer, Mr Hockey, said, 'Well, you should just go out and get a good job.' Moving forward, when the Prime Minister was asked on radio about how to get a deposit and own your home, the Prime Minister, straight from Point Piper, said, 'Well, have you thought about getting rich parents?' We know that in the real world that simply doesn't happen. With tight budgeting and maybe not eating any smashed avos, you're able to save $50 per week. The bank will require a 20 per cent deposit, meaning you have to save $100,000. At the current rate, this will take around 2,000 weeks to save-the next 38 years of your life. It's a sobering situation, but this is the one issue facing thousands and thousands of young people right across the country. I know from talking to mums and dads and grandparents in the suburbs that I represent that they talk about this. They deal with this issue: how do you get the 20 per cent deposit, with prices rising up and up? I understand it and members on this side of the chamber understand it. But, if you've never heard it or you've never lived in the real world, or perhaps you're not walking down the same shopping centre aisles or going to the same cafes or community meetings that I go to, you don't understand it. You don't understand what it's like being forced to scrape and save every single day just in order to own your own home. In doing so, young people are forced to take on record levels of debt that were unimaginable just two decades ago. For those who have been able to buy a home, mortgage debt among 18 to 39-year-olds doubled between 2002 and 2014, jumping from $169,000 to $336,000. This is not sustainable and cannot continue, which makes the government's one silver bullet-raiding your own super scheme-all the more crazy. They want young people to take on more debt and more risk to get into the housing market, so when you do finish your working life you're less prepared to have a guaranteed income. Their entry scheme, which we've just heard about from members of the government, would see demand for housing increase and push up prices even further. As we heard from the shadow Treasurer, what we must do is address the issue of negative gearing and the impact that it is having on homeownership rates. The recent report from the Grattan Institute highlighted that negative gearing has many undesirable consequences. It reduces rates of homeownership, it reduces the availability of long-term rentals and it increases the volatility of housing markets, increasing the risks to the Australian financial system. The Grattan Institute summed it up best when it said: The most obvious thing the Commonwealth Government could do is reduce the capital gains discount and abolish negative gearing. It wouldn't solve the problem but it would help. Everybody seems to get this and everybody seems to understand it, except the government. I've said it in this place before and I'll say it again: what will it take for this government to realise that it must follow Labor's lead and act on negative gearing and housing affordability? We on this side of the House understand it. We represent middle and working Australians proudly. They are crying out for leadership. They are crying out for someone to stand up for them. They simply don't believe the spin and the nonsense that comes from the government about raiding superannuation. It is not the answer; it will only make it worse. That's what they want to do-tinker at the edges with bills like the ones we're debating today and raid the superannuation accounts of young Australians to increase demand and push up property prices. We know the government doesn't believe in the integrity of the system of compulsory super. The government will look for any opportunity to weaken-not strengthen, but weaken-our system of superannuation. This is a government attempting to set a precedent that Australia's $2.3 trillion in retirement savings can be accessed for something other than what it was intended for-retirement income. It goes against the core objective of superannuation. We know from speaker after speaker from the government that they're not interested. They're not committed to dealing with the issue of housing affordability. When I speak to local families and mums and dads and grandparents, I know that they are worriedpeople in suburbs like Springfield Lakes, Springfield, Collingwood and Bellbird Park, which are seeing a huge amount of demand coming online. But the prices are being pushed up and up, and the government refuses to do anything when it comes to the supply side issue. I could go on about some of the other suburbs I represent, but I am no different from any other member in this House. Right across Australia, people are hearing the same message about housing affordability. Right across Australia, people want to see action so that their kids and grandkids have the same opportunity that everyone else had-the great Australian dream. The government simply aren't speaking with everyday Australians. They certainly aren't talking with potential first home buyers. Earlier today I was speaking in the Federation Chamber about the government's other pet issue-its other set obsession-which is giving a $65 billion tax cut, of which we know billions of dollars will go offshore and also to large multinational companies. If the government is serious about wanting our support for housing affordability and if it is serious about tackling these issues, it must, and it has to, look at the issue of negative gearing and capital gains tax. It's that simple. We have to have that conversation in the community, because the community is demanding it. Time and time again we've been calling on the government to listen to what the community is saying. Time and time again we have been calling on the government to listen to the superannuation industry, which is not supportive of what the government is doing to undermine our retirement income planning for this nation. If you're lucky enough to buy your seventh, eighth or ninth property, good luck to you-you've done well and you've been a success. All we're simply saying on this side of the chamber is that everyone deserves the opportunity to enter the market as a homeowner. But, more importantly, every young person in this country deserves the opportunity of owning their own home. thank all members who contributed to the debate. The 2017-18 budget demonstrates the government's commitment to reducing pressure on housing affordability so that homeownership is more achievable for Australians. This legislation delivers on this commitment by improving the integrity of Australia's tax system and boosting the availability of rental accommodation in the market.",143,Bills
126,Mr Sukkar (Deakin,"Assistant Minister to the Treasurer) (18:04): Firstly, I want toSchedule1 of the Treasury Laws Amendment (Housing Tax Integrity) Bill 2017 amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to disallow deductions for travel costs incurred in producing or gaining assessable income from residential premises as residential accommodation. The changes mean travel costs for individual investors, such as to inspect and maintain properties, will no longer be deductible. This will stop residential property investors from using the tax system to pay for their holidays by claiming costs as a rental expense. However, these changes don't prevent investors from engaging third parties, such as real estate agents, to provide property management services. These expenses will continue to be deductible. The change to disallow travel expense deductions has an estimated gain to revenue of $540 million over the forward estimates. Schedule2 of this bill amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to limit, from 1 July 2017, plant and equipment deductions for investors in residential investment properties to assets not previously used. There has been an abuse of the tax system when it comes to property investors claiming excessive deductions for plant and equipment items. These changes will improve the integrity of the tax system by better targeting these deductions. Investors who purchase new plant and equipment for their residential investment property after 9 May 2017 can continue to claim a deduction over the effective life of the asset. However, subsequent owners will not be able to claim deductions for those plant and equipment items. These changes will not affect capital works depreciation deductions relating to residential property investments. The change to limit depreciation deductions has an estimated gain to revenue of $260 million over the forward estimates. These changes, together with the change to deny travel deductions, improve the integrity of the tax system and reduce the opportunities for excessive deduction claims. Schedule3 of this bill, along with the imposition bill, implements an annual vacancy charge on foreign owners of residential real estate where property is not occupied or genuinely available on the rental market for at least six months in any 12-month period. The vacancy charge builds on the government's existing foreign investment regime, which seeks to increase the number of houses available for Australians to live in. The charge provides a financial incentive for the foreign owner to make their property available on the rental market. The charge payable will be equivalent to the residential application fee that was paid by the foreign person at the time the application to purchase the property was made to the Foreign Investment Review Board. The vacancy charge applies to foreign persons who make a foreign investment application for residential property from 7.30 pm on 9 May 2017. For eligible foreign owners of residential real estate the vacancy charge will be levied on an annual basis. The annual vacancy charge is expected to result in greater use of foreign owned properties. Reporting and notification requirements are also expected to provide greater visibility of vacancy rates for foreign owned properties. The Australian Taxation Office will administer the vacancy charge. The changes contained in the legislation have been designed to open up the residential rental market and strengthen the integrity of Australia's tax system. I therefore commend the bills to the House. now read a second time.

Ms O'NEIL (Hotham) (18:11): All of us in this House have in our lives children who are important to us. I am the mother of oneand four-year-old boys who are the centre of my existence, and I'm a former foster parent. The welfare of Australian children is one of the driving passions of my life, as a person and as a politician. I talked about this in my first speech. Every time a child in this country is abused, harmed by another person, this parliament has failed. It is our job to protect them. That much should be beyond debate. But we fail far too often. The sexual abuse of children is abhorrent. It sickens me and it sickens everyone in this parliament. I believe, and Labor believes, that the people who commit these crimes must be punished. Most sex crimes are state offences, but as a Commonwealth parliament we play an important and growing role in protecting Australian children. We are responsible for offences that relate to telecommunications and offences that occur overseas, and it is child abuse occurring in these contexts that is the subject of most of this bill, the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Sexual Crimes Against Children and Community Protection Measures) Bill 2017.",147,Bills
128,Mr Sukkar (Deakin,Assistant Minister to the Treasurer) (18:09): by leave-I move:,148,Bills
129,Mr Sukkar (Deakin,"Assistant Minister to the Treasurer) (18:11): by leave-I move:I have the great privilege of working with a lot of organisations within my portfolio area that protect Australian children. One of them is the Alannah& Madeline Foundation. You would remember Alannah and Madeline. They were three and six years old when they were tragically killed in the Port Arthur massacre. The organisation that is their namesake was created by their very brave father, Walter Mikac. The CEO of that organisation is fond of saying that protecting children on the internet is the defining child protection issue of our age, and I don't think any parliamentarian or any parent in the community would have a different view about that. The reality is that children today face dangers that didn't exist 10 years ago. They didn't exist when any of us in this chamber were children. These changes are not academic. They are not the invention of tabloid newspapers. They are absolutely and completely real. In this country we are seeing massive growth in the number of people who are viewing and sharing child abuse images. Indeed, the volume is so large that the Federal Police do not have the ability to investigate and prosecute more than a very small proportion of perpetrators. The Australian Federal Police receive more than 10,000 reports of child exploitation every year, and we know that that number is growing every year-and they are just the offences that we are aware of. We are seeing incredibly disturbing trends with how the crimes in this area are changing on the internet. We're seeing sexual predators target children to produce abuse materials themselves on apps that many of the children of people in all of our communities use-things like Snapchat and musical.ly. We are seeing the growth of absolutely disgusting trading and selling of child abuse materials on the dark net. We are seeing a growth in the use of FaceTime and Skype to target the abuse of children who are living in poor countries right throughout our region. The Philippine National Police receive over 6,000 cybersex abuse case referrals every month from other law enforcement agencies around the world. I want to take a moment to mention the men and women working in the Australian Federal Police who have to review, handle and classify this material when they go to work every day. I cannot say how strongly I commend the bravery of the officers who undertake this work. It is so difficult that the Australian Federal Police officers who do it have to work constantly in pairs-they're not allowed to work on this alone-and they have to have regular psychological check-ups. I know from talking to Australian Federal Police officers that the sole reason they go to work to do this, frankly, traumatic work every day is that they care so deeply for the children who are at the other end of these images. I know we speak as one voice as a parliament when we say how much we truly appreciate the efforts of those officers. Labor believes that, due to these extensive changes in the way that child abuse is proliferating online, there is a need to review the law in this area. That is why the opposition will be supporting this bill, with some amendments. I want to talk about some of the areas that we believe are particularly worthy of support in this bill. One of those is the additional supports that this law will provide to vulnerable witnesses. In this context, of course, we're referring mainly to children who are going to sit in court and testify against adults who are older, who are stronger and who are much more powerful than they are. Those children exhibit incredible bravery in their willingness to tell their stories to try to prevent further abuse of other children. They deserve every protection that the law can provide to them, and we are very pleased to see some improvements made in the bill before the House in this area. We are supportive of the new grooming offences that are contained in the bill, and we're supportive of the clarification this bill provides on the scope of some of the child sex offences that are contained in the Criminal Code. We also support the change in the terminology that is contained in this bill. The bill changes the words that we use to describe the material in question to 'child abuse materials'. This may sound like a small thing, but it is absolutely not. We talk often in the public realm about this problem being called child pornography, but that does not recognise the seriousness and the abject criminality that is at the heart of these images. These images harm children in their creation. But every time these images are accessed and every time they are viewed, there is an additional violence and an additional abuse being undertaken. That is because, every time those images are looked at, there is further humiliation done to that child. Every time those images are looked at, there are citizens of this country who are doing something to support an industry which only thrives and survives on the abuse of some of the most vulnerable people in our community. Labor is of the view that the crimes contained in this bill are so horrendous that there are in fact some areas that need a much tougher approach. I want to talk about some of the amendments that Labor will be making to this bill to make sure that the paedophiles who are harming children are locked up for as long as we can manage. Child sex abuse which involves subjecting the child to cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment, or which causes the death of that child, is barbaric. We want courts to be able to lock up people who commit this horrendous crime-really, what must be the worse crime that can be committed. We want judges to have the power to put those people away for life. Labor will move amendments in the Senate to bring in life imprisonment for aggravated sex offenders. Labor will be moving further amendments to increase the maximum sentences for the most serious child sex crimes by five years, to 20 and 25 years imprisonment. We believe that predators who go overseas to prey on and abuse vulnerable children should face tougher penalties than those the government has proposed. Labor are particularly sickened by the examples that we are aware of where vile website moderators encourage other people who are part of these horrendous networks to commit crimes against children. People who incite violence and cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment against children deserve further punishment. They are the despicable ringleaders of these child abuse networks. They facilitate the production and distribution of sometimes sadistic and brutal material, and courts must be able to punish them appropriately. Labor will be moving amendments to add aggravated offences to target these vile criminals. We will also target offenders who play a role in coordinating, organising or inciting other people's participation in these most serious sex offences with new aggravating sentencing factors. We want child sex offenders to be appropriately punished and we want to focus on the worse offenders because bringing them down is critical to stopping the proliferation of these absolutely sickening crimes. Labor have looked at and tackled this bill with only one issue in mind, and that is the protection of children. That is our only goal here. The government's bill contains mandatory minimum sentences, and this is the only section of the bill that we will oppose. We will do that because these sections of the bill will not make Australian children safer. We made this decision very thoughtfully and with extensive expert advice. There is almost a uniform view in the law enforcement and legal community that this is a legal device which will not further protect Australian children-indeed, it may have the opposite effect. Prosecutors are opposed to this measure, and the Law Council and just about every other organisation like them are opposed to it. In fact, the Attorney-General's Department, part of the government that sits on the other side of the House, is also opposed to this measure. Mandatory minimums let guilty people off the hook because juries are less likely to convict them when they know there is no discretion about the sentence. Mandatory minimums mean that criminals will not cooperate with police to bring the kingpins who run these networks to justice. I don't want paedophiles on the street-I've got two children; I shouldn't need to say that. I don't want to put people away for five years-I want to catch the kingpins who are the drivers of this disgusting behaviour and I want judges to be able to put them away for life. That is what Labor's amendments will allow for. One of the additional issues in this bill is that the mandatory minimum sentences will have very significant unintended consequences. As the bill stands, schedule 6 would attach a mandatory five-year jail term to an 18-year-old in a consensual relationship with a 15-yearold. I want to make that clear to people listening. What the government is proposing would mean that an 18-year-old in a consensual relationship with a 15-year-old would end up in jail for five years. The Law Council has provided examples of some of the behaviour that they believe will be captured by these provisions. One of them is an 18-year-old and a 15-year-old who go on a school trip together. They might be year 10 and year 12 students. They engage in sexual activity overseas. Under this bill the older person in the relationship would be up for a mandatory five-year jail term. That means the judge has no discretion about whether that punishment fits the crime. We are speaking here about 18-year-olds and 15-year-olds who are engaged in sexual activity over Snapchat. This is something that a lot of teenagers do. The Law Council points out that this behaviour between a 15-year-old and a 17-year-old in a consensual relationship is perfectly legal. On the day the older person turns 18, suddenly that person has committed a range of federal offences and will go to jail for a minimum of five years. These are crimes. A consensual sexual relationship between a 15-year-old and an 18year-old is a crime; I don't devalue that. But does the Minister for Justice really believe that the young people in this relationship belong in jail for five years? I want to return to the bill at large. I do believe that this parliament needs to send a clear message that the sexual abuse of children is absolutely intolerable and that not only is it intolerable but also this parliament universally regards this as the most heinous crime that can be committed. We will be supporting this bill and we will be strengthening it. We want to send paedophiles to jail for longer. I say that as the parent of two young boys who are right in the age of target for these horrendous criminals. Labor have and always will fight to protect children here and overseas. Indeed, we have a long history of acting to protect children in this way. It was Labor, under former Prime Minister Paul Keating, that introduced some of the first offences that targeted those who sexually abused children, and those were world-leading laws at the time. The previous Labor government did extensive work in this area. One example is the establishment of the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse. That was the first inquiry of its kind at a national level. One of the most important roles of that royal commission, which is still underway, is understanding this problem better and providing advice to this and other parliaments around the country about what we can do to improve the law in this area, and we will be keenly awaiting their final report to consider further law reform. Labor wholeheartedly support the object of this bill. We have no tolerance for child sexual abuse. But we believe this bill needs to contain even stronger messages of condemnation for these horrible crimes. We will be pleased to support this bill with strengthening measures in the Senate. always fought to protect children in Australia and overseas from abuse and exploitation. We have a strong record on protecting children from child sexual abuse. Labor first introduced world-leading offences, targeting Australians who engage in the sexual abuse of children overseas, in 1994. Labor established the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse when we were last in government. And Labor appointed Australia's first national children's commissioner to advocate for the rights of Australia's young people in 2013. All members of this parliament know that the sexual abuse of children is vile and disgusting. Children are the most vulnerable members of our society and we must do all we can as legislators to protect them. Labor are and always have been tough on paedophiles, but we want to do it right and make sure that offenders are properly imprisoned and kept away from harming vulnerable children. The government's bill aims to protect children but it doesn't go far enough. It's Labor's priority to ensure that those who prey on vulnerable children get the punishment they deserve through the justice system. And we want to make sure the punishment for child sex offences acts as an appropriate deterrent to prevent abuse from occurring in the first place. Labor welcome several aspects of this bill but we want it to be tougher and more effective. That is why we will be seeking amendments in the Senate to ensure that offenders are appropriately punished. We will be moving amendments that will ensure that child sex offenders are appropriately punished and amendments that we hope will improve the effectiveness of the criminal justice system. We want courts to be able to lock up the worse offenders for life. We want to see higher maximum sentences available for courts to hold perpetrators accountable. We want to make sure that people watching child abuse remotely are covered by the existing offences. People are watching child abuse material through webcams and live streaming, so we need to make sure our laws are keeping up with the pace of technological change. We will also be proposing new aggravated offences for people who incite or direct the production of child abuse material. There are vile people who can be found lurking in chatrooms and encouraging people to create new child exploitation material. It's a truly disgusting practice and we need to act to stop it. Labor will also be moving amendments that will improve protections for children. If a person engages in sexual intercourse or activity with a child outside Australia, they may be able to rely on the defence of marriage under the Criminal Code. Both the Law Council of Australia and Anti-Slavery Australia have called for this defence to be removed from the Criminal Code. Labor also takes issue with schedule 13 of the bill, which relates to national security. Schedule 13 would allow information to be withheld by the Attorney-General where, in the opinion of the Attorney-General, it is likely to prejudice national security. These provisions",148,Bills
130,Mr Dreyfus (Isaacs,"Deputy Manager of Opposition Business) (18:26): Labor havego beyond the stated purpose of the bill and are of general application. If the government wishes to proceed with this general national security measure, it should be introduced as part of the bill dealing with national security matters and referred to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security for review in accordance with the usual practice of this parliament. There are also a number of concerning aspects of this bill, and Labor will be moving amendments to address these. In particular, the bill introduces a mandatory sentencing scheme for a large number of child sex offences, and my colleague the member for Hotham, the shadow minister for justice, has already spoken eloquently in relation to these matters. This bill would apply mandatory minimum sentences for what the government has defined as 'the most serious Commonwealth child sex offences' and 'all Commonwealth sex offences that are a second or subsequent offence'. There are no exemptions for persons who may be significantly cognitively impaired. Mandatory minimum sentences are not the solution to Australia's crime problems, they're not the solution to Australia's gun problems and they're not the solution to child sexual abuse. There is no evidence that mandatory minimum sentences act as a deterrent. In fact, they actually make Australia's criminal justice system less effective, because they make juries less likely to convict. Perpetrators who should be convicted may escape punishment altogether. Juries may decide not to convict, even though they think they're guilty, because they may not want to inflict on an offender a sentence they think is disproportionately harsh based on the circumstances of the crime. Mandatory minimum sentences also make offenders less likely to plead guilty. Offenders facing mandatory minimum sentences lose an incentive to provide useful information or assistance to prosecutors. These concerns have been repeatedly expressed by state and territory prosecutors, but the government is choosing to completely ignore them. The government is ignoring similar concerns that have been expressed repeatedly by the legal profession through the state and territory law societies and the Law Council of Australia. The Law Council of Australia is the peak body for lawyers across Australia. It has said about this bill: Mandatory sentences actually make it harder to prosecute criminals, by removing the incentive for anyone to plead guilty or to provide information to the police. There is every incentive to fight on and appeal against convictions. Of course, we're used to the government ignoring the advice of experts, but the government is even ignoring the advice of the Attorney-General's Department, which has issued formal guidelines opposing mandatory minimum sentences. It is clear that mandatory sentences do not work, and Labor is firmly opposed to them. It is the role of the judiciary to make decisions about sentencing criminals, and that is what our system of justice is founded on. This is a clear separation-of-powers issue. It's not up to the legislature to decide what the sentences should be for individual offenders regardless of the particular circumstances of the case. Our system of government is based on the fundamental principle of judicial independence. It's the role of judges to decide on sentencing, because they are impartial and unbiased; they can come to each decision with a clear mind and determine what justice requires in each case. It is the role of judges to make the punishment fit the crime. That role can be carried out only by a court that has examined all the circumstances of the particular crime-something this parliament cannot seek to do in legislation. The role of the parliament is to indicate to courts the seriousness with which parliament views different classes of crime, in particular by setting maximum penalties. The High Court of Australia is not in any doubt about the importance of maximum penalties. In a decision handed down just last week, Director of Public Prosecutions v Dalgliesh, the Chief Justice and Justices Bell and Keane quoted with approval from a 2005 decision of the court, Markarian v The Queen. In that case, former Chief Justice Gleeson and Justices Gummow, Hayne and Callinan said this: … careful attention to maximum penalties will almost always be required, ﬁrst, because the legislature has legislated for them; secondly, because they invite comparison between the worse possible case and the case before court at the time; and thirdly, because in that regard, they do provide, taken and balanced with all of the other relevant factors, a yardstick … The High Court has been equally forthright about the importance of judicial discretion in sentencing. Later in their judgement in that same case, Dalgliesh, Chief Justice Kiefel and Justices Bell and Keane quoted another earlier decision of the court and offered their own view. They said: In Eliasv The Queen, former Chief Justice French of the High Court, and Justices Hayne, Kiefel, Bell and Keane said: 'the administration of the criminal law involves individualised justice'. Then they added: … the imposition of a just sentence on an offender in a particular case is an exercise of judicial discretion concerned to do justice in that case. This has been the clear position of the High Court for decades. Former Chief Justice Barwick of the High Court, while recognising the power of the legislature to determine penalties for offences, in Palling and Corfield in 1970 said: It is both unusual and in general, in my opinion, undesirable that the court should not have a discretion in the imposition of penalties and sentences, for circumstances alter cases and it is a traditional function of a court of justice to endeavour to make the punishment appropriate to the circumstances as well as to the nature of the crime. In 1981, Chief Justice Gibbs said in Sillery and The Queen that even in the case of a most serious crime: ... there may exist wide differences in the degree of culpability of particular offenders, so that in principle there is every reason for allowing a discretion for the judge at trial to impose an appropriate sentence not exceeding the statutory maximum' and that mandatory sentencing 'would lead to results that would be plainly unreasonable and unjust'. Other legal figures have voiced the same principle. The President of the International Commission of Jurists Australia, former NSW Liberal Attorney-General and former NSW Supreme Court Justice John Dowd, called for a judicial inquiry into mandatory sentences in 2012. He said: It is a breakdown of the rule of law and sentencing, where the court determines what is appropriate. Former NSW Director of Public Prosecutions Nicholas Cowdery AM QC said in 2014: It is unrealistic, therefore, and unjust, to prescribe a penalty or minimum penalty that must be imposed for any serious offence before it has been committed or is even in contemplation (or can even be foreseen by Parliament), before all the facts and circumstances are known and without knowing anything of the offender; and experience has shown that such measures do create injustice. Justice requires proper consideration of all the circumstances of the offence and the offender. And Justice Michael Adams of the NSW Supreme Court powerfully said in 1999: To remove judicial discretion in such a vital area of the liberties of the subject is tantamount to a vote of no confidence in the judiciary … The assertion by the elected politicians of the right, in effect, to impose particular sentences for particular crimes, as a response to immediate political exigencies is a significant interference with traditional and well settled principles of the separation of powers. In a submission to a 2012 parliamentary inquiry, the Australian Human Rights Commission said: Laws that impose mandatory minimum terms of imprisonment are inconsistent with Australia's international human rights obligations, including obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). A particularly concerning example-it has already been given by the member for Hotham, but it bears repeating-of how these mandatory minimum sentences would work in practice is that an 18-year-old and a 15-year-old who engage in sexual activity while overseas, perhaps on a school trip, would be captured by the offences. An 18-year-old in this situation would receive a mandatory minimum sentence, under the government's bill, of five years in jail. There would be no room for judicial discretion to take into account the particular circumstances of the case. This is unacceptable. In speaking out against the mandatory minimum sentences in this bill, the Law Council of Australia raised this example and pointed out: Teenage years can often be marked by rash decisions and regrettable mistakes. A blunt instrument like a mandatory minimum sentence will not take this into account. The Law Council said: Mandatory sentencing is always likely to trigger unintended consequences that are at odds with the intention of the laws and fundamental principles of justice. What has been the government's response to this long-expressed opposition to mandatory sentences? It has been to ignore it. The government has produced no evidence that mandatory sentencing works and has not even bothered to explain its reasons for attempting to impose these mandatory sentences. Mandatory sentences will not make children safer. Juries are less likely to convict, perpetrators are less likely to plead guilty and perpetrators are less likely to cooperate in bringing down ringleaders. In this area of child sex abuse Labor want courts to be able to lock up the worse offenders for life. We want to see paedophiles imprisoned and kept away from vulnerable children. Labor want to see higher maximum sentences and the sentences of life imprisonment that we are going to propose for this bill to make sure that Commonwealth child sex offences do work effectively. But mandatory minimums don't work and are wrong in principle, and that is why we are opposing them. Amendment (Sexual Crimes Against Children and Community Protection Measures) Bill 2017. Imagine that you or a loved one had been subjected to child abuse. Wouldn't you want to know that the law was on your side? Our outdated rules have failed to recognise the heinous and disgusting nature of this vile crime and the seriousness with which we must combat this scourge. Whilst past administrations have failed to give the subject the attention and amendment required, I'm glad to support a government that values the protection and well-being of the next generation.",152,Bills
131,Mr Falinski (Mackellar) (18:40,"I rise to speak on the Crimes LegislationThis bill targets all aspects of the child sex offender cycle by strengthening measures at the time of charging, bail, sentencing and upon release. Our reforms will criminalise emerging forms of child sexual abuse, strengthen community protection from child sex offenders and ensure that sentencing of child sex offenders reflects the gravity of this type of offending. They will ensure that terminology used in Commonwealth legislation reflects the seriousness of child sexual abuse and improves protections for vulnerable witnesses. It is the largest such change to the Criminal Code in decades, and seeks to provide genuine deterrence, punishment and protection. At the moment legislation is too weak and our criminal justice system has arguably not given sufficient weight in its sentencing for these crimes-41.3 per cent of child abusers never serve time in prison. Just think about that for a moment: over one-third of child abusers never face the justice that they deserve. And, of the preposterously low portion of offenders that are imprisoned, the average sentence for carrying out one of society's most unspeakable evils is a paltry six months. We are seeking to protect our communities from some of the most horrendous ills imaginable by shifting courts towards a preference for imprisonment rather than mere suspended sentences. We can maximise safeguards against these criminals, ensuring that the most dangerous predators are imprisoned and kept away from those who they seek to harm. In the same vein, the introduction of mandatory minimum sentences will go a long way to alleviating the institutional biases and embarrassing weaknesses inherent within a criminal justice system that has been rendered toothless by the turn-the-other-cheek attitude of previous regimes. For all the naysayers that have prejudged this bill, based on nothing more than their preconceptions of mandatory sentencing, I say this: this law will target those who attempt to do harm to the most vulnerable members of our society, ensuring that they face the penalties that they deserve. What possible objection could members have to that? By spelling out clearly to the courts what is and is not within their remit, this parliament can reinforce its power to mandate the law and its enforcement. This issue is just too important to be left to the whim of a judiciary that has been perceived as insufficiently harsh to such criminals. We would also like to see change to the mindset of the courts to better align it to contemporary Australian society and prioritise civil safety, giving greater balance to victims and the community over the rehabilitation of convicted criminals. Importantly, this bill prevents judges from using an offender's standing in the community to discount their sentence, if it was used to assist in the commission of the offence. In cases involving the worse offenders, we would like to see the courts make it more difficult to release defendants on bail. Similarly, by mandating that courts state and record their reasons for releasing suspects on bail, we can finally begin to stand up for ourselves, to strengthen our resolve against these criminals and better protect our children. We also are making it compulsory for the courts to have regard to the objective of rehabilitating offenders, including setting appropriate treatment and supervision conditions. It's an aspect we cannot overlook if we want to lastingly reduce the number of offences committed against children every year. We are not, as I'm sure some of the opposition would dreamily machinate, shifting towards dictatorial tendencies. This law does not mark a shift in civil liberties. We will continue to maintain the principle of innocence until proven guilty. This is a tenet of our free liberal society and one that we will not change. Rather, what this bill does is enhance our freedoms. We should be confident that our law enforcement and justice systems can securely guarantee that our loved ones won't be harassed, hurt or abused. Surely we should have the freedom to live without fear that child abusers, having been given free rein by the courts to roam free, strike again, harming our children. In yet another example of utter contempt for victims, unscrupulous defendants have been allowed to unnecessarily and inappropriately harass their victims through harsh and brutal cross-examinations. By making it simpler to pre-record testimony, allowing such video recordings to be used as evidence and introducing greater restrictions on the scope of cross examination, this government aims to right the wrongs of the previous government's hamfisted approach to the sensitivities of victims-that is, our children. Four years ago in the UK, 48-year-old Frances Andrade took her own life after being subjected to hostile, aggravating and downright selfish cross-examination by the defendant's legal team. She was forced to relive, in public, over and over again, the horrors of her abuse as a 14-year-old. The subsequent inquest blamed the needlessly aggressive hostilities as a key reason behind her suicide. No-one wants to see that happen here. Not a single parent wants to see their child subjected to such extended, repeated and unnecessary torment when they are doing the right thing-speaking out and making sure their attacker can never do this to someone else. SoI beseech those opposite to get on board, to stop dragging their feet, because we can make a difference. With this bill we also are amending legislation to bring criminal legislation up to date with the digital age. With such dramatic changes in the way we interact and communicate, particularly when technology is becoming ever more complex and the internet more available, it is time to update our child-protection legislation. Unfortunately, paedophiles are constantly seeking new ways to exploit emerging technology to commit their crimes. Where the vast majority of us see wonderful opportunities to improve our lives, a sickening minority have harnessed the internet and the dark web to enact their sickening and deplorable fantasies. They rob our children of their childhoods, of their innocence and of their sense of security. We must crack down on the loopholes that have helped and will continue to help abusers get off scot-free. Internet carriers have their role to play in monitoring and reporting such highly offensive material. Failure to act, to report on abuses and remove any material, will carry greater financial penalties than ever before, because we are serious. Everyone must be vigilant and everyone carries a responsibility to speak out. This will greatly aid law enforcement agencies in their efforts to monitor the ever-expanding vastness of the internet and its 24/7 nature. Our desire to tackle this issue and protect our most vulnerable is nothing new. This bill reflects the Turnbull government's continuing commitment to protecting our children and builds upon previous child protection legislation passed in this very parliament. In June this year, with the Passports Legislation Amendment (Overseas Travel by Child Sex Offenders) Bill 2017, the Turnbull government stopped child sex offenders from travelling overseas to sexually abuse children in more vulnerable parts of the world. We also introduced Carly's law to target online predators preparing or planning to cause harm to procure or engage in sexual activity with a child, increasing police powers to intervene. This government is steadfast in its commitment to the principle that all children should be safe from abuse wherever they happen to be born and, most certainly, in Australia. This morning I saw bipartisan support at the launch of the Polished Man campaign by my colleagues the member for Kooyong and the member for Fisher, who were inadvertently joined by our Prime Minister, the member for Wentworth. The will is there. The will is bipartisan. We can all agree that any violence, including sexual violence, against our children is despicable and must end. Let's end it now and let's end it together. Legislation Amendment (Sexual Crimes Against Children and Community Protection Measures) Bill 2017. To state the obvious, sexual abuse of children is abhorrent. The very thought of children being harmed in that way breaks my heart and I'm sure it breaks the heart of all members of this House. To give you some context, a fortnight ago my wife Lea and I celebrated the 25th anniversary of our very first date. For those entire 25 years, and for a few years before, she's either been a frontline child protection worker or a lawyer representing people giving evidence in the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse, or in her current role, which is as a prosecutor dealing with child abuse. On Monday, Minister Keenan associated the Australian Labor Party, including me, with paedophilia or child abuse in a grubby, disgraceful and unforgivable tactic in this chamber. He stood right there, at that front bench. He said, whilst pointing at the Australian Labor Party, 'What is there to prevaricate about? We want paedophiles off the street and we believe this legislation deserved bipartisan support.' That is something I will never forgive him for, even if he comes back into this chamber and apologises. I will never, ever forgive his comments. They were disgraceful. The Australian Labor Party has a long, proud tradition of standing up for Australian children. Minister Robert Tickner commissioned the Bringing them home report. Prime Minister Kevin Rudd's apology to the stolen generation was delivered on my first day in this chamber. Prime Minister Julia Gillard apologised to the victims of forced adoptions. Policies flowed from these apologies, such as the Closing the Gap commitments and the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse, which Prime Minister Julia Gillard kicked off. We have a long, proud tradition-like those opposite, I will say-of standing up for Australian children wherever we can. The extent of abuse uncovered by the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse has shocked Australia and the world. For my wife to transfer from being a social worker to being a lawyer-I thought I'd heard it all, and I've heard stuff that would break anybody's heart. Night after night after night, especially when she came home from night duty after not being able to go to the gym after work, I heard horrible stories over the last 25 years. Then she was to go and work for the royal commission, for no more, where she heard worse details of child abuse. That royal commission shone a spotlight on a shame that has been hidden for far too long, and I know those opposite would agree. Around 8,000 survivors of sexual abuse have given evidence in private sessions in the royal commission, and I thank the royal commissioners for the great work that they do. That must be an incredibly difficult process. There were 8,000 children who had their lives broken by vile paedophiles or sadists or both. There have been 2,393 referrals to authorities from the royal commission thus far-thus far-because of a Labor Party decision, because of a Labor Prime Minister's decision, to hold that royal commission. When institutions that are charged with caring for our children violate that trust, it shatters all trust in all institutions. I look forward, two years on, to some redress movement from this government.",155,Bills
132,Mr Perrett (Moreton,"Opposition Whip) (18:52): I rise to speak on CrimesThe royal commission has reported some of the impacts of child sexual abuse on the victims and survivors. They report that there are both short-term and long-term effects, and many may be lifelong. Children and adolescents face emotional, physical and social impacts. These impacts often extend into adulthood, affect life choices and mental health and may lead to victims committing suicide, I'm sad to report. The nature and severity of the impacts vary between survivors, but it's all often incredibly horrible. The impacts extend beyond the immediate victims, affecting their parents, colleagues, friends and, sadly, sometimes their families and the community. There is no doubt that all children deserve our protection and support. I commend the member for Hotham for her stance in this area. We know, as parents and as good politicians, that children are our most precious resource-hope distilled, as I've described it in the pastand they are also, sadly, the most vulnerable members of our community. We must do everything we can to protect every single child in Australia. But we also know that there will be more children who will be abused. We won't be able to protect every child, no matter how hard we try, and sadly some children will have their lives broken by predatory paedophiles. And, worse, more often than not, that abuse will be perpetrated by a family member. The very nature of child sexual abuse makes it difficult for children to disclose and for others to detect. Where infant children are involved, communicating the abuse becomes even more difficult. But, wherever child abuse is reported or detected and then prosecuted, the perpetrators of this most sickening crime should feel the full weight of Australian laws. They should be punished and they should be locked up. We must make our laws the best they can be to give every child the maximum chance of living a childhood free from harm. I want to keep my own children safe; I want to keep the children in Moreton safe; I want to keep all Australian children safe. So Labor will be moving amendments to this bill in the Senate. Those amendments will make this bill tougher, giving greater protections to children who are at risk of being abused. We are seeking these amendments so that the bill will impose higher maximum sentences and courts can lock up the worse offenders for life. Our laws reflect the ever-changing ways that paedophiles procure their child victims and export vile images to other paedophiles on the web. People who incite others to commit child abuse will be subject to aggravated offences. These stronger measures, put forward by the member for Hotham, on passing through the Senate, will protect children. We know that paedophiles manipulate; they create opportunities for abuse like you wouldn't believe. The royal commission has recognised that it is often difficult for parents and others who care for children to recognise the grooming behaviour used by paedophiles to trap their victim. We need strong protections so that, when grooming behaviour is recognised, it is punished. The perpetrators should face tough penalties appropriate for such a heinous crime. There is one aspect of this bill that Labor will not accept and that I personally do not support-that is, the provision of mandatory minimum sentences-for one simple reason: mandatory sentences do not work. We know that. The experts know that and have told us that. The Law Council of Australia, the peak body for lawyers, says: Mandatory sentences actually make it harder to prosecute criminals, by removing the incentive for anyone to plead guilty or to provide information to the police. There is every incentive to fight on and appeal against convictions. The Australian Institute of Criminology, the Queensland Law Society, the Victorian Sentencing Advisory Council and prosecutors, just to name a few, have warned that, in some circumstances, where an offender is facing a mandatory jail sentence, a jury may refuse to convict. I repeat that: a jury may refuse to convict. Mandatory sentences make a good headline grab for a media-hungry politician, but sadly, they don't work. Even the Attorney General's own departmental guidelines recognise this. We need laws that work, that will make it more likely that we can lock up paedophiles. This should not be about political ideology and grubby political posturing; it should be about protecting our children. It's no use having laws that say judges must lock up convicted paedophiles for a period of time, if those same laws make it less likely that paedophiles will be convicted. Mandatory sentences take away the discretion of the judge to determine an appropriate sentence in the circumstance of that particular case. It's very easy to say, 'Paedophiles should be locked up regardless.' Many people would agree. I would agree. My wife would agree mostly vehemently, and, as I said, she has devoted nearly 30 years of her working life to protecting kids and hunting down paedophiles. But it is the unintended consequences of mandatory sentencing that create the mischief. You will see sentences that do not fit the crime. It would be a tragedy to see laws designed to protect children actually convicting young people engaging in normal adolescent behaviour and sending them to jail. Let me give some examples that have been provided by the Law Council of Australia: For example, a 15 and 17-year-old might be sharing sexual images with each other in a consensual relationship, yet the day the older partner turns 18, under this legislation that 18-year-old would be looking at an automatic five-year sentence.  On a scout's trip to New Zealand, a 18 year old student has sex with his 15 year old Year 10 girlfriend. The 18 year old student would be sentenced to a mandatory minimum of five years jail.  On a holiday overseas between two families, an 18 year old and 15 year old commence a romantic relationship and they touch each other. The 18 year old would be sentenced to a mandatory minimum of five years jail.  An 18 year old and a 15 year old exchange images and sexual stories on Snapchat.  An 18 year old and a 15 year old engage in sexual activity using FaceTime. The 18 year old would be sentenced to a mandatory minimum of five years jail.  An 18 year old text messages her 15 year old friend encouraging him to send an intimate image to his 18 year old girlfriend. The 18 year old who sent the text message would be sentenced to a mandatory minimum of five years jail. An 18 year old boy and a 15 year old girl are in a relationship and constantly exchange intimate images. The boy has previously been convicted for a child sexual abuse offence. He would be sentenced to a further three years mandatory jail. These could be any children. We could say, 'Children should not have phones; children should not send images.' I know what the world should be, but we also need to reflect the world as it is. These could be any children making poor decisions in any family, in any suburb of Australia. This is not the behaviour that this legislation was designed to catch, but it could easily happen in a suburb near you. These kids would be caught nonetheless. They would go to jail because the impartial, informed judge would have no discretion. Judges would have no choice but to sentence these kids that I've mentioned in the scenarios to a minimum five-year jail sentence. This is why we have judges who have discretion in sentencing. No politician would ever say that every judge gets every decision right every time, but I will guarantee that the Australian justice system gets it right more times than that of any other country. No-one can imagine the thousands of different scenarios that may come before a judge and be caught by these offences. Not having a mandatory minimum sentence will not prevent paedophiles from being jailed, but it will prevent some young people who do not deserve to be jailed from being jailed and potentially having their lives ruined and their families' lives ruined. As the Law Council of Australia has said: When you take away the ability of a judge to take into account the seriousness of the offence, the degree of culpability of the offender, their personal circumstances or the explanation for offending, you generate disproportionate and, often, unconscionable outcomes. What Labor proposes is to have higher maximum sentences. We want judges to be able to lock up the worse child sexual abuse offenders for life. That would truly protect our children-without the unintended consequences of young adolescents being locked up for behaving like adolescents and making foolish decisions-and not punish them forever. Labor is proud of its record on fighting to protect children, both in Australia and overseas, from all types of abuse and exploitation. In 1994 Labor led the world in laws that targeted Australians who engaged in sexual abuse of children overseas. In 2009 the Labor government implemented the National Framework for Protecting Australia's Children, an important initiative that was accompanied by an injection of $63.6 million. In 2010 it was Labor that made it an offence to target preparation for child abuse. In 2013 Julia Gillard as Prime Minister established the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse, the first of its kind in the national forum and perhaps the most important inquiry ever to be conducted in Australia. As I said, it has made 2,393 referrals to authorities so far. In 2013 Labor appointed the first National Children's Commissioner to advocate for the rights of all Australia's young people. And in 2013 Labor introduced the Vulnerable Witness Act. Labor is strongly committed to protecting Australian children from all forms of abuse and exploitation. We have been consistent in our approach. There is still much work to do to tighten up our laws, to protect children so that our laws cannot be used as a tool to avoid detection or punishment. The chair of the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse, the Hon. Justice Peter McClellan, recently said in a speech: Our work has shown that across many decades many institutions failed our children. Our child protection, criminal and civil justice systems let them down. Although the primary responsibility for the sexual abuse of an individual lies with the abuser and the institution of which they were part, we cannot avoid the conclusion that the problems faced by many people who have been abused are the responsibility of our entire society. It is our responsibility as lawmakers to make sure our laws are adequate and fit for purpose and to have faith in the expertise of our judicial officers. It is our responsibility as lawmakers to make sure that our laws don't have unintended consequences. It is our responsibility to make sure that our children are protected. Labor wholeheartedly supports the objects of the bill but will move amendments in the Senate to make it even tougher. Ms MARINO (Forrest-Chief Government Whip) (19:07): I think everybody in this place understands that children are incredibly precious and they have a right to be protected. No child should ever be in a situation where they are sexually assaulted, but we know that that is what's happening. This Crimes Legislation Amendment (Sexual Crimes Against Children and Community Protection Measures) Bill 2017 adds to the government's recent legislation relating to child sexual abuse. Carly's law passed the parliament in the last session, a law that makes it a crime to plan to harm a child who is under 16. It targets online predators who misrepresent their age with the sole purpose of grooming the child online for sex. These people are pretending to be young children, like the children they are grooming online. The first arrest using this law has already been made. The government also recently passed legislation that stops convicted sex offenders from travelling overseas to commit criminal acts against children in other countries. This bill specifically targets some inadequacies in the criminal justice system that result in outcomes that don't sufficiently punish, deter or rehabilitate offenders. The bill also introduces new offences directed at the use of the internet for the sexual abuse of children. Today I'd really like to acknowledge the member for Fisher, Andrew Wallace, for his Polished Man campaign. It's a campaign encouraging men to take a stand and actively commit to ending violence against children by painting one fingernail for the month of October. I looked at the statistics provided at this gathering. They show that more than 120 million girls and 73 million boys have been the victims of sexual violence. I thank Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and the Minister for the Environment and Energy, Josh Frydenberg, for their support of this campaign. The government has become increasingly concerned about manifestly inadequate sentences for child sex offenders. These sentences do not sufficiently reflect the harm suffered by the victims of child sex abuse or protect the community from the risk of future harm. These sentences also do not fully reflect the fact that these crimes actually increase the demand for child abuse material, particularly online. I read that-and this really concerned me-since 2012, less than two-thirds of Commonwealth child sex offenders have received a term of imprisonment after conviction. This means that 269 child sex offenders, convicted of a Commonwealth crime, were released directly back into the community over the past five years. I find that appalling. Of those who were imprisoned, the most common sentence length was 18 months and the most common non-parole period was six months. I can't think of anyone in my electorate or any Australian, in fact, who would think that these are adequate sentences for those people who sexually abuse children. I'm a mum. How would any mother and father feel if the person who was convicted under federal law of sexually abusing their child actually served no time in prison? All of us here know how we would feel if it was our child or our grandchild. I know exactly how I would feel. These are vile, heinous crimes. The trust and the vulnerability of children we see every day. We see it in our own children; we see it in every child. I had a group of wonderful children with special needs who came into this parliament today from Busselton in my electorate. The thought of anybody taking advantage and sexually abusing one of those extremely vulnerable young children, to me, requires the sort of legislation that we're putting forward here. I don't want to see any person who sexually abuses a child not suffer the punishment they deserve. I would suggest that there isn't one member of parliament or one parent or one grandparent who wouldn't feel the same. It is absolutely disgusting and abhorrent. We see these beautiful kids who trust us as adults-they trust us to look after them. What's love to a child? Love is security. And that's what we are here to provide. I see my role in this place as providing as much security as I can through the legislation that we enact, and that's why I support the measures within this bill. I agree with the Minister for Justice, our federal laws should punish and deter offenders unequivocally. They should send a very simple message out into the community. None of us here, in any way, believe that a sex offender should not be punished. They should be punished, and we should be deterring potential future offenders. That's why this bill introduces mandatory sentencing for specified offences-to address the disparity between the seriousness of child sex offending and lenient sentences. It's critical. The community depends on us to provide the laws to protect the community, as much as is possible, across the board, and no-one more so than our children. That's what I expect. IfI weren't a member of parliament here, that's exactly what I would expect of the members in this parliament and the government of the day. Mandatory minimum sentences will send a very clear message. They will apply to the child sex offences that attract the highest penalties-not just any penalty; the highest penaltiesand to reoffenders, as they rightly should. Are those reoffenders of the 269 who weren't sent to jail and, as a result, they've reoffended? What message did they get out of that? If they are reoffending they clearly have not learnt from their original offence. I find that it's applying to the highest penalties. That cannot be understated in this debate. It combats the evolving use of the internet in child sexual abuse. I know first hand from young people in my electorate that offenders are using the internet to groom young people for sex. As most members here would be aware, I've spoken about this frequently and worked actively in this space. I've seen this as an opportunity for paedophiles. I've delivered hundredshundreds-of cybersafety presentations. The minister at the table worked with me, historically in his previous roles, in establishing the Office of the eSafety Commissioner, focusing on children and specifically providing resources in this space. I have delivered hundreds of cybersafety presentations to young people, parents and community groups. Following one of these presentations the mother of an 11-year-old girl contacted my office and said, 'My daughter came to your presentation today and she's come home and she's had to confess to me that she's realised after listening to my presentation that she, at 11, was being groomed online for sex.' It's made even easier on the internet, because paedophiles are grooming these children to have sex with them, but they're also encouraging them to meet them in person. It's extremely disturbing for me, having delivered this to primary school aged children, to find eight children in one class of 11-year-olds who had the courage and the honesty to admit to me that they had been to meet people in person that they first met only online. I'm continuing to do these presentations. What disturbed me even more, which is why I'm strongly supportive of this bill, is that too often it's usual for me now to come across classes where, when I do my secret survey and I ask them if they would be honest about what's happening to them online-I ask them if they have ever been to meet in person someone they had first met only online-the hands go up. Can you imagine how horrified the teachers are? And can you imagine how horrified the parents who have come along to some of my sessions are when I tell them that's the response I get? It's not happening to someone else's children. It's happening to our children. So, every time. I can get to one child it's a very good day. That's what we are trying to do here. We're trying to protect those wonderfully innocent, precious children. I make no excuse for that. I think it's the best thing this government can be doing and I'm proud of the fact that we take it so seriously. It concerns me, too, that sentencing for child sex offences needs to be commensurate to the seriousness of the crime, and we are talking about the most serious crimes. We need to make sure that the sentences imposed adequately reflect the seriousness of the offending that's occurred. That's important for community trust in us. That's what the community expects of us here. We pass a lot of laws in this place and there are a lot of laws around this space at the state level as well. But when they involve Commonwealth offences, such as using a carriage service-which, as the minister knows, involves using a phone, an iPad, the internet or any form of service-to abuse, harass and, of course, to sexually abuse, it is against the law, as it should be. It is a federal offence. Child sexual offences are also federal offences in this space. I'm very pleased that we are introducing this legislation to make sure that we are doing everything we can. We the government are very serious about ensuring that child sex offenders are off our streets as soon as possible and for as long as possible, especially when there are those who reoffend. There are a number of measures contained in this bill, and community safety is the primary consideration here. Those listening to this speech may find it surprising that community safety is not already the primary consideration. This bill makes it explicit: it is to ensure the protection of the community. It ensures that, once an offender's parole has been revoked, they will serve time in custody. That's what that mum, that dad, that grandparent, the brothers and sisters and the friends, expect us to do. The families of every child who has been sexually abused expect us to have the laws to not only try to protect that child but also then to punish the person who offends. I'm very pleased that this is the road that we're taking on this. Two new measures target online sites especially. If you have a bit of a look around the internet, the amount of pornography available online, and the amount of aggressive physical pornography and some of what's available on the dark web, is just extraordinary. I am greatly concerned about what our children have access to and what they're accessing and how young they are when they have access to it. The second measure, criminalising the transmission of communications to groom any person with the aim of procuring a child for sexual activity, is very, very important and a measure I'm strongly supportive of. I've just seen too much of it. It wasn't just an 11-year-old; 13and 14-year-olds were also being groomed online for sex. That came out of a group that I had previously. We need to make sure that there is harsh punishment. We need to send a very clear message to offenders and potential offenders that we as a government and we as a society are not going to stand by and allow more young people, our children, to be sexually assaulted. Ms HUSAR (Lindsay) (19:22): Sexual crimes against children are abhorrent. Children are among the most vulnerable members of our community, and every measure should be undertaken to ensure their safety and their security. Sexual crime against children is not a debate for political handballing and pointscoring. But, sadly, that's what we've seen today. I'm proud to support the members for Hotham, Moreton and Isaacs who spoke before me on the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Sexual Crimes Against Children and Community Protection Measures) Bill. Labor is committed to strong legislation that will keep children safe. Children deserve our absolute protection and our support and we must do everything within our power to ensure that kids are safe from sexual predators both here and abroad. We have an obligation also to the children of other countries. We must protect them from the criminals who stalk them on the net, groom them, deceive them and exploit them in the most heinous way possible. Labor are committed to doing what we can to protect children from harm and abuse and we have zero-zero-tolerance for child sexual abuse. The tragedy is that children who are victims of sexual abuse endure lifelong suffering, carrying the burden of crimes that should never have been committed. The parents of these children are affected. Nobody wants to go through the nightmare of losing a child, but to lose your child at the hands of a sexual predator would be nothing more than a living hell. No-one's child should be subjected to sexually explicit conversations or to being stalked by sexual predators who are using social media platforms or apps that specifically target children. These crimes are being committed in Australia and overseas. Anti-Slavery Australia reported in its submission to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee that children in the Philippines are lured to sex tourism hotspots, such as Angeles City, Metro Manila and Cebu City, on the promise of legitimate jobs. Thereafter they are physically and/or emotionally coerced into working in the sex industry, including, increasingly, online exploitation dens, where they are made to perform on webcams for foreign online sex tourists. In 2013 it was estimated that tens of thousands of boys and girls were in the webcam sex tourism trade alone, with that number predicted to increase. What depraved, sick humans they are who consume this. Adding to the terror are the children trapped in child trafficking and slavery. There has been an increase in trafficking to use children in online exploitation. This is driven by the financial support from Australian offenders who encourage the production of sexual exploitation materials. Labor have no tolerance for these crimes by paedophiles, and we want to see them stopped and perpetrators locked up, facing the most severe penalties. The criminals who groom and procure children online need to be stopped. The international paedophilia rings that traffic and enslave children need to be stopped. We welcome some of the changes in this bill, including: the new offence to criminalise the grooming of third parties for the purpose of procuring a child for sexual activity; new aggravated offences for child sex abuse where a child is subject to cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment or which causes the death of a child; the addition of residential treatment orders as a sentencing alternative to allow intellectually disabled offenders to receive access to specialised treatment options; and the removal of the requirement to seek leave before a recorded interview of a vulnerable witness can be admitted as evidence in chief. We believe the government is playing sick politics with laws that protect children from sexual abuse. We are not going soft on the perpetrators of these crimes, and those who seek to score political points are nothing more than sick. We commend the actions of the Australian state and territory police and the Australian Federal Police in combating this scourge and stopping the sexual offenders who are exploiting children. As the member for Hotham pointed out, what a horrible job it is for those AFP men and women who have to trawl through this material. I want to support the member for Hotham in her statement of thanks and gratitude for what these men and women go through in having to classify this material. I can only imagine it would be incredibly horrendous to watch. The police in each state and territory and the AFP work closely with international counterparts to rescue children and stop the offenders. We commend task force agents of the Queensland Police Service and their international counterparts for the many operations that they run, including the operations which they undertook and ran on the dark web network over many months which led to the rescue of 85 children. That means 85 kids are now removed from that life. There were hundreds of arrests, including the site's operator, Shannon McCoole. He is serving a 35-year sentence for the sexual abuse of multiple children. David Cecchin, a member of the paedophile Shannon McCoole's child exploitation website, had previously pleaded guilty for possessing, accessing and disseminating child exploitation material. He regularly disseminated child exploitation material on the website, and he's been sentenced to seven years and five months jail. He had 1,500 items of child exploitation material on his computer. Ninety per cent of that material was photographs and the rest was videos. The creation of new child exploitation material needs to be stopped. The paedophiles and criminals who are running these internet sites and creating the content need to be stopped. No child should ever be exploited in this way. We believe the bill should be tougher, stronger and more effective by: increasing maximum sentences, with the worse offenders locked up for life; keeping up with changing technologies such as criminals watching child abuse through webcams and live streaming, and stopping them, charging them and bringing them to justice; and introducing new aggravated offences for people who incite or direct the production of child abuse material. This bill introduces mandatory minimum sentences. We do not support mandatory minimum sentences, because we know mandatory minimums do not work. As the member for Hotham has already pointed out, all of the agencies, including the Attorney-General's Department, have said they don't support mandatory minimums either. The bill's mandatory sentencing is problematic because of different ages of consent across Australia. And mandatory minimums can lead to fewer prosecutions and convictions, sometimes leading juries to acquit rather than sentence, and can conflict with the role of the judiciary. People will not have an incentive to plead guilty or to inform police on others' actions if they know they face a mandatory sentence. It builds in the incentive to fight and appeal against convictions. Even former Prime Minister John Howard has previously commented, 'As a matter of public principle, I do not agree with mandatory sentencing and, in the end, I do think these matters ought to be determined by judges and by magistrates.' It's a shame that those opposite only seek to champion John Howard when it suits them. He's only getting rolled out for his opposition to other things and not his opposition to mandatory sentencing. Debate interrupted. That the House do now adjourn.",158,Bills
133,The Deputy Speaker ( Mr Hogan) (19:30,"I propose the question:Broadband Ms RYAN (Lalor-Opposition Whip) (19:30): I rise today to condemn this government for its appalling rollout of the NBN across this nation and more specifically in the electorate of Lalor. This government has taken what should have been the biggest infrastructure project in this country's history and turned it into something that is not delivering for the constituents in my community. NBN 2.0 is an absolute fail for the people in my community. Rather than deliver digital technology to the families, to the businesses, to the students-to my community-it is delivering a digital divide. Not only do constituents have the challenges of being in the drive-in, drive-out suburbs, with an hour and a half each way to get to work for some of them, but also they can't work from home. Not only can many not access the NBN as the rollout stalls and is slow, but many cannot get ADSL1 or ADSL2 in areas of my electorate, and there does not seem to be anything this government is prepared to do to fix this issue. No matter how many times I am on my feet in this place, no matter how many times my office connects with the NBN and works with the providers, nothing seems to be in the plans for our area. And that includes our agricultural area, a key national provider of vegetables to this country, which is not even on the rollout maps. There will be no NBN for Werribee South and the businesses down there, some worth hundreds of millions of dollars. No-they are paying to use 4G in their logistic centres. The costs are extraordinary. Those opposite are talking all the time about costs to business, but they don't want to do anything to fix this cost to business. Their NBN 2.0 is an absolute failure. There is an assumption by government agencies such as Centrelink that people will have access to the internet, but people in my community do not have such access. They are told by Centrelink to go online and use the website. But who's going to pay for the downloads they're doing on wireless? Who's going to pay those costs when they live in a house that does not have ADSL1? The worse part is the absolute failure to understand the communities in which we live. In a growth corridor, people are moving in every week. They go and inspect a house on a Sunday and they show up at an auction the next week and bid for that house. They think the house has an NBN connection or internet access, only to find when they have moved in that there are not enough ports in the area and they don't have any internet service in their home. It is almost false advertising that is occurring in my community. It is an absolute outrage. And what have we seen today? We've seen the report come down and-surprise, surprise!-my community is in the top 10 in terms of people complaining about internet services in their area. That is no surprise to my office, because we deal with this every day. And, worse, these are complaints about the internet. Hoppers Crossing is listed as having the third highest number of complaints in this country and Werribee the fourth highest. I've got news for this government: Werribee's the area that supposedly was getting the NBN, and it's in the top four in terms of complaints. I have people talking to me about their internet speeds all the time. Some examples: Mr Birch of Point Cook reports to me that he has a download speed of 0.61 megabytes per second and an upload speed of 0.32 megabytes per second. Bad luck if he's trying to run a microbusiness from his home and avoid drive-in, drive-out. Mr Wadsworth of Point Cook reports that he has a download speed of 2.36 megabytes per second and an upload speed of 1.73 megabytes per second. Mr Boucher of Seabrook has a download speed of 1.2 megabytes per second and an upload speed of 0.96 megabytes per second. Note that none of those people live in Hoppers Crossing and Werribee, where we are in the top 10. I want to finish by trying to drive home to this House just how difficult it is for people in my electorate to run a business, to run a family, to study and to actually be a global citizen in the 21st century. National Police Remembrance Day solemn occasion when we commemorate and pay tribute to those officers who have lost their lives in the line of duty and convey our respects to their families and colleagues. On 29 September, we recall the names of every officer who has made the ultimate sacrifice while protecting our communities. A police officer never knows what scenes they will be confronted with when they start their shift. Tragically, some officers don't make it home to their families. That's why it's so important that we as a community remember what our police face every day and pay tribute to those who make the ultimate sacrifice. This year I attended the Police Remembrance Day service at Maryborough, where more than 200 officers, family and friends came together to reflect on the service of police officers at the special ceremony at the LifeChurch. It was also a great honour to ride in this year's Wall to Wall Ride for Remembrance with my daughter Yve. This year the Wall to Wall event saw more than 2,000 motorcycle riders across Australia, including a contingent from Texas in the United States, meet at locations in their jurisdictions before riding to the National Police Memorial in Canberra. This year, the name of Queensland Senior Constable Brett Forte, who was tragically killed on duty in the Lockyer Valley in May this year, was delivered to the National Police Memorial wall in a moving ceremony. I thank all the organisers of the Wall to Wall Ride for Remembrance and particularly acknowledge the Queensland Police official motorcycle riders Senior Sergeant Bradyn Murphy and Inspector Peter Flanders; and Queensland Police Commissioner Ian Stewart, who rode to Canberra and performed the solemn duty of placing the ceremonial baton containing Senior Constable's Forte name at the wall. In Australia, police uphold the rights and freedoms of the individual by protecting life and property and keeping the peace. As a former police officer I understand the immense satisfaction but also the difficulties that police encounter every time they put on the uniform. It's a job where, at the beginning of every shift, officers have the incredibly weighty task of loading bullets into a weapon that has the primary purpose of applying lethal force. Following that, there is the weightier task of walking out into everyday life with no certainty as to what serious challenges it's going to ask you to solve. It's a job where your training and your colleagues are your greatest assets. Policing is a job where most members of society trust you and are happy to see you out and about and where, more often than not, people want to strike up a conversation with you for no particular reason other than they approve of the job that you're doing walking the beat and keeping the peace. It's a job where your own physical and mental well-being is regularly placed on the line to help others and where the highs of success are often matched by the lows of tragedy. I'm pleased the coalition government has committed $1 million towards a new campaign designed to promote awareness of the mental health challenges faced by police officers. This program will be run by the Police Federation of Australia, promoting awareness, understanding and prevention of, and early intervention in, mental health issues through a",166,Adjournment
134,Mr Llew O'brien (Wide Bay) (19:35,"National Police Remembrance Day is arange of media workshops and documentary videos. The experiences police are exposed to throughout their careers can have a profound, lasting and psychological effect not only on them but also on their families. Police are expected to act with bravery. They must perform their duty without fear, favour or hesitation, often in the face of great danger. It's a very demanding vocation that can leave psychological scars such as post-traumatic stress disorder and depression if the mental health aspects of the job aren't managed carefully. I often say that, the more we talk about mental illness and mental health and promote the programs and services that are available to address it, the more the stigma is removed and the more likely people who feel they might need some help will seek it sooner, rather than letting it build up. I hope this new campaign funded by the coalition government will do just that. Finally, I want to convey my respects to all police, past and present, and commend them for the incredible job they do every day. Gambling conducted a survey of residents, which included a significant portion of the constituents in my electorate of Wills. Part of that survey sought to profile the gambling habits of residents as well as gauge the public sentiment towards gambling within the municipality. It revealed that 74 per cent of survey respondents took the view that poker machines had a net negative impact on the community, with only 24 per cent of the community choosing to use poker machines, even on one occasion or a couple of occasions. Figures from the Victorian Commission for Gambling and Liquor Regulation show that in 2015-16, $63.5 million-or an average of $174,031 each day-was lost on poker machines just in my electorate of Wills. It's interesting to note that the Moreland council survey indicated that, of those who do use poker machines, 76 per cent use them at pubs and clubs locally, representing an increase from the statistics contained in a comparable survey back in 2011, with 24 per cent of people using them at the casino-a decrease from the 2011 survey. So it's little surprise that the public have such a dim view of the 671 pokies that line the pubs and clubs in my electorate, with the clear and identifiable trend being that it is these pokies in our neighbourhoods that are costing families so much. Very few people in this place would fail to understand the devastating impact that addiction has and how it touches families. According to a report by the Productivity Commission, alcoholism costs the community $14 billion annually, with illicit drug use costing the community $7 billion annually. So, it may surprise you, Mr Speaker, that gambling costs the community a staggering $16 billion annually. That's more than alcoholism and more than illicit drug use. In fact, a 2013 report published by The Economist charted Australia's per capita gambling losses as the highest in the world. I don't want to minimise the severity of the other ills of society that I have mentioned-not at all. Clearly, the impact of all forms of addiction can be devastating and is devastating, but I do think it's compelling to see the significance of problem gambling illustrated in these economic terms relative to the other categories of addiction. We're fortunate in my electorate to have many excellent venues that don't rely on gaming machine revenue, like the Coburg Lions VFL club or the Coburg RSL. Rather, they rely on things like high-quality food, live entertainment or a good footy game to draw a crowd. But it's hard for those venues, those clubs, to survive. I have spoken in this place before about the",168,Adjournment
135,Mr Khalil (Wills) (19:40,"A couple of years ago, the Moreland City Councilworld-class live music scene at venues in my electorate. I have tried to use my position as a newly elected MP to protect those venues, which are under threat by overdevelopment. They are assets worth protecting. SoI would encourage my constituents and those from outside my electorate who hold concerns about the adverse impact of pokies to support those establishments, to go to those locations, those sporting clubs and live music venues, which don't have pokies that form the bulk of their revenue. Support those establishments. Vote with your wallets and purses, so to speak. The cause and effect of easy access to pokies is a debate which has been raging since gaming machines were first introduced to Victoria in 1991. Successive state governments in Victoria from both sides of politics have acted to limit gaming machine losses through measures such as limiting maximum bets and removing ATMs from gaming venues. But, back in 1991, it would have been difficult to envision the rise of smartphone betting, for example, which of course has become extremely popular in recent years. While the adverse impact of gaming machines is still enormous, I think, as lawmakers today, we need to be cognisant and mindful of the new and emerging gambling products that technology makes available. The Australian Gambling Research Centre reports that the gross global yield from interactive online gambling has grown from US$1 billion in 2006 to US$12 billion in 2017. That is a remarkable increase. The surge in popularity of online betting markets has seen an increase from five per cent to 24 per cent of the global betting market. I'm pleased that this current federal parliament has seen legislation which has dealt with these forms of gambling, including limits on in-play betting and strict controls on the advertising of such products, but I believe there's more to do. Unfortunately, there are more than 35,000 Victorians whose gambling habits have put them in significant financial trouble and a further 122,000 people who are impacted by the problem gambling of others and of their family members. That is according to a report by the Victorian Responsible Gambling Foundation. Gambling addiction is as difficult as any other addiction, and it's something we need to deal with as best we can. Mental Health communities. Mental health is, of course, one of the government's national health priorities, and as this is Mental Health Month it presents a good opportunity to reflect on the issues we face as a society as we turn our minds to how we can help those in our community who are at risk of suffering from mental health issues. Those of us, like you, Mr Speaker, who live outside metropolitan cities in rural and regional Australia are a proud bunch. And so we should be. We make a massive contribution to the wealth of this great nation, and it's often a contribution which goes relatively unnoticed and unthanked. The Australian spirit is strong amongst rural and regional citizens, but isolation and lack of services have unfortunately led to a significant disparity in the rates of mental illness and outcomes. For example, Mr Speaker, you might not be shocked-although it shocked me-to learn that farmers are twice as likely to die from suicide as the generallyemployed population. Last week, Country SA PHN launched a new counselling service for regional and remote South Australians. This initiative helps to address one of the key health priorities of our government. Regional Access is a free service available 24 hours a day, seven day as week to",169,Adjournment
136,Mr Pasin (Barker) (19:45,"I rise today to discuss mental health in regionalanyone over the age of 16 who lives or works in a regional or remote area of South Australia and who is feeling the pressures and stresses of everyday life. Regional Access will be staffed by professional, trained counsellors who are ready to listen, support and encourage. They will provide individual strategies to best manage situations and provide further support as needed. Regional Access is available to anyone who has a concern, a worry or just wants to chat. It's available 24/7 to support people at their time of need. The counsellors will focus on people's individual situations and develop strategies to manage the situation that the person who has made the call finds themselves in. People can have up to three 30-minute sessions with the same counsellor. Online mental health interventions including self-help and exchanges with clinicians have proven benefits. For someone suffering from depression and anxiety, digital services can be as effective as face-to-face sessions. But, if needs increase, this service will refer people to be seen by a local face-to-face psychologist under a priority referral. This service will provide a welcome boost to local mental health services and demonstrates the federal government's commitment to ensuring mental health support is provided to the people who need it in the communities they live in. Regional Access bridges the gap and allows everyone access to counselling when they need it most. With South Australians having access to professional counsellors 24 hours a day, seven days a week from anywhere in the state, we will see, hopefully, a removal of one of the impediments that put many off seeking help. My hope is that people in Barker will embrace this new service. While I have some time, I will refer, in this Mental Health Month, to some other fantastic services that are delivered federally into my electorate of Barker. I highlight headspace, which operates from Mount Gambier, from Berri in the Riverland and in Murray Bridge. To have three of these services operating in my electorate for people under the age of 24 gives me some comfort that young people who are struggling with issues, who are dealing with mental health stresses and strains, have a place to go. For those over the age of 24, can I commend to you the Riverland Division of General Practice, which operates both in the Riverland and-it would seem counterintuitively-in Mount Gambier, providing counselling services in a faceto-face, direct manner for people in my electorate. It's the same service, coincidentally, that in Mount Gambier provides rehabilitative counselling services for those who are suffering from drug and alcohol abuse. It's creating in Mount Gambier a one-stop shop for people who are dealing with drug and alcohol abuse and psychological sequelae. In this Mental Health Week, I'd like to thank the staff who make all this possible. Mental Health health. In particular, I wanted to raise some issues on behalf of Australians for Mental Health, who have asked me to come to this place to encourage this parliament and all parties to reaffirm their commitment to making mental health a priority and to help end the stigma and shame associated with those seeking help for mental ill-health. On 23 August 2014, I was honoured to launch Australians for Mental Health at the Village Cinemas in Fountain Gate. It aims to improve, and campaign for improved, mental health services. I did that with Professor Pat McGorry. Mental ill-health will affect up to about 50 per cent of all Australians at some stage in their life. Too often, they suffer in silence. Australians for Mental Health has as its charter the aim of providing a stronger uniting voice",170,Adjournment
137,Mr Byrne (Holt) (19:50,"I rise tonight to discuss in this place the issue of mentalfor every Australian affected directly or indirectly by mental ill-health. It will advocate for change, and it will continue to advocate for change. On that note, last week, as part of Mental Health Week, I was delighted to attend a celebration at headspace Narre Warren for headspace Day. It is a national event that aims to get people talking about youth mental health. Each year, a quarter of all young Australians will experience mental health issues. The theme of headspace Day was the importance of young people taking care of their mental health issues early, before they become serious. It was an honour to meet all the wonderful staff at headspace Narre Warren, which is led by centre manager Nicholas Teo. Headspace Narre Warren is one of the most popular headspace services in the country, assisting over 1,200 young people in the Casey area in 2017. The national average is approximately 650 people. It was wonderful to meet the staff and to thank them for making a real difference to the lives of Casey youth. I look forward to working closely with headspace Narre Warren and with Mr Peter Ruzyla, the chief executive officer of EACH, who oversees the running of this headspace, Dandenong headspace and other headspaces, and also to assisting him in ensuring funding so that this centre and other centres remain so that we keep a world-class local mental health facility for young people in the long term. The plight of the state of mental health in Australia was amplified by a briefing by Professor Pat McGorry, who is, as I've said before, leading the efforts of Australians for Mental Health. Professor McGorry made it clear that over the last 15 years we have witnessed an increase in awareness about mental health and mental illness. However, it's his view that more action is needed to properly invest in mental health. A few years ago, mental health funding in this country was set at seven per cent of the total health spend in Australia. But now it's declined to 5.25 per cent of the health budget. In contrast, data shows that most OECD countries spend between 12 and 16 per cent of their health budgets on mental health services. That mental health funding in Australia is at Third World levels is almost impossible to fathom. Professor McGorry also told me a story about an associate who was a clinical psychologist whose brother had schizophrenia. He had a severe illness but he received less than goodquality health care due to the lack of investment, it was said, in mental health. In contrast, this man's sister, about a year ago, was diagnosed with lymphoma. In the same health system, the sister received top-quality care and mental health support, whereas her brother continued to receive poor-quality care when he would relapse. When you hear such stories, it re-amplifies why we need to be more focused on improving mental health services in Australia. During Mental Health Week it was also concerning to hear that the suicide rate in Australia was 3,027 people in 2015. When each of these deaths is preventable, it's vital to ensure people can obtain expert care in the future to reduce the suicide rate to zero. Having worked with Professor McGorry for a number of years, the key thing that strikes me is the decrease in mental health funding from seven per cent to 5.25 per cent, which does impact on mental health services in this country. We have to do more as a country to lift funding so that we can give those with mental health and mental illness issues the care that they deserve and need. Energy Ms PRICE (Durack) (19:55): I rise this evening to reflect on an event that occurred some nine years ago, which, in the current climate of our debate on energy, is a startling example of managing energy policy. On3 June 2008 a corroded gas pipeline ruptured on Varanus Island off the coast of Dampier Peninsula in my electorate of Durack. Thankfully, no-one was injured in this explosion. However, that plant supplied a third of Western Australia's gas supplies, and it was shut down completely for two months while an investigation took place. In the ensuing months, Western Australia went through an energy crisis-a real energy crisis-the likes of which you would struggle to believe, Mr Speaker. Western Australia was in such dire straits that we had emergency defence department diesel reserves released to the state's power generators. Industries with high power consumption, like mining and manufacturing, ground to a halt and our then Premier, Alan Carpenter, pleaded with people in the households of Western Australia to pitch in and reduce energy consumption. And we did. During those three months while Varanus Island was offline the state reduced its power consumption by some three per cent, a large reduction that was enough to power the largest town in my electorate, Geraldton-and I know the Minister for Urban Infrastructure at the table has had the pleasure of visiting Geraldton-every day during the crisis. It was difficult but we got through that crisis. We brought back online previously decommissioned generation from the coal-fired power station in Collie, which had the old turbines of the Muja AB power station. We sourced gas from other suppliers through our 15 per cent domestic gas reservation policy, and within two months the crisis had been resolved. Mr Speaker, you may wonder why I am telling this story in the House tonight and why it is relevant today. It's because that gas crisis in 2008 was exactly that-a crisis. It required emergency action, it required a change of policy from a state government and it required help from the federal government. Fast forward to 2017, and an energy crisis has now become Labor Party policy. How disappointing that is for this country. It is now the norm for states like South Australia. I reflect on a news article I saw today which reported that over 100,000 food parcels are being supplied as a direct result of the careless, reckless power policy of the South Australian government. With a 50 per cent renewables target, without a plan to keep the gas flowing by placing a moratorium on gas exploration in the Labor states and asking the Australian taxpayer to pay for it, Labor are doing the exact opposite of what was needed to fix that Western Australian crisis in 2008. I might remind the House that Alan Carpenter, who instituted these changes to save Western Australia from that crisis, was a Labor Premier. But Labor have fallen victim to the left of their own party. In a bid to win the inner-city green vote at the expense of everyone with a power bill, they have decided to ditch the Alan Carpenter approach to energy policy and instead go with the Bob Brown model. This is of serious concern to me and all of us on this side of the House, and I say this as a member in this place with one of the largest penetrations of renewable energy technologies in their electorate. We welcome it. We welcome renewable energy, because, while I believe that of course there is a place for both renewables and thermal generation, I believe in letting green energy compete on its own two feet. I have wind power in Kalbarri and Merredin, solar power in the Pilbara, and hydropower in the Kimberley-just to name a few. But in all of those places renewables are supported by other forms of power, and the reason is that they are simply not reliable. That is what this government's National Energy Guarantee is all about. You can have green energy, you can have cheap power and you can have certainty in the market for private investors. It is doable. I sincerely hope that once those opposite have figured out what our policy's all about-and it's a very positive policy, so please take the time to understand itthis country will have reliable, affordable power and certainty of investment in power generation, and we will get those power prices down.

Wednesday, 18 October 2017 Leifer, Ms Malka students at the ultra-orthodox Jewish girls school Adass Israel in Melbourne disclosed they had been sexually abused by Malka Leifer, the school principal. Almost immediately, Leifer fled to Israel, with the assistance of the school board. She was later charged in Victorian courts with 74 counts of sexual assault and rape. In 2014 the Australian government applied for Leifer's extradition back to Australia to face these charges, but so far she has managed to avoid extradition, on the basis that she is not mentally fit to stand trial. It is now nearly four years since those Victorian charges. Perhaps the Israeli judicial system and the Israeli Minister of Justice might consider having an independent psychiatric panel re-evaluate Ms Leifer's ability to go before an extradition hearing in Israel and be returned to Australia to face those very grave charges. Yesterday I met Dassi Erlich, who is one of my constituents. She has also met with the PM, in the company of the former Victorian Premier Ted Baillieu, who has done a good job in assisting her. My friend Merav Michaeli, a member of the Israeli Knesset who was recently here, has held a press conference in Israel with Dassi and has drawn a great deal of attention to this outrageous case in the Israeli system. A number of us will meet with Ayelet Shaked, the Israeli justice minister, when we are at the Beersheba commemoration, to press Dassi Erlich's concerns and to see if a fair and independent evaluation of the accused person can see that she is brought back to Australia. The absconded principal should be returned to Australia, a country friendly to Israel, to face charges against her by Dassi Erlich and a number of other young women who were sexually abused. It is most unfair that Dassi Erlich has been left hanging with these issues that still oppress her and a number of other young women in my electorate. Only via a proper trial, with Ms Leifer facing a Victorian court, can these issues be properly addressed. I'm hoping that the pressure that friends in the Knesset have mounted will see that this issue has a much higher priority in Israel. I also hope that the delegations of people-including the Prime Minister, me, Mark Dreyfus and others-going over there for the commemoration of the charge of Beersheba will help bring justice for Dassi Erlich and the other young women who were so badly treated. Turkey (10:04): This year marks the 50th anniversary of the establishment of official relations between Australia and Turkey. On4 October 1967 the Australian immigration minister, Billy Snedden, and the Turkish ambassador, Baha Vefa Karatay, signed an assisted migration agreement which paved the way for thousands of Turks to come to Australia as guest workers. I want to speak a little bit about our historic relations given those 50 years of shared history. Like every other immigrant community, the Turks have worked hard and have helped build Australia as we know it today. Today there are more than 150,000 Australians of Turkish",174,Notices

145,Mr Hawke (Mitchell,"Assistant Minister for Immigration and Border Protection)descent calling Australia home. Australia's history with Turkey goes back to way before the 1967 agreement, as all of us here are patently aware. Given the Centenary of ANZAC that we marked in 2015 and the commemorations that continue, I want to provide a few examples of some of the shared stories that mark the journey of Australian and Turkish relations over the years. I want to speak of a young surgeon from Victoria who was seeking adventure in Europe and enlisted in the Ottoman army during the 1877 Battle of Pleven. Charles Snodgrass Ryan received the highest of the Ottoman military honours for his service. On his return, as the story goes, he treated Ned Kelly, who was wounded during the infamous shootout in Glenrowan in 1880. Ryan returned to Turkey in 1915, this time as a surgeon with the AIF in Gallipoli. During a ceasefire, Turks in the trenches were intrigued to see an Australian officer wearing Ottoman army medals, supervising the burial of Turks. Once they learned of Ryan's story, they all lined up to pay him respect. Meanwhile in Gallipoli, a commander with the Turkish forces, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, and a commander with the British troops, Stanley Melbourne Bruce, were on opposite sides. Bruce would become the eighth Prime Minister of Australia in 1923-the same year that Mustafa Kemal Ataturk and his friends founded the new Turkish republic. The two men's paths crossed again at the international conference on the Turkish Straits. Bruce was chairing the League of Nations meeting in 1936 that set the status of the Turkish Straits. They admired each other as statesmen. They shared the common vision for world order. Mustafa Kemal Ataturk's present to Bruce was a gold cigarette case that, according to some accounts, Bruce carried until the time of his death, where he had two photos-one of his wife and one of Ataturk. In 2015, we celebrated and commemorated the centenary of ANZAC. Now, in 2017, where we were once old foes, we have developed a friendship out of a shared tragedy. Turks attended ANZAC Day services. Australians of Turkish descent were touched by Ataturk's letter to ANZAC mothers-that famous letter which we all know now by heart, with the quote, 'Having lost their lives on this land, they have become our sons as well.' In 1951, ANZACs and Turks were on the same side in Korea at Kapyong. They even planned a joint ANZAC ceremony that wouldn't go ahead due to the Battle of Kapyong. In 1967, after years of diplomatic work, this time Turkey sent its sons and daughters to Australia. They provided much-needed labour and helped propel our economy in a growing phase post-World War II. Turkey and Australia remain allies in the global war on terrorism. Turkey, obviously, is at the forefront of refugee resettlement in the region. Trade between our countries is booming. The 1967 agreement, 50 years on, paved the way for the relations between our countries and the relationship spanning the modern history of both nations. (Time expired) Fiji Ms ROWLAND (Greenway) (10:07): On 10 October 1970, the tiny Pacific nation of Fiji gained independence from Britain and a parliamentary democracy was established. Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara was the first Prime Minister. He is considered by many as the founding father of modern Fiji. Fiji's independence and subsequent break from monarchical reign is a proud achievement. Fiji has faced great challenges and, at times, upheaval in its short independent history. In the past, democratic freedom in Fiji has been a source of contention and concern. In September 2014, we saw the country take part in its first democratic election since the military coup of December 2006. It was a privilege for me to be part of the observer delegation for that election-my first visit to Fiji. On the weekend, I had the privilege to attend the 2017 Fiji Independence Day celebrations at Liverpool. It was a great opportunity for me to catch up with friends old and new. Many dignitaries and consular officials also attended. Prime Minister Bainimarama and his wife were special guests again this year. Like last year, the Prime Minister spoke of his vision and hopes for his beloved Fiji. His emphasis was on education and opportunity. He spoke about the introduction of free education for primary and secondary students. He acknowledged that education was the key to future job prospects. He spoke about his government providing opportunities for all Fijians to further their skills and enhance their employment opportunities, regardless of their cultural or religious backgrounds. The Fijian civil service, he said, will no longer be a place where employees are at an advantage because of their family name, tribal standing or who they know. Recruitment processes will be based on merit and transparency. He spoke of telecommunications driving investment. As with last year's speech, the Prime Minister spoke passionately about his country, his government and his people. He emphasised that no-one should be discriminated against or disadvantaged. I was impressed with his vision and conviction in ensuring his Fiji is one that is committed to standing side by side to forge ahead as a powerful and fair Pacific nation. The Prime Minister didn't want Fijians to feel they had to leave their homeland to broaden their skills and provide their families with greater opportunities. I've spoken in this place about my own Fijian heritage. I spoke on the day about the contributions that many Fijian Australians have made to our great nation. Many families migrated to Australia to provide their children with better education, access to health care and stronger employment prospects. To hear the Prime Minister speak of his administration's mandate to provide all Fijians with such opportunities irrespective of race, gender or religion was extremely heartening. I also spoke of the Fijian consular officials based here in Australia and the hard work and commitment they have displayed representing their country so passionately and professionally. This year's Fiji Day was bigger than last year, with thousands of people from all cultures attending and celebrating the warm, vibrant and generous culture of the Fijian people. Congratulations to the organisers for their efforts and hospitality. It is a credit to you how well attended the day was. To the many families who ran stalls, I say a hearty vinaka vakalevu, and Sota Tale: I look forward to seeing you next year. Mining North Queensland want, they are more jobs and a reduction in power prices. These are essential things. They not only want jobs; they want job security in the post mining boom world. They want to know they can pay their bills to keep the lights on and keep the air conditioning running, particularly during the North Queensland summer. One of the keys to achieving both of these goals is to build a high-efficiency, low-emission-HELE-coal-fired power plant in North Queensland. Support for a clean, coal-fired power station is high. The Townsville Bulletin conducted a poll last month in which 79 per cent of respondents supported",176,Constituency Statements
146,Mr Christensen (Dawson) (10:10,"If there are two things the people of Central and the idea of building a HELE coal-fired power plant in North Queensland. This is backed up by findings of a NSW Minerals Council poll where 64 per cent of 1,000 respondents were in favour of a HELE power plant. We have abundant coal in Queensland, and a HELE coal-fired power station constructed at the mouth of a coalmine would be extremely cost-efficient and it would avoid transmission losses that occur when power is sent from the southern parts of Queensland up to the north of the state. It would also deliver jobs in construction and more jobs in the industries that flourish with affordable and reliable power-jobs also during the operational phase. Central and North Queensland is home to some of the largest and best-quality coal reserves in the world. That coal is currently being exported to other countries around the world for making steel; also for generating electricity with HELE technology. HELE generators produce up to 50 per cent fewer emissions. More than a thousand of these generators have already been built or are under construction around the world, predominantly in China and India. North Queensland is a perfect location for Australia to build its first. Industries in the north pay an exorbitant price for electricity because so much power is lost transmitting over long distances. Building a generator at the mouth of a greenfield coalmine in North Queensland makes economic sense, cutting transport costs to the generator and reducing losses from long-distance transmission. Some years ago, Townsville Enterprise Ltd commissioned a report-that was funded by the Gillard Labor government-titled Base Load Power in North Queensland & The Dalrymple Agricultural Scheme. It noted the need for additional capacity and found that a major coal-fired power station would put downward pressure on electricity prices in the north, with a potential $838 million social cost-benefit gain. People are more interested in affordables than renewables. That's why I've been fighting for a clean, coal-fired power station in the north for the past 12 months, and I will continue to do so. My message to Canberra, to both the government and the opposition is this: we need to power the north. We need to power the north by lowering power prices and by creating jobs. We can do that by building a clean, coal-fired power station in North Queensland. I urge the government and I urge the opposition to support powering the north. Crown Casino Melbourne serious misconduct at Crown Casino. These allegations have been brought to me by a number of former Crown employees. Although the allegations focus on Crown in Melbourne, they also suggest a broader pattern of misbehaviour in the poker machine industry, and that, obviously, has grave implications for people right around Australia, including in my electorate of Denison. For example, the whistleblowers allege illegal machine tampering, including the disabling of lower-bet options and the modifying of buttons to allow prohibited autoplay, both of which increase gambler losses. Moreover, there's software manipulation to increase gambler losses even further, in particular, on weekends when the number of naive, first-time and casual users is obviously much greater. I'm horrified to recount that the Victorian Commission for Gaming and Liquor Regulation has allegedly done nothing to stop this shocking criminal misconduct. According to whistleblowers, in some cases the commission is clearly complicit in covering it up.",178,Constituency Statements
147,Mr Wilkie (Denison) (10:13,"For some time, I've been investigating allegations ofRegrettably, the alleged misconduct at Crown is not limited to poker machines. Indeed, the whistleblowers also allege that the casino avoids AUSTRAC's scrutiny of individuals involved in transactions over $10,000 by sometimes tolerating and even encouraging the misuse of identity documents. If these allegations are true, then Crown would be facilitating money laundering for any number of nefarious reasons, like tax fraud, drug running and even terrorism. Other examples of alleged misconduct at Crown include the sanctioned use of illicit drugs at the casino, the practice of covering up domestic violence, and management's disinterest in staff flaunting the law prohibiting them gambling at the venue. There are too many allegations to address in this short speech, so I encourage members and senators, law enforcement and regulatory agencies, and the media to scrutinise the video record of the whistleblowers' testimonies. You will see that the identities of the whistleblowers have been obscured for their personal safety, and because it was a condition of them speaking out. However, their identities have been confirmed by me, and I'm confident we must consider very seriously the information they provide. These whistleblowers know the risks they're taking by speaking up. I pay tribute to them for doing this. I also call on the federal and Victorian governments to ensure that the allegations are investigated thoroughly. Many laws have possibly been broken, and the truth will not be uncovered without a parliamentary inquiry and investigations by law enforcement and regulatory agencies. I seek leave to table a copy of the record of interview with the Crown Casino whistleblowers. Mr Robert: The government hasn't seen the information the member is seeking to present, so has no comment on its veracity, but the government is always open to, and always wants to ensure, complete transparency in this parliament. The government's also aware that every member is responsible for their own statements and their words, and stands behind those. Having said that, and noting that, the government is allowing leave. Leave granted. Banks Electorate: Community Events 38th annual spring festival in Gannons Park at Peakhurst. As always, it was a fantastic day, with literally tens of thousands of people attending-they estimate around 40,000 people came on the day. Over the history of the event, more than $1 million has been raised for a range of great, charitable causes, many of them very local indeed. On the day, there were over 150 stalls, which included stalls from a range of local businesses, live entertainment and various competitions. It was also good to see the Army, SES, fire services and police represented at stalls on the day. I'd like to thank everyone at Lugarno Lions, one of the great Lions Clubs of Australia.

The Bullettes have been around since 1999 and have 17 teams across both junior and senior competitions-about 150 players. They, of course, play at the big netball centre at Condell Park as part of the Bankstown City Netball Association. It was great night with a fantastic atmosphere. It was great to see many of the young players recognised for their achievements during the year. Congratulations to everyone at East Hills Bullettes on a great 2017. Macquarie Electorate: Environment Meals on Wheels Ms TEMPLEMAN (Macquarie) (10:19): The New South Wales government's plan to dump a modern concrete bridge in Windsor's historic Thompson Square is about to claim another heritage victim. On Sunday, I stood in front of a cross-section of Telford paving-a type of early-19th-century road construction named after a Scottish engineer, which was a leap forward in road building in the world. In the one other known place in Australia where there is Telford paving, near North Sydney, the structure is heritage-listed and preserved. The New South Wales government's own tender documents for the Windsor development reveal that it is likely the Telford paving used in the early roads runs all the way through historic Thompson Square. This whole area is about to be ripped apart, as work to remove Aboriginal and colonial archaeological artefacts begins. This is vandalism of yet another piece of the history of Australia's settlement and expansion-against the advice of the New South Wales government's own heritage office and the National Trust, at a key colonial site-that the environment minister has the power to stop. But he refuses to act. The community is begging that the federal environment minister exercise his powers to emergency-list this Georgian square to preserve the remains of the early settlement, and the aeolian sands and the treasures they hold. Meals on Wheels has been a service that Australians have taken for granted for decades. In the Hawkesbury region of my electorate of Macquarie, Meals on Wheels has been operating for 50 years. This achievement was celebrated at a big birthday bash at the Hawkesbury Race Club, and was a chance to reflect on the changes the organisation has seen and the milestones it has achieved. In New South Wales, most Meals on Wheels services receive Australian government funding from the Department of Health to help cover administrative costs. That support is crucial, and must continue. But we all know that the heart of Meals on Wheels is the enormous contribution of the volunteers. In the Hawkesbury, you have to travel 72 kilometres at the furthest point to deliver a meal to a client-north to Wisemans Ferry, west to Mountain Lagoon. Volunteers drive a really long way. We know that there are not just the benefits of a nutritionally balanced meal but also flow-on benefits, like the opportunity for early intervention, and the sense of connection that the delivery of meals provides. The volunteers tell me they get as much out of it as the clients do. It's a service that really respects the contribution an elderly person has to make, by allowing time for a natter-the sort of thing I remember doing with my grandmother. The Hawkesbury service was started by Windsor Rotary 50 years ago. They're still supporting it, as is Kurrajong North Richmond Rotary. Many volunteers received recognition for their services, including Shirley Smith, who leads the team, and Margaret Elder. They all deserve congratulations. Banks Electorate: Football Association Gold Medal Dinner. It was fantastic night, with all the clubs of the St George Football Association coming together at a terrific venue. There are over 10,000 soccer players in the St George region. It's an absolutely critical part of our community. It was great to be there to present some awards, and also to chat with many of the local clubs in our area. There were people there from Forest Rangers, Lugarno, Renown United, Hurstville City Minotaurs, Carlton Rovers, Connells Point Rovers, and a whole range of other teams. It also great to chat to Craig Kiely, the very effective general manager of the St George Football Association, who put on this great event for the community. It was also particularly good to see Executive Chairman of the St George Football Association Sok Mallios there on the night. Sok has done an enormous amount for the football community over decades-many decades-and all of us who were there were very glad to see Sok, and to have the opportunity to acknowledge his tremendous service to the game. On 17 September, I attended the end-of-season presentation for the Connells Point Rovers Football Club at Club Central in Hurstville. Connells Point Rovers are one of the largest clubs in the St George region, with more than 800 players and some 70 teams, from under-sixes all the way up to over-35s. The Connells Point Rovers play down at Poulton Park. The reality is that Poulton Park is not in as good a condition as it could be. That needs to change. It needs to be improved. I look forward to talking to the club further about that important issue. I thank Steve Matthews, the club president, Dave Haggett, the club secretary, and everyone else involved in that very active club for all their work. On 15 September I attended the end-of-season celebration of the Bankstown District Amateur Football Association at the Revesby Workers Club. BDAFA oversees all the clubs in the Bankstown region, including the six clubs that are located in the Banks electorate: Panania Diggers, St Christopher's, Revesby Workers, Revesby Rovers, Padstow United and Padstow Hornets. It was great to see all of those clubs represented at the BDAFA awards. The volunteers were acknowledged for all of their efforts. Football is overwhelmingly a game of volunteers. People put in enormous effort, largely so that their kids have the best opportunity they can to play football, which is a very noble thing to do. I thank Shane Merry, the CEO, and Glenn Rufford, the chairman, for all their efforts at BDAFA.",180,Constituency Statements

I've spoken often in this place about the potential that exists in my electorate of Bass. It is true that we face challenges-in particular, those of generational disadvantage and the related pressures that this places on our community, including social isolation and related poor health and education outcomes. In some areas of Bass the rate of poverty is as high as 20 per cent, with over a third of households dependent on income support payments as their main source of income. We have high rates of unemployment, underemployment and insecure work. According to the most recent ABS statistics, there are 6.4 unemployed Tasmanians competing for each vacant job. This government and the Hodgman state Liberal government have presided over what's become an economic standstill in Northern Tasmania. However, I remain optimistic about the opportunities we have for the future in Bass. I have a vision for Northern Tasmania as a region that has a focus on high-end industry and advanced manufacturing, supported by our tourism industry and greater educational opportunities. We are already making waves in the advanced manufacturing space, with the Australian Maritime College and local companies, like Definium Technologies and Van Diemen Luxury Craft, continuing to grow, creating local jobs and opening up Tasmania to national and international markets in areas where innovation and quality drive market growth. From this renewed focus on industry and advanced manufacturing I see a clear pathway to training and education, specifically for this type of work and training being undertaken locally. The relocation of the University of Tasmania's northern campus will make Launceston a central education hub, providing opportunities for the ongoing upskilling of the local workforce, including school leavers and those already in employment seeking better employment opportunities. This investment in Northern Tasmania will strengthen the liveability of the region and will have multiple positive flow-on effects, particularly for tourism, which already directly and indirectly contributes about $2.5 billion a year to Tasmania's gross state product, which is the highest economic contributor for any state in Australia. I'm the first to admit that there is work to be done to meet the challenges facing Northern Tasmania-challenges that have only been exacerbated by the ineffectiveness in Tasmania of the state government and the federal government. However, I remain confident in my vision for Northern Tasmania and in Labor's vision for Bass. We are already seeing glimpses of this positive future. I look forward to seeing the region flourish as we further capitalise on the potential that exists in Northern Tasmania. It's particularly important for me to mention the role of renewable energy in Northern Tasmania. We have advanced manufacturing in the form of Haywards engineering that provides wind towers. That sort of job is the future of Tasmania. (Time expired) Dunkley Electorate: Small Business Dunkley the Minister for Small Business, the Hon. Michael McCormack.

When I spoke in the House to fight for a reduction in the taxation rate for small businesses to 27.5 per cent, I was fighting for them. When I and my colleagues spoke in support of simplifying legislation and removing crippling red tape, we fought for them. And when Minister McCormack came to Dunkley to speak directly to our local businesspeople, it was clear that the Turnbull coalition government fights for small business. The minister and I visited the main street market in Mornington, as well as Young Street in Frankston, speaking to local craftspeople, shop owners and locals, including, for example, those in Empire Mall benefiting from our $600,000 federal government upgrade. We engaged in open and frank conversation with small business owners as well in a forum that, in particular, attracted much interest. The Dunkley Small Business Roadshow brought representatives from the Australian Taxation Office, the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman, as well as representatives from the department and the minister's office to listen and help representatives from local manufacturers and businesses, such as Pacific Urethanes; finance company, GCS Credit; local produce manufacturer, Blue Bay Cheese; rent4keeps; and many other small businesses. The roadshow was a fantastic opportunity to gain insight to the thoughts and concerns of such an important part of our community, including the traders affected by the troubled Young Street works in Frankston who have experienced significant delays across the board and, because of that, have experienced downturns in business, forcing many to lay off staff or to close due to the state government's delayed Young Street works. I was glad that, to reinforce my continued support and advocacy for their businesses, Minister McCormack and I were able to show them that the coalition government cares about their welfare, even if our state counterparts don't. I would like to sincerely thank the minister for his time in coming down to Dunkley to speak with our local traders and entrepreneurs, and commend his continual efforts to remove red tape and to let Dunkley small businesses flourish.

154,Mr Falinski (Mackellar) (10:32,"I'm very glad to speak in favour of this bill, notmoney or, indeed, giving up a never-ending stream of good-news stories to key constituencies. I stand here to support this piece of legislation because history has shown us over and over again that lower taxes with less government leads to a better society because it is a freer society, a more equal society and a happier one. Western democratic societies have never had to set up their own institutes to measure global happiness in order to declare themselves the happiest people on the planet. It really is Disneyland politics. If we are to bring the best of ourselves to this place, then surely we must learn from history. Surely we must enact legislation that we know will help our community be happier and will give people more opportunities and, therefore, more choices. Underlying this bill is the lesson that we have all learnt over many years: when the state taxes its people and companies less, people are better off. The reason for this is pretty obvious: individuals are better at spending their own money than the government. It is what PJ O'Rourke calls the 'other people syndrome'-that we're better at spending other people's money than we are at spending our own. If, let's say, I'm buying myself a car with my own money, you can bet I'm going to get a pretty good car at a pretty good price. But, when I'm buying a car for someone else, with someone else's money-let's just put it this way-different criteria apply and that person gets a very different car to the one I would have bought myself. Wherever possible, we should leave money in the hands of other people who earned it, because they are going to use it more sensibly and more effectively than the state. And so it is with company tax. You see, companies do not really pay tax; they collect tax. Any tax you charge a company is passed on in lower growth, lower investment, higher prices, lower returns and lower wages. When you vote against this bill, what you are voting for-and let's be very clear-are fewer jobs for those out of work and lower wages for those in work. That's what the Labor Party stands for when it opposes this bill. Many Australian companies have to compete against foreign companies that emanate from jurisdictions with much lower rates of tax and much friendlier tax environments. How are they meant to compete in the market when that is the situation? Why do some people in this place want Australian owned companies to do worse than foreign owned companies? What this parliament needs to appreciate is that you can't move land and you are limited to how many people you can move-and it is always the most skilled that do-but there are few limits on how much capital you can move around the world. In an environment where most investors are happy with returns that are less than 10 per cent, what do you think the attitude of international investors is when they are faced with more viable businesses in Australia that have to pay 30 per cent tax versus one in Singapore at 15 per cent or one in Ireland at just 10 per cent? So if you are a small business or a start-up, or just trying to grow your business, forget about getting competitive and reasonable financing from overseas. You see, the Labor Party and the Greens want to make sure that you only get a loan from the banks, that you have to put your house on the line-and anything else you might have. If you lower tax rates, you increase the supply of risk capital in our economy. If you are the Greens or Labor, you don't want to see the banks having to compete for business-oh no, none of that for their mates in the banking sector! You see, under Labor and the Greens, the only people entitled to preferential treatment are the unions. And if you are an Australian entrepreneur trying to build a business that employs people, that provides jobs and creates competition so consumers can get a better deal, don't expect to get any favours under Labor or the Greens-because those opposite believe they are better at spending other people's money. Let's just review what the bill does. Further to the Treasury Laws Amendment Act 2017, the bill amends the Income Tax Rates Act 1986 to progressively extend the lower 27.5 per cent corporate tax rate to all corporate tax entities by the 2023 financial year and further reduce the corporate tax rate in stages so that by the 2026 financial year the corporate tax rate for all entities will be 25 per cent. At the moment, the company tax rate has only been reduced to 27.5 per cent and this reduction only applies to businesses with aggregated turnover of less than $10 million from 2016 and businesses with aggregated turnover of less than $25 million from 2017. Reduction of the corporate tax rate then applies to businesses with an aggregated turnover of less than $50 million from the 2018 income year onwards. This bill contains residual components that did not pass in May 2017. These include provisions to incorporate tax reduction progressively within a specific time frame. This bill allows the tax reduction to apply gradually to higher turnover thresholds until a cut-off to businesses earning less than a billion dollars by 2023. The threshold changes are: $100 million in the income year 2019; $250 million in the income year 2020; $500 million in the income year 2021; and a billion dollars in the income year 2022. Aggregated turnover threshold is then removed in 2023. A uniform company tax rate of 27 per cent would then apply to all businesses in the 2024 income year, which would then be lowered to 26 per cent a year later and, finally, remain at 25 per cent from the 2026 income year onwards. These changes would further encourage growth and innovation and promote investment that would then grow the economy, making Australia more competitive with other countries. The benefits are broader than tax cuts. Increasing the aggregated turnover threshold will increase access to small business entity concessions, such as the $20,000 write-off for depreciating assets, immediate deductions for certain expenditures and simplified depreciation rules. Economy-wide modelling by Treasury and KPMG suggests change will have net benefit on GDP, GNI, employment and investment. So companies in my electorate such as PharmaCare, which provide supplements to help people lead healthier lives, can invest in bringing more products to market to help people avoid health issues and live healthier lives. And, while they are doing that, they are growing their business here in Australia and employing more Australians. Or what about Dematic, a company that designs and builds the logistical systems for the warehouses that increasingly drive our economy. Dematic, like so many other businesses, has multiple choices as to where it invests its money. It can ramp-up its businesses on the Northern Beaches of Sydney, building up its high-end design and engineering units, or it can do that in one of the other five nations in which it operates. You cannot tell anyone here, except for those members who keep unicorns as pets, that the level of tax they are paying in one country over another does not play a role in their decision-making process about where they invest their money. Look at Link Healthcare, founded by John Bacon and his wife Lyn. It is a truly innovative company; it has expanded around the world. It has saved many lives and, just as importantly, it has made the lives of so many others better. It supplies drugs to the Australian market, when, to put it bluntly, none of the large multinational pharmaceutical companies would. According to Labor and the Greens, this truly remarkable Australian company should be put at a disadvantage compared to the very companies that could not and would not help Australians. While there are plenty of other businesses in my community that would also benefit from a fairer, better and more efficient tax system, let me focus on two more only, starting with Kobi Simmat and his team at Best Practice Certification. They are doing the back-end work that helps digitise and grow companies. It is a company that helps others get on with doing business and provides a better place for all Australians. As my second example, we have Andrew and Pip Goldsmith from The Boathouse. They took a punt-no pun intended-and ploughed money into a run-down wharf that no-one else would touch. It is now virtually impossible to get into, as people from right across Sydney come to have breakfast and coffee over the water at Pittwater. With lower taxes, this parliament will be encouraging more Australians to have a go and invest in buildings that have not been used for years and create spaces that people want to be in or, in their case, on. There are many other examples, like Incat Crowther, which are tendering to have their own designed ships built by the US Navy, or like H.I. Fraser, which does engineering work on things like dams. So there you have it: companies that make people healthier, that supply warehouses, that build ships and dams and that invest in public buildings. All of them employ Australians, all of them export overseas, all of them make our nation stronger and more content. And Labor and the Greens want to hurt them all. economics as 'the less than elegant metaphor that, if one feeds the horse enough oats, some will pass through to the road for the sparrows'. For the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, this analogy may as well be tattooed on their brows. Trickle-down economics is the mantra and the gospel of this government. It's the snake oil they peddle and the broken ideology at the centre of their politics and their policy. It's the broken ideology that they have come into this place to prosecute on behalf of their mates in big business, who fill Liberal Party coffers with one hand and suppress wages and keep megaprofits ticking over with the other. It's a broken ideology. Now, all around the world, people are revolting against it, and young people, in particular, are standing up. If you listen to this government, you would think that a big corporate tax cut is the first stepping stone towards a perfect society, where everyone has a well-paid job, everything is cheap and everyone lives in a nice big house. If you listen to this government, you would hear the best way to make Australia a better place isn't by properly funding schools and hospitals or by investing heavily in the infrastructure of tomorrow-and it is certainly not by taking action on dangerous global warming that's threatening our way of life and it's certainly not by looking after vulnerable people. Apparently-apparently-cutting the corporate tax rate is the secret to unlocking the vast potential of our society. Apparently, if we give the very rich more slices of the pie, all our problems will be solved. Well, that's not what the analysis suggests. Late last year the tax office released a transparency report which showed almost 680 companies, with more than $100 million in income, paid no tax in 2014-15-680 companies! At the same time we have companies in Australia who are making a motza and paying no tax, the government's saying, 'Well, perhaps",184,Bills
155,Mr Bandt (Melbourne) (10:42,"John Kenneth Galbraith described trickle-downwe should give these companies a tax cut.' Why not start by asking the ones who are paying no tax to pay their fair share before we talk about giving handouts to the very wealthy? In the lead-up to the election, research by the Australia Institute showed that there is no correlation between corporate tax rates and economic growth in OECD countries-that companies with lower company tax rates have lower standards of living, measured as purchasing power of GDP per capita. It also found that wages and mixed income had declined a share of GDP as corporate tax rates have been lowered and that average unemployment rates have risen as company tax rates have been lowered. But this government doesn't let the facts get in the way of a good scare campaign. Instead, the Prime Minister, along with everyone else in his government, has taken a leaf out of Donald Trump's book by trying to convince us that tax is somehow an emotional or moral burden for society that they are courageously and selflessly ridding us of. These people are cradling the dying tenets of neo-Liberalism in their arms. They are desperately fanning the flames of fear around this building every time question time rolls around. One might ask: how has it come to this? Alarmingly, the answer is all too familiar, because some of the biggest problems with politics today can be traced back to former Prime Minister Abbott, the member for Warringah, who has helped poison the debate. While current Prime Minister Turnbull pretends he's capable of engineering a mature conversation about economics, he's just in lock step with former Prime Minister Abbott. He's following in his predecessor's footsteps. Ultimately, the point of this whole big show is a distraction. It's a way of trying to distract the Australian people from the stark reality that's bearing down and that people are feeling every day: inequality is very real in this country and is getting worse, wage growth has stalled and youth unemployment is worryingly high and hasn't come back to normal levels since the GFC. This means that we are condemning hundreds of thousands of young people to life without ever knowing a secure income or a proper job. All of that is happening under this government's watch. Their answer is to say, 'Well, the problem is that the big banks are paying too much tax.' According to Oxfam, the top one per cent in this country have over 22 per cent of the wealth, and the top one per cent in this country own more wealth than the bottom 70 per cent of Australians combined. Just think about that: the bottom 70 per cent of Australian have less combined wealth than the top one per cent. That's the kind of US-style society that we're heading towards. We hear reports that the Commonwealth Bank has made a record profit, even after allegedly breaching money laundering and terrorism finance laws, and then the government says that the big banks deserve a tax cut. Let's just consider the government's argument for a moment. The government says, 'If we cut the tax rates to big companies, they're going to somehow employ more people.' Do you really think that, if the big four banks get $7 billion in tax cuts, as the government wants to give them, they're going to use that to suddenly employ all of those young Australians who are currently finding life tough because they haven't got a job? No. It's going to go straight to their profits-straight to their bottom line. The banks aren't crying out and saying, 'We'd love to employ more people, if only we paid less tax.' It's just going to be a big gift to the big banks and it will come at a cost, because that's less money that this government has to spend on schools or hospitals or looking after people who are doing it tough. In a society where the bottom 70 per cent of us have less than the top one per cent of us, by having less money available to build the common good so that it can give the big banks a tax cut is going to increase inequality. They're not even keeping the fact that this government is owned by the top one per cent a secret. There was a fundraiser last year in the lead-up to the election for the Treasurer and the member for Higgins. It was sponsored by one of the big four banks-the same bank that the member for Higgins used to work at. The government aren't even keeping it a secret that they're sponsored by the big banks. The revolving door between politics and big business is still spinning, and it's showing no sign of slowing down. It's grotesque and, sadly, it has been successful. As hard as it is to say, right now greed and corporate interests are doing very well in the battle in Australia. They gaze down at everyone else with contempt and contemplate new ways to erode the middle and working classes in this country. What we should be doing here in this place is standing up to powerful interests. What we should be running here is a democracy that is truly representative, that looks out for the interests of regular people, not just the interests of big business, who can afford to employ the lobbyists and the ex-politicians and then come here and demand a tax cut. What this place needs to remember is that everyday people built those companies and that those companies would be nothing without everyday people working for them. This place needs to remember that, to fund the essential services which we rely on, which we all use and which we're all proud of, we need everyone to pay their fair share of tax. I urge the politicians of this country to stop this capitulation. The Labor Party has followed in the Greens' policy footsteps before; the Liberal Party has even followed in the Greens' policy footsteps before. They should do it again, because it is appalling that this government has the guts to stand up here, knowing how many people are unemployed or underemployed and want more work but can't get it and knowing that young people are doing it tough, and say, 'We want the big four banks to get an extra few billion dollars a year because they are not making enough.' Well, this race to the bottom has to end. The concentration of wealth at the top has to end. As long as the people in power in this place are owned by the corporate interests that put them in, we won't get any meaningful reform. Some standards do need to be raised in this place. This government has, and will have, a lot to answer for if it goes ahead with this giant wasteful tax cut. If the Australian people had a choice between ensuring everyone could get their kids to the school of their choice and having it well funded and knowing they would be looked after in a public hospital if they got sick, knowing that it would mean asking the very rich in this country to start paying some tax instead of getting a tax cut, or giving the big four banks a tax cut, I know what most people would choose. What is at stake with this bill is nothing more than, and nothing less than, the beginning of the erosion of egalitarianism in Australia and of the principle that in Australia, no matter where you come from or how much money you have, if you get sick the hospital will look after you. If you need to go to a doctor, they can see you without demanding your credit card first. In Australia, everyone gets to go to school, TAFE or university, no matter how much money they have. What's at stake is our belief that that is a fundamental principle that beats at the heart of this society. If we believe that, we've got to fund it. The question then is: who should we ask to foot the bill? The answer is very, very simple: those footing the bill should be the companies which are making world-leading record profits-they should be asked to chip in their fair share. Those 600-odd companies earning over $100 million a year that are currently paying no tax should be made to pay their legal minimum. If we do that and if we get rid of those unfair tax breaks for the people at the top, there will be enough money to make sure Australia is a place where everyone is looked after. We will be able to preserve egalitarianism in this country. If we think the solution to our current problems is to become more like the United States, then we are in strife. If government backbenchers stand up here and say, 'We have to do this because Donald Trump has done it,' then we are in serious strife. I do not want to outsource the government of this country to Donald Trump. I do not want our decisions about what is right for people in this country to be made by a reckless, dangerous president, who will do everything he can to wreck his own country and grow the gap between the rich and everyone else. If you believe that Australia is a place where everyone has a place, a country where everyone should be treated equally, no matter how much money they've got, and if you believe that the point of government is to make sure that everyone gets looked after and is can get the education and health care they want, no matter how much money they have, then you will vote against this bill. Ms CLAYDON (Newcastle) (10:55): I rise today to add my voice of dissent to this debate on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Enterprise Tax Plan No. 2) Bill 2017. This is the government's $65 billion ram raid on the federal budget, a raid that will hike the deficit, deepen the debt and force vital services to be slashed. Those opposite screeched hysterically about the 'debt and deficit disaster' for months before the 2013 election, but you don't hear that much around these parts anymore. That's because they don't want to remind Australians about the damage they have done in the past four years to our national accounts, damage that far exceeds anything incurred in protecting the country from the global financial crisis. In fact, they have hiked up the debt to a colossal half a trillion dollars, for the first time in Australian history, and very few Australians could even conceive of what half a trillion dollars looks like. Make no mistake: this Abbott-Turnbull government has trashed the budget and threatened the hard-won AAA credit rating that the formal Labor government secured for the first time in our nation's history. Now they want to rip a further $65 billion out of the budget for a corporate tax cut, with no evidence of any substantial impact on jobs or growth. Now let's be honest: there are only two ways the government will be able to fund this incredible corporate gift. They can sit back and watch the debt climb or they can continue their usual practice of gutting health, education and vital public services. It's an undeniable truth-every single dollar you rip out of the budget to give back to companies is a dollar you can't spend on health, education, infrastructure and the things we really need to drive jobs and growth. Realistically, the government won't be able to find the cuts to make up for this breathtaking shortfall. Our budget is likely to continue mounting, while vital services get cut to the bone. This plan is reckless and it is dangerous, and there is no evidence that it will do anything but fatten shareholders' dividends and bolster already bumper profits. The big banks, which have a shameful rap sheet of scandals that have claimed thousands of Australian victims, will be rewarded-wait for it-with a $7.4 billion windfall. And an estimated 40 per cent of the money will head straight overseas to offshore investors and foreign tax authorities. Labor agrees that our tax plan desperately needs repair, but we don't think we should do this by handing over billions of dollars to the big end of town. We want to see real reform and a fairer system that minimises wasteful tax breaks which disproportionately benefit wealthy Australians. We don't think it's right that some Australians are able to employ strategies that aren't available to millions of pay-as-you-go workers to dramatically reduce how much tax they owe. We want to do something about the excessive negative gearing and capital gains tax concessions that largely benefit wealthy property investors, the very same tax breaks that are driving up house prices and locking millions of Australians out of home ownership. We want to curb the practice of people using trusts to artificially split their incomes between family members in order to dramatically reduce their tax obligations. It's not illegal, but it is immoral. That's the sort of thing the government should be looking to curb. For us on this side of the House, we also want to limit the amount of money that can be claimed for managing tax affairs. We think it's wrong that big companies pay a lower tax rate than lowerand middle-income Australians. We want to see some transparency, where businesses earning over $100 million are required to publicly disclose how much tax they pay. We want to shut down loopholes that allow multinational companies to shift their profits and avoid paying tax. But the government want to give them a further tax break. And, regretfully, each and every other one of these measures that would bring more fairness and more accountability to Australia's tax regime while saving billions of dollars has been opposed by the government. So let's be clear: Labor wants a fair tax system, and we understand the importance of budget repair. What we don't want to do is levy a burden of debt and crippled services on future generations by handing $65 billion to the big end of town. Already, one-third of Australian companies pay no tax-I repeat: no tax-and the biggest multinational companies operating in Australia pay just over half the headline corporate tax rate of 30 per cent. Let's just pause for a moment to really think about this. This means that multinational companies earning billions of dollars are paying a lower average rate of tax than Australian nurses or Australian teachers. Most Australians would be appalled to hear this and would rightfully expect the government to rectify the situation. But, rather than fixing things, Mr Turnbull plans to make it worse by giving big companies a tax cut while he levies a tax hike on working Australians earning more than $21,000. In what world is that fair? What cruel and twisted priorities does that demonstrate? The Turnbull government are shamelessly, transparently and single-mindedly focused on finding new ways to funnel public funds to the big end of town while fighting tooth and nail to protect the tax lurks and loopholes for the wealthy that do nothing to boost growth. They are a government at war with lowand middle-income Australians. They've trashed your services. They've cut your penalty rates. They're hiking your taxes. They've fought against your pay increases. And now they want you to thank them because they want to give your big business boss a tax cut. It's outrageous. This bill will rip $65 billion out of Australia's bottom line, take money away from pensioners and hurt jobseekers. It will mean less investment in health, education and infrastructure; it's going to force senseless cuts in our schools and universities; and it will require tax hikes for low-income workers. And for what? Very little. Just consider the government's own figures that show this reckless cash splash will add a miniscule one per cent to growth, and it will take 20 years in order to achieve that. Even this anaemic result has been called into question. In fact, a report from senior research fellow at the Australian Institute, David Richardson, found:  There is no correlation between corporate tax rates and economic growth in OECD countries.  Countries with lower company tax rates have lower standards of living, measured as purchasing power of GDP per capita. …… …  Growth in foreign investment as a share of GDP was strongest when Australia's company taxes were highest. But what about wages? Conservatives have been telling us for years that profits from rich companies will always trickle down to the workers. Well, the government's own data-the rosiest modelling it could summon-says that workers can look forward to a one per cent boost to their pay packets, also in 20 years' time. It's hardly anything to crow about. Even this seems questionable. In the December quarter, businesses recorded a massive 20.1 per cent boost to their profits. So, what happened to wages in that period? Well, they actually went backwards by 0.5 per cent. So it's very clear that there's no guarantee whatsoever that wages will grow with companies' bottom lines. The government also tells us that, when companies make more money, they put more people on. The experience of Australian banks in recent months would suggest otherwise. In August, the ANZ reported a $1.8 billion cash profit for the third quarter. In May, Westpac announced a $4 billion profit for six months. Around the same time, Macquarie reported a record $2.2 billion in annual profit, and the NAB boasted a first-half cash profit of $3.3 billion. If the government were right that large profits equalled increased job creation, you'd expect that these banks would have created a bumper field of jobs this year, wouldn't you? Well, you would be wrong-very, very wrong. In fact, together, Westpac, NAB, ANZ and Macquarie have actually cut 2,300 jobs in recent months. But, of course, this makes perfect sense. Employers don't create jobs because they are making more money; they create jobs when there is a greater demand for their services. The reality is that businesses are under relentless pressure from shareholders to increase their dividends and drive efficiencies by cutting staff, not putting more on. Any CEO who went on a hiring spree just because he got a lower tax bill would quickly find himself on the wrong side of the hiring queue. This is a government that, despite touting itself as the party of business, demonstrates breathtaking ignorance of basic business imperatives. These grossly expensive tax cuts won't do anything meaningful for wages, economic growth or job creation, but they will deliver one thing in spades, and that is increased inequality. Michael Bradley put it well in the recent Drum article where he says: That's all just a long way of saying that the small business tax bonanza the Government is selling is largely illusory. In the bigger picture, 45 years of trickledown experiments, promising that the rivers of money which have flowed to corporations and the rich will turn into 'jobs and growth' for all, have delivered one clear outcome: a massive and sustained increase in income and wealth inequality. We know from the OECD that increased inequality is inevitably a stall on growth. But you might say that this is all theory and speculation and that we can't possibly know what's going to happen unless we try. Well, luckily, this real-life experiment of the government's agenda has already been done in the American state of Kansas. It crashed and burned so spectacularly that it drove the state to the brink of depression. In 2012, the people of Kansas were told that cutting taxes for the highest-income earners as well as cutting the corporate tax rate would be 'a shot of adrenaline into the heart of the Kansas economy'. They were told that they would create 22,000 new jobs. They were told that business and investment would flock to the state, increasing the wealth for everyone. They heard that disposable income would be increased by $2 billion over the following five years. Sound familiar? Well, it should, because it's exactly the same spin that those opposite are peddling in Australia today, with exactly the same agenda. So, what actually transpired? Rather than adding jobs, the state registered a net loss of 23,000 jobs when compared to the previous average employment growth rate. Meanwhile, nearby states with similar economies saw an increase in job growth. How about the promised population growth? That was another spectacular fail, as the population actually slid backwards. And, again, neighbouring states continued to grow at the average rate. Similarly, disposable income also went backwards. But there was an explosion in debt and deficit. This led to severe spending cuts as the government desperately tried to repair the damage they'd done to the budgetary bottom line. After four years of this unmitigated disaster of anaemic growth, deepening deficits and savage spending cuts, the people of Kansas said, 'No more!' By a two-thirds majority, the conservative legislator admitted the spectacular failure of their program and repealed many of the tax cuts that had created such havoc in their state. Inequality isn't just a word or a metric. It is a dangerous and growing trend where wealth is increasingly concentrated at the top end of the income spectrum, leaving people on low and middle incomes struggling and creating generations of working poor. This is exactly what the Turnbull government is all about-ensuring that wealthy Australians and companies are looked after. Forget about the debt and deficit. It's ignored, as are the millions of Australians who will find it harder and harder to get by. This legislation is a heist and a con, and it should be comprehensively rejected. through its $65-billion big-business tax cuts, when we know that this has already been rejected by the Senate. We know that the government doesn't like listening. We know that the government-and the Prime Minister-has a tin ear when it comes to delivering economic reform, let alone energy reform. But, when it comes to the government having laser-like focus on an achievement, it is not reform of the energy, health or education sectors. It is the sole mission for and in the DNA of, it appears, every member of this government to do everything possible to give relief not to middleand low-income working Australians-the hard working men and women of Australia that I represent and that every single member in this place represents-but to large corporations and big business. That is their objective and clear intent. I know that, and my community and the people of Australia know that. I want to remind the House of some of the actions of this government and what they've put on the table to pay for the legislation that we're dealing with today: cuts to families, through changes to family tax benefits; cuts to pensions, through scrapping the energy supplement, which I'll come back to; cuts to jobseekers, forcing them to wait for Newstart; cuts to young people, forcing them from Newstart onto youth allowance; and cuts to new parents and families, through changes to paid parental leave. The last time we debated this and the last time. I spoke in the parliament about this-the very same week in which we saw tax cuts for millionaires and huge relief for large corporations-this government voted to cut the energy supplement for pensioners in this country. The same week!",187,Bills
156,Mr Dick (Oxley) (11:10,"Here we go again. The government is once again trying to ramI would sometimes like to give the government some advice about claiming fairness. Who can forget the leaked report about the budget that was brought down earlier this year-I guess it was from yet another hit inside the government; there are so many of them-revealing that the government had spent over $100,000 in market research testing about what should be in the budget. They didn't go to a town hall, like the Leader of the Opposition will do. They didn't travel the country, listening to what's happening to communities and small-business groups or what's happening on the ground. They paid for market research testing to tell them what to put in the budget. And you know what it found? The research, paid for courtesy of the taxpayer, showed that the word 'fairness' should be used. The government had to be told to use the word 'fairness' in a budget that delivered a tax cut to large multinational companies and millionaires in this country while increasing taxes-not even keeping them the same-for working people and people who are making do, getting by and keeping their head above water. So much for the Liberal-National Party being 'the party of low tax' and 'the party of small government'. That's rubbish; it's nonsense. In this budget, tens of thousands of people in my electorate, earning less than $80,000 a year, will get a tax increase. And, at the same time, they've got to watch a tax cut to large multinational companies. We know that when the big end of town says 'jump', this government says, 'How high?' Despite this obviously extreme, right-wing agenda that has now taken over the government and that has been building up for the last four years now, what does the economic modelling say about the $65 billion handout? It says it's a waste of time and a waste of money. Not only are we seeing that the cost to taxpayers is a further $600 million over the forward estimates and $36.5 billion over the medium term, as outlined in the budget papers; on top of this, we're going to have annual, ongoing costs of $8.3 billion. It doesn't stop there. New calculations show that this big-business tax cut will also cost the Australian people an extra $4 billion in interest charges. That equates to around $162 for every single man, woman and child in the entire nation. The total interest bill will hit over half a billion dollars in 2021 before blowing out to beyond $1 billion in 2023-24. These are simply staggering statistics. Surely, the government must have something to show for this incredible handout of taxpayers' money. Treasury analysis released by the government on budget night said that, as a result of big-business tax cuts, that the economy will be-wait for it-potentially one per cent bigger as a result. It is forgoing the revenue that would have paid for things like health, schools, adequate social security and family support, support for our ADF and support for a homelessness and housing strategy-let alone the NBN, but I don't have enough hours in the day to talk about the government's failure on the NBN. What we're doing is asking this parliament-which has already rejected these cuts, as the Senate has rejected them-to then say, 'No, trust us; we are going to grow the economy, potentially by one per cent.' But that one per cent is over a decade. It's a bit like the latest so called guarantee of the energy policy. The government is saying it's going to be a guarantee. There's no economic modelling to show that it is a guarantee, but the government is expecting us to agree when they say, 'We have all the answers. We know best. We are going to deliver, at best, a 50 cent reduction to the people of Australia in 2020.' This government is just going from the ridiculous to the absurd. The one per cent is over a decade. But the decade I refer to begins at the end of the decade of tax cuts. That means the one per cent dividend claimed is actually around 20 years away. That's 20 years of waiting before the Australian people see growth of just one per cent, while the budget is $8.3 billion worse off per year and the Australian people are slugged with an interest bill of $4 billion a year. We've already seen a Treasury research paper that predicts these company tax cuts are likely to increase company incomes by a mere 0.6 per cent over the long term. Further to this, the paper also suggests it will take 20 years for the economic benefits of these company tax cuts to have any long-term value, with half the benefit coming in 10 years. Given the large component of corporate tax cuts only starts to take effect in 2022, Australia will be waiting 25 years for a 0.6 per cent increase in incomes. While we're waiting for this to happen, a report by the US says more than 40 per cent of the $65 billion handout will go offshore to investors of multinational corporations and foreign tax authorities. This is even before I start on the big banks. We all know that giving corporate tax cuts really pales into insignificance when compared to the protection racket, as I like to call it, that this government operates around big banks. Just recently, the Commonwealth Bank reported a near $10 billion profit-and this Prime Minister and Treasurer think that they deserve a handout from the Australian taxpayer to further enhance the bottom line of the CBA. In the same week that this occurred, the financial intelligence agency AUSTRAC filed claims in the Federal Court which state that the bank broke the law up to 54,000 times by failing to report suspicious transactions on time. We know that the government is out of touch, and the community is seeing this. You only need to look at Newspoll, which has shown consistently 21 times why this government is out of touch and why this Prime Minister is losing support across Australia. We know that the plan to cut payments to families, pensioners, new parents, young people, students, people with a disability and jobseekers is on one side and on the other side is the plan to ensure that large corporate Australia somehow, magically, mythically, will deliver a trickle-down approach to provide long-term economic reform. With all this money being splashed about by the government to big business, it's clear for everyone to see where the government's priorities lie. I'll tell you it's not with Australian families, pensioners or any person needing a hand; it's with big business and the banks. To pay for the corporate handout, we know that there will be a whole range of cuts. For a government that's been in power for over four years and promising Australians that there are better days ahead, well, my community and the rest of Australia would like to know where are the better days ahead? It's certainly not in energy policy. It's certainly not anything to do with the NBN. It's not certainly to do with jobs or wages growth. And it's certainly not anything to do with inequality, which we're seeing at a 75-year high. We have recently seen wages and salaries grow by just 0.7 per cent in the three months to June and by only 2.1 per cent over this year. We know that this increase, however, was driven by a jump in the number of hours worked rather than pay increases. The true figures show that the average compensation of employees declined 0.1 per cent for the quarter and climbed just 0.1 per cent over the year. Real net disposable income per capita-the best measure of potential living standards-slipped by 1.4 per cent. What did the Treasurer make of this? He said, 'Well, a substantial lift in wages would have to wait until a sustained improvement in profits.' If the Treasurer bothered to check, he'd know that earlier this year company profits rose by more than 30 per cent in the year to March, the best result in 33 years; while wages rose only 1.5 per cent, leaving the share of wages and national income at 51.5 per cent-the equal lowest level since the early 1960s. On top of this, new data released in the June quarter found that annual growth in compensation per hour fell over the June quarter from 1.1 per cent to minus 1.3 per cent-the weakest growth in 25 years. While the government can claim that more jobs are being created, they are also coming with record low wages. Capital Economics chief economist Paul Dales said the wage figures were even worse when broken down to average employee compensation per hour and that 'there is no evidence whatsoever that wage growth has started to rise'. What does all that mean? Out in the community people are struggling. People are finding it hard to make ends meet with the rising cost of living and the rising cost of energy prices. The government's solution to the energy crisis is to give a 50c per week reduction in energy costs-pushing out to the 2020s. I don't know about you, Madam Deputy Speaker, but when I return to the electorate of Oxley this weekend and when I visit community groups with the big headline news that the energy policy of this government will deliver a saving of 50c a week-perhaps by 2020-I don't think that's going cut it. In fact, I know that's not going to cut it. When I go to small businesses and say, 'The great energy policy unveiled by the Turnbull government this week will deliver you a reduction of 50c a week,' I know that's not going to cut it. I know that people will say to me: 'You've got to be kidding. That's as good as it gets?' With the package of bills before us today, we know that, when it comes to the government's priorities, it is not about delivering real reform for the economy; it is not about dealing with inequality; it is not about tackling the low wages growth that we are seeing yearin year-out. But we do know that small business needs support. Labor has supported the cut in company tax for small businesses to 28.5 per cent and will support a further cut to 27.5 per cent-covering all small businesses, who represent 83 per cent of Australian companies. Labor is very clearly on the side of genuine small business. I come from a small-business background. I know what it's like because my parents ran businesses. I know what it was like because I saw the struggle that they went through. We need to do more to support small businesses. I recognise that the 8,748 small businesses in my electorate are the backbone of our local economy. I know, from my parents and from when my father ran a business, how critical it is for government to be there when it's needed but also to get out of the road for businesses to be able to grow, to support the local economy and, more importantly, to grow employment in the local economy. But billion-dollar corporations and businesses do not need, at this time, a handout. They do not need assistance. When I speak to the people I represent, including community groups and chambers of commerce, and I say, 'I'm on your side; I'm supporting a tax cut for you; I don't support large, multinational companies getting a tax cut,' I know where they stand. Party, and their boosters in big business, have only one idea when it comes to securing Australia's economic future. It's an old idea and a very bad one. They remain disciples to trickle-down economics. Their only idea is to give more to those who already have quite enough, in the hope-the hope, not the expectation-that some of that may flow through to others and boost economic growth generally. This is despite the fact that these ideas, these policies, have been discredited over the last 30 years-in particular, since the global financial crisis.",193,Bills
157,Mr Giles (Scullin) (11:25,"It is clear that the reactionaries who run today's LiberalButI will say one thing for the person who presently leads the Liberal Party and the government, the Prime Minister. He has been inconsistent, as we know, on just about every matter that he has expressed a view on-on energy, as we are seeing right at the moment, and certainly when it comes to marriage-but he has been a true disciple to neoliberalism. Throughout his political career, he has been a booster of inequality, and we are seeing that most clearly in this bill before the House today, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Enterprise Tax Plan No. 2) Bill 2017. That's something that serves this parliament poorly, and it would serve Australians poorly but for the firm opposition of the Labor Party-in this place and in the community-to this narrow, bleak agenda for Australia. There is only one idea this government and its boosters have, and that's why Jennifer Westacott, the leader of the Business Council of Australia, has said of this package that there is no plan B-because they can't conceive of one. They can't conceive of a different way forward, of a pathway to inclusive growth, to a more equal Australia. That is what the Labor Party are committed to. In opposing this legislation, I want to make out the case for that pathway-for sustainable economic growth which is to the benefit of all Australians, not just the few. There is a plan B. There has to be a plan B. The failure of this government to consider alternatives, to consider the evidence, is something for which they stand condemned. When we consider this legislation before the parliament now, we are thinking about what's happening in the Australian economy at the moment. There are three things that are going on that I think are critical to this debate. Firstly, there are record-high company profits-a matter the member for Oxley just touched upon. Secondly, despite this, there are very low levels of reinvestment by those profitable businesses back into their businesses. Thirdly, and most troublingly for me and for most of us on the Labor side of the parliament, there is record-low wages growth. What does this set of circumstances require? Policies to boost profits further while doing nothing for investment, and certainly nothing to secure reasonable wages growth, are the cornerstone of a plan to increase and exacerbate inequalities of income, wealth and power. That is what this bill represents-a continuation of that extreme neoliberal agenda. We know, on the basis of Treasury modelling, that this plan will also do nothing to secure economic growth. The growth dividend is negligible and almost laughable. As we debate this bill today, we do so in the context of the warnings of the IMF that Australia has one of the fastest-growing levels of income inequality in the OECD. This is a problem that, on this side of the House, we are determined to solve. But this bill will only exacerbate it further. For me-and, I believe, for my colleague the member for Oxley-this is something which is bad morally. We think extreme levels of inequality are, in themselves, wrong. We also know-and this is what makes this bill and the government's approach so galling-that this isn't simply a question of how we see the world; this is a question of the evidence. We now know that the level of inequality that this bill will advance is actually a drag on economic growth. It's bad for everyone, not just those individuals being left behind by this cruel agenda. This is why there has to be a plan B. This is why I'm so proud to be part of a Labor team that has started to articulate an alternative way forward for the Australian economy and for Australians. BeforeI get to some of the elements of that, I want to talk a little bit about the Treasurer, who in this bill-and, indeed, across his handling of his responsibilities-is all over the place. It's so confusing-and, again, also galling-to read reports about how he's embarking upon a new vision to secure inclusive growth. Wrapping himself up in the words of a Labor approach to economic management will not secure that approach. This bill-the narrowness of its vision, the bluntness of its application-underlines exactly that point. I read this morning his second reading speech. He said, 'I will not rest until this agenda has been prosecuted. I will not rest.' He said that on 11 May and we are now in October. Not even in this corner piece of the government's agenda to secure jobs and growth can the government effectively articulate its agenda. We know the commitment is real-we know it is visceral-to push Australia down this path to inequality. But, even on this core item of business, the government can't bring itself to advance its agenda/ Such is its level of dysfunction; such is the level of incompetence and incoherence by the Treasurer and all of the government's economic team. I touched briefly on the warning the IMF delivered to Australia about the rapid increase in income inequality in Australia right now. I also touched upon the concern that this is not simply a question of the impact on individuals; it has a broader consequence in terms of the managing of our economy. I note again that, very recently-in September, in fact, when I last thought I was going to have the opportunity to speak on this bill, this centrepiece of the government's economic agenda-the Fairfax-Lateral Economics well-being index report revealed that the yearly drag on national well-being caused by income disparity across the economy had grown by $62 billion over the past decade. This is something which is getting worse, not getting better, even before this approach is legislated. I obviously hope it won't be legislated. Inequality is, as our leader, the member for Maribyrnong, has said, 'the biggest threat to our health as an economy and our cohesion as a society'. That's why we reject the agenda set out in this bill. Government members describe this as 'the politics of envy', but that flies in the face of reality. It is a cheap and nasty rhetorical device that ignores those three factors that I set out earlier which characterise the Australian economy at the moment: record company profits, a very low level of reinvestment of those profits and record low wages growth. The last two are real problems. The second one, if businesses are doing well, is something that would be welcomed by the Labor side. But I don't think that welcome needs to be accompanied by an additional more than $36 billion handout at a time when our budget is in such structural disarray and when there is no evidence of any connection between those levels of profitability and wider economic benefits-particularly, again, when there is no plan to secure high levels of reinvestment in businesses. Indeed, we would suspect that much of this giveaway would simply be repatriated offshore. Also, there is not even an attempt to connect this to wage outcomes. There are answers to the problems of wages. I spoke earlier about inequalities of powers as well as inequalities of wealth. Central to fixing this is to restore the balance in our workplaces, taking seriously what's going on in the world of work and restoring the power of workers to bargain effectively and to secure a fair share for their work. That is a problem that Labor is committed to solving, and the member for Gorton will be addressing some of the matters that will go to fixing this problem very shortly. But we don't get any debate about a fair share from the world of work or from profits that companies are making. Instead we just get this blind adherence to the ideology of trickledown. Its blindness is such that even voices that are very sympathetic-and very sympathetic, broadly, to this neoliberal agenda in perhaps a milder form-are casting very significant warnings. The government is heedless of the advice of the IMF, of the OECD, of even the World Bank, who are warning against this sort of reckless and irresponsible economic approach. Even the Reserve Bank of Australia has very recently cast very significant doubta position that government members should be mindful of-about the supposed benefits of this massive giveaway to big business. If the government isn't troubled by Treasury's advice about the measly growth dividend of the measure contained in this legislation, perhaps they could look beyond the helpful advice of the Business Council of Australia, or perhaps even ask the obvious question, which is: 'She would say that, wouldn't she?', speaking of Ms Westacott. Of course, she is in the business of securing a good deal for her members; good luck to her in that-except to the extent it causes a bad deal for Australians, for working Australians, and, indeed, for the Australian economy. I think members should go beyond questioning Ms Westacott and should come back to the comments of assistant governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia Luci Ellis, in puncturing the arguments of the Treasurer when it comes to international competitiveness on corporate tax rates. Dr Ellis is a person that government members should have regard to, when she talks about the business environment-which is, of course, a critical factor for multinational businesses in choosing to locate here-the institutional framework, the rule of law, the macroeconomic outlook, and where the resources are. These are matters that are of deep concern to the Australian Labor Party's economic team in seeking to advance upon a race to the top, not a race to the bottom, in securing the future of the Australian economy; in supporting Australian businesses across a wide variety of sectors; in having a proper approach to infrastructure; and in having the confidence to invest in people and in skilling them through schools education, through training, and, obviously, through not short-changing our higher education system-as this government is continuing to seek to do in the face of all the evidence and in the face of great opposition. On this legislation, the simple idea that it contains is in one sense very easy to rebut. The challenges that face the Australian economy and face Australian society are complex. The answers to them are complex also. But again, they are not to be found in giving more to those who already have enough, and continuing to have blind faith that these benefits will somehow be shared. If we simply look at the cost here, the cost to the budget is extraordinary at a time when we need to seek to effect significant structural repair of Australia's budget-a matter that used to be of concern to government members or, at least, seems to be of concern to them when they are in opposition. The massive giveaway without any dividend in return is extraordinary. There's been some comparison to some overseas examples, and I want to say two things about that. Firstly, even Donald Trump in proposing company tax cuts sought to extract something in return; here, it's a freebie. It's simply to be taken on trust, and in spite of the evidence. Secondly, I would urge government members also to look to the United States and to have regard to the Congressional Budget Office's research on effective corporate tax rates. We on this side of the House are up for a proper debate about tax, but a debate that is grounded in fact. What matters of course is not the notional rate, but the effective rate. And I'd ask government members to give some consideration to that as they continue down this frolic. The cost is great. Again on the benefit: it is really blind faith that's put before us that this massive giveaway-this multibillion-dollar giveaway-to our biggest companies, at a time when they are enjoying record profits, will deliver return for anything other than the shareholders in those businesses, because we know the growth dividend is almost non-existent. Lastly, let's also think about the implications of all this for the Australian economy-I've touched on the failure to articulate a pathway to sustainable growth-and for Australian society. We are confident in Australians; that is why we are committed to investing in them and to developing their capabilities. We believe that in the Asian century we can continue to thrive, based on our qualities, our capacities and our capabilities, if we support them with infrastructure, with investment in skills, and with recognising the real pathway to securing Australia's economic future-not this blatant grab; this handout to those who have enough. Ms BIRD (Cunningham) (11:40): I will just shake the dust off these speaking notes! They've been sitting on my table for a while, waiting for the Treasury Laws Amendment (Enterprise Tax Plan No. 2) Bill 2017 to come before the parliament for further debate. The optimist in me would take from that that perhaps the government was reconsidering the wisdom of this particular bill, but the realist in me recognises that it's probably more a reflection of their lack of faith in their capacity to get support across the parliament for the bill. Regardless, when this proposed enterprise tax plan was first announced, my Labor colleagues and I made it very clear that we would oppose it, and that position has not changed. I stand here today, finally speaking on the bill, still opposed to what is a very unfair and illjudged proposal before us. The legislation we have here is obviously seeking to implement the remainder of the government's company tax cut plans. This particular part of that plan would provide companies with a turnover above $50 million with a tax cut to 25 per cent. It's costing $600 million over the forward estimates and $36.5 billion over the medium term. Over the medium term, the government says this element of their company tax cut plan will cost $36.5 billion, with the cost of the full company tax cut plan being $65.4 billion. Indeed, in the final sitting week before the budget, the government managed to successfully pass part of its company tax cut plans through the Senate. It passed the tax cut, to 25 per cent, for businesses with a turnover of up to $50 million. Consistent with the position that we've had on the company tax cuts presented in this bill, we will be opposing it. The bill is, in fact, the ultimate example of how wrong this government's priorities are. It is about looking after those that need it least, slugging those who are already struggling, and not addressing problems that are frustrating individuals, communities and businesses. I want to touch on a few of those, because these sorts of significant budget decisions, particularly in a constrained fiscal environment, are a real reflection of where the priorities of a government lie. This government has decided, from a trickle-down theory of economics, that giving cuts to big business is going to benefit the community. I would argue that the things that have been passed over, cut and ignored are far more significant to those in the communities that we represent. First up, obviously, are the penalty rate cuts, which have had, and continue to have, an impact on individuals and their families, and a flow-on impact on discretionary spending and businesses. I would just like to ask members of the parliament to look at the most recent Australian Bureau of Statistics report on retail turnover, which had a 0.6 per cent fall in August. This is a significant fall-I think, in fact, it's the largest fall since about 2013particularly across areas such as food retailing; cafes, restaurants and takeaway food services; household goods; and clothing, footwear and personal accessories. What's happening in our communities is that people have a dwindling discretionary spending budget. Their wages have been flatlining for a long time. If they rely on penalty rates-one member of the family might work on a Sunday, for example-to bring them in a bit of extra money, they have now had that severely cut. Under these circumstances-let alone the obvious issue that we've all been debating in this place around the growing hit from energy prices on the household budget-the amount of money that people have left over after paying for their basics, their food costs, their education costs and their housing costs is, no doubt, under huge pressure. The money that they, as locals, have on the Saturday to say, 'Let's go and have some dinner at the local restaurant,' or to say to the kids, 'Come on. We'll go and buy a new outfit for summer,' has been severely hit. The flow-on of that is a hit to our local small businesses, because that's where the locals shop. This blind adherence to attacking wages is completely oblivious to the flow-on impact that has on the movement of money in our local communities and, particularly, to our small businesses. As I said, we're seeing that in the ABS reports on retail turnover. The other area the government has cut is school funding. They cut it, then they restored part of it, but there is still a significant cut in place compared to what was promised to the Australian population at the 2013 election, when both major parties had a particular position. We've stuck to ours; the government didn't stick to theirs. What that actually means in my own seat is a real cut to the capacity of my local schools to be able to implement targeted, specific, tailored programs to ensure our young people are competitive in the current economy. In my seat of Cunningham, there is $15 million less available to my schools as a result of the government's decisions. We often talk about money, but one of the important things with the original Gonski reform proposals was that it tied the state, Catholic and independent sector school authorities to a range of performance requirements. When Mr Abbott won the election, became Prime Minister and walked away from the Gonski commitments, the government also did away with all the ties around that funding that required performance across a whole lot of areas, so we don't have a plan for improvement in our schools. Issues such as graduating from high school, going on to further education, literacy and numeracy support and teaching quality-all of these things that we know are critically important-should be priorities for this government, not the bill before us. If we go beyond the school years, obviously it is very important that our students get postsecondary education. We know that the changes that are occurring in the workforce mean there are going to be very few jobs for people who come out of school and don't get a further qualification. At the moment, the two main pathways for that are our fabulous TAFE and vocational education sector, and our world-class universities. I think the government's cutting of $500 million out of the vocational education sector when it abandoned the national partnership agreement is really a sad indictment of the priorities, and we have seen that flow through to increased costs and pressure on the TAFE sector at the state level. There have been course closures, the endangered future of campuses and increased course costs that are locking out students. Instead, we should be investing in capacities and pathways through the TAFE system. As a former TAFE teacher but also as someone who understands how valuable a vocational education can be, I will continue to fight on that front. Our university sector is under significant pressure as well. It is not just the universities themselves, which are facing significant direct funding cuts, but also our students at universities. They are going to have to pay higher fees. They are going to have to pay their loans back at a much lower level of pay-down to $42,000 from the previous $55,000. All of those pressures are being added to university students, I have to say, at a time when they're going out, starting their adult life and maybe looking to start a family or take out a mortgage. They are carrying significant financial burdens through the loans that they have to pay back. Really, a bit of time and a bit of space to breathe when they are earning at those low-income levels is particularly important to enable people to start their adult life. As a mother of adult children, I'm sure we don't all want them living at home forever, so we do need to make sure that our policy settings enable young people to start their lives. The other issue-and it's been significant in my area-is the one I touched on around housing affordability. The government could be taking action much more significantly on housing affordability. I want to draw the parliament's attention to the Domain Regional House Price Report that has recently come out. In Wollongong, house prices jumped 16.7 per cent in the year to December 2016. That put Wollongong as the third most expensive city in Australia for housing. This is an extraordinary outcome. It's great for people who have housing-they look at it and see its value growing-but for our young people, who want to actually be able to stay in their local area, start a family and buy a house, as I said, this is becoming an increasingly difficult challenge. We need policies. Labor has announced a range of policies around capital gains tax concessions and negative gearing to help make these young people more competitive against the investors. We want people to be able to buy their first home, not to be constantly outbid by people buying their seventh or eighth or ninth investment property. We particularly want those incentives directed towards new housing stock, rather than just buying up what's already available. Labor also has a range of other agreements and reforms that we have proposed around housing affordability and, importantly, homelessness as well. There is the NBN mess. The government could actually do something about the mess of the NBN. It was fascinating to see the Prime Minister in parliament this week basically boasting about how successful it's been. I can only presume his phone's not working, because even members of his own side are reporting that they're having a hell of a time in their local communities with the NBN rollout. The Prime Minister attempted to say in answer to a question that it was all the fault of retail service providers. I'll tell you what: we should be onto retail service providers. There's some activity that absolutely needs to be called out about transparency in the provision of services. A lot of people-in fact, I surveyed my electorate and I was astonished at the number of people-who took the time to write knew they were on fibre-to-the-node and their problem was reliability, because every time it rained there was water in the pits and their lines went down. People know exactly what the problem is, and in so many cases it's the technology that the Prime Minister, in this former role as the communications minister, rolled out. People have frustrations with that. Investing in some local infrastructure would be a good alternative because we know that quality infrastructure can drive economic diversification. It's actually about jobs and growth, unlike discredited trickle-down tax concepts. In my own area, for example, the MaldonDombarton rail link is currently being promoted by the Illawarra Business Chamber. It's been a project that I've campaigned on for over 10 years. It will be a game changer for our region by linking us with south-western Sydney and the port of Port Kembla. If we could have just one project, it would be great to see the government get behind that. What we have before us is a bill that has all the priorities wrong. It's based on discredited economic theory, as other colleagues in this debate have been pointed out-a theory that has been proven across the world not to work and has been discredited by even conservative economic bodies, people such as the OECD, the World Bank and so forth. And we are supposed to believe that giving this cut to big business will mean that the improved financial position they find themselves in will automatically translate into jobs. Of course, the first thing they think to do when they are in that improved financial position is to go and employ more people! Well, they don't. Businesses employ more people because they have more work to be done. It is actually about increasing the demand, and that demand relies on people in the community having the capacity to spend and to be out supporting their local businesses. This bill must be opposed, because it's discredited; it's unfair; and it's a reflection of the wrong priorities in a fiscally constrained environment to be going in this direction. I have to say, when I surveyed my electorate on this direct question, the vast bulk of people who responded to that question did not agree with this particular tax cut. In fact, they outlined their priorities, which I have gone through today, and that's where the government's focus should be. Ms BUTLER (Griffith) (11:55): This debate really does expose this government's recklessness when it comes to making decisions about this nation's federal budget. We have a government right now that is, as we speak, trying to cut funding from universities. It is trying to cut almost $4 billion in fiscal terms from university funding. It has legislation before the House to increase student fees and to lower the point at which people, who have been students in the past, have to make additional payments to the government by reducing the HECS threshold. At the same time, they are trying to give a massive, whopping tax cut to Australia's biggest businesses. They are trying to find a whole stack of money, billions of dollars, to give a whopping, massive tax cut to Australia's biggest businesses-so much for being responsible and handling public finances with respect! This is a measure that really demonstrates the complete lack of respect this government has for its so-called 'jobs and growth' agenda. Remember the 'jobs and growth' slogan from the last federal election? I do-'Jobs and growth, jobs and growth.' Unfortunately for the Prime Minister, saying the same three words over and over again does not actually create any truth to those words. Repeating a slogan does not bring anything into existence other than hot air, and unfortunately we've seen it continue, even this week in parliament with the even less catchy slogan of 'economics and engineering'. You couldn't think of a worse slogan if you were given a million years in which to do it. We had jobs and growth last year at the federal election, and now what do we see? We're not seeing jobs and growth; we're seeing a $65 billion tax cut plan-a plan where the government wants to spend $65 billion on tax cuts for corporations, and not just Australian corporations but for multinational corporations as well. This government has been hyperventilating about debt and deficit since it came into office in 2013. Of course, it hasn't even met its own tests in that regard, because both have increased over that time. If you purport to believe that we need to reduce debt and reduce the budget deficit, then the last thing you should be doing is worsening the budget bottom line by $65 billion by having this big tax giveaway for corporations. This discussion has been going on for a long time. This measure from the government was first flagged in last year's budget. Then the Treasurer was going on about this idea before this year's budget, but here we are today, in the middle of October, finally debating these bills. We only got to commence debate on them in mid-September. I want to make it clear that Labor will not support this part of the government's $65 billion tax cut for business. We have always opposed this massive deterioration in the budget bottom line over the medium term. We think that this kind of hit to the budget does expose the hypocrisy of the Turnbull government when it seeks to make other cuts. It wants to cut revenue to pay for its cuts to spending, and when we talk about cuts to spending, it's the public funding of universities that we're talking about. It is also, might I say, the government's current plan to cut the energy supplement to 1.7 million seniors in this country. It will make their lives even harder: it will make it even harder for them to pay for electricity and for the costs of living. Those are the things that government wants to cut spending on, but it is more than happy to give away $65 billion on tax cuts. So we've got a government that wants to stand up and support big corporations on the one hand while at the same time putting under pressure seniors who are relying on the energy supplements, students who are trying to get a higher education, and universities that are trying to actually create a higher education system that can compete in our region and in our world. We know that universities are an important part of this nation's domestic, internal economy and are also important for us internationally, because international education, together with international tourism, is our most important service export and is in the top rankings of all of our exports, not just service exports. So this government is taking money out of the budget, by giving away $65 billion, while at the same time asking Australians to accept big, deep cuts to services and big, deep cuts to pensioners through the energy supplement. This is just ridiculous. I don't think people are going to stand for it. I think people are sick and tired of this government standing up for the big end of town and failing to look after the people it's elected to represent, like people in my electorate. I recently had a gentleman visit me at one of my regular mobile offices. He was absolutely distressed at the thought of the energy supplement being cut. He wants to lead a dignified life. He does not want to see cuts to pensions. He worked hard all of his life and lost his superannuation in the global financial crisis when he was at or near retirement age. He didn't have the luxury of being able to work for another 20 years after the global financial crisis to restore his superannuation. He's reliant on the pension and he didn't expect to be. He is absolutely horrified at the thought of this government's cuts to the energy supplement for seniors-and so he should be, because Australians have a right to expect decency and dignity in retirement. Australians have a right to expect a government that will stand up for them, not for vested interests. Australians have a right to expect that a government will make the right decisions and have the right priorities when it comes to the federal budget. Having these people, who claim to be deficit hawks and fiscal conservatives, reducing the budget bottom line by $65 billion just seems to be wrong logically, let alone ideologically. Why does the Turnbull government not care about seniors? Why does the Turnbull government not care about students? Why is the Turnbull government's priority to find a way to prepare and propose tax cuts for the big end of town, for big Australian companies and for multinationals? They argue that this will create more investment and more jobs. That's the argument that we hear from the government. Unfortunately, this is the same old discredited, trickle-downeconomics nonsense that we've heard from conservatives since the days of Thatcher and Reagan. The idea that if you just cut taxation for the top end of town then the benefits will magically flow down to everybody else is just wrong. The Prime Minister has argued that if companies have lower tax rates then there will be this magical reinvestment of their profits in their organisations and that will lead to better productivity and more jobs. Making companies' bottom lines better does not magically and of necessity lead to more investment and better jobs. We know that because that's what's happening at the moment. Company bottom lines are improving. We've seen record earnings by corporate Australia. Where's that money going? It's not going into wages. Wages growth is flat. Wages growth is at its lowest level since we started keeping the wage price index in 1997. Wages growth is not where the big, record corporate earnings are going. It's absolutely not the case. Those earnings are certainly not going, unfortunately-not as much as you might like-into investment into the company itself, into capital deepening, into improving productivity. They're not doing that. There's been an investment strike in Australia in recent years, and that's a problem. It's absolutely a problem. Australian firms need to get more productive-that's very true. Labour productivity growth has been up since the terrible productivity-killing days of Work Choices were put behind us, but multifactor productivity needs to improve, and that's going to require capital deepening and managerial expertise. But we're not seeing the levels of investment in those things from companies that we should be. Where's the money going? It's going to shareholders. Of course that's where it's going. Earnings per share is an important measure for companies. I'm not criticising them for that they need to raise capital; they need to be able to demonstrate to potential shareholders that people will get an income stream from their shares. But what about the days of capital gain from shares? What about the days of saying, 'What we want from shares is for companies to improve and for the value of our shares to go up,' and for that to be the key issue for people? I talked to the CEO of a big firm about this very issue last week. He talked to us about the productivity improvements that his staff had driven from the ground up and about the investment that his firm had made across their manufacturing business. I said to him, 'What do your shareholders think about the fact that you're reinvesting your profits into the company?' He said, 'You know what? We've found better shareholders. We've found shareholders who are in it for the long term, who want to see this place improve.' That's the sort of leadership that we want to see from corporate Australia. Instead of you having a handout, with tax cuts, while at the same time urging more so-called flexibility on your workforce-which really just means more ability to change their hours at short notice and to avoid paying them penalty rates, those sorts of changes-how about we see some leadership and you say: 'We want to see the best possible corporate Australia we can. We want to see reinvestment. We want to see investment in the capacity of our managers and our people. We want to see capital deepening'? That's what this country actually needs. To hear this argument from the government that better corporate profits means better corporate investment and jobs, when it flies in the face of the reality of recent years, just demonstrates how ideological this bill is and how little this bill has to do with practical reality or empirical experience. This bill tells you everything you need to know about the Turnbull government. It tells you that the Turnbull government is a deeply conservative government rooted in the traditions of Thatcher and of Reagan. It tells you that the Prime Minister is not someone who is progressive, is not someone who wants to do the right thing in the interests of seniors who are worried about losing their energy supplement, is not someone who wants to promote greater involvement in higher education and greater quality in our universities. He's happy to make cuts affecting both of those groups. He's happy to make cuts to higher education. He's happy to make cuts to the seniors energy supplement. He is someone who has wholly signed up to old-fashioned Thatcherism and Reaganism, to old-fashioned trickle-down economics arguments-and they've been proven not to work. What this shows is that the only way to have a government that understands the importance of investment-investment in education, in our people, in making sure that people in their later years have dignity in retirement and a decent standard of living-the only way to get a government that believes in those things and the only way to get a government that doesn't want to see seniors' and students' interests being sacrificed in favour of the interests of the top end of town is to vote for a Labor government at the next election. The only way to get a Treasurer who will act in the interests of the whole nation and not in the interests of vested interests is to vote for a Labor government. The member for Lilley is here in the chamber. The member for Lilley was responsible-together, of course, with the then Prime Minister and the members of the Labor government-for Australia's work during the global financial crisis in fending off a recession. This was the only developed nation in the world to fend off a recession during the global financial crisis. We were so fortunate to have a Labor government during that time because Labor governments understand that the budget has to serve the economy, not just the interests of the government but the interests of the national economy. Labor governments understand that this sort of neoliberal, trickle-down economics nonsense that, unfortunately, the Prime Minister seems to be 100 per cent signed up to just doesn't work. I'm very, very relieved that we had such wonderful leadership during the global financial crisis, and I certainly hope that, in the interests of the nation, we have another Labor government sooner rather than later. I'm very pleased to stand up to oppose this bill because these priorities in this legislation are the wrong priorities for our nation, and this nation should be supporting seniors and students, not the big end of town. Bill 2017, I think, aims to complete the coalition's extreme trickle-down economic program by cutting the corporate rate for companies with a turnover above $50 million to 25 per cent. The staggering cost of all these measures is $65 billion. Almost 40 years after trickle-down economics was first introduced in the US and the UK under Reagan and Thatcher, Malcolm Turnbull is attempting to import the most pure form of this foreign product into Australia. Make no mistake about it, this is a toxic foreign import. It follows the voodoo logic that tax cuts for the wealthy will drive economic growth and improve the lives of everyone in the community from the top down. But, of course, as the record of Reagan and Thatcher shows, company tax cuts are not the silver bullets to achieve economic growth. This point was made",196,Bills
158,Mr Swan (Lilley) (12:10,"The Treasury Laws Amendment (Enterprise Tax Plan No. 2)yesterday by the RBA's Luci Ellis in her brutal demolition of the Business Council of Australia's propaganda, which has been sprouted by Jennifer Westacott. Reagan and Thatcher's enduring economic legacy in the United States and the United Kingdom is one of rampant economic inequality, hollowed-out middle classes and armies of working poor. If the BCA and the Liberals have their way, they'll take us down that American road. During my time as Treasurer, I was associated with an attempt to lower Australia's corporate tax rate. Our efforts in government were part of an entirely different context and a much broader package designed to manage the stresses of a two-speed economy by placing more weight on resource rent taxes and less on the corporate rate. As a solution to Australia's current jobs and growth challenges, a corporate tax cut makes absolutely no sense at all. It doesn't even make the top 10 sensible policy responses to Australia's current economic challenges. Turnbull and the Business Council run the classic trickle-down argument that cutting corporate tax rates will restore Australia's tax competitiveness. Thanks to tax transparency reports legislated by Labor and damning Senate revelations of tax evasion by some of our largest companies, the rationale for Turnbull and the Business Council arguments completely evaporates. In 2015, as a result of Labor's tax transparency legislation, tax office data revealed that one in three private companies in Australia paid no tax, and one in four public corporate entities operating in Australia paid no tax. In addition, half of the foreign companies operating in Australia had no taxable income, while 56 millionaires paid no income tax. The revelation really blows Turnbull and the Business Council's trickle-down argument right out of the water, because, courtesy of deductions, deferred losses, minimisation and evasion, public companies in Australia already pay an average of 24 per cent on that taxable income, while private companies pay an average of just 19 per cent. Just last week, we had a conservative estimate from the ATO that an estimated $3.5 billion in tax revenue from large corporates and multinationals was unaccounted for. As the Senate inquiry into tax evasion uncovered, the ATO has confirmed that some of Australia's largest global companies have been engaging in aggressive transfer-pricing activities, costing the public billions of dollars in revenue. In tax discussions, there is a conventional distinction between legal tax avoidance and illegal tax evasion. The reality is: there is a spectrum. Today, I want to discuss the behaviour of one company-BHP. Their behaviour leads me to believe they have operated at the evasion end of the spectrum for over a decade. For years, BHP have claimed to be a global leader in tax transparency and corporate responsibility. We now know nothing could be further from the truth. BHP have an ongoing $1.1 billion tax dispute with the ATO regarding their Singapore marketing hub, dating back to 2003 from 2013. In addition, they have a $300 million dispute with the Queensland government over royalty avoidance through transfer pricing. BHP's 2017 Economic contribution report also admits, for the first time, that BHP are also being audited for an additional three years-fiscal years 2014, 2015 and 2016. Given that BHP is already engaged in a $1.1 billion dispute with the ATO and is now under audit for a further three years, it is clear that BHP is one of biggest tax dodgers, if not the biggest, in Australia. Consider this: last week the ATO confirmed it is currently engaged in disputes worth around $4 billion with large corporates, mostly associated with transfer pricing. This means that over 25 per cent of the value of the ATO's tax disputes are with just one company. BHP's 2017 Economic contribution report proves conclusively that BHP is a fiscal termite eating away at the foundations of our corporate tax system. There wouldn't be another company listed in the ASX stock exchange which would have a tax liability anywhere near BHP's amount, although Rio may come close. Rio is also involved in aggressive transfer pricing. Clearly, these two companies-BHP and Rio-have not been playing by the rules. These tax disputes are pillaging the Australian Treasury and shortchanging the Australian people, pure and simple. BHP and Rio are freeloading off the hard work of millions of workers who haven't had any wage growth in Australia for years and small businesses who are paying their fair share while fighting to balance the books. It is nothing short of a disgrace that BHP continue to claim they are a corporate leader in tax, given their aggressive use of marketing hubs in what is effectively a tax haven-Singapore. However, the most outrageous aspect of BHP's tax affairs is hidden in their 2017 annual report, with the report for the executive director and his remuneration package. On page 134, the report outlines that the CEO exceeded his performance outcomes in the individual measures category, warranting a million-dollar bonus. When we turn to page 135, we discover one of the key performance indicators of individual measures of that category is 'strong representation on key issues such as transparency and tax'. In essence, the BHP board have awarded their CEO a million-dollar bonus for a billion-dollar bill avoided in tax. It is a million-dollar bonus for organising aggressive tax minimisation through a tax haven, resulting in one of the largest tax disputes in Australian history; a million-dollar bonus for enhancing transparency and tax reputation when the company's tax affairs can only be described as high farce. I'll say it again: a million-dollar bonus for $1 billion avoided in tax. It is no wonder that, in an effort to restore their reputation, BHP have launched their 'Think big' campaign. Thinking big is just an advertising slogan to camouflage what the Big Australian has become in the last decade-Australia's biggest tax avoider. When I first began raising BHP's tax affairs in this place in late 2015, the company's chief financial officer, Mr Beaven, took the time to write to me about what an honourable taxpayer BHP really was. The letter made no mention of the ATO dispute, which was not yet public, and instead emphasised that BHP pays a lot of tax. Well, that's nice! But paying a lot of tax doesn't then grant you the right to evade billions in tax. BHP is like that guest at the hotel: it has rented the penthouse, it has had full room service but it has run off and left the bill because it has only paid for a standard room. BHP have always presented themselves as a model corporate citizen. This behaviour destroys the morale of people who pay tax and who then come to believe that government treats them with contempt by penalising them while sparing the powerful and the wealthy. BHP, just like every other individual and business in Australia, have a legal and ethical obligation to pay all of their tax. Tax isn't an option. Tax isn't a donation. Tax is the price we pay for the institutions and structures, both legal and economic, which have made the Australian economy one of the strongest in the OECD. As a company, BHP have benefited enormously from our institutions and our structures. BHP should pay all of the tax they owe, not an amount that they decide is appropriate. When global and respected companies operate in this cavalier way, it compromises the integrity of the social contract and greenlights others to follow in their tax-avoiding footsteps. With the departure of the former BHP chairman, Jac Nasser, and the appointment of Ken McKenzie, BHP has an opportunity to begin to restore BHP's reputation. When I first called out BHP's activities in 2015, I didn't blame the CEO or the board. Unfortunately, the self-righteous leadership of BHP shows no sign of remorse or contrition and, instead, have indicated that they will go to the wall claiming their tax dispute is simply about evaluation. Well, BHP, the gig is up. I'm not seeking to bury BHP but implore them to lead by example. For years, BHP have claimed to be a corporate leader. Now it's time to start acting like one and stop hiding behind PR campaigns. I would have thought that the Treasurer and the other austerity campaigners in this government would be horrified by this behaviour of BHP and others and that they'd be out there publicly condemning it. Instead, we just have deafening silence. If the Treasurer were fair dinkum about acting on tax evasion, he would have been banging the table and condemning this behaviour. Of course, what is really happening here is the Treasurer is dancing with the one that brung him. This bill shows that the Treasurer is happy to blow out the deficit, with an unfunded $65 billion tax cut-unfunded!-and of course to see the budget further eroded by the disgraceful activities of companies like BHP. At its core, this government is a trickle-down government. This is a government that believes in tax cuts for the rich and the powerful and deregulation for the powerful. It attacks the social safety net at every turn and it has wage suppression in its policy suite for everybody else. All that this corporate rate cut will end up in is stock buybacks and dividend payments. And who gets those? Generally people who are pretty well-off. As the RBA outlined yesterday, it will have a minimal impact on jobs and growth in the long-term-a devastating critique of the government's policy yesterday. In a debate between Luci Ellis of the RBA and Jennifer Westacott from the BCA, Luci Ellis completely destroyed Jennifer Westacott's arguments-but there's nothing new about them. There is a very rich debate about the impact of this sort of corporate tax cutting and, as the Treasury modelling itself shows, it will have a minimal impact on jobs and growth over the long-term in this country. But the government are forging ahead with an unfunded tax cut which is going to blow out the deficit, are tolerant of other companies that are flouting their rules and are snubbing their nose at the Australian people. Why is that? It is because the government are dedicated to serving the top table first-dedicated to the wealthy, of the wealthy and for the wealthy. member for Lilley in this important debate on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Enterprise Tax Plan No. 2) Bill 2017. It's a debate about tax, but, at its heart, it is a debate about the economic priorities we face in this country. Those of us on the Labor side understand that the single biggest economic issue that we have to tackle in this country today is the growing inequality between those who have and those who do not, between those who represent those who have and those of us, on this side of the House, who want to see a fairer Australia for all Australians. We know that the big economic levers that need to be pushed include giving working Australians a wage rise. It is time. Australia needs a pay rise. We know that we need to ensure the corporates are paying their fair share of the tax burden. We know that governments have to invest in social capital, particularly in our schools, in early-childhood",206,Bills
159,Mr Stephen Jones (Whitlam) (12:24,"It is a great pleasure to be following theeducation, in technical and further education and in our universities. Social capital is critical in addressing growing inequality. But we also know that we need to invest in traditional infrastructure as well, economic infrastructure that is going to make a difference, particularly to regions that are struggling. The NBN is critical in this, providing the railways of the 21st century, wiring up every house and business in the country not only to the markets of their town and the country but to the markets of the world. We also know that, if we're going to address growing inequality, we have to do something about the growing inequality between capital-city Australia and those of us who live in regional Australia. It's my sad duty to inform the House that this bill, and this government, is failing against each and every one of these measures. It is often said that budgets are about priorities. The priorities on display in this budget are very clear. Big business gets a tax cut, high-income earners get a tax cut and ordinary workers earning above $21,000 a year get a tax increase. If you're a worker relying on penalty rates, you get an extra wage cut because of the government's support of the cut to penalty rates. We are heading in the wrong direction. We will be opposing this bill, and we have opposed elements of the previous and related bills, because we do not believe that the answer to Australia's economic woes-to the growing inequality between those who have and those who don't-is to give the wealthiest and the big businesses in this country a $60-billion unfunded tax cut. I've mentioned the growing inequality between regional Australia and capital-city Australia. I'm not surprised that there are not many members from the regional electorates of the coalition benches on the speaking list to talk in favour of this bill. You won't find a supporter of this bill in regional Australia for the very simple reason that it delivers little to them. If you look at the benefits that are going to flow from this bill and you do a geographic comparison between who wins and who gets nothing out of it, it is stark. I've had some data prepared which looks at the number of incorporated businesses that will benefit from this bill before the House in the capital cities versus those that are outside the capital cities. It might surprise you to know that the number of businesses in the area of Greater Sydney that are going to benefit from this legislation in the next financial year is 20½ thousand. For the rest of New South Wales, it's a little over six thousand. That's almost a factor of four to one-20-odd thousand to a little over six thousand. And we estimate that by 2026-27 there will be a quarter of a million businesses in Greater Sydney that will benefit from these unfunded, unaffordable tax cuts, compared to a little over 60 thousand businesses in the rest of New South Wales-67 thousand. In the state of Queensland, we see a similar pattern: a very large number of businesses in Greater Brisbane, compared to the rest of Queensland. In fact, right around the country there are big gaps. If you look at some of those places in regional Queensland-I happen to have the data for the City of Greater Brisbane: over 6,500 businesses are eligible to benefit from this legislation before the House. But if you go to an electorate like Capricornia, a little over 260 businesses stand to benefit. If you go down to New South Wales, in the electorate of Page it is a little over 230 businesses; over the road in Eden-Monaro, a little over 316 businesses. Down in Corangamite, it is 195 businesses. The picture we can paint here is that we have members representing regional Australia from the coalition parties who are coming into this House and voting in favour of legislation that does nothing to benefit the businesses and constituents of their electorates, but does a hell of a lot to ensure that the big businesses in the capital cities of this country will benefit and to deny the government the revenue to fund the very services that are needed in rural and regional Australia to address growing inequality. They are cutting their own throats by voting for this bill. Mark my words, Mr Deputy Speaker, when we vote in favour of a $65 billion unfunded tax cut, things will follow. In the next budget we can expect the government to be bringing bills into this House which will introduce cuts to the very programs that are absolutely essential to address growing inequality in this country-that is, further cuts to vocational education, further cuts to university spending and further cuts to school education; further cuts to the social welfare safety net that is so important in some of these struggling rural and regional communities; and more disasters in the rollout of the NBN. So there are consequences for those regional MPs who vote in favour of this bill. Not only does it not deliver a benefit to their electorates but it puts in place a structure which is going to ensure that they are going to have to come in here and support further cuts to the social safety net and the social capital investment and the hard capital investment that their communities so desperately deserve and, importantly, so desperately need. There are lots of reasons that this bill does not pass any sane test. It's not going to address the huge economic challenges around growing inequality in this country. But let's put that aside for one moment and see whether it will address the tests that the government has set for itself. We can see-as the member for Lilley has pointed out, and as the deputy governor of the Reserve Bank said at the National Press Club yesterday-this will have a negligible impact on growth in this country. In fact, on the government's own figures, there will be around one per cent of economic growth in 20 years time. This is a government that can't even get the modelling for growth accurate over the forward estimates, so we can take with a pinch of salt its estimates and its modelling for what growth is going to look like, as a result of this one measure, in 20 years time. We know that it's not going to do anything for wages either. If we accept the government's own figures of $2 a day in 20 years time, we can take that with a pinch of salt. It can't even get the modelling for wages growth right over the next two years; how can we accept any modelling it's done on wages growth over the next 20 years? By the standards that it has set for itself, this legislation is not credible-except and save for the one proposition that was put quite forcefully by the member for Lilley. We can set aside this idea that the bill is going to lead to wages, jobs and growth. There will be negligible impact on jobs growth, negligible impact on wages growth and no impact on economic growth. So, what's the purpose of it? Clearly, the purpose of this bill is to fix up their mates. It is a $65 billion tax cut for some of the wealthiest companies in Australia, the sole purpose of which is to fix up the mates who so ably and keenly support those on the other side. A lot has been said about the need for us to have a competitive tax base, for us to be competitive with other jurisdictions in terms of economic investment. We've had a look at this and we've had a look at what is not only being said in Australia about the impact of taxation policies on business investment in Australia. We had some interesting statements from the assistant governor of the Reserve Bank yesterday at the National Press Club who argued that this sort of tax measure has a negligible impact on a business's inclination to invest in Australia. She said: When businesses make decisions about where to locate-the tax rate does presumably matter, but so does the business environment, the institutional framework, the rule of law, the macro-economic outlook and where the resources are. There's a broader business environment to consider and those advantages haven't gone away. She makes it quite clear what the Reserve Bank thinks of the government's argument that this measure is essential to boost growth, job creation and investment in this country. Never could there have been a clearer statement from the Reserve Bank of Australia that the government's argument in favour of this bill is absolutely bogus. To the issue of comparing our tax rates to other countries around the world. The United States Congressional Budget Office put out a paper earlier this year saying that the statutory corporate tax rate is one of the many features of a tax system that influences corporate behaviour and that, because of their broader scope, average and effective corporate tax rates are better indicators of a company's incentives to invest in a particular country than the headline corporate tax rate. That is to say that, yes, you can look at the headline tax rate, but it is often the case that the majority of companies are paying that headline tax rate. The paper points out that the headline tax rate of 30 per cent in 2012 was equivalent to an average tax rate for Australia of around 17 per cent, and, in fact, the effective corporate tax rate for businesses in this country was around 10.4 per cent. This is the advice that the independent Congressional Budget Office is providing to the US Congress about how they should set their tax rates at a level which would make them competitive with Australia. It's not the 30 per cent headline they're looking at; it's the average tax rate of around 10.4 per cent. For all the reasons set out by the member for Lilley, we think that average is too low. In Australia we have a revenue problem, and it's why we cannot afford this unfunded, unconscionable corporate tax rate at this time. It's not what Australia needs. It is going to drive us backwards and not forwards. (Enterprise Tax Plan No. 2) Bill 2017. I want to add my voice to those who oppose this bill and outline some of the issues with it, to reiterate what we've heard from some of the previous speakers. This government has introduced legislation that would implement the remainder of the government's company tax cut plans, providing companies with a turnover above $50 million with a tax cut of 25 per cent, costing around $600 million over the forward estimates and around $36.5 billion over the medium term. In the final sitting week before the budget, the government managed to successfully pass through the Senate part of its company tax cut plans, managing to pass a tax cut of 25 per cent for businesses with a turnover of over $50 million. Consistent with our position on company tax cuts, Labor continues to oppose this bill because this bill is fundamentally flawed and fundamentally unfair. Not only is this government proposing to the House a measure which will materially, significantly and structurally damage the federal budget but is also demonstrating the skewed priorities of this government. It is standing up for massive tax cuts to big business and lining the pockets of multinationals to the tune of billions instead of delivering education, health care and affordable housing to the Australian taxpayers, whose money they wilfully spend. This bill is fiscally flawed and morally bankrupt. To speak to the economic inconsistencies in this bill, I reiterate the truth spoken by the member for McMahon, the shadow Treasurer, Chris Bowen, when he said in September, during the second reading debate, that we can have budget repair",209,Bills
160,Mr Khalil (Wills) (12:39,"I rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendmentand a return to budget balance or we can have a corporate tax cut, but we cannot have both. This government has clearly chosen corporate tax cuts over budget repair. It was about eight years ago when Malcolm Turnbull described $300 billion in projected gross debt as 'gigantic'. He said, 'Gigantic! Unacceptable!' What a stark contrast to his silence over the almost $500 billion-half a trillion dollars-in actual debt his own government currently presides over. This debt will soon hit half a trillion dollars on his watch. Under the Liberals, gross debt has blown out by more than $209 billion, net debt has blown out by $100 billion for the current year and the deficit for this year has more than tripled, from $10.6 billion in their 2014 budget to $36.5 billion now. If only the Liberals would spend less time bickering and briefing against each other and more time working together to address issues that actually affect Australians every day-housing affordability, job creation, education, health care and effective budget repair. Perhaps then we wouldn't have seen the deficit triple. Perhaps we wouldn't have seen the net debt blow out by $100 billion this year. Perhaps we wouldn't have seen the AAA credit rating at risk on their watch. If Malcolm Turnbull and Scott Morrison were actually serious about returning to surplus, they would immediately ditch their $65 billion tax gift for big businesses, including the big banks. We've always opposed this significant structural deterioration to the budget. These cuts are a hit to the budget and show the rank hypocrisy and gross incompetence of a government which lectures the Australian people about the need for budget repair. Do you remember this? They used to talk about 'debt and deficit disaster'. They used to talk about 'budget emergency'. Remember that? I do. And yet, on their watch, the deficit has blown out, as I said, and debt has crashed past the half-a-trillion-dollar mark. Put simply, given the debt blowout under this government, Labor cannot support an expanded corporate tax concession that costs the budget $65 billion over the forward estimates. It would not be responsible, and we are for responsible tax reform that is genuinely fair. We have declared this since the plan was first introduced. We've highlighted some of the extremely minimal economic benefits of this plan: one per cent of economic growth in 20 years time and an increase of $2 a day in wages in 20 years time. There is negligible wage growth and negligible GDP growth in the government's own modelling, conducted by the Treasury, and all of this is at a time when wages growth has flatlined and is at record lows, at 1.9 per cent. Some economic data that was released in September this year recently showed us that living standards, which had been climbing, went backwards in the last quarter. Australian families are facing the nasty cocktail of rising energy prices-electricity prices-stalling wages growth and record high underemployment, and the government have nothing to offer. Absolutely nothing! Let me correct myself. That's not right. They do have something to offer: they're offering a handout-a tax cut handout-to millionaires and multinationals. That's what they're offering. Their offer is to squeeze money from the most vulnerable in society. We've had long-held concerns about low wages growth. Without a doubt, the dwindling bargaining power of workers and their representatives has played a central role in stagnant wages growth and rising inequality. This is at a time when the government has also supported penalty rate cuts from 1 July this year and has sought to raise income taxes on all taxpayers with incomes above $21,000. So a worker on $55,000 will pay $275 extra a year; someone on $80,000 will pay an extra $400 a year. It goes to this government's approach and its misguided priorities that its answer for flat wages growth is to cut pay and to have higher income taxes. However, it's not just the workers and families who are trying to make ends meet that this government is actually targeting; it's also going after the most vulnerable in our society, as I mentioned. It's going after the most vulnerable rather than actually asking its bigbusiness buddies to pay their fair share. Only Labor is serious about fair budget repair that doesn't ask the most vulnerable in our community to carry the heaviest load. The obscenity of this government's approach of targeting the most vulnerable is on display in my electorate of Wills. My staff and I have worked tirelessly with constituents who have been targeted and falsely accused-indeed, by the government's own admission, up to 40 per cent have been given false debt notices-in this government's disastrous Centrelink robo-debt debacle. It may have left the news cycle, but the repercussions are still very real. I regularlyand I'm sure many of my colleagues do-sit with students, aged pensioners and those with disabilities, and hear their stories first hand. Their lives are made worse and harder by the irresponsible budget decisions made by this government. There's a real impact. Of course, we do what we can to represent them in challenging the wrongful debts. We advocate to Centrelink and to the Department of Human Services for their cases to be reassessed and to have an actual case officer look over and see the truth of their situation. I've had hundreds of constituents come to my office panicked about the debt notices that they have receivedsome with a $200 to $300 debt which was incorrect. One had a debt as high as $19,000. But the underlying issue that I see as connecting these cases is this attack on the vulnerable. This government has a pattern of choosing to target the vulnerable for revenue while favouring the top end of town for tax cuts and exemptions. It has basically prioritised giving millionaires and big business tax cuts and raising income taxes on workers earning above $21,000 over saving penalty rates. It has targeted Medicare-our best safety net-from the very beginning, slashing funds from, literally, the sickest and poorest people in our country. It has targeted students, young families and those who need support and advocacy the most. We can see that clearly in this bill. It gives to companies that turn over more than $50 million-an amount of money, by the way, that does not even register as conceivable to the majority of Australians that this government claims to serve. This plan favours massive corporate tax cuts over hard working Australians who, daily, place their trust in government. It is a $65 billion ram raid on the budget to be handed straight to multinationals and big banks at the expense of people who work and struggle throughout the country. It's obvious that ordinary Australians are losing under this government. I see it, as I said, every day in my electorate office. They are being neglected. And, more than that, they are being wilfully targeted. The government have set out a net, and it doesn't matter who they catch-whether it's the tuna or the dolphins. They've collectively punished thousands of Australians, some of whom don't have the wherewithal or the understanding of how to respond, particularly when they're put on a Centrelink call where they're waiting for three or four hours trying to speak to someone. Often, they just give up and pay the fine, even though they know it to be incorrect. The lucky few who have managed to make it to the offices of local MPs have, maybe, got the assistance they need to combat this. But it was stacked against them. The government have, over and over, been proven to lack real economic leadership. It is a fact so evident in their failure to live up to their initial economic promises of a surplus and the structural deterioration in the budget, but also in their neglect of Australians who are forced to fight for their rights to live and work peacefully. It's for these reasons that I absolutely oppose this bill. Economically, it's delusional and it doesn't stand up. The government have actually kidded themselves. They're trying to kid Australians into thinking that they have our best interests at heart in this bill. The government are trying to have us think that the best and only way for our economy to grow is to take from the poor and give to the rich, but trickle-down economics doesn't work; we know that. We've seen the evidence overseas. In the US, many of the corporates have held onto the gains they've made rather than create employment or pass them on to shareholders through dividends, and it doesn't work here. By the way, by the government's own modelling we can see it has a negligible impact. Hardworking Australians will not see the benefits of billions in tax cuts for multinationals; it's not going to happen. This government will have you believe that this mess is the only way to grow the economy, but never has it been clearer that they are beyond out of touch with ordinary Australians. We can see all of that wrapped up in this bill. Morally, it is bankrupt. It abandons those who need responsible reform the most, and that's not what government should be doing. Quite simply, it has failed in its economic leadership; it has no economic leadership. There's one person at the forefront of all of this: the Treasurer. The Treasurer's incompetence and failure to do his day job is yet another indication of this government's failure on economic policy. This is not a sudden revelation; we've seen this play out. This is a pattern of incompetence and failure that simply underlies how bad this government is. It's a blooper reel that would make Joe Hockey blush. It goes to the very heart of the government's policy vacuum and the Treasurer's failure. The Turnbull government needs to ditch its $65 billion big business tax cut instead of relying on zombie measures to prop up its shaky projected surplus in 2020-21. For the sake of the budget and for the sake of all Australians, the Turnbull government must stop clinging to its cruel and unfair zombie measures, which have no hope of passing this parliament. The coalition has no credible plan to bring the budget back to surplus and to protect Australia's prized AAA credit rating. While it's trying to help big business, that's not helping the situation at all. Rating agencies have previously highlighted that a further slippage in the return to surplus would jeopardise this credit rating. If Malcolm Turnbull and Scott Morrison were actually serious about returning to surplus, they would immediately ditch their $65 billion tax gift for big business, including the big banks. Fundamentally and ultimately, only Labor is serious about budget repair that's fair. We don't ask the most vulnerable in our community to carry the heaviest load. We want to actually deliver to those most vulnerable, in education, in health care and in housing affordability, and make it better for Australians. Dr ALY (Cowan) (12:52): The government went to the last election with a mantra of 'jobs and growth'. We heard it spread throughout Australia at the last election. I must say, that's a very noble vision to have, a vision for jobs and growth. I'm fairly sure that most Australians would agree that jobs and economic growth are fundamental to the viability and the future sustainability of our society. But I'm sad to say that the mantra of jobs and growth has never extended, has never grown and has never emerged as an actual priority for this government. The Treasury Laws Amendment (Enterprise Tax Plan No. 2) Bill 2017 was first flagged in last year's budget. They are now reintroducing parts of the bill this year, and we've only been able to commence the debate on these bills in mid-September. This seems to be endemic of the way in which this government operates to pass bills through. They seem to be half-baked, they seem to be unsure of what they're doing, and they seem to want to pass things through quickly so that it appears that they're doing something, while they deal with their own internal unrest and chaos. This bill is actually a hit to the budget that demonstrates the hypocrisy of a government that lectures the Australian people about the need for budget repair. This is a government that used to talk about a debt and deficit disaster and a budget emergency, yet, on their watch, while they've been talking about jobs and growth and spouting that mantra, the deficit has blown out and has crashed past the half-a-trillion-dollar mark. Just after this year's budget, we asked some simple questions about the actual cost of the full company tax rate plan. We've received several answers to that: $24 billion, $26 billion, $50 billion, $36.5 billion, $65.4 billion-the list goes on. But we've been very clear, since the plan was first introduced, about highlighting the extremely minimal economic benefits that would be an outcome of this huge spend, which ranges anywhere between $24 billion and $65.4 billion-who knows what the actual cost is? Let's have a look at some of those benefits, because they could hardly be called benefits. There will be economic growth of one per cent in 20 years time. That's a very low standard to want to aspire to. There will be an increase in wages of $2 a day in 20 years time-not today but in 20 years time. All of this comes at a time when wages growth has flatlined at a record low of 1.9 per cent and when economic data recently showed that living standards, which had been climbing, have gone backwards in the last quarter. I like to get out in my electorate and talk to some of the businesses around there. I've issued an invitation to all of the businesses in my electorate-small, medium and larger ones-to come to me and let me know how this tax plan has benefited them and how some of the measures, like cuts to penalty rates and cuts to taxes for businesses, that have been implemented by this government under the banner of jobs and growth have benefited them. I have to say that not a single one of those businesses has come forward and said that they've actually been able to employ more people or increase their productivity as a result of anything that this government has done. In fact, the reality is that businesses have had to lay off people and have reduced their productivity. There's a reason for that, which is that this plan does nothing to instigate any growth in the economy. Along with all of the government's other measures, it actually does not result in any wages growth. I'm no economist, but we all know that if you want to save money you have to spend less. We all know that if you want to grow the economy people have to be able to have more disposable income to spend in that economy. As a business, if you want to grow your business, you need to have more customers coming in. That's not what is happening. It is certainly not happening in Cowan, where businesses have had to shut down because people are spending less, and people are spending less because wages haven't grown. People are spending less because inequality in this country has actually increased under the watch of this government. Since July this year, the government have also supported penalty rate cuts, and they seek to raise income taxes for all taxpayers with income above $21,000. I just cannot comprehend how people can make ends meet on an income of $21,000 a year. A worker on $55,000 will pay $275 a year, and someone on $80,000 gets an extra $400. I just don't comprehend that. I don't comprehend how it is that the proportion of my income that went to tax when I was a single mother raising two children on a minimum wage was actually higher than it is now that I am somebody on the highest income tax bracket. I have more avenues available to me now to reduce my tax than I did when I was a struggling single parent on the minimum wage. How is that fair? How does that reduce inequality in our society? More importantly, how does taxing and punishing the lower end of our society and making them pay for these tax cuts to big business result in jobs and growth? It goes to this government's approach and their misguided priorities that their answer for flat wages growth is a cut to pay and higher income taxes. We hear those that support it say that it's needed to drive investment. But it was only a few years ago that we had the biggest investment boom Australia has ever seen with a headline corporate tax rate of 30 per cent. So where's the evidence to suggest that a cut to corporate tax rates is actually what is going to drive more investment in Australia? honourable member's time is expiring. The honourable member may wish to either continue this afternoon or finish. Dr ALY: I will finish, and I just want to finish on this: Labor's approach is that we have a dividend imputation, a great Labor reform, which means that every domestic payer of corporate tax, in effect, gets it back. These are the priorities that we should have. Australians can look only to a Labor government to look after their needs and to recognise their priorities, rather than to a government that is out of touch and cares only about giving big tax cuts to big business. Debate adjourned. Sitting suspended from 13:01 to 16:01 Treasury Laws Amendment (2017 Measures No. 6) Bill 2017 Second Reading Consideration resumed of the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. Measures No. 6) Bill 2017. Digital currencies and, in particular, decentralised cryptocurrencies have been one of the more mind-bending digital innovations of the past decade. Money supply is a difficult concept for a layman to get their head around at the best of times but, when you add a digital peer-to-peer exchange that relies on a decentralised encrypted ledger to record and manage currency transfers that is entirely independent of any financial institution or government, things get conceptually complicated very quickly. While currencies that operate independent to governments initially appealed most strongly to libertarians and cybercriminals, cryptocurrencies are now a relatively mainstream, if still new and evolving, digital innovation. Venture capitalists are investing heavily into a range of fin-tech start-ups that rely on digital and cryptocurrencies. Indeed, the messaging start-up Kik recently raised nearly $100 million through an initial coin offering for its Kin token distribution. However, for far too long our laws have failed and have not kept up with this innovation. As a result, fin-tech innovators are currently hindered by the uncertain legislative environment surrounding the",212,Bills
161,The Deputy Speaker (Ms Vamvakinou,"It being almost one o'clock, the",217,Bills
162,Mr Watts (Gellibrand) (16:02,"I rise to support the Treasury Laws Amendment (2017use of digital currencies. To support these industries, we need to make legislative changes to give businesses and consumers confidence and certainty. Dr Rhys Bollen, from the Monash University Faculty of Law, noted in his submission to the 2015 Senate inquiry into digital currency that: … a well designed and proportionate legal and regulatory regime will support user confidence in, and therefore growth of, innovative payment systems such as virtual currencies. At the moment, anyone purchasing a digital currency in Australia is technically liable for GST expenses on that purchase. In the 2017-18 budget, the government announced a measure which removed the double taxation of digital currency. They argued that this measure was to prevent double taxation within our tax system, and this bill addresses that issue. Double taxation means not only that consumers are getting a worse deal financially but also that it's hard for digital currencies to be competitive as a means for exchange when compared to government-regulated currencies. The total market capitalisation of cryptocurrencies continues to grow and recently surpassed $170 billion. Those traders and investors who use digital currency will now not be taxed for buying and selling through regulated exchanges, and this is likely to increase usage of and demand for digital currencies. Labor supports the Treasury Laws Amendment (2017 Measures No. 6) Bill 2017. Schedule1 to this bill amends the A New Tax System (Goods and Services) Act to ensure that supplies of digital currency receive equivalent goods and services tax treatment to supplies of money, particularly foreign currency. The explanatory memorandum for the bill outlines that supplies of money receive special treatment under the GST law, because generally a supply of money is not a supply within the meaning of the act. Therefore, entities that pay consideration in money are not liable for GST on the supply of that money. As money is a medium of exchange only, it is not consumed and is therefore not subject to GST. However, because bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are not considered to be money in a legal sense, simply using them at the moment theoretically attracts GST. In some cases, entities will pay each other for an exchange of 'money', such as during debt trading and foreign currency speculation. In those situations, a service is being provided, and the exchange of money is not simply a medium of exchange. Exchanges of digital currencies as a medium of exchange are different in this respect. The United Kingdom and the US have not applied value-added taxes to digital currencies. The EU ruled that bitcoin was exempt from the VAT. This bill will bring our law into line with nations like these. This measure is supported by the fin-tech sector as well as by legal and tax professionals. States and territories have been consulted on the reform and have also agreed to it. Separate inquiries by the Senate Economics References Committee and the Productivity Commission in 2015 both recommended taking this step. Other concerns regarding the use of digital currencies for criminal activity or money laundering can be addressed in separate reforms-namely, anti-money-laundering and counter-terrorism-financing initiatives. A definition of digital currency will also be included in the GST act. This definition includes a number of requirements which digital units of value must satisfy in order to be considered to be similar to state fiat currencies. The definition also includes the following criteria: digital units of value are made up of interchangeable units generally available to the public without any restriction on their use or future use as consideration; they are valuable only as a medium of exchange; they do not have value that depends on, or is derived from, the value of anything else; they do not have a value solely, or mainly, because they give an entitlement to receive, or direct the supply of, a particular thing; and they're not denominated in any current country's currency. It's hard to quantify the size of the digital currency market in Australia, especially because it is restricted by this double taxation system. While bitcoin is the most prominent digital currency, there are currently more than 500 other digital currencies. Most of these alternative digital currencies were inspired by, or explicitly modelled on, bitcoin. Labor supports the measures to help Australian tax laws to come up to date with developments in financial innovation. These measures will help strengthen our growing fin-tech sector, which benefits all Australians and can be used by all businesses-particularly, innovative new businesses. It can be incredibly difficult for smalland medium-sized enterprises to secure appropriate levels of finance. SMEs have access to more diverse options through these new fin-tech innovations. These products can be appropriately tailored to meet the needs of small businesses. Examples include online trade finance, peer-to-peer lending and other ecommerce arrangements. Worldwide, there are many examples of success in this space. WeChat in China allows users to apply for loans and receive a decision almost instantly, through the app. It then allows individuals to transfer money to each other, again within the app. Lufax, the second largest peer-to-peer lender in China, offers personalisation of car insurance options in real time, taking into account weather and traffic conditions on the day. Blockchain and digital currencies generate value streams not just limited to financial services. The fin-tech sector has a huge role to play in transitioning our economy. Microeconomic policy reforms and even competition policy reform can be accelerated by blockchain innovations in this space. The ASX, for example, recently announced its intention to introduce blockchain technology into the process of clearing and settlements. RMIT in Melbourne has just launched a Blockchain Innovation Hub this month. In other matters in the bill, schedule 2 amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to include the Centre for Entrepreneurial Research and Innovation on the list of deductible gift recipients. This allows members of the public to make tax-deductible donations to the CERI. The CERI is located in Nedlands, WA, near the UWA, in the federal electorate of Curtin. It was established in 2015, initially funded by iron ore miner Charlie Bass. This ensures that gifts of $2 or more to the organisation will be tax deductible. The amendments apply to gifts to made to the CERI after 1 January 2017 and before 31 December 2021. Listing organisations in tax law is common and uncontroversial. Labor supports the Centre for Entrepreneurial Research and Innovation's addition to the DGR list. Labor has a proud record of strengthening and protecting the not-for-profit sector, and we are pleased to support this bill. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that this bill be reported to the House without amendment. Treasury Laws Amendment (Enterprise Tax Plan No. 2) Bill 2017 Second Reading Consideration resumed of the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. to which the following amendment was moved: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""the House declines to give this bill a second reading as: (1) this significant structural deterioration in the Budget is unaffordable; (2) the Government has prioritised giving millionaires and big business tax cuts, and raising income taxes on workers earning above $21,000, over saving penalty rates; and (3) the Government has failed to deliver any economic leadership"". Ms SHARKIE (Mayo) (16:10): I rise to oppose this bill. I'm going to be outright and upfront on it. We know that many smaller businesses have been doing it tough in the current economic climate. We also know that smaller businesses provide approximately half of all employment in Australia. My electorate of Mayo is particularly blessed with small enterprises, with over 99 per cent of businesses being small businesses. Some have very large turnovers, but they are small family enterprises. The Nick Xenophon Team saw the tax relief in the previous bill as a way to give smaller businesses breathing space and to meaningfully encourage employment growth in Australia. These are businesses that have under $50 million annual aggregated turnover, including independent supermarkets, independent service stations, small construction businesses, the FruChocs brand and any other small family businesses and independent shops that you can think of. We acknowledge that they are quite different to the Coles, Woolworths and Bunnings of the world. This is why we supported company tax cuts for up to $50 million with annual aggregate turnover-up to, but not beyond, $50 million. Remember that this threshold, as I've said, is not about profit. For example, it's not uncommon for an independent supermarket to have a turnover of over $15 million a year, but the owner would only be taking home the merest fraction of that. There are many businesses right throughout our communities that do have very high turnovers, but very low profit margins-service stations, in particular. I'm talking to small, independent service station owners in my electorate. They're often making less than one cent for every litre they sell. They might have a turnover of $12 million or even $18 million, but they only need a couple of people to drive by without paying for petrol and their profits for the day are gone. The Nick Xenophon Team has a different view about big business. For big business, we are not convinced that tax cuts will translate into the same jobs growth as they will for smaller businesses. GDP growth can be split into growth in returns to capital, or profit growth, and in returns to labour-namely, wage growth. Australia has been experiencing declining wage growth, especially relative to profits growth. The wages share of total factor income has fallen from 54 per cent in March 2016 to 51.5 per cent in March 2017. The profit share of total factor income has increased from 24.2 per cent in March 2016 to 27 per cent in March 2017. Put another way, the returns to employees have been slowing down, whereas the returns to employers have been speeding up. It's hard to get a sense of the dramatic movements just from the numbers but, if you look at graphs, they look like cliffs. Recent research indicates that there is also a high concentration of market power in many of the sectors in Australia's economy. This means that fewer and fewer large firms are dominating Australian markets. When markets are controlled by a few big firms, the more likely it is that they act in an anticompetitive nature, and that disadvantages consumers. It also means that these firms can simply use their market position to extract higher profits rather than needing to enhance competitiveness by attracting talent or developing their workforce. One classic example is the way in which Coles and Woolworths have used their market dominance to squeeze their supply chains, such as Australian farmers, to increase their profits. And yet, employees of Woolworths, for example, do not appear to have had a real wage rise since 1 January 2015. That's coming up to nearly three years. AlthoughI understand that enterprise bargaining is underway, that is still a long time while all of their bills continue to go up. In summary, unlike smaller businesses, I am not convinced that company tax cuts to the biggest businesses will result in significantly increased wages or employment. However, I will say the biggest challenge currently facing all businesses that I talk to in Australia is not their tax burden but the burden of the rising costs of energy. I have spoken at length in this parliament about the escalating prices of both electricity and gas, and the constructive steps that the Nick Xenophon Team have taken to address the issue. However, ultimately, the federal government must also act decisively under its own steam to tackle this challenge headon. I urge the coalition, the government, to set aside their fruitless pursuit of big company tax cuts and focus on what are truly the biggest challenges facing all Australian businesses and end the policy uncertainty on energy. I urge them to do so with speed and haste. Investment in power generation needed to be stimulated years ago. With severe energy shortfalls looming, this can only herald further price spikes. Our time is running out fast. When I talk with businesses in my electorate, what they tell me is they can't afford 20, 30 or 40 per cent increases in their electricity. They want to be able to put on young people; they want to be able to grow their businesses. They don't talk to me about needing to get a further company tax deduction. Those that are under the $50 million threshold are the true businesses that we should be supporting with a different tax regime. I say to the government: we have many, many things to work on in this parliament other than this endless pursuit to try to give the biggest businesses in our country, as well as the big four banks, even more money. Ms MADELEINE KING (Brand) (16:16): I rise today to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Enterprise Tax Plan No. 2) Bill 2017. At a time when wages growth has flatlined to a record low of 1.9 per cent, when living standards, which had been climbing, went backwards in the last quarter and when Australian families are facing the harsh reality of rising living costs and rising electricity prices, this government is preaching to the Australian people about the need for budget repair. At a time when people are trying to make ends meet when faced with record high unemployment and underemployment, when hard working people have been slammed with penalty rate cuts-with nearly 10,000 workers in my electorate of Brand alone feeling the hurt in their wages-and when average income earners are facing tax hikes while millionaires will pay less tax, this government has plucked an arbitrary $65 billion from thin air for the benefit of the big end of town. Yes, that's right, there will be $65 billion in corporate tax cuts, while everyday Australians are lectured on the need for budget repair. It took a little while for this government to tell us what the tax cuts were going to be and what they were going to cost. It started at $24 billion. It went up to $26 billion and then to $50 billion, and later on in question time it went back down again to $36.5 billion. Eventually, the Treasurer settled on the reply that these tax cuts would cost the economy and the budget $65.4 billion. You couldn't make this confusion up. It is staggering, but this $65 billion in corporate tax cuts that would be the result of the full plan would have an extremely minimal economic benefit-let alone the parts that the government managed to get through. By 'extremely minimal', I mean economic growth of one per cent in 20 years time and an increase in wages of $2 a day in nearly 20 years time. At the same time, they've failed to protect penalty rates for the lowest-paid workers among us-as I said earlier, those 10,000 workers in Brand across hospitality, retail and pharmacy services. Labor will not be supporting this; Labor, of course, cannot support this. When reflecting on this and on all those cuts to the programs and services that the government have made, I cannot help but think about what could have been done with that $65 billion. All those cuts have been made so that the government can give a $65 billion corporate tax cut to big business. I think about the everyday people who are carrying an additional burden as they do their best to get by-hard working people; students; parents with kids at school, TAFE or university; older Australians and people living with disability. This government has seen fit to cut funding to schools, TAFE, vocational education and apprenticeships. More than $600 million has been cut from TAFE and vocational education in this year's budget, and that is on top of the almost $3 billion in cuts to TAFE skills and training, and the loss of more than 130,000 apprenticeships since 2013. This government has no problem in taking $22 billion from school funding. Not a dollar difference, they said in 2013, scrambling to match Labor's game-changing needs-based funding of our education system. It turns out it was quite a lot of dollars' difference-it ended up being $22 billion difference in 2017. A third of this tax cut for corporates would have paid for over 22,000 new teachers, and, obviously, countless other resources for schools. When it comes to higher education, this government is eyeing up the university sector as another cash-grab opportunity. After years of their inaction, a policy vacuum was created for our great universities-our third-highest export industry in Western Australia. And after their disastrous attempt to deregulate university fees and introduce potentially $100,000 degrees and after this sabbatical and higher-ed policy, the brains trust comes back with a new plancutting university grants, which means less investment in research, in student support services and fewer courses on offer. This government is increasing student fees by 7.5 per cent, which in anyone's language is a barrier to young people wanting to pursue higher education. Or rather, it's a barrier to those students who do not have the capacity, or their families do not have the capacity, to take on this additional cost and this additional debt. Where do the fees go from this extra 7.5 per cent? Does it go to new infrastructure in universities? Does it go to improving ageing infrastructure? Does it go to supporting the universities themselves to employ more lecturers, to help innovate teaching programs, to undertake research, which they are required to do and which they love to do? Does it have any of these things? No. No, this money does not go to the universities; it goes straight to pay for these tax cuts to corporates. Our university students already pay the sixth-highest fees in the OECD, and we're adding to that. We're adding increased fees and new fees to students undertaking enabling courses. We're charging for enabling courses. These are courses where students have to go-and many students in my electorate go-to be able to obtain entrance into university because they may have a low ATAR score or did not complete high school at all. These enabling courses are generally shorter, and they help people, who are often the first in their family to be able to go to university, get into uni. Murdoch University-which is not in my electorate, but in the member for Tangney's electorate-has the OnTrack program. In 2016, there were 296 students from the region who took advantage of this program; this year, there are 453. Instead of keeping these courses as they are and not charging for them, this government is going to add them to the HECS regime. It just increases debt for young people who can't afford it. When I took this matter up with the minister for education-and, sadly, we've been talking about it through the press and not directly-he said there is no up-front costs for enabling courses, and that is right. It goes to a student's debt. He said: There's no upfront cost for enabling courses and those students will be treated exactly the same as their peers doing other courses at university where the student loan program applies. Except, these enabling courses are not the same, are they? They don't get you a qualification. They're much shorter and they're not the equivalent of a bachelor degree or a post-graduate degree. It's disingenuous of the minister for education to assert to people in my community that they might be. These charges drive students away. They simply rack up the debt for those in our community least able to afford it, and those in our community we want to encourage to go into university, to take that plunge, to be the first in their family to attend a university to improve their lot for their future and the future of their children and their families. That's what that money's going to pay for-the corporate tax cuts-instead of helping more people get into university and get a better education. As I said, our university students pay the sixth-highest fees in the OECD. Our government is pushing us further up that list. I guess it depends on your perspective, but perhaps you can congratulate yourself for limiting the access to university for those who can't afford it. The education minister also mentioned the 'rivers of gold' that he somehow thinks universities live off. Once again-and I've mentioned it before in this place-it's an absolute farce that this government does not understand the essential cross-subsidy that is created in our higher education system. I wish it wasn't the case, but it is the case and has been the case for a long time. To expect or think that increasing student fees and having access to student fees after the places were deregulated meant universities had more cash in their bucket-some 'rivers of gold'-is entirely incorrect. It's untrue. It's no wonder the university sector is upset that it has a minister for education that fails to understand how the university sector actually operates. The other thing the government is doing in trying to pay for this corporate tax cut is locking out the children of migrants who we have invited to live in this country. Changing arrangements so that only full-fee-paying university places are now offered to New Zealanders and migrants caught up in the government's punitive citizenship changes is not fair. It's not fair on the families who have made the decision to call Australia home, who've come here for a good and better life, and now find they can't afford to pay for their children's education. While pushing ahead with the $65 billion in corporate tax cuts that will be ineffectual at best, the government is throwing away good money for little or return. We know it has wasted $122 million on a non-binding community postal survey to gauge people's opinions on how other consenting adults get treated by our laws. It's unfair; it's not right. I find it absurd and I find it abhorrent that our government has sanctioned this judgement-casting exercise instead of getting on and doing its job. An honourable member interjectingMs MADELEINE KING: That's right-its job is changing the law, as it does and as we do, in this place every day. That $122 million could have been put towards having 1,900 new teachers in our schools or helping to educate our children. We could have trained 4½ thousand new nurses to care for the sick, the unwell and the aged. It could have provided 2,000 new beds to help address homelessness. Imagine what could be done if $65 billion could be found to address educational, health or societal needs. The Prime Minister has also wasted the opportunity to connect this country with a first-rate NBN. Instead, he purchased, with taxpayers' money, more than 15,000 kilometres of copper-15 million metres of copper-for his second-rate, inferior and frustrating NBN. TodayI invited the Prime Minister to come and visit Baldivis and its abysmal NBN and mobile reception communications black hole that he's formed. I perhaps said it in the wrong venue, which was question time. I'll be writing to him. I paid the price for that invitation and I got booted out, and that's fair enough. Nonetheless, I do urge him to visit and to speak to the people of Baldivis-and he can witness first hand the kind of anger and frustration that I get to witness from people who are utterly confused and bamboozled and, quite frankly, angry about the money he's wasting on what is an outdated National Broadband Network before it's even been implemented. So we're introducing more copper in a digital age. One might ask: what next? What next will this government attack or waste its money on so that it can fund a corporate tax cut? Well, how about we cut the bereavement allowance for the elderly-generally, the elderly? It's a short-term payment to help people meet the costs of bereavement and adjusting to becoming single. It's usually paid to a member of a long standing elderly couple who has lost a loved one. It's not a great saving. It's a great amount of money for the people affected as they have to adjust very quickly to a single life. A single life is quite different from a life as a couple. It's even more different, again, when you have spent a long time with the same person and you find yourself in that situation. So, while you introduce a $65 billion corporate tax cut, you'll take a bereavement allowance away from those depending on a social safety net. It begs the question: what are the priorities of this government? Well, I guess we know. Further from home, I'll talk briefly about foreign aid. The Prime Minister now holds the dubious honour of being responsible for the lowest level of aid spending as a share of gross national income in 60 years. By slashing our foreign aid budget-by cutting programs that alleviate pain and poverty for the world's poorest and that improve their health and therefore improve the health of Australians-the Prime Minister can hold his head high, should he so choose, that we are now 17th out of 28 countries in the OECD's aid rankings. So all this pain; these cuts to wages, programs and services, the income tax rises, are for what? Are they really the government's answer to flat wages growth, and triggers to drive investment? They may be this government's misguided answer, but experience tells us another story. Only a few years ago, we had the biggest investment boom Australia has seen, with a headline corporate tax rate of 30 per cent. Assistant Governor of the Reserve Bank, Luci Ellis, has nullified the argument that you need this tax cut to drive investment. She has said: When businesses make decisions about where to locate-the tax rate does presumably matter, but so does the business environment, the institutional framework, the rule of law, the macro-economic outlook and where the resources are. There's a broader business environment to consider and those advantages haven't gone away. Ms Ellis is right, those advantages have not gone away in Australia, and a corporate tax cut would do nothing, or at least very little, to improve business circumstances in Australia. As I've said before, budgets are all about priorities. It's crystal clear that this government's priorities are at odds with what is just and fair and right. This government could not be more clear on where it stands, as it works to achieve big-business cuts, as high-income earners get a tax cut, as workers earning above $21,000 per annum get increased taxes, and as penalty rates are cut. Unlike this government, we in Labor have priorities which ensure that we deal with inequality in this country. This means funding our schools, and investing in infrastructure that will develop the jobs needed to keep people working in the future. This means a fairer tax system, levelling the playing field for first home buyers through reforms to negative gearing and capital gains tax. And, as announced recently, our plan to impose a minimum 30 per cent tax on discretionary trusts to deal with the issue of income splitting is dealing with something that has been in the too-hard basket for far too long. Amendment (Enterprise Tax Plan No. 2) Bill 2017. Labor obviously will not be supporting this bill. We have been very clear about our reasons why, but I'm very pleased to have the opportunity to articulate those further, and to perhaps give a bit of an indication from a northern Australian perspective as to why this massive cut in the corporate tax revenue for our country is not a good idea. At a time when some of our lowest-paid workers are receiving a $60 billion pay cut, it's disgusting and out of touch for the government to at the same time give their mates in big business a tax cut. Since this has been bill introduced, we on this side of the House have been very clear on where we stand-and that is, that the cost is high and the benefits are minimal. By the government's own admission, one per cent of economic growth in 20 years time is not a significant amount of growth. I think those opposite would have to agree that it's simply not a significant amount of growth, particularly considering the massive amount of revenue our country will forgo if this bill is enacted. A $2-a-day increase in wages in 20 years time is about as exciting for an Australian worker as 50c extra in their pocket. That is as a result of this new energy policy that we've been hearing about over the last 24 hours, not that we've got much detail on it, but I think any reasonable person on the opposite side would agree that it's not significant. And not that we know that it's absolutely going to happen, because there's no modelling to say how they've derived that there will be that very, very small decrease in power bills. I was glad to see Senator Dastyari today using hamburgers and soft serve ice creams to illustrate what a month of savings looks like. Mr Tim Wilson interjectingyou, member for Goldstein, for articulating what we all know to be true about this energy compromise with the member for Warringah. Mr Tim Wilson interjecting-",217,Bills
163,Mr Gosling (Solomon) (16:31,I also rise to talk about the Treasury Laws,225,Bills
164,Mr Gosling,"This government's energy plan actually looks like a cheap stunt. Thankmember for Goldstein, it would be hard not to come to that conclusion. It must be a bit difficult when you've got two prime ministers running your agenda. I think what Senator Dastyari was pointing out is that, if it is true, this saving to energy bills-which is perhaps going to happen after 2020-is not significant. I digress slightly. Government members interjectingchildren, who are 3½ and five, are out there and hope to buy their own house, they might see a $2-a-day increase, because the opposite side of politics want to give a massive corporate tax cut to their mates. So it's tiny. It's a supposed wage growth. This is at a time when we've seen a total flatline of wages growth. We're seeing falling living standards and a huge pay cut through the penalty rates decision that this government has really encouraged. It has really encouraged the Fair Work Commission to cut the wages of low-paid workers. Obviously, it is a disgrace. A little while ago, I spent some time with a young constituent of mine, Amber, who was expecting her and her partner's first child. Her take-home pay is going to be significantly reduced at a time when she has become a new mum and she's going to need every dollar in the household. She said that working on Sundays was worth it because she would actually be able to make ends meet, pay the rent, put fuel in the car and buy groceries. She recently had her first child. When I caught up with her recently, she was obviously thankful that there was a maternity leave system. What those opposite probably fail to realise-because they're becoming a bit out of touch, spending so much time with people who don't have to worry about paying the bills-is that people really struggle. So the priorities of those opposite are a bit mixed up. We can't really see what the government is doing to help address the factors that have a huge impact on working Australians, so the priority is for a tax cut for their mates, but, at the same time, they're encouraging the cutting of penalty rates for working families. So it's not only not fair; it's not smart. We all know that, with that minute increase in 20 years time in a take-home wage or in the growth of the economy-which is, as all reasonable people would have to agree, minute-you've got fewer people in society with money in their pocket to put back into the economy. So it doesn't really make a lot of sense. And the government is looking at raising income taxes on all taxpayers with incomes above $21,000. That's just dumb. It's absolutely pathetic. The government's response to flatlining wage growth and falling living standards is to give a pay cut to working families and increase income tax. These are people who have low disposable incomes and spend the majority of their wages in the economy. Those on the other side of the House will say that lower corporate tax rates are needed to attract investment, but all credible studies show that a lower tax rate is one of many features of the tax system that influence corporate behaviour. An example of another factor that influences corporate behaviour is government investment in infrastructure. The revenue we're foregoing with this corporate tax cutA division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 16:40 to 16:56",225,Bills

166,Mr Gosling,"It is like one per cent economic growth in 20 years time. So when mymany features of the tax system that influence corporate behaviour, but investment in infrastructure would be a massive incentive to improve our attractiveness as a destination for capital for investment. I think this government are just making things up when they say that the massive cuts-$65 billion worth-to corporate entities, much of which will go offshore, will result in more investment. By their own admission, there will only be a very, very small increase in take-home pay after 20 years. All these cuts do is show that the government's priorities are completely out of whack. Let's look at what they're doing at the moment. They're pursuing cuts for the top end of town through their corporate tax cuts and tax cuts for high-income earners. They are pursuing higher taxes from workers and those workers will see their take-home pay slashed. They have also shown that they have completely given up on northern Australia by decimating the NT-based Public Service and disadvantaging people who already pay a premium on goods and services due to our location. So the cost of living up in the north is high. We were all hopeful that there would be some of that investment that I just alluded to. Much fanfare was made about the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility. Two years after that scheme was announced, there still has not been one dollar provided in concessional loans to proponents who want to use the enormous potential of the north to drive productivity and drive exports, which will be good for our country. Even though we only have five per cent of the population across the north, we supply a massive amount of exports, and that adds value and wealth to our country. We could do a lot more if we had some assistance in terms of investment in infrastructure. To date, we haven't seen much at all and the chambers of commerce across the north were here last night at an event, and it is clear that they want to see a lot more than words. They want to see some action. They want to see some dollars hitting the ground in northern Australia for the good of the country, for the good of their members, obviously, and also for the good of the community. We want to drive jobs and we want to drive sustainable population growth across the north. At the moment, we have not seen one dollar out of that $5 billion infrastructure facility. On our side, we have our own priorities. We've heard a little bit about the priorities of those opposite and how misguided they are. I'm sure they know exactly what they're doing in terms of helping out their mates in big-business land with lower corporate tax rates, even if much of that is going offshore. Our priorities are supporting Australian workers in trying to drive their ability to have self-determination in their lives-not to be a drain through the welfare system but to be able to work, receive a fair day's pay for a fair day's work and support their families, like Amber and her young family that I mentioned earlier-because that's good for our country. When people are working, are happy, are supporting their families and are showing their kids a better life than they had, that is good for our nation. At the same time as these corporate tax cuts are being given out by the current Turnbull government, there's also a decimation of funding for public schools in my electorate, like Anula Primary School. But, at the same time, private schools in big, southern capitals are getting exponentially more funding from this government. Now, that is obviously not fair, but, again, it is also not smart. We know that we need to properly invest in our kids, with a great public education system and a great private education system, and we're committed to",226,Bills
167,Mr Gosling,"As I was saying, all credible studies show that a lower tax rate is one ofdoing that. We're committed to helping families meet their cost of living, which makes life pretty tough. We also need to do another couple of things, and I'll cover them quickly. We need to stop people accruing millions in tax write-offs, by capping the amount people can claim in accounting expenses. Again, it's not fair that the top end of town can work the system. The extra wealth that they get-good for them. I'm happy for them to be wealthy, but not at the expense of, for example, our public education system. This tax cut was not funded. There was no plan whatsoever to actually pay for this corporate tax cut. So, again, it's largesse; it's helping their mates in the top end of town at the expense of everyday Australians. That is what is not acceptable about this and why we do not support these corporate tax cuts. will be speaking against the Treasury Laws Amendment (Enterprise Tax Plan No. 2) Bill 2017. I wholeheartedly support the amendments moved by the member for McMahon, because the Abbott-Turnbull government has fundamentally failed to deliver any economic leadership. These changes were first flagged in last year's budget and again in this year's budget, when the Treasurer reintroduced them into parliament straight away. So here we are, in mid-October, with the government finally bringing the bill on for a debate. So much for the importance of Prime Minister Turnbull's apparent jobs and growth agenda. A hollow slogan for a hollow man. BeforeI go further, I want to deal with one of the major furphies that the Turnbull government is propagating in this debate: the claim that other countries have lower corporate tax rates and that Australia's tax rates are comparatively high-a mantra regularly spouted by the neo-cons on the other side, or the backbenchers who know no better. Sadly, too many of those opposite have drunk the top end of town's Kool-Aid for way too long-they're a little bit confused. Australia has a rate of 27.5 per cent for small and medium businesses-that is, those with turnovers of up to $10 million-and 30 per cent for other big businesses. It's important to remember that a phase down to 25 per cent is already legislated over the next 10 years for companies that have up to $50 million in turnover. The Turnbull government's argument is that tax cuts are required because Australia's corporate tax rate is too high. Let's put this to the test. Let's have a look at an analysis of this claim. We'll do our own little fact check. The US Congressional Budget Office, a non-partisan budget outfit similar to the Australian parliament's Parliamentary Budget Office, published a paper earlier this year saying that the statutory corporate tax rate is only one of the many features of a corporate tax system that influence investor behaviour. The US Congressional Budget Office paper outlined that average and effective corporate tax rates are better indicators of incentives for corporate investment than the headline rate. On the statutory corporate tax rate, Australia's 30 per cent tax rate ranks as 10th. On the average corporate tax rate, Australia rates 15th, the fourthlowest in the G20. On the effective corporate tax rate, we're ranked 11th. On the statutory corporate tax rate, we're 10th, which is competitive with most of the G20 nations, but when you look at the average we're ranked 15th, and on the effective we're ranked 11th. This means that our average and effective corporate tax rates are average or below average when compared with the other G20 countries. That is a relevant comparison because, obviously, the G20 countries make up the world's 20 largest economies.",227,Bills
168,Mr Perrett (Moreton,"Opposition Whip) (17:03): Like the member for Solomon, IDon't forget, Mr Deputy Speaker Howarth, as many do on the opposite side, that we have dividend imputation, which means that we essentially refund our corporate tax to our domestic investors, something which is quite unique around the world and often gets lost in this debate. If we're going to compare our tax rate internationally, let's have a proper debate. Let's compare our corporate tax rates on a proper basis-on average and effective rates-with our competitors around the world. When the Turnbull government tells you that Australia's corporate tax rate is uncompetitive, remember the facts; that is not the case. It is certainly true that Paul Keating took the approach of lowering the tax rates. However, he only did that by broadening the base. The tax changes were funded in another way. Despite the stern opposition of the Liberal and National parties of the day, Mr Keating, as Treasurer and Prime Minister, brought in lasting reforms, including capital gains tax, fringe benefits tax and an assets test. He made difficult decisions and then had to retail them to the Australian public to ensure that the Australian tax base was broader. What does that mean? It means that our social safety net is better able to target and help most Australians. Labor tax policies always have fairness at their core, not greed. Sadly, those opposite have fallen for the misinformation being peddled from the top end of town. What has the Labor Party done from opposition? Under the member for McMahon, we've seen some tough decisions, such as those about negative gearing, trusts and deductions for managing tax affairs. Labor and the opposition leader Bill Shorten understand that it is only through proper base broadening that you earn the right to have conversations about expenditure or lower company tax rates. The Abbott-Turnbull government has not earned that right. Here we are in their fifth year of government. The coalition has been unable to make any tough decisions on fiscal policy in Australia, so Labor will oppose this part of the government's $65.4 billion tax cut for big business. We've always opposed such significant structural deteriorations to the budget over the medium term that do nothing to broaden the tax base. In the current fiscal and economic climate, it is not appropriate. The Labor Party has been clear in highlighting the minimal economic benefits of these business tax cuts. We're heading for one per cent growth in 20 years time-perhaps. This has come at a time when wages growth is stagnant-and, for some people, it is going backwards-and the effective tax rate for some members of society, especially the lower wage earners, is going backwards. At the same time, corporate profits for CEOs are soaring. This huge hit to the budget shows the rank hypocrisy of a government that lectures the Australian people about the need for budget repair. I remember when those in the government used to talk about a debt and deficit disaster and a budget emergency. I think there was a truck circling Parliament House; there was a truck circling the country. Yet, on the Liberal and National Party's watch, what has happened? Mr Dick interjectingfrom my neighbour, the member for Oxley. The deficit has blown out. Debt has crashed past the half a trillion dollar mark-a nightmare for our grandchildren and their children. And who will bear the brunt of this tax cut for big businesses that those opposite are championing? Everyday working families will, through income tax increases. The independent Parliamentary Budget Office put out a report a few months ago stating:",228,Bills
169,Mr Perrett,"Has the deficit blown out? It has blown out-and I'll take that interjectionPersonal income tax receipts are projected by the PBO to increase by 1.6 per cent of GDP over the medium term, from 11.1 per cent of GDP in 2016-17 to 12.6 per cent of GDP in 2027-28 (Figure 1). Once the tax 'cap' is reached, personal income tax receipts are projected by the PBO to continue to rise as a per cent of GDP as company tax receipts decline from 2023-24 as a result of the Government's Enterprise Tax Plan. The PBO projects that the average tax rate on personal income will rise from 22.7 per cent in 2016-17 to 25.9 per cent in 2027-28. In 2023-24-not that far away-people in my electorate of Moreton, in the member for Oxley's electorate and in the whip's electorate will see personal income tax at 12.4 per cent of GDP, while company tax will be at 4.5 per cent of GDP. By 2027-28, personal income tax will be 12.6 per cent of GDP, while company tax will have gone down to 4.2 per cent of GDP. Under the harbourside mansion tax plan, the Australian worker will have to do even more heavy lifting, from 12.4 per cent to 12.6 per cent of GDP, while the CEO battlersthose battlers at the top end of town-what will they be doing for Australian society? Their tax rate will be going down, from 4.5 per cent to 4.2 per cent of GDP. From 2023-24 through to 2027-28, when the company tax rate is supposed to decrease to 25 per cent for all companies, personal income tax will rise by 0.2 per cent of GDP at the same time as company tax decreases by 0.3 percentage points. It's clear that lowand middle-income Australians are paying for the government's $65-billion handout to big business through rising personal income taxes. What does this mean for the mums and dads and the working young? It means that the chefs from Sunnybank are going to be doing more. It means that the motor mechanics from Moorooka will have to do more. It means that the rockmelon stackers from Rocklea will have to do more. Lowand middle-income Australians will have to do more while CEOs pay less. Earlier this month, this was again confirmed by the PBO-an independent body, trusted by both sides of parliament, set up by Peter Costello-when it said: In addition to the effect of nominal income growth, average tax rates are projected to increase due to policy changes, most notably the policy decision to increase the Medicare Levy from 2019-20. Australian workers and their families are facing a cruel and nasty cocktail of stalled wage growth, record unemployment, increased costs of living and rising electricity prices, all on the Abbott-Turnbull government's watch. And all the government has to offer is the Prime Minister telling us this week that power bills might-might!-fall by 50 cents per week in three years time. We've got a climate of fear and uncertainty. We know that fear and uncertainty in the market are infectious and spreading, and what does the government offer us? 50 cents. Inequality in this country is getting worse. That is a fact. And yet the Liberal Party and the National Party are still pushing the failed trickle-down economics of tax cuts for big business and the wealthy few, which more and more economists are saying does not work. It is not good for growth. Read Wayne Swan's book on this topic if you need to understand it more. Mr Rick Wilson interjectingReal wages for the top 10 per cent of income earners have grown by 72 per cent over the last four decades, more than three times the rate of increase in real wages for the bottom 10 per cent of income earners. I hear the member for O'Connor laughing opposite. You know where this is felt most? In the bush. In the middle of Perth it might be a different experience, but in the bush it's particularly exacerbated. The latest GDP figures show that 51.5 per cent of income went to employees. This is the lowest percentage since September 1964. Over the past four years, labour productivity has risen by nearly six per cent. Normally, if labour productivity is on the increase, what happens? Normally, wages go up. But we've seen real wages actually fall by 0.6 per cent, and the wealth gap continues to widen. In 2014, households in the top 20 per cent owned 62 per cent of the wealth, while the bottom 20 per cent owned less than one per cent. Home ownership rates are at a six-decade low. This week, National Anti-Poverty Week, we've heard from the Australian Council of Social Services that they estimate over three million Australians are living in poverty. Governments are all about choices. Their policies can either fight inequality or entrench inequality. The Turnbull government is entrenching inequality. Election results have consequences and, so far, since the coalition came to office, they have proposed slowing the rate of pension increases, cutting the income support bonus, removing consumer protections from financial advice and giving a tax cut to people who already enjoy million-dollar incomes. They've launched a relentless attack on working people. We've seen wage growth stall. We've seen penalty rates slashed on their watch. We've seen them impose tax increases on the bottom 80 per cent of the workforce. They've attacked unions and workplaces by launching a politically motivated royal commission. They've established the ABCC and the Registered Organisations Commission. We know that unions are the scapegoat-but I'm going to say the 'escape goat'. It's what they go to when they want to sacrifice something to their neoconservative volcanoes. These measures are all about shifting the balance of power in workplace relations, allowing unscrupulous employers to engage in practices that avoid fair work obligations, such as sham contracts and dodgy labour-hire companies. Enterprise bargaining agreements, when they have ended, are becoming bargaining weapons, like we're seeing with the Streets Ice Cream workers at the moment. Inequality is about fairness, and this Turnbull government is unfair. They're entrenching inequality in this country and we deserve better. The Turnbull government could use its power to fight inequality. Budgets are all about priorities, and this government, quite simply, has them wrong. The 'harbour-side mansion' budgets have delivered big-business tax cuts and high-income earners getting a tax cut. Workers above $21,000 are getting increased taxes and penalty rates are being cut. The Turnbull government's priority will always be to look after the top end of town: the big corporations, the conglomerates, the millionaires and the billionaires. There is no other way to interpret a budget that is so fundamentally unfair to ordinary working Australians. Labor understands that inequality is an impediment to economic progress and community happiness. We have our priorities, ensuring that we deal with inequality in this country. Obviously, this means properly funding our schools. This means proper investments in infrastructure. This means a fairer tax system and further dealing with superannuation tax concessions. It means levelling the playing field for first-home buyers and capping the deductions people can obtain for managing their tax affairs. And it involves our plan to impose a 30 per cent tax on discretionary trusts. Dealing with inequality means providing more affordable housing so Australians can live close to where they work. To tackle inequality, this country needs a brave government. It needs a country with a brave heart, not a small heart. speak in this debate of the Treasury Laws Amendment (Enterprise Tax Plan No. 2) Bill 2017. Just in case I don't get to it, I should declare from the outset that we will oppose this bill. We will do this on the basis that this bill stands as a savage attack by this government on Australian families and their households. I've spoken on many occasions about my electorate. My electorate is the most multicultural electorate in the country. It's very colourful, very diverse and one that lives in harmony. I have the lion's share of refugees coming into the country. I get to see their aims and their dreams for their families, particularly their children. By the way, that's why education is so significant in my community. But my community is not a rich community. It has many, many social challenges. Issues of housing are certainly impacting on my community. The average household income in my community is under $60,000 a year. So, as I say, it is not a rich community. I believe that what the government proposes in this piece of legislation is only going to exacerbate the emerging inequities that we are seeing in our communities. And that's not just my community. I think if you took a broad snapshot of all those represented in this place, they would find that they, too, are presiding over an emerging position where, regrettably, we are moving to increase the level of inequity applying in our communities. We're told this is all about budget repair. Clearly, budgets need to be addressed, and my friend-what's your seat, Graham? Mr Perrett: Moreton. leading up to the last election-a debt-and-deficit disaster. He spoke about the issue about budget emergency-a deficit that we see has not only blown out but the debt has crashed now past the half a trillion dollar mark under this government's watch. You can't make an argument for the Australian people, get a mandate to be in government-even though it's by one seat-on the basis that you're going to do something about addressing the budget emergency or this debt-and-deficit disaster. The thing that you want, most of all, in coming to government, is to give big business, multinational companies-including the four big banks that probably should be subject to a royal commission, given the fact that they presided over 50,000-odd instances of money laundering in the case of one bank alone-a $65 billion tax reduction. From my perspective, I think this is going to lead to a structural deterioration in the budget over the medium-term. Certainly you've got to think about how, not in a plain economic sense, this is now being received in local communities-communities that, like mine, aren't rich; communities that do need family assistance; communities that do, regrettably, have high levels of unemployment; and communities that are trying to get their head above water, trying to use the TAFE or the education system to facilitate their job readiness. All those things have been impacted by this government's recent budget, and yet this is all being set aside, effectively, for a $65 billion tax break for big business. When this was being prosecuted-and Madam Deputy Speaker, you'll recall the shenanigans that occur from time to time in question time-and you think about the questions that were asked in the lead-up to: 'How much is the government's giveaway to big business going to cost?', one answer that was given was $24 million. Another answer that was given-I think by the Prime Minister-was $26 billion. We got to $50 billion. Then it was back to",229,Bills
170,Mr Hayes (Fowler,"Chief Opposition Whip) (17:18): I, like my colleagues, rise to",232,Bills
171,Mr Hayes,"My friend from Moreton has spoken about what we heard a lot about$36.5 billion. Ultimately, the Treasurer had to concede that the real cost over the mediumterm of the tax cut for big business would be $65.4 billion. I think we were a little surprised about that. And, no doubt, our colleagues on the other side of the House were probably similarly concerned because they probably didn't know what they were signing up to when they made all these grandiose plans at the last election. Similarly, colleagues from the other side used to tell me they didn't know what they were signing up to when John Howard brought Work Choices in-a piece of legislation that made it legal for the very first time in this country to pay workers below the award rate of pay. And colleagues from the other side thought that it was just the Labor team acting up and protecting trade unions, and they never believed what we were saying until the legislation was enacted. John Howard, the then-Prime Minister, had control of both the House and the Senate, and enacted the legislation. Mr Perrett: Because of Barnaby Joyce. below the award rates of pay. Not that we want to digress into a political history of this, but when Labor came to power in 2007 it wasn't just the traditional Labor voters that rallied behind Labor. Let me tell you, when I did railway stations, as everyone does, and street meetings, it wasn't only the mums and dads but the grandparents coming along and saying, 'We never thought this would happen.' It was their fear at what was being delivered, or what was going to be imposed upon their children and their grandchildren, which certainly corralled people to think that the only people who were going to stand up for them and for their future was a future Labor government. I'm not trying to give a lesson on this, but maybe it's food for thought for those on the other side. Perhaps you should think about what a $65 billion tax cut for big business really does mean when you want to put it in terms of who is going to pay for it. What about the families? What's going to be the respective position? What services are you going to cut? This is all based on the assumption that there's trickle-down economics-if we give big business a tax cut, that will flow off to their workers. I don't know about you, Madam Deputy Speaker, but I don't really subscribe to the 'pigs might fly' concept. I know many of my colleagues were at a seminar early this morning by Catholic Social Services Australia. There was a launch of a new publication entitled, An economy that works for all. The introduction was delivered by someone whom I think we all know very wellFather Frank Brennan, who is the CEO of Catholic Social Services. This publication is part of the Catholic Social Justice Series. Regrettably, I haven't read it all yet. But there were a few things I was able to pick out, only because it dealt with trickle-down economics, of all things. It cites from the 2007 social justice statement entitled, Everyone's business: Developing an inclusive and sustainable economy. That was a paper by the Australian Catholic bishops. It focuses on not only the distribution of wealth but its creation and how it is used. It's all about issues of social inclusion and ensuring that people's positions aren't being exacerbated by the way we distribute wealth in our economy. In that, the Australian bishops agreed with the remarks of Pope Francis when he said this: 'Trickle-down theories, which assume the economic growth encouraged by a free market will invariably succeed in bringing about greater justice and inclusion in the world, have not been proved.' I think that's the argument we've been trying to make for some time. This theory that big business, by a tax reduction, are going to turn that into higher wages for their people and are going to distribute the wealth throughout their workforce is, as I say, up there with the theory that pigs might fly.",232,Bills
172,Mr Hayes,"Yes-and what they did, at a corporation level, was start to pay peopleHopefully, most people will see that this is certainly a misplaced priority by this government. Simply hoping in the belief that, for instance, the big four banks are going to see the error of their ways and just pass this onto their account holders-it's not something that shows us as being of sound mind when we're considering the general application for economics in this country. The whole basis of the government's position is: multinational companies-big businesspay too much tax, people earning under $87,000 don't pay enough tax and, besides that, people who work on Sundays and public holidays get paid too much. You can't have it all ways. You can't then decide that the remedy for our economy is: put it in the hands of big business and give them the tax cuts in the blind belief that they're going to actually distribute wealth to shareholders, workers and bank account customers. It's certainly taking a lot of it on trust. I would have thought that many on the other side of the House probably winced when they actually heard the real figures that have now been confirmed by the Treasurer-as being a $65 billion cut. That is what the cut is really going to cost the economy. Let me put this in some perspective. We've had a big argument, as you'll no doubt recall, Madam Deputy Speaker, about the amount of cuts occurring to schools-$17 billion. There are cuts to universities of $3.8 billion. There are cuts to TAFE and vocational education of $657 million. These cuts have all been made to help sustain this tax cut for big business. But, when you add to that the cuts that have occurred in respect of family payments and age pensioners and the government making it more difficult for people to get the disability support pension, you can see that those at the lower end of the spectrum, the most vulnerable in our community, have been singled out to do the heavy lifting for this tax cut. This is all in the guise of budget repair. That is how the government is backing it in. This is not the right course that we should be adopting. It's certainly not what you would think the priority should be for this government. We know we've got issues that we need to address, but taking money off schools-$17 billion-and taking money out of universities? The best thing we can possibly do is invest in our future. The future is our children. They are going to go on to run this place and look after us and everything else in the process. The future starts with a good education. We have moved aside from that and said, 'We need to make cuts there.' That's not terribly business like. These are direct cuts that are going to impact on our future-our economic future, our competitiveness in the world, as a producer, and what we need to do as part of the emerging smart economy. We have moved to cut in that direction. It just shows that this government's priorities are all wrong. What do we really aim to get out of this staggering thing? I'm sure this got raised in the party room somewhere along the line. There is minimal growth opportunity for us through these tax cuts to big business. In fact, it is one per cent over 20 years. Would you believe that that equates to about a $2 a day increase in wages in 20 years time? Therefore this is not something that's going to net a huge change in corporate behaviour. It's not going to net a change in the way corporations do business. And yet this government has bet the farm on this notion of trickle-down economics. We expect more from those who occupy the government benches. They need to ensure that a sustainable approach is taken when we address the long term aspects of budgets. I take you back to what Pope Francis said-that trickle-down theories in economics have not been proven. We have taken on something which just does not seem to make sense. It certainly doesn't apply in any other economic area. This government has bet the farm on this, and it is certainly not in a position where any credible economist will come out and say it has done the right thing. (Time expired) spoken in respect of the Treasury Laws Amendment (Enterprise Tax Plan No. 2) Bill 2017 thus far. Just as I was about to walk into the chamber to speak on this matter, I came acrosssitting on the top of a pile of my papers-an article that was published earlier this year. I want to quote it, because it is so relevant to what we are speaking about. It is an article written by an economics correspondent, Eryk Bagshaw, on 28 February this year: Company profits have surged to record highs at the same time wages suffered their sharpest decline in eight years, new figures show, as the Turnbull government prepares to argue the case on Tuesday for a $50 billion company tax cut. The three months to December 2016 saw a 20 per cent jump in profits, while wages fell 0.5 per cent the largest decline since mid-2009, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics Wage Price Index. Over the course of 2016, company profits rose 26 per cent. The opening statement of that commentary sums up what this is all about and why it is so wrong. The $50 billion figure that was used in the article at the time has since changed, because of the government's budget measures in 2017, but the principle and the essence of what was being said remains true. We have a situation where company profits are at record highs. Wages have literally stagnated, and yet the government is saying the companies need to be given a tax break. It simply doesn't make sense. And no rational person out there in the community will buy the government's argument that these tax cuts are necessary to stimulate the economy. It won't work because-as the member for Fowler has just made clear-trickle-down economics has proven to be an absolute nonsense. The only beneficiaries of trickle-down economics are the CEOs, and maybe some of the senior employees of companies, who are paid millions of dollars and whose income has increased over the last decade or so by millions of dollars each year-but certainly none of the broader based employees of those companies. The facts speak for themselves. Mr Deputy Speaker, I'm sure you're aware of CEOs that I'm referring to who are now being paid, in one case, tens of millions of dollars for their service, while the rest of the employees are lucky to get the minimum wage or so. With this legislation, the simple message that goes out to the community is this: at a time when housing affordability is at a crisis, when wages growth is non-existent, when penalty rates are being cut, when higher education costs are increasing, when pensioners are being squeezed of every last dollar that they have and when we have an NDIS system that the government are struggling to fund, which helps some of the most vulnerable people in the community-at a time when the government can't help those people in desperate need, they are saying to the Australian public: 'We can help big corporations that are making some of their highest profits in many, many years.' Indeed, in this legislation there will be an extra $36.5 billion of tax cuts for big business over the years ahead. We are talking in this case about big business. This is no longer the argument about the small mum-and-dad business. These are businesses that turn over $50 million a year or more. No-one can sincerely say that these are small, struggling businesses. When a business is turning over $50 million, it's a pretty big business in anyone's language. What is even worse about this legislation is that, when the tax cuts are granted to these companies, most of the",233,Bills
173,Mr Zappia (Makin) (17:34,"I endorse the comments of all my colleagues who havemoney is very likely to go to shareholders who live overseas or who invest overseas. That's where most of the money will go. It won't even go back-putting aside the trickle-down economics-into Australian businesses or Australian homes that might in turn spend some of it in their own communities and therefore stimulate their local economies, and the country for that matter. It's very likely that most of the money will go offshore, and the statistics will just highlight that that is going to be the case. Just as concerningly-I think it was only about a year ago-we saw reports from the taxation department about companies not paying tax in this country. And we saw that there were, I think, one in three companies in Australia that didn't pay tax. Again, these are large companies. One in three, roughly 33 per cent, was the figure for 2014-15. My understanding is that for the previous year, 38 per cent of those companies didn't pay tax. The government are saying that they want to offer a tax cut to a group of companies who, in many cases, are not paying tax in the first place. We're talking about companies that are either public or foreign with an income of $100 million or more, or private companies with a turnover of $200-plus million. These are the kinds of companies that are not paying their tax-1,904 of them. Putting all that aside, as everyone knows, most companies and certainly any company that has a $50 million a year turnover would employ accountants-people who are smart at knowing how to manage the finances of the business they've been employed to look after. Those companies, quite legitimately and legally, find all kinds of ways to minimise their tax obligations. So the truth of the matter is that, whilst we might have a headline rate of around 30 per cent for companies right now, it's not surprising that in 2012-and that was the last year I was able to get the figures-the companies were paying a company rate of 17 per cent and an effective tax rate of only 10.4 per cent. We talk of companies supposedly paying 30 per cent, but in reality the average tax rate for 2012 was 17 per cent and the effective rate was only 10.4 per cent. That's what they paid, so let's get real about what companies are contributing to the economy and to the taxation revenue of the country. Amongst those companies are some of the biggest income earners in this country. In recent years, we've seen the profits made by the four major banks. In the first half of this financial year, 2016-17, the four major banks have already made $15.6 billion in profit. Yes, they pay tax-I do not dispute that for a moment-but do they really need a tax cut in order for them to grow when they have made $15 billion profit already? If they do get a tax cut-and that will add to their profit-will they really use it to employ more people, improve their services or perhaps establish more branches around Australia? In the very years that they've been making these excessive profits, we have seen them do the exact opposite. I'm not at all convinced that these tax cuts will be used in a way that will benefit the broader Australian community by stimulating the economy, creating more employment and the like. The truth of the matter is that these tax cuts are also driven by government ideology. Yes, budgets are about priorities, and we accept that, but they're also about ideology. The coalition government is driven by ideology rather than common sense and fairness when it comes to this matter. It has a budget that is already in crisis. Last year the deficit was $38 billion. This year the deficit is anticipated to hit nearly $30 billion. We have a national debt that's now topped half a trillion dollars. With all of those debts hanging over the government and the difficulty in getting its books in order, the Turnbull coalition government are saying to the Australian people, 'We have a budget in crisis, but we can afford to give $65 billion to big business'-and, in this case, specifically, $35 billion to businesses that have a turnover of $50 million or more. And it does this at a time when the government has taken an absolutely disgraceful stand on some matters. Firstly, with respect to penalty rates, not once did it stand up for some of the lowest paid people in the country. Perhaps somewhere between 650,000 and 700,000 people will be affected and worse off, in some cases to the tune of $6,600 a year, because of cuts; people who are already on the lowest levels of income. Not once has the government stood up for those people, nor did it stand up for the people on the minimum weekly wage in this country when that matter went to the courts for consideration. This government shows no compassion and no concern for the people who need government support the most, yet it is prepared to stand up and support the people and the companies that don't need a government handout or government support in any way. We have seen that time and time again, regardless of whether it's to do with the shipping legislation, the minimum wage, penalty rates, the 457 visas or any industrial relations matter. We even saw it yesterday when we were debating the industrial chemicals legislation in this place. The government only hears the voice of big business, and no-one else. Whatever big business wants, this government thinks that's the right way to go. That is shameful and it should not be the case, particularly when, in many cases, those very big businesses that the government purports to support do not even have their bases here in Australia and do not make a full contribution to this country in the way they could and should. I'm going to finish on a couple of other matters that are pertinent to my home state. Again, at a time when we have this government saying that it wants to give billions of dollars of tax cuts to big business, we have agricultural growers in my region who are simply asking for a pittance in comparison to what is being proposed here to support their industry. A year ago we had floods in the northern plains. As a result of those floods, some 50 different producers were directly affected and in most cases lost all of their produce. Their losses amounted to about $150 million. For them, that was all their income for the year. They've asked for some money to build levee banks along the Gawler River-which flows through their propertieswhich will, if there is a future flood, prevent them from losing their crops. The state government has come on board with $9 million. The local councils-because there's a group of councils-have come on board with $9 million and are asking for $9 million from the federal government. That's all they're asking for-$9 million. When you compare that with the money that is being sought here, you can appreciate that it really is a drop in the bucket. The Prime Minister went out and saw those flooded farms a year or so ago, but he never got back to them and has never offered anything to them. That's a classic case of the government simply not hearing, not listening and not caring about people who really need some help and who are asking for something that is not unreasonable. Lastly, on Friday, we will see Holden close its doors in the northern region of Adelaidean industry that has been producing cars in this country for 69 years. Holden has become an iconic motor vehicle for Australians, and, for the region that I represent and which the member for Wakefield represents, it has been the foundation of the economy. It underpins the economy and has done so for the last 50 years or so. This government could not find the money to support this industry, which generated more tax revenue for the government than it was being asked to provide and which created thousands of jobs for the region, but it can afford, and can find the money, to support big businesses that don't need that support-which is absolutely disgraceful. That has resulted in the loss of tens of thousands of jobs across Australia. It just shows the foolish priorities of this government, the heartless attitude of this government and, quite frankly, the stupidity of this government in cutting off an industry sector that was returning more money to it than it was costing it. Ms MACKLIN (Jagajaga) (17:48): I'm very pleased to follow the member for Makin and to support his remarks in relation to the devastating impact that the closure of the car industry will have, particularly on the livelihoods of individuals and families in the northern suburbs of Adelaide. It's going to be a very, very hard time. How this government can continue to ignore the needs of people in this part of Adelaide absolutely astounds me. They should hang their heads in shame. If you were looking for a piece of legislation that really summed up the approach of the conservatives, you'd have to say that this legislation that we're debating here tonight sums it up. This really is it. The Treasury Laws Amendment (Enterprise Tax Plan No. 2) Bill 2017 really displays all the twisted priorities of this government: trickle-down economics writ large, tax cuts for multinationals and big business, a $65 billion tax cut for big business. I might remind the government, who like to go on about the size of the deficit-or, anyway, they used to -that this $65 billion tax cut for big business is, of course, totally and completely unfunded. This conservative government thinks that big multinational corporations pay too much tax. That's their view. But they also think that ordinary Australian workers-like the people the member for Makin was just talking about-earning less than $87,000 a year should pay more tax. These are the priorities of those opposite-that multinational corporations and the banks should pay less tax and low-income workers should pay more tax. That sums up this Liberal National Party government. At the same time, we have low-income workers who work on the weekends who are going to have their penalty rates cut. This government has done nothing to stop that happening. How on earth can that be fair? How can it be fair that big companies in this country get a tax cut, low-income workers get a tax increase and a whole lot of other people who have to work on the weekends lose their penalty rates? If you are a big business, you will get a tax cut. It is one rule for the rich and powerful in this country and, of course, a very, very different rule for low-income workers. More than anything else, it really does demonstrate just how out of touch this Prime Minister is. It also shows the rank hypocrisy of this government when it comes to budget repair. We get lectured every day by the Treasurer about the need for budget repair. It started when they came into government a few years ago. They said that we had a budget emergency. You never hear that anymore because, of course, under their watch the deficit has blown out. One of the reasons it's blowing out is they want to spend $65 billion on a huge tax cut to big business. We will not support this part of the government's $65 billion tax cut. We don't think it's fair. We actually think that big business and the banks need to pay their fair share of tax. I just want to remind everyone about an incident in question time earlier in the year that really demonstrated how much this government wanted to hide the cost of this tax cut. People on the Labor side will of course remember this, and I suspect the Treasurer will too, because it was very embarrassing. We asked a simple question of the Prime Minister: what is the cost of the full company tax rate plan? You might remember that we got a whole range of answers that day. First it was $24 billion. Then it was $26 billion. Then it was $50 billion. When asked again to confirm it, the Prime Minister flicked it to the Treasurer-a hospital handpass if ever I've seen one. At first, the Treasurer said it was $36½ billion. Then, a little later in question time, he'd obviously thought better of that answer and came back and said $65.4 billion. In the space of question time, the company tax cuts had gotten more expensive, to the tune of $15 billion. What a farce. Honestly, you wouldn't trust this lot opposite with a $20 note. Let's be very, very clear: all the evidence from the last three decades, during which it has been implemented by conservative governments across the world, is that trickle-down economics doesn't work. Trickle-down economics has been a failure. Government members interjectingMs MACKLIN: Get up and defend it. Tell us what happened when Margaret Thatcher tried it and Ronald Reagan tried it. What we've actually seenGovernment members interjectingMs MACKLIN: Funnily enough, the International Monetary Fund doesn't agree with you. We wouldn't want to take any notice of them! You, of course, know better than the International Monetary Fund! You know better than the OECD! Well, actually, these big international organisations are making it absolutely clear that trickle-down economics does not work. We've seen workers' wagesyou know that using the word 'you' is reflecting on the chair. Ms MACKLIN: That's very kind of you, member for Swan, to remind me of this. We around the world have seen workers' wages stagnate-all of us. Even those opposite who want to ignore what's happening to wages, we're seeing wages stagnate while the profits of big companies have soared. We're seeing the casualisation of the workforce. Too many young people are stuck in part-time and insecure work. While this is happening in our economy and society, we're seeing tax cuts from this conservative government and cuts to social services for the most vulnerable people in our country. Let's think very carefully about the supposed economic benefits of this proposed company tax cut. The government itself has admitted it will deliver just one per cent of economic growth in 20 years time. I don't think the current Prime Minister will be here in 20 years time to see the impact. It would deliver a $2 a day increase in wages in 20 years time. This is at the time when wages growth has flatlined. We're seeing economic data released recently showing that living standards are going backwards. We on this side do, of course, have very strong concerns about what's happening with wages growth. The diminished bargaining power of workers and unions has played a key role in stagnant wages growth and rising inequality. And, of course, the scorched earth approach that those opposite tried in their 2014 budget, a budget that targeted so many vulnerable Australians-that budget really did, of course, try to rip up Australia's social security system. The government have no real answers to the big problems that need to be addressed in our economy. Their only answer is to hand out $65 billion for big business. I do want to address one of the criticisms made by those opposite about our position on this issue. They like to go on that we only make these criticisms because of some kind of politics of envy or some kind of class war. But this is an extraordinarily outdated and dishonest notion-that the only way",235,Bills
174,The Deputy Speaker ( Mr Irons,"Member for Jagajaga, as an experienced member,for Australia to grow and prosper is to give the biggest tax breaks to those who need them least. That really is the view of those opposite. It is a vision for a less fair, less prosperous and more divided Australia. Now, that's not the Australia that I know. The Australia that I know deeply values fairness. We are a kind and compassionate country. The proposed company tax cut will damage that. It will damage that kindness and compassion for our fellow human beings and it will badly damage our budget. What we actually need right now is fairer growth-growth that is all about increasing employment, investing in our people and making it clear that if you work hard in Australia you'll be rewarded, but if you do fall on hard times you'll get help. From our point of view, in Australia you're never on your own. And that is why Labor will oppose this bill. situation where recently-on 10 October this year-the government borrowed, according to the Australian Office of Financial Management, $150 million in one day, repayable in 2040. That's one for the grandchildren, because of the government's failure to manage their debt and deficit. When we left office in September 2013, we faced the debt trucks of the then opposition leader, the member for Warringah-and we faced the member for Wentworthsaying that a $300 million debt projection was absolutely gigantic, and a debt-and-deficit disaster. Well, the budget figures clearly show that since September 2013, when the Labor government lost office, government debt has risen by $231 billion to now be $504 billion. According to the Australian Office of Financial Management, they're not going to start paying off some of these borrowings until 2040. Just last week, the Australian Taxation Office revealed-whilst they patted themselves on the back for clawing back $1 billion from multinationals in corporate Australia-that $3.5 billion in tax revenue had been lost by multinationals engaged in tax evasion. Now, $3.5 billion could do a lot. But the government now feels that it can afford to give away $65 billion to corporate Australia. Most of those who will benefit will be the big multinational companies, including the big banks. Their dividends will be imputed-and most of their shareholders are big corporates overseas. So Australians won't benefit; even of the corporate shareholders, very few will benefit. But if Thatcherism and Reaganism showed one thing, across the 1980s, it is that budget deficits blow out, and budget debts blow out. In fact, society has become more unequal. That's what happened under Thatcher's UK and Reagan's USA. This government feels that we're going to follow the failed policies of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan-trickle-down economics-which will result in greater inequality in our country. This is at a time when disposable income is just $29,640 per household-below the 2013 level of $31,650. Annual wages growth at 1.9 per cent is the lowest rate ever recorded. The proportion of the Australian total income to GDP-wages are now the lowest since records began in 1959. In fact, the situation is that the decline in terms of household income over the last six months for the nation was a staggering $20.4 billion-the steepest percentage drop since the 2002 recession. For the 10th time recently, jobless figures in this country revealed that over 700,000 people-currently 725,000-are unemployed. The last time that happened was before the coalition was elected in 2013: Deputy Speaker, guess when it was: it was in 1997. So at a time of economic growth in the country but with stagnant wages growth, rising inequality, household consumption down and household income down, the government",239,Bills
175,Mr Neumann (Blair) (17:59,"This is an astonishing piece of legislation. This is afeels-at a time when profits have gone up by nearly 40 per cent per annum, but wages have remained stagnant at about 1.9 per cent-that they can afford to give more money to large companies, mainly multinationals, to benefit those companies and their shareholdersoverseas shareholders-and Australian households will suffer. The coalition and the conservatives never learn. They seem ideologically obsessed with Thatcher and Reagan and do not understand economics at all. In fact, we get lectures in question time about economics and engineering, but they don't seem to understand anything about economics. Why pursue failed policies? Why pursue them at all? We've got a situation where this government's got a structural deficit. It is really important to understand this-I see the member for Fisher smiling. The Abbott-Turnbull government added $231.9 billion in gross borrowings in a matter of 48 months. That's $4.83 billion per month during the strongest global recovery since the 1950s. In the last financial year, 201617, the coalition government added $6.71 billion in borrowings per month. And they've got the nerve to lecture us! What a hide this mob have! It's extraordinary that they would lecture Labor in relation to this. But, at the same time, they are prepared to give $65.4 billion in tax cuts to corporate Australia and $16,000 a year in tax cuts to millionaires. At the same time as households are doing it tough, at the same time that disposable income is the lowest it's been for some considerable period of time, they want to increase the tax on those persons with income above $21,000 a year. The inequity is rank. The hypocrisy is extraordinary. As many of my colleagues have pointed out, the figures are quite clear. The government says we're out of touch with the world in terms of our corporate tax rate, but that's not true. The figures are crystal clear, and many of my colleagues have referred to them. In the past, the US Congressional Budget Office said that the headline rate might be 30 per cent in terms of the corporate tax rate in 2012. The average rate in Australia is 17 per cent, so the effective tax rate is 10.4 per cent. AndI mentioned dividend imputation before. That's one of Labor's greatest economic reforms. But the truth of the matter is, this government is committed to an ideological pursuit here. This is an absolute special from those opposite: big business and high-income earners-millionaires-get tax cuts, but anyone earning above $21,000 per annum gets a tax hike. This is all at a time when, from the middle of this year, 700,000 Australians face penaltyrate cuts. The hypocrisy and inconsistency of the government's position is extraordinary. They give us lectures about energy reliability and affordability, but they oppose the supplement of $365 for pensioners and $550 for pensioner couples which is designed to assist them with their energy needs. They want to get rid of it; that's their policy. And, at the same time, they say to us, 'If our policy's accepted and you give us bipartisan support, some might be about $100 per annum better off in 2030.' That's a couple of dollars a week. Even on these particular government figures, the people are only going to be better off by a couple of dollars in a decade. So where's the benefit of this particular corporate tax cut they're giving? It's not there. I think government budgets, just like budgets in the household, reveal people's values, their ethics and their priorities. RecentlyI met with Geraldine Mackenzie, the new USQ vicechancellor, and Ian Hawke, the director of advancement in the Office of the Vice-Chancellor at USQ, in my electorate. That's a great university, but the government wants to slash funding for universities. This is a regional university that's hit its Bradley target with respect to lowsocioeconomic students-for many students, it's the first time anyone in their family has ever gone to university. This is a university with campuses in Ipswich and Springfield in my electorate. But what is this government doing? It's cutting $3.8 billion of funding to universities in the higher education sector. Ian Hawke says: 'Clearly, the decline in funding means Australian students will be paying more for potentially a lower-quality experience. And, of course, the further risk is an international student market thinking Australia is a poorer-quality proposition because the government has reduced its commitment, and the uncertainty is destabilising.' They can't find the money for the university sector, but they can give the money to multinationals? It's a warped sense of priorities. They've taken $637 million out of TAFE training and apprenticeships, cut $2.5 billion out of skills training, and they've cut $17 billion out of needs-based funding for schools. But they do this all in the context of giving back $65 billion in tax cuts for big business. It does not make sense. If we want future growth and productivity and to make sure we're an economy that can compete in Asia, we're not going to do it by slashing penalty rates. We're not going to do it by slashing wages and salaries in this country. We're going to do it by the ingenuity, creativity and skills of our people. Investing in TAFE, in higher education, in the tertiary sector and in our schools is the way to go. Don't give a tax cut to multinational companies; invest the money in education. Because, long-term, that is better in terms of productivity and economic growth. And with economic growth will come social justice and equality of opportunity. It'll give a fair go, and Australia will have both a productive and growing economy and a strong and prosperous future, with an equal say for people from all backgrounds. It will be an equal society. There'll be greater equity in the economy and our society. We've had 130,000 people employed in our university sector, and I'd like to see more people employed. It supports another 40,000 jobs. I'd like to see our universities be cathedrals of learning. I'd like to see our schools as palaces of education. I'd like to see our preschoolsour kindies-as places where kids can come and learn as best they can, with teachers who are best trained to care for them, who want their advancement in life. Education is the great equaliser in society. But the government thinks the great equaliser in society is Reaganism and Thatcherism, and it's not. They're going to raise fees, cut university funding and put a greater financial burden on graduates, universities and their students, and resourcing. That's the priority we should have. We shouldn't be debating this legislation; we should be debating other legislation with extra funding in the budget for universities, for TAFE, for schools, for preschools and kindergartens. That'll make a difference in our region. Just think about that. I'll finish where I started, with the $150 million they borrowed, which will be refunded in 2050. We've just wasted about $120 million on a marriage equality survey. They can afford to do that-honestly! I voted 'yes', and we'll be voting again in weeks to come, when I expect the 'yes' campaign to win. We'll be voting in this parliament in relation to that issue again. We should have done that and dealt with this issue months ago. Those are the warped priorities of this government. They're getting it out of whack. We need access to fair and well-funded education in this country. That's one of the most effective tools to fight against inequality. But this government is about an unequal Australia, not an equal Australia. It's about inequity, not equity. It's not about social justice; it's about social injustice. This is a government that has its priorities all wrong. That's the difference between us and them in terms of the economy. We're about the economy, and we're about equity. The government is not about the economy and it's not about equity. They claim they're the great champions of the market. They claim they're the great champions of economic growth, but they're not. They're not about a prosperous future for this country. They're not about that at all. We should not be supporting this legislation. It is not fair on the country. It is not good economics and it's not good for society. think it is the member for Blair-somewhere around Ipswich way. He's always a very wellprepared, well-thought-out speaker. A government member: Doesn't say much for you! friend. There's a bell ringing around this country, and it seems it's ringing louder and louder. The only people who can't hear this are the government. It gets louder and louder every day. By election time, it will be like a gong. It's a warning bell to the government, the community and society, because fundamentally we have a whole lot of troubling aspects in the economy. We have low wages growth. We have rising income taxes for workingand middle-class Australians. We have cuts in penalty rates at a time when workers are supposed to be asking for a pay rise. We have sham contracting in the labour market. We have vicious competition in many areas of the labour market. We have a shift away from the traditional arrangements of permanent employment, permanent part-time employment and even the traditional arrangement of casual employment. We have increasingly more arrangements in the labour market, whether it is labour hire or self-contracting or subcontracting. Sometimes we have contracts upon contracts. All of these arrangements are designed to have a vicious deflationary effect on wages. That is the reason they exist. We've seen it in Caltex and Bardier and one wage scandal after another. All of this ripples throughout the economy. I've seen many situations in my own electorate. They were working people who once would have been on predictable arrangements with predictable pay rises and would have had a level of security which is commensurate with their ability to not just pay the bills, but also to get ahead. If they worked hard, they could get into a situation where they could become middle class and their kids could go to uni, which is the Australian dream. Traditionally, it's been the dream of Anglo-Saxon postwar economies. That is, we would have a large middleclass-fewer super-rich people and fewer poor people, but a large middle class. That was the aim of the society. All of Menzies' speeches-and we hear it all the time from those opposite-were consistent with that, and so were the speeches of most postwar leaders. What we're seeing is income deceleration out there in the economy, and this affects the consumer economy. One of the things around the penalty-rates debate is that I've had cafe owners say me: 'If only I could cut the penalty rates, I could open up on a Sunday or I could employ someone else on a Sunday.' I say: 'That's fair enough that you might look at your own enterprise and think that, but what happens if everybody does it? There's less money in the economy.' Most particularly, what happens when the big entities get to do it? They just profit that. They take that wages cut and put it in their pocket or give it to shareholders. It's not new thinking. Otto Niemeyer during the Depression famously had the same idea: cut pensions by 10 per cent and wages by 10 per cent and put your economy back into surplus. There is one problem with that-and we've got Mr Hughes' portrait up there to remind us all in this",240,Bills
176,Mr Champion (Wakefield) (18:14,It's always hard to follow the member for Blair. I,243,Bills
177,Mr Champion,"I'm receiving a bit of negative feedback from across the aisle from mychamber of the effects of history-it doesn't work. In actual fact, you find that your economy decelerates. It's an interesting thing. We've got that big warning bell-that gong-going off in the economy. I've said before in the House-and it's worthwhile repeating here-that we hear from the government all the time that a job is the best form of welfare, but it can be put another way too. ACOSS put it in Poverty in Australia 2016: Being unemployed is the strongest overall predictor of poverty, with higher rates of poverty amongst this group than any other group. So what happens when a government sets out, in parts of the economy, to court unemployment for groups of people? You saw it in the car industry this week. The last car rolled down the line at GMH Elizabeth. You can go on Facebook. There is a page tracking this car's progress from the body shop to the paint shop. It's now getting the doors, the windscreens, the dash and the engine put in it. It's slowly making its way. On Friday, that last car will come off the line. With that last car, thousands and thousands of workers in the economy will suddenly have the predictability and certainty of a highly skilled job with good wages suddenly ripped away. We know what's going to happen to the car company. Nine hundred and fifty people are going to seek other work. Some of them are going to be unemployed, and that unemployment will be the greatest predictor of whether they stay in or out of poverty. It's largely dependent on their family circumstances and what's happening in their own family units. In the components sector, it's going to be very difficult indeed. It's going to be very difficult for blue-collar people in South Australia, where they also face big reductions in the shipbuilding workforce, big reductions in civil construction and big reductions in commercial construction at the moment. So we're seeing a sort of blue-collar hit on jobs in South Australia. We're seeing the same thing in Victoria. Often, the jobs that the government talk about as though they're creating them-but, actually, it's the private economy creating them-don't directly translate to those who are losing their jobs. So there's going to be great dislocation come Monday next week. You see that uncertainty spread by this government all the time. It's spread in terms of not just the economy and wages but the energy crisis. We see the government order a report. We have business, unions, state premiers, the Labor opposition and Senate parties all lining up behind the Clean Energy Target. So you've got a semblance of certainty, you've got modelling and you've got government process. They ordered a report, they got the report and they considered the report. Initially, they said nice things about the Clean Energy Target. Then what do we have coming out of the party room? It's a result of the division and the malevolent power that Tony Abbott has on the coalition party room to say no, to spike things and to threaten the leadership. Of course, that uncertainty around energy policy ripples throughout households. It ripples throughout manufacturers. Every manufacturer I've been to see has talked to me about power. Every food manufacturer, welding shop-wherever you go, people are talking about their power contracts in manufacturing. It impacts on investment. Higher education is more expensive. The government are slowly-and you can see it everywhere, such as with the housing affordability crisis-putting up big blockades on the ramps to the middle class. They are keeping everybody on a low road in a low-wages economy. This hasn't worked anywhere else. They'll tell us on this bill that they're doing tax reform. But they're not dealing with negative gearing and the capital gains tax concessions, which are fuelling the housing affordability crisis. They're not dealing with trusts, where we know people income-split and deliberately manipulate the taxation system to lower their taxation rates. They're not dealing with the people who spend thousands and thousands of dollars every year on their accountants to reduce their tax so they don't contribute to society. They would rather pay their accountant than pay the taxman. What kind of disloyal, miserly thinking that is-that you would rather give your accountant 10 grand or 15 grand than give your country 10 grand or 15 grand! It's lunacy. It's actual lunacy. It's a deeply sort of immoral/amoral thing to do. So they're not dealing effectively with the people who are just dodging their responsibilities. It's not just about dodging tax; it's about dodging your responsibility as a citizen. They don't want to pay for the roads that they drive on and they don't want to pay for someone else's health care and education. They don't want to pay for the very things that make us a community and a society. Tax cuts by themselves are not tax reforms. It's not tax reform to just simply cut tax. This has been done before. Ronald Reagan did it, and George Herbert Bush famously said, 'So what I'm saying is: it's just not gonna work,' and then he went on to refer to a man who's investing in 'voodoo economics'. We know what that did to public finances in the United States. It destroyed them. So simply handing out unfunded tax cuts doesn't do anything for your economic growth. We know what the predicted and modelled economic growth is. It's one per cent in 20 years time, and the wages that we're supposedly all going to benefit from will be two bucks a day in 20 years time. This is an assault not just on an economy that might serve working Australians; it's an assault on good public finances. It's an assault on good public finances to think that you can give out this $65 billion tax cut. But let's not forget that we've had different figures all the way along. First of all, the Prime Minister said $24 billion, $26 billion and $50 billion in answers in question time. It was in the shadow Treasurer's speech. Then the Treasurer said, 'It's $36.5 billion,' and then he came back and said, 'Oh, it's $65.4 billion.' So they're all over the shop. What we do know is that this is an assault on good, cautious public finance. It's a departure from the traditional role of conservatism in this country-a departure from my grandfather's Liberal sort of faith. This is just a big giveaway to the top end of the town in the vain hope that you might somehow get an economic policy out of it. Meanwhile, what are they doing to the people who have stagnant wages growth and whose friends and family-and maybe themselves-are being thrown into an economy where labour hire is increasingly prevalent and, with it, job insecurity and sham contracting becoming increasingly more prevalent? Well, they're giving those people an income tax rise. If you're on 55 grand a year, your tax is going up $275 bucks. It doesn't seem to make much sense. Those people are actually the big contributors to economic growth in this country. They're the ones who spend their wages at shops, buy things, invest in things and make things. If you're on 80 grand, it's an extra $400. All of this means that there is a big bell ringing in the economy-ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, and on and on it goes. Everybody else in the country can hear it and everybody else in the country knows it. Even the CBA's chief economist, Mr Blythe, talked about wages growth being two per cent 'if you're lucky'. He is reported in the Australian Financial Review as saying: We used to talk about wages policy … and considering the current backdrop. I think maybe the time has come again to think about that. You've got there a bank economist talking about wages policy. The government should listen to him. Frankly, they should also listen to the opposition and start thinking about what they're doing to public finances, to public trust in the economy and to overall economic growthbecause this bill is not going to be good for it. It's going to be very, very bad for it. It's going to be very bad for public finances and very bad for the national economy. Ms TEMPLEMAN (Macquarie) (18:28): I listened to a CEO recently who was asked about the wage levels of his sector and when he expected to see wages in his sector rise. They've been very flat and there's a lot of casualisation. He was asked what he thought might have to happen before wages would become more secure and wages would rise. His response was: 'Well, profits have to get better.' That seems to be a bit of a catch cry for the corporate world-that it all depends on profits being better. But you have to ask yourself how much better they need to be. Official data show that wages are actually going backwards, while company profits are surging. At the end of last year, in particular with mining and construction leading the trend, the Bureau of Statistics business indicators for the December quarter showed a massive 20.1 per cent surge in profits over the quarter, while wages fell 0.5 per cent. I guess that's got me asking-when does the trickle start? When does it start to go down from on high and catch workers? When do they get to feel any bit of dampness or moisture? Right now they're not getting it. That's what this enterprise tax plan relies on. It relies on trickle-down economics. All the evidence would suggest to us that it just ain't going to happen. If you're not getting it when you're seeing a massive 20.1 per cent surge in profits, you've really got to ask when are you going to get it? When I think about this whole idea and whether minimum wage earners will get a trickledown treat from company tax cuts, whether new jobs will be created by this trickle-down that is meant to happen thanks to this legislation, it is really hard to see what might happen. History and international experience would tell us that you have to be optimistic to think that it's a thing. It assumes that the benefits of any productivity growth that are associated with any increased investment will actually come through, and we're just not seeing it. That really is the framework in which I look at this piece of legislation. I think it is rather ironic that this came out of the so-called jobs and growth agenda, which of course we haven't heard much of lately. We've got different three-word slogans that have replaced that. There's been a variety-reliability and something and something. Ms TEMPLEMAN: Well, some people can remember them. But I think we've got to be as dubious about them as we are about the 'jobs and growth' phrase. It was first flagged in last year's budget. Then just before this year's budget, we really got a bit more detail about it. I want to put on the record that I'm a huge supporter of tax cuts for small business. As someone who's been in small business for 25 year, I've had the benefit of being my own small business, employing people, having different structures and there's no way I would travel to the other side of the chamber. I am certainly not the exception on my side of the chamber either. There are many, many of us who at different times in our life have had different models of self-employment. It's certainly not a gift that's only bestowed on those on the",243,Bills
178,Honourable Members Interjecting,"opposite side. I've had the benefit of being a small business but have also worked a lot with big business. I'm hugely supportive of tax cuts for small businesses. Small businesses do an enormous amount with very little. The people who miss out when it's a small-business tax cut and have missed out through all of this are the people who aren't incorporated, the people who are sole traders and work for themselves. They don't often employ people-it might be a husband and wife team. They miss out completely on any of the benefits. What I'm not a supporter of is a small-business tax cut that just goes on and on and on to any size business, especially one that ends up being a $65 billion tax cut for business. I will never forget the question time when we actually first heard the detail of what these cuts would be-and I should be specific; it's $65.4 billion. This is a hit to the budget bottom line; absolutely, a straightforward hit to the budget bottom line. Really, for a government that has so hypocritically ranted and raved about reining in the budget deficit and about budget repair, to throw this on to the table is an extraordinary act, and then to watch as the figure to this was allocated. It was a simple question that we asked in question time. It was the Leader of the Opposition who asked the Prime Minister a very simple question: what's the cost of the full company tax rate-cut, plan? What is the cost? The answer had three figures: $24 billion, $26 billion and $50 billion. Forgive us, but I think on our side we were a little confused as to which was the right figure. So when asked again to confirm the figure, the Prime Minister, as is his want, flicked it to the Treasurer. We've seen him do that a lot with energy in the last few days. Out of that the Treasurer disclosed, with quite a bit of drama and performance, a figure of $36.5 billion that this enterprise tax plan would add to the budget bottom line. We were still confused because this was a different figure to the three that the Prime Minister had given us. So we asked again, and we got yet another answer to the same question. The Treasurer replied $65.4 billion. In one question time, those tax cuts, the ones we're discussing today, got more expensive to the tune of $15 billion. It's probably lucky question time wasn't much longer. We've been very clear since this plan was first introduced to highlight not just the hit to the bottom line but how minimal the benefit will be. We are talking about-and people should really remember this-one per cent of economic growth, not next year, not the year after, but in 20 years time. And we're talking about how this would trickle down to wages. Well, it will-to the tune of a $2 a day increase in wages in 20 years time. As a small business operator, you're always weighing the investment and the return and you're trying to keep your costs down and maximise the benefits that you get. I just can't see that $65.4 billion is a really great use of that money to get only one per cent of economic growth in 20 years time or a $2 a day increase in wages in 20 years time. This is all happening when wages growth has completely flatlined to record lows of 1.9 per cent. The economic data shows that our living standards which had been climbing have gone backwards, that families are facing a really difficult mix of rising costs of electricity prices, stalling wages, record high underemployment. These are all the issues we're confronting, and this is all we've got. It does nothing to address any of those issues. It also comes at a time when this government has supported penalty rate cuts which came in on 1 July this year. By the way, the penalty cuts were meant to allow employers to hire more people. I don't think we've seen that yet. Maybe I'm missing something. In my community I'm not hearing people say to the government, 'Thank you so much for cutting those penalty rates, because now I've got a job-lower pay but I've got a job.' I am not hearing that; I'm hearing that people are starting to feel that pinch, and I'm listening really hard to my electorate of Macquarie. I think I must be listening much harder than government members are listening to their electorates. When I hear those who support this measure say that it's needed to drive investment, I reflect that in no time in the 25 years I've been in business can I really see that these sorts of initiatives have made any difference. Fortunately, governments have not tried this very often but, if you put it into the broader context, not that many years ago, we had a huge investment boom in Australia and we had a headline corporate tax rate of 30 per cent. It didn't seem to impact on that massive investment. The US Congressional Budget Office put out a paper earlier this year, saying they recognise the statutory corporate tax rate is just one of many features of the tax system that influences corporate behaviour. My experience with corporates would reflect that as well: that there isn't one single reason a company decides to do what it does. There will be a number of things, but a corporate tax rate is not the sole driver of it. And the US Congressional Budget Office says that, because of their broader scope, the average and effective corporate tax rates are better indicators of a company's incentives to invest in a particular country, rather than the statutory corporate tax rate. The paper points out that, with a headline rate of 30 per cent in 2012, the average rate for Australia of tax paid by corporates was 17 per cent and the effective tax rate in the end was 10.4 per cent. I really think that this is a government trying to take a shortcut-to try to be seen to be doing something to help big corporates, to try to be seen to be doing something about unemployment and to be seen to be creating jobs. But there are so many better things that they could be doing than this. I can think of so many ways that $65.4 billion could be better spent. I noted with interest this week that the Assistant Governor of the Reserve Bank, Luci Ellis, actually quashed the argument that you need this tax cut to drive investment. Maybe the RBA is missing something but, in my experience with the RBA, they are smart people and they look really closely at the evidence before they say things. Ms Ellis said: When businesses make decisions about where to locate – the tax rate does presumably matter, but so does the business environment, the institutional framework, the rule of law, the macro-economic outlook and where the resources are. There's a broader business environment to consider and those advantages haven't gone away. We are very fortunate that we do have those business advantages. When it boils down to it, budgets are all about priorities. This was announced as part of a budget, and this government has quite simply got the priorities wrong. They've got their big business tax cuts, they've got high-income earners getting a tax cut, they've got workers who earn $21,000 getting increased taxes, and they've got penalty rates cuts. You would have thought all of this might be enough. But we have a government that continues to try to take more and more measures. In the time that I have left, I might mention that we are one year into this term of parliament, but we are five years into a coalition government. Australia and the economy are facing serious challenges on the jobs front. It's not often that you hear those on the other side acknowledge that, and acknowledge that things are tough. But in the other chamber today, I did hear some acknowledgment that things are tough, and I think that's important for people to hear from all sides of politics. It should be more than enough for the Treasurer of this nation to be focused on these challenges, and possibly coming up with some more creative ideas. Let's think about what would be some better ways to tackle the issues that, supposedly, this enterprise tax plan will address. I think the things we have to focus on are things like properly funding our schools. That is one way to reduce inequality. If people have money to spend, they have learnt well, they have got great tertiary education, and they get well-paid jobs or they create their own businesses. We on this side of the House would definitely like to see people creating their own businesses. They are the things that will make our economy boom and, quite frankly, then there'll be demand, and then big businesses will benefit as much as other businesses. We could see a fairer tax system. We could further deal with superannuation tax concessions. It's something that we've announced-and yet somehow this government has decided it was a secret super tax and we've been hiding it. But, in fact, we are very upfront about the sorts of changes to the tax system that we would like to see. If you want to improve the tax system, forget this one-let's level the playing field for first home buyers through reforms to negative gearing and capital gains tax. Let's cap deductions that people can obtain individually from managing their tax affairs to $3,000, so they actually do pay a fair share of tax. Let's make sure big business pays its fair share of tax. They're the sorts of things we should be discussing in this chamber, not this bill. Ms SWANSON (Paterson) (18:44): I rise today to remind the Turnbull government that my colleagues and I believe in a fairer tax system for Australia. As such, I will not support this government's $65 billion tax cut to big business. My electorate of Paterson is home to several communities that are living, breathing, collateral damage of a system where the government takes from those who are less well off and gives to those who are far better off. A $65 billion-just saying those words!-payout to big business is being funded by lowto middle-income individuals and families. That's $65 billion drawn from the pockets of some of the most hard working people in our country, including in my electorate of Paterson. Under this budget, Australian families are suffering stagnating wages and rising electricity costswe all know that too well! And don't you look forward to getting the text to tell you to turn the air-conditioner off on the 45-degree days? We'll all wait with bated breath for that. That is alongside record high unemployment and serious underemployment. In an economy that has traditionally been characterised by strong economic growth, living standards went backwards in the last quarter. I'm not sure what evidence this government is relying on to justify big business payouts, but Labor is listening to the experts. And the Assistant Governor to the Reserve Bank, Luci Ellis, nullified the argument that you need a tax cut to drive investment. We ask again: where are this government's priorities? Labor is committed to helping the people of Australia. We want equality across the board. We want people to have good and productive lives and jobs. Labor believes that budgets are about identifying needs, prioritising them, developing good solid policy responses and compiling a measured and equitable financial pathway towards implementation. In contrast, the Turnbull government budget fails to address some very serious economic challenges. The government has assured us it's meeting the challenges on the jobs front and the wages growth front, but this government has promised the people of Australia many things. And, once again, the people of Australia have been let down, seriously let down. Labor believes in ensuring equal access and opportunity for every Australian. That begins, first and foremost, with a properly funded education system, not this watered down Gonski 2.0 nonsense. It begins with proper investment in infrastructure and ensuring all Australians have access to information and communication that is so vital to living in a modern world. It is, indeed, so vital to every facet of business and industry, vital to staying engaged in a global community. I'm talking about connectivity, digital communication and, specifically, mobile and internet connectivity. This has been an abject failure on the part of the Turnbull government from the very person, the Prime Minister, who, when he was communications minister, was the master of all things connected. He was going to create a great internet. Do you remember that one? It was going to be faster and cheaper, and have a multi-mix technology basis-and wouldn't it be great? I can still remember that image of the member for Warringah and the then-communications minister standing in front of the illuminated board pointing out how fantastic it would be. What an abject failure it's turned out to be. Just today, we've heard from the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman that more than 27,000 reports were lodged with them during the past financial year, and complaints about the NBN have risen a whopping 160 per cent. AndI want to share some of the ombudsman's, Judi Jones's, comments in her report published today: Australians are relying more than ever before on technology to stay connected, to be informed, and to do business, so it is critical that consumers are able to rely on the services they sign up for. While it is necessary to acknowledge the role of the national broadband network in driving significant change in Australian telecommunications, complaints have increased across the board. Complaints about services delivered over the national broadband network have more than doubled. This is the ombudsman's report that was published today, with Judi Jones saying: This includes an increase in complaints about connection delays and reliability issues such as faults. The increase is somewhat to be expected given the accelerated rollout of the NBN, but is still a concerning trend. There you have it, hot off the press today from the telecommunications ombudsman, Judi Jones. Clearly, this is not good enough. It is patently not good enough. It is an outcome fundamentally out of keeping with the priorities that Australian people so desperately want. We need to keep pace with the technology. We want to be connected to each other, not only to our friends and family, but to our business associates. We see members constantly glued to their phones as they walk around this House. Imagine if they couldn't get the internet or mobile communication. As the member for Paterson, I am extremely distressed to say that I don't have the NBN and I don't even have internet at my residence. We have to rely on a dongle. It is clearly not good enough. And there are so many more in my electorate who are absolutely bitterly frustrated by this failure. Another great fail has been this government's so-called jobs and growth agenda. What a spectacular flop! In the Hunter Valley, home to my electorate of Paterson, the unemployment rate hit 7.6 per cent in August. At the time, this was nearly two per cent higher than the national unemployment rate. In June, youth unemployment in the Hunter Valley hit 10.9 per cent. As the member for Paterson, I am committed to ensuring that high unemployment rates in my electorate become history. I am committed to ensuring that we identify the barriers that my electorate faces in finding work. I'm committed to ensuring that our communities have the opportunity to create jobs as well as just find them. I demand to know: what has the government done to help the battlers of my electorate? Not much, I suspect. This government has offered tax cuts to big business. This government has ensured tax cuts to high-income earners. This government has ensured increased taxes for workers earning above just $21,000. And let's not forget about penalty rates. This government has worked to ensure that some of the most hard working individuals in our country don't get financial recognition for the service they perform for our community, for the hours that they spend away from their loved ones during what is traditionally family time, for the nights they spend serving others on shift work instead of enjoying recreation themselves or even sleep. Many of the roles that require penalty rates to provide even a modicum of a respectable wage are the province of casual or part-time employees. There has been a move towards casualisation of jobs right across Australia. People don't need to hear it from Parliament House. They're living it every day. Casual workers have minimal job security and work hours foreign to most people. We hear about the 24/7 economy. WhilstI don't deny that it exists, I say to you: when schools operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week, then we might consider it, but I'm sure that will never happen. While we have young children who need to be educated within a Monday-to-Friday, nine-to-three framework, that will be the basis for the working week. It is just common sense. Anything very much outside of those times is not conducive to family time, and we need to be thinking about that more. It is the government's responsibility to address this issue. They're doing precious little, and I personally don't like waiting around. I was delighted to welcome the Australian Jobs Taskforce to Paterson. This federal caucus committee, chaired by the member for Longman, Susan Lamb, is travelling across Australia to address inequality in employment and opportunity. The statistics are undisputed. Regional areas across Australia are suffering incredibly high rates of unemployment, and our young people are being hit the hardest. I remind you, Deputy Speaker Claydon: just last year, the youth unemployment rate in the Hunter Valley hit over 20 per centand I know you know this well, as, being the member for Newcastle, you share this area with me. It is truly distressing. That meant that one-fifth of our young people were looking for work and couldn't find it. This astronomical rate was second only to outback Queensland, which had a youth unemployment rate of 28 per cent-almost a third of young people not being able to find work. I fail to see how the government continues to let this happen. A fair go is something we Australians once upon a time were proud of. We were proud to offer it to all, but it seems we are really struggling-and I am struggling to see how this is providing a fair go. During the recent Australian Jobs Taskforce hearings in my electorate, I heard from young people who were desperate for a job-people who had disabilities so minor they've fallen through the cracks with regard to any government funding or support but who still have so much to offer, and highly skilled and qualified mature age workers who, after leaving employment due to family commitments, cannot re-engage with employment. Their references are stale and their contacts are out of date, but, again, they're smart, strong and willing. These people want work. They have so much still to give, and yet no-one will give them a go. It is people such as these who are last on the list when the economic climate is tough. Those who are most vulnerable are struck the hardest. These high unemployment rates reflect the economic climate of the region. Stagnating wages and little economic growth point to an economy that is struggling. That is squarely the remit of the Turnbull government, who like to constantly remind us that they're the economic maestros in this concert. They like to tell us how good they are at balancing the books and driving investment, driving wages growth and driving down unemployment, yet, after four years, we're still not seeing any of this. Where is it, you economic geniuses? I ask you: where is it? Another factor driving youth unemployment is the skills mismatch we're seeing right across Australia. Growing industries in my electorate, as in many others, require high skilling, yet in the past year we've seen the constant erosion of TAFE and VET programs. Since June 2014 we've seen over 4,000 apprenticeships lost in the Hunter region alone. It's further evidence that the very great value of these training opportunities is being lost, yet this government's skewed budget priorities consistently leave this out of the equation. The erosion of funding is only reinforcing the stigma that sees apprenticeships regarded as second class, and this is wrong. There are many skilled, well-paid, valuable and, indeed, noble crafts and trades that have literally built this country. A government member interjectingMs SWANSON: Your government's not helping to train anyone. Apprentices are what the economy needs, and we've said that, if we're elected to government, one in 10 of the people on every federal government infrastructure project will be an apprentice. I think that would be a fantastic thing. The benefit would be twofold: it would give our young people jobs and it would also encourage them on a lifelong path of learning. How can a government that's so committed to jobs and growth constantly ignore the facts? In 15 years, today's youth will be the leaders of this nation, and the government is not helping them off the starting block. The longer youth remain unemployed, the more their opportunities in the workforce dwindle, and it only takes six months. Someone who is finishing their HSC this November-and many are sitting it right now-only has those precious few months into summer to find a job before it will become exponentially more difficult for them to do so. The longer they remain unemployed, the harder it will be to find a job. But it only takes six months for it to become really difficult. Potential employers look at a resume and say, 'You haven't worked for six months. What's going on here?' even though we all know how quickly that time can flit by. The problem compounds and people have fewer prospects for employment and income growth. By pursuing such an ill-advised budget, this government is directly diminishing the futures of Australian youth. In Paterson, we're actively working to try to combat this policy void of the federal government. We're doing our own thing, if you like; we're engaging in grassroots initiatives, which I'm heavily involved in. There have been some fantastic projects. In the short time. I have left, I want to acknowledge Cessnock City Council, which has been running the Cessnock city youth employment project. They've been training a small group of people with a great model. It's a 12-week program. The results from the pilot program are that five of the five young people found employment after completing the program. Congratulations to Jane Holdsworth, the economic development manager of Cessnock City Council. She's doing a magnificent job. She's hoping to roll this model out to other councils all around the country. Personally, I would really like to see that happen, because I know it is very successful and quite novel. In the words of Jane, if every council in Australia took 20 young kids and got them a job at the end of the year, 14,000 to 15,000 jobs would be created every year. Imagine if each of our councils could train 40 or 50 young people. It would be truly amazing. This government has its priorities wrong, and this is well and truly exemplified in the current budget. Ms COLLINS (Franklin) (18:59): As my colleague so ably said, the fact that the government is pursuing these big-business tax cuts shows how wrong their priorities truly are. Not only are they intent on continuing to push their big-business tax cuts; they also have gotten rid of the deficit levy whilst we have a deficit, so they're giving high-income earners a tax cut as well. At the same time, with their increase to the Medicare levy, they're giving ordinary workers a tax rise. They want to give big businesses $65 billion in tax cuts and they want ordinary workers who earn $21,000 to have a tax increase. How is that fair? How is it that this government thinks that this is okay? How is it fair that this government continually attacks working people in Australia? How is it fair that this government wants to believe in trickle-down economics and wants to believe in the jobs-and-growth plan that it keeps talking about, where businesses are going to employ more people if the government gets this through? We saw the Business Council of Australia in the media today saying, 'We really need this. Australia has one of the biggest taxes on companies in the world. People won't invest and we're not going to get the jobs if this doesn't happen.' But the RBA Assistant Governor has belled the cat on that today. The Reserve Bank Assistant Governor, Luci Ellis, said that the corporate tax rate in Australia was 'irrelevant' for domestic investors because of our system of dividend imputation. Indeed, she said that the tax rate was only one of many variables considered by foreign companies who want to come and invest in Australia. She said that one of the things that actually impacts is the investment that we've seen in recent years over the mining boom because we have the resources. Multinational companies are coming here because we have the resources, not because of our tax rate, and we had that mining boom at a time when we had the tax rate we've currently got. Ms Ellis said that, when foreign companies are making these decisions on where to invest, they consider many variables, including the tax rate, the business environment, the rule of law, the educational base of the country and where the resources are. That's what international companies and companies that are going to invest in our country are making decisions on. Not only that, the claim that we are one of the highest-taxing nations in the world when it comes to company tax is simply not true. If you look at the United States' Congressional Budget Office's paper, put out earlier this year, it shows that Australia is actually down here when it comes to corporate tax rates. That's what it says, because that is the truth. It says: Because of their broader scope, average and effective corporate tax rates are better indicators of a company's incentives to invest in a particular country than is the statutory corporate tax rate. It points out that, while there is a headline rate of 30 per cent in Australia in 2012, the average rate for Australian companies was 17 per cent. Because of the reforms that we supported, we're getting a bit of transparency now about how much tax some of these companies are actually paying in Australia. Some Australians are quite shocked when they see that published list. They see that some of the companies that are in Australia are actually paying very, very little tax. Indeed, some of them pay zero tax. To come in here and claim that these companies need this tax rate when some of them don't even pay any tax, and some of them pay very little tax, is ludicrous. To say that this is going to increase jobs in the economy is simply not true, but the government continues with these warped priorities and continues to insist that this is the only way forward. We have our own priorities on this side. We're going to prioritise other things, like properly funding our schools, which is what the government said it would do. We all remember the government said it was on a unity ticket with Labor when it came to investing in children's education. The funding wouldn't change depending on who won government. We all remember it well. There were people out there with their signs saying that the government was going to invest in schools and education, just like Labor was. We now know that that's not true. Another of our priorities is infrastructure. In my home state in Tasmania, we've seen no new infrastructure projects under this government-not one. The only infrastructure projects that have occurred in Tasmania are ones that were funded in Labor's plan in 2013 and ones that Labor committed to, and the government had to copy us in election campaigns. That is it. That is all the government has invested when it comes to infrastructure in Tasmania-no new plans, no investments. On our side, one of our other priorities is having a real fairer tax system. That is, a tax system that leads to dealing with some of the inequities in the system. We have said very clearly that we want to deal with the superannuation tax concessions. We've said very clearly that we want to level the playing field for first home buyers through reforms to negative gearing and capital gains tax. Of course, we believe that the housing issue in Australia and housing affordability are a serious issues that need to be addressed by the government, and we've seen very little from the government in this regard. Another one of our priorities in our fairer tax system is capping the deductions that people can obtain for managing their own tax affairs. We've also recently announced our plan to impose a minimum 30 per cent tax on discretionary trusts to deal with some of the issues around income splitting. So it's not like we're shying away from the hard decisions. We are making our tax system fairer. We want to do that. But, of course, the government is the one that is pursuing this $65 billion tax cut rather than investing that money where it should bein infrastructure, in schools and in other areas. If you want to talk about the government's inaction, there's no clearer way to do that than to talk about the portfolio that I'm the shadow minister for-ageing. The government in recent weeks has had a review into the Living Longer Living Better reforms that Labor instituted when we were last in government. It has had, for the first time, data about home-care packages-the packages for older Australians so that they can stay in their own homes for longer and get the support that they need. When the government released the David Tune report into Living Longer Living Better and it finally released the data that I've been calling for since March, what has become evident for the waiting lists for home-care packages is that more than 90,000 Australians-vulnerable, frail Australians-are waiting for care packages so that they can get support to stay at home. The sad reality is that those people are going to be waiting some time for those packages. This would be a great investment from the government, rather than giving $65 billion in tax cuts to big business. This is the sort of thing a government should invest in. Not only does it actually save the system money; it's actually a better outcome for the individuals, their families and carers. It also creates jobs. One of the fastest sectors for jobs growth in this country is health care-and, indeed, aged care. We're going to need a lot more workers to look after our changing demographic and our population. So it would be a very sound investment. Instead, what we've seen is no further investment from the government, but they will release an extra 6,000 packages. So that's only 6,000 packages to deal with over 90,000 people waiting on that list. That's just one example of where the government could spend some of the $65 billion it wants to give away to business. That's what the government keeps talking about-this trickle-down effect. They say, 'It will create all the jobs. This is our priority.' But it's simply not going to work. It's not going to work the way we are in Australia at the moment-for today's economy and for the situation that we face in Australia today. One of the issues that keeps getting raised when it comes to jobs in Australia at the moment is wages growth, or the lack of it. We've seen some of the big companies pay very little or no tax. Already, they're not investing in their people and their workforce to the level that they should. But we've seen a campaign to reduce penalty rates from some of the businesses in Australia. We've also seen people not willing to give workers the pay rises that they deserve. We've also seen-and this is really interesting-that the link between increased productivity and increased wages appears to no longer correlate the way that it used to. That is because of technology and the changing workforce as technology is occurring in our system. We need to deal with that. We need to find a way to ensure that Australians have secure, well-paid jobs so that they can function and have confidence in their own investments and in their own family life. It's a very serious issue that there are so many Australians in casual and insecure work. This is something the government could tackle. Giving $65 billion in tax cuts to big businesses is not the way to tackle it. It will not do anything to help those workers who are vulnerable in insecure jobs, who are out there working really hard and who are also having their penalty rates attacked. If the government wants to do something about wages growth, cutting people's actual take-home pay is not the way to go about it. We have seen support from unions for workers in the High Court and the decision that has happened with the Fair Work Commission. On our side of politics, we've said that we would intervene to change Fair Work Australia's essential regulations to make sure that workers cannot have their take-home pay cut. We don't want to see workers who are already in casual and insecure work have their take-home pay cut when they're working unsociable hours on the days that other people don't want to work-the days that other people want to spend with their families. How is cutting their pay going to help the economy? These people are often 100 per cent consumers: everything they earn, they spend in their local economies, which creates jobs. I don't understand why the government wants to continually attack workers on the one hand, while, on the other hand, saying that, if we give big business a tax cut, we'll end up with more jobs for the workers. It just doesn't correlate. Trickle-down economics has failed in the past. I don't understand why the government is so attached to it and why it thinks it's going to work in this instance. I really cannot see why the government is so attached to this big-business tax cut. I'm curious as to whether it thinks it's going to be able to get it through the Senate. Of course, we don't yet know what sort of deals it's doing to try and achieve that. Clearly, there are some issues, and the crossbenchers and Labor in the Senate have stated our position on this bill. We don't believe that big business needs this tax cut, and we don't think it's affordable, given Australia's current financial position. We have said very clearly that there are other priorities, such as investing in education and infrastructure. We've said very clearly that we have our own plan for a fairer tax system that ensures that Australians who are doing it tough are rewarded, not given the tax increase that the current government is proposing for ordinary workers who earn more than $21,000. We have a completely different plan to the government's. It's interesting when you go out and talk to constituents, because constituents are awake to this. You go to any town hall meeting, community meeting or mobile office in your electorate and the constituents are really concerned that the government is continuing to pursue this bigbusiness tax cut. They know it's the wrong priority, and I'm amazed that some of the backbenchers on the government side, particularly those who are sitting in marginal seats, are not telling the Prime Minister and the senior ministers this. I'm amazed that they are not hearing people in their constituencies say that this big-business tax cut is the wrong priority at this time. I would be very amazed if the local member over there doesn't hear it from his constituents. Think about what that $65 billion could do if it were invested in children's education, health or infrastructure. Those things would create more jobs and be more productive for Australia's long-term future than a simple big-business tax cut. That's what my constituents are saying, and I am really surprised that the backbench and the marginal seat holders on the other side are not telling their leadership that this is the wrong priority. Australians know it's the wrong priority, and I'm sure those members are hearing it out and about in their electorates. I would be very surprised if they could stand up in this place and say, 'I have no constituents that are concerned about whether this $65 billion tax cut is a good idea at this time.' I would be very surprised if their constituents aren't saying, 'That's the wrong priority.' If you're going to give $65 billion away, don't give it to big business; give it to the little people. Give it to the workers. Give it to the kids in the schools. Give it to the patients in the hospitals. Spend it where it's really needed. This is not where it's really needed, and it won't make a big difference to these businesses at this time. As I said, many of these businesses don't pay the full tax rate anyway. Many don't pay the amount of tax that we believe they should and some are paying zero tax. We know that is not right. We need a fairer tax system for Australia, but this is not the way to go about it. It can be done in a better way, and the government should abandon this idea and do it properly. previous speaker's comments. She explained very eloquently and made quite clear why we oppose this bill, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Enterprise Tax Plan No. 2) Bill 2017otherwise known, as I would call it, the '$65 billion tax cut for big business at the expense of pensioners, families and working people bill 2017'. That's what it should really be called. The bill has already been rejected by the Senate-the Senate has already looked at it and rejected it-yet here we are again with the government trying to ram it through. As we've heard in this place, during question time a couple of months ago the Leader of the Opposition asked the Prime Minister what the full cost of the company tax rate cut would be. We heard three different figures over a couple of days-or in one day or whatever it was. One figure was $24 billion-that would be the cost of the company tax rate cut plan. Then we heard $26 billion-a difference of $2 billion. Then we heard a third figure: $50 billion. Then, when asked again, the Treasurer said $36.5 billion. So we had four different figures of what",246,Bills
179,Mr Georganas (Hindmarsh) (19:14,"I rise to speak about this bill and to support thethe cost will be. But, then again, what's a few billion between friends? What's a few billion between some of the Prime Minister's big-end-of-town friends? Today in this place, we talked about electricity prices-an issue that affects all of us and every Australian. We know that bills are skyrocketing-they're through the roof. People are struggling to deal with huge increases under this government's watch-under the five years that this government has been in power. The average household is spending over $2,000 a year on electricity, and the government is throwing its hands up in the air and saying, 'Call your provider; get a better deal,' 'Nothing to see here; we have no role,' 'Blame the states; there's nothing that we can do,' and 'Blame the former Labor government that was in five years ago'-soon it will be six. The real issue here is that, when mums and dads, working people, are calling for something to be done on energy, we have a government that's not willing to take any action to bring down prices. But, when the big end of town-the big multinationals, the big, big businessescall the Prime Minister or visit Kirribilli, with the champagne flowing, and ask for a tax cut, the government says, 'Sure; yes, we'll hand it over. Here you go; here's $65 billion. Let's take it away from the pensioners, from the low-income workers, from health and from education'-and that's just to name a few. How unbelievably out of touch is this government-when you're giving away $65 billion to the richest people in this nation? This brings back some memories for me. When I was here in 2006-07, the Howard government listened to the big end of town and the same thing took place. They listened to the big end of town and tried to pass an outrageous bill for working people. That was Work Choices. We on this side all remember Work Choices. This reminds me of that. You can just see it: the richest people in Australia knocking on the former Prime Minister's door and saying, 'Give us a break. Get those working entitlements out of the way so that we can make more money'-and off he went and did it. This is the same thing. The Prime Minister is listening to the big end of town-the billionaires-and giving them exactly what they want. Back then with Work Choices, it was a cut in employment expenses for the corporates at the expense of working people of Australia. Well, we all know what happened back in 2007. The people of Australia did not like it. They were offended by it and they fired Mr Howard, and Labor restored the wages of our hard working constituents, who were not listened to by the former Liberal coalition. This isn't about small businesses that employ millions of Australians. We need to do more to support those small businesses and do as much as we can for them to help them survive and ensure that they are able to employ people. This bill is about the greed of corporate Australia. This particular movement is about the corporate greed of Australia, and they certainly do not need a handout. They certainly do not need a handout when there are people out there struggling to get a job and people wanting an education. We see what's been done through cuts to universities in the last 12 months. The big end of town do not need a handout. Let's support small businesses. Let's support the small businesses that employ many, many people. I've got some great start-up businesses in my electorate of Hindmarsh that I visit, as well as some established small businesses, that really need a hand up or some assistance. Let's help them. Let's look at the facts in this bill. The facts are one per cent economic growth in 20 years time. We're going to get a benefit of one per cent in the economy in 20 years time and, for workers, a $2-a-day increase in wages in 20 years time. We're going to take $65 billion out of the budget-and we really don't know what it will cost, because there are four different sets of figures-to get that miniscule one per cent growth and a $2 increase for workers in 20 years time. This is at a time when wage growth has flatlined, with record lows of 1.9 per cent currently. This is also at a time when the government has supported penalty rate cuts from July this year. So we have big, big benefits to the top end of town, giving them massive tax cuts, handing over many, many billions of dollars, and there is no action on reversing the cuts to penalty rates for people who absolutely need those penalty rates because they work on weekends. It could mean the difference between putting food on the table and paying their energy bills. On top of this, the government expects workers on incomes over $21,000 to pay higher taxes. The government are telling the big end of town, 'We will give you $65 billion,' but at the lower end, where people really need some assistance and help, anyone earning just over $21,000 will be expected to pay more. So they are telling people who cannot afford it, 'We're going to squeeze more out of you so we can give to those who can afford it the most.' Obviously, not much for our millionaire class. This has to be a criminal act. This is wrong. How does the government expect to get away with this? How do government members expect to go to their constituents and say, 'You're going to pay more tax, but we're going to let the multinationals, the big companies, some who pay zero tax, off the hook and we're going to give them a bigger tax cut'? That's what those opposite are going to have to say. To be honest, I don't think that many members of parliament will be able to do that. The public are listening. They know. They're watching their hip-pockets, and their hip-pockets are empty. Let's not forget, the previous member spoke about university students and universities having to deal with huge cuts to their budgets. We all meet with constituents, and so do I in my electorate office in Glenelg, and I meet with people who are struggling to make ends meet and struggling to find jobs. I meet with parents who want to find jobs for their kids and are concerned. These people need assistance. But, no, we're going to make them pay more tax. IfI didn't win the last election in Hindmarsh, I seriously wonder how the former Liberal member would be able to look these people in the eye, people I see every day, and explain why the government is giving millionaires a massive cut, yet taking away from the people who come to our electorate offices for assistance. How can you justify the old, failed trickle-down economics? This is what it is: it's trickle-down economics. 'Let's handover shovels full of dollars to the multinationals and big millionaires and, hopefully, a little bit of it will trickle down.' It hasn't worked, it doesn't work, and we know it won't work. This proposed tax cut is insane. It's constituents like the ones I speak to that give me the strength in this place to stand up and fight against bills just like this one. What makes me so angry is that the government is willing to get out the chequebook for the fat cats, but not when it comes to supporting manufacturing workers-manufacturing workers in Adelaide who have been done over with the closure of Holden. What we've been saying is that manufacturing workers in Adelaide need help. We need help to support those people with targeted assistance during a period when Holden is closing down, and again in 2013 those people needed help. GMH should have been targeted with assistance during a period when the Aussie dollar was quite high and was hurting them. Where was the government then? All we had was a Treasurer that came out and goaded them out of town. He basically gave a speech that scared the pants off them, and they ran off. There were ways of keeping Holden in Adelaide, in the northern suburbs, which would have continued to employ people. But this government was not interested. They were not listening. As I said, the only people they've listened to is that higher end of town, like at Kirribilli House while the Prime Minister's having champagne with them. But he will not listen to working people. I tell you: they've been missing in action in South Australia, especially when it comes to manufacturing. We also hear from those on the opposite side of the House saying that these outrageous tax cuts are essential in order to drive investment. Well, let's look at what the US Congressional Budget Office put out in a paper this year. It said that the statutory corporate tax rate is one of the many features of the tax system that influence corporate behaviour, and that is because of the broader scope. They say: … average and effective corporate tax rates are better indicators of a company's incentives to invest in a particular country than is the statutory corporate tax rate. The paper goes on to point out that, at a headline rate of 30 per cent in 2012, the average rate for Australia was 17 per cent and the effective tax rate was 10.4 per cent. Let's not forget about some of the great Labor reforms, which mean that every domestic payer of corporate tax, in effect, gets it back. We actually refund our corporate tax to our domestic investors-something which is unique around the world and is often not talked about. We see a government that is completely out of touch. We see a government that listens to only a small portion of the Australian population. It ignores all the communities who are asking for assistance or for help. We saw tax cuts for the big end of town and a tax increase for those earning over $21,000. We see cuts to pensions and we see cuts to education. We see cuts to health and we see cuts to universities. And, at the same time, it's okay for the big end of town to receive massive dollars in tax cuts. But you don't need to take my word for this. Take the word of the assistant governor of the Reserve Bank. She dismantled the idea that you need this massive tax cut to drive down investment. She said: When businesses make decisions about where to locate – the tax rate does presumably matter, but so does the business environment, the institutional framework, the rule of law, the macro-economic outlook and where the resources are. ……… There's a broader business environment to consider and those advantages haven't gone away. The government has absolutely failed on economic leadership and economic management. The Treasurer is failing in his job to leave this country in better shape than when he arrived. The Treasurer needs to understand that the age of entitlement should be over for the big end of town. So much for the importance of the so-called 'jobs and growth' agenda that this Prime Minister ran on. All we heard was 'jobs and growth, jobs and growth'. We've seen higher unemployment rates, hardly any growth and the lowest wages growth for many, many years. How do you expect your economy to be fired up and to work when wages are stable and not going up at a reasonable pace? (Time expired) Federation Chamber adjourned at 19:29. Veterans (Question No. 758) Ms Rishworth asked the Minister for Veterans' Affairs in writing: (1) Question Why are there no targets for the Veteran's Employment Program (VEP). (2) Question Will his department provide outcomes for the VEP; if not, why not; if so, when. (3) Question How is the success of the program currently being measured. Mr Tehan: The Minister for Veterans' Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Answer The Industry Advisory Committee on Veterans' Employment (IAC), established under the Prime Minister's Veterans' Employment Program, is considering an appropriate target to set for the employment of veterans by businesses who want to participate in the Program. The Department of Defence and Department of Veterans' Affairs are fully supporting Industry in the development of the program. (2) Answer Progress on the implementation of the various initiatives under the Program has been and will continue to be reported on the Program's website at www.veteransemployment.gov.au. (3) Answer The Program aims to raise awareness of the skills and experience that veterans can bring to the civilian workplace and increase their employment opportunities. To date, the IAC has been established with strong interest from the business community. Information and tools for veterans seeking employment is now available on the jobactive and APSjobs websites. For example, more than 1600 jobs flagged as Defence Force experience desirable have been advertised on jobactive to date. Telecommunications (Question No. 799) Ms Sharkie asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, in writing, on 17 August 2017: (1) In light of rolling blackouts in South Australia last summer, is the Government taking additional and proactive measures to improve standby power capability for mobile base stations and NBN infrastructure in areas of high bushfire risk; if not, why not; if so, (a) what are these measures, and (b) which of these measures will be complete in advance of the 2017-18 summer bushfire season. (2) Why does the Government not currently guarantee any minimum standby capability for mobile base stations and NBN infrastructure in areas of high bushfire risk. (3) Who is going to take responsibility for the maintenance of the copper network in areas where the NBN is being delivered through satellite or wireless technology, and in these areas, will there be a requirement to maintain the copper network to a certain standard; if not, why not; if so, what will that standard be. Mr Fletcher: The answer to the Member's question is as follows: (1) The Australian Government understands the importance of telecommunications services during an emergency or power outage. It is important to remember that no communications technology – fixed line or mobile – is completely resilient to power outages. Following the South Australian power outages, the Australian Government, through the Trusted Information Sharing Network (TISN), brought together interdependent sectors to identify lessons learnt and consider how governments and industry could better work together to improve cross-sectoral collaboration and information sharing with jurisdictions in emergency situations. (a) The Energy Sector Group of the TISN will run a cross sectoral exercise with representatives from the communications, energy and transport sectors in October 2017. (b) The Communications Sector Group of the TISN is considering how to model the redundancy of mobile communications (including mobile phone tower back up power) as it relates to public safety communications and will provide recommendations to the Australia-New Zealand Emergency Management Committee early in 2018. (c) The Department of Communications and the Arts has established an industry notification protocol to support the communications sector to report significant service disruptions as they unfold. These reports will then be shared with the relevant emergency services and the Australian Government Crisis Coordination Centre. Together, these additional measures will assist with information sharing across government and industry during events such as wide-scale power outages. (2) Mobile network operators take their responsibilities to support emergency response efforts and enabling communities' access to emergency services seriously. Mobile carriers are responsible for planning for, and investing in, arrangements for the continuity and restoration of mobile services in response to all hazards, including bush fires. The complex and dynamic nature of risks to communications critical infrastructure means that applying uniform compliance standards may be difficult (for example, it may not be safe or possible to access some base stations during or immediately following a fire) and may also inhibit the flexibility and innovation that is central to enhancing the resilience of critical infrastructure services and organisations. The Government did introduce measures to incentivise mobile carriers to provide increased auxiliary power to mobile base stations under round two of the Mobile Black Spot Program. This program is delivering 765 mobile base stations around Australia in total, and the Government gave additional weighting to proposals for new base stations which included additional backup power. However, it should be noted that battery backup can add a significant cost to the operation and maintenance of base stations, particularly in remote areas where base stations are often commercially unviable. (3) Under the Copper Continuity Obligation (CCO) of the Telstra Universal Service Obligation Performance Agreement (the Agreement), Telstra is required to maintain the existing copper network until 2032 in satellite and fixed wireless areas. Roads (Question No. 815) Ms Sharkie asked the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, in writing, on 7 September 2017: In respect of the National Land Transport Act 2014 s(5) criteria for a road to be added to the National Land Transport Network, specifically a road which connects a capital city and a major centre of commercial activity, will he define ""major centre of commercial activity"". Mr Chester: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: There are a variety of factors taken into account when determining a 'major centre of commercial activity', such as economic and population significance and strategic trading importance of individual links and export gateways.",256,Bills
