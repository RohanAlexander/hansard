This contributes as a carrier to the levy-do not is one of the cases where Australia is unique cover its own net costs in providing the in the world, leading the world in creating USO.

The argue that it really should be providing this government is creating a massive service for no consideration at all-or very government owned monopoly. But still, as little consideration. In any event, this the NBN is rolled out prior to the next contentious issue depends on whether the election, it means there is another part of the relevant costs are calculated for a new network where Telstra will no longer be the provider of the USO having to start from sole player. In fact, Telstra has agreed to scratch or an existing carrier with a network gradually decommission its legacy copper whose original costs have long since been customer access network and its hybrid fibre recovered. coax network and migrate customers to the NBN as the latter is rolled out. So the need to Mr Paul Paterson of Castalia, the change the way the USO is currently independent expert the government provided is, in large part, a response to the commissioned earlier this year to consider NBN. this question, largely agreed with Telstra, concluding that the company's net costs in But, even without the NBN, there is merit providing the USO aggregated with the cost in shifting the basis of the USO from a of the NRS and public payphones were in the regulatory requirement imposed on Telstra, order of between $250 million and $300 where its true cost is opaque and only partly million.

We in the to impose the one-size-fits-all NBN on every coalition have vigorously criticised Labor's part of the country without regard for either NBN for its decision to equalise wholesale cost or fitness for purpose. In the case of the broadband prices in the cities and in the bush USO, this manifests itself as the absence of via an embedded and opaque cross-subsidy any independent review mechanism to rather than a transparent transfer. We are ensure basic services delivered over this absolutely agreed that there should be an costly new government controlled monopoly equivalence in the cost of accessing are at least comparable in price and quality broadband across Australia, but we do not to those services delivered on the existing believe that that equivalence should be at the network. Most of all, we are concerned that cost of stamping out competition right the good public policy of moving to a direct around the nation and certainly should not be and transparent subsidy for the USO and at the cost of stamping out competition in putting it out to tender has been sullied, those areas in the cities where competition is avoided and eliminated by the incredibly very feasible and would occur were it not for poor public policy of entering into a prethe anti-competitive policies and practices of emptive 20-year contract where Telstra will the NBN and this government. continue to provide the USO as retailer of In our public policy principles, it would be last resort. Frankly, I think we can all inconsistent to criticise measures that make understand that this is, in truth, simply part the true cost of the USO clearer and ensure of the very generous consideration required that they are fully funded. Likewise, we have to gain Telstra's consent to the deal it agreed no objection to replacing two separate with the NBN Co. last June. On the issue of industry levies for the USO and the NRS, the bureaucracy, I note that TUSMA is just the national relay service, with a single levy. latest quango from a government that has Greater simplicity and less administrative undeniably achieved world's best practice in overhead are always useful guiding the creation of quangos.

Zhisheng, Mr Gao (Question No. 69) Mr Danby asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in writing, on 15 November 2010: In respect of Chinese human rights lawyer Mr Gao Zhisheng: (1) Has the Government raised the following issues with the Chinese Government: (a) that on 20 April 2010 Mr Gao was allegedly taken from the home of a relative by security agents; and (b) since then, Mr Gao family has not seen or heard from him, nor received information on his whereabouts; if so, what was the outcome; if not, when will these issues be raised and in what context. (2) Has the Government raised the following issues with the Chinese Government, that: (a) in 2006 Mr Gao was charged with 'inciting subversion' for defending religious minorities and other clients considered controversial; and (b) after Mr Gao's sentence was suspended, he was allegedly harassed and periodically detained, including from February 2009 until March 2010; if so, what was the outcome; if not, when will these issues be raised and in what context. Mr Rudd: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. Mr Gao was one of Australia's cases of concern submitted to Chinese authorities immediately prior to the 13th Australia-China Human Rights Dialogue, held in Beijing on 20 December 2010. We have not yet received a response from China. (2) Yes. China's response on (a) was that Mr Gao's case was in the judicial process, and it was therefore not appropriate to comment on his case, and on (b) that Mr Gao was a Chinese citizen and a criminal who had broken Chinese laws, and that China was a country ruled by law and did not welcome outside interference. Think Tanks and Policy Institutes (Question Nos 311 and 316) Mr Robert asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Trade, in writing, on 23 March 2011: (1) How many think tanks or policy institutes are funded by the Minister's department, and (a) what are (i) their names, and (ii) key areas of research, and (b) in what office/agency within the department do they fall.

(3) For each think tank or policy institute in part (1), on what date (a) was an announcement made that it would be formed, and (b) did it commence operating. Mr Rudd: On behalf of the Minister for Trade and myself, the answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: There are three Australian think tanks or policy institutes that are funded by the Foreign Affairs and Trade portfolio. Portfolio agencies also support a number of think tanks and policy institutes overseas. (1) (a) (i) Australian Institute of International Affairs (AIIA), Canberra ACT, (ii) The AIIA is an independent, non-profit organisation seeking to promote interest in and understanding of international affairs in Australia. Precluded by its constitution from expressing any opinion of its own on international affairs, the AIIA provides a forum for the presentation and discussion of a wide range of views. (b) Independent. Provided with funding by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT). (2) (a) 2007-08: $85,000 (b) 2008-09: $80,000 (c) 2009-10: $80,000 (d) 2010-11: $88,000 (3) (a) DFAT does not have a record of an announcement in relation to the establishment of this institute. (b) The AIIA was established as a national body in 1933. The AIIA grew out of an agreement between the three existing Australian branches of the Royal Institute of International Affairs. (1) (a)(i) Asia Pacific Civil-Military Centre of Excellence, Queanbeyan NSW, (ii) The Centre focuses on development of civil-military capabilities to prevent, prepare for, and respond more effectively to conflicts and disasters overseas.

(1) (a)(i) Asia Pacific Centre for the Responsibility to Protect, University of Queensland, (ii) The Centre aims to advance the concept of the Responsibility to Protect and support states to build capacity to protect civilians. (b) Independent. Provided with funding from AusAID. (2) (a) 2007-08: Nil (b) 2008-09: $293,952 (c) 2009-10: $500,692 (d) 2010-11: $2,521,658 (this includes $2 million for research grants under the Responsibility to Protect Fund, which is administered by the Centre and open to competitive applications from institutions, academia and non-government organisations). (3) (a) The Responsibility to Protect principle was unanimously adopted by world leaders at the 2005 UN World Summit. In August 2008, then Foreign Affairs Minister Smith announced that Australia would strengthen its support for the Responsibility to Protect principle by establishing a fund that would underpin work on the concept in Australia and overseas. (b) 20 February 2008. Foreign Affairs and Trade: Departmental Travel (Question No. 336) Ms Julie Bishop asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in writing, on 24 March 2011: How many departmental officials accompanied him on each of his overseas trips since the 2010 election, and what were their positions, and what was the total cost to the Government of their travel. Mr Rudd: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Note: Costs are as at 31 March 2011. Some costs have not yet have been finalised. (a) Mr Rudd travelled to Pakistan and the United States from 15 to 27 September 2010. Mr Rudd was accompanied by four Canberra-based DFAT staff (two in Washington and two in New York). The positions of the staff members who accompanied Mr Rudd were: First Assistant Secretary, Americas and Africa Division Head, UNSC Taskforce Assistant Secretary, International Organisations Branch Acting Departmental Liaison Officer The total cost of the staff members' travel was $57,028.89 (b) Mr Rudd travelled to Japan, Belgium, Italy and the Holy See from 12 to 20 October 2010.

The total cost of the staff member's travel was $12,517.34 (c) Mr Rudd travelled to China and the Republic of Korea from 31 October to 6 November 2010. Mr Rudd was accompanied by one Canberra-based DFAT staff member (to all destinations). The staff member who accompanied Mr Rudd was First Assistant Secretary, North Asia Division. The total cost of the staff member's travel was $13,078.54 (d) Mr Rudd travelled to the United Arab Emirates, Kazakhstan and Bahrain from 29 November to 6 December 2010. Mr Rudd was accompanied by two Canberra-based DFAT staff (to all destinations). The positions of the staff members who accompanied Mr Rudd were: (Acting) First Assistant Secretary, Europe Division Assistant Secretary, Middle East Branch The total cost of the staff members' travel was $27,698.36 (e) Mr Rudd travelled to Indonesia, Egypt, Jordan, Israel, the Palestinian Territories, Brazil and Chile from 8 to 20 December 2010. Mr Rudd was accompanied by four Canberra-based DFAT staff (two in Indonesia, one in the Middle East, and one in Brazil and Chile). The positions of the staff members who accompanied Mr Rudd were: First Assistant Secretary, South-East Asia Division First Assistant Secretary, South and West Asia and Middle East Division Ambassador for People Smuggling Issues Assistant Secretary, Canada and Latin America Branch The total cost of the staff members' travel was $39,665.66 (f) Mr Rudd travelled to Ethiopia, Switzerland, Turkey, Greece, Liechtenstein and Germany from 24 January to 7 February 2011. Mr Rudd was accompanied by five Canberra-based DFAT staff in total (two in Ethiopia, one in Switzerland, one in Turkey and Greece and two in Germany). The positions of the staff members who accompanied Mr Rudd were: (Acting) First Assistant Secretary, Europe Division Assistant Secretary, Africa Branch Assistant Secretary, Arms Control and Counter-Proliferation Branch Director, UNSC Taskforce Executive Officer, Climate Change and Environment Section The total cost of the staff members' travel was $73,168.18 (g) Mr Rudd travelled to South Africa, Egypt, Afghanistan, United Arab Emirates, Jordan, the Palestinian Territories, Israel, Saudi Arabia and Tunisia from 24 February to 12 March 2011. Mr Rudd was accompanied by three Canberra-based DFAT staff in total (two in South Africa, Egypt, Switzerland, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan and Tunisia; and three in the Palestinian Territories, Israel and Saudi Arabia). The positions of the staff members who accompanied Mr Rudd were: Assistant Secretary, Middle East Branch Executive Officer, Middle East and Northern Africa Section Diplomatic Courier The total cost of the staff members' travel was $76,739.29 United Nations Security Council: Resolutions (Question No. 353) Mr Danby asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in writing, on 10 May 2011: (1) Is he able to confirm that on 23 February 2011 Senegal cut diplomatic ties with Iran; if so, can he indicate whether this was based on Senegal's concerns about an arms shipment from Iran that landed in the Apapa port of Lagos, Nigeria, in July 2010. (2) Can he confirm that (a) this shipment of arms was in violation of United Nations sanctions under Security Council Resolution 1929 or any other resolution(s), and (b) the ship transporting these arms was owned by CMA CGM. (3) Can he confirm whether CMA CGM owned the ship Victoria, seized by Israel off Gaza on the 24 February 2011, and whether Victoria was on this occasion containing arms in violation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1929, or any other resolution(s). (4) Do ships operated by CMA CGM visit or transit in Australia; if so, (a) on what dates since 1 January 2007, and (b) were their cargoes inspected by Australian authorities; if so, were they found to be in breach of any United Nations Security Council resolutions. Mr Rudd: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) I ( Mr Rudd) can confirm that Senegal severed diplomatic relations with Iran on 23 February 2011 and that these relations have not since been restored. A communiquÃ© of the Senegalese Council of Ministers Meeting of 24 February 2011 stated that the President of Senegal condemned Iran's involvement and responsibility in the killing of Senegalese soldiers, through the supply of arms and munitions to rebels in the South Casamance region of Senegal. The communiquÃ© stated that the Senegalese army's ballistics expert had proven that munitions used against the Senegalese soldiers were of Iranian origin. DFAT is not aware of any reference to arms shipments through Nigeria in any statements on the matter by the Government of Senegal. (2) (a) The Australian Government has received no formal notification regarding the arms shipment from Iran. United Nations Security Council resolutions in relation to Iran prohibit Iran from supplying, as well as all States from procuring from Iran, any arms or related materiel or goods with an application in nuclear weapons programs or in the development of weapons delivery systems. (b) I cannot confirm media reports that the ship transporting the arms was owned by CMA-CGM. (3) According to information available to DFAT, the Victoria is a registered German vessel. I cannot confirm media reports that the Victoria was owned by the Peter Doehle Company of Germany. The feeder (shipping) company was CMA-CGM of France. An inspection of the ship's cargo by Israeli authorities in the Port of Ashdod revealed 40 tonnes of arms and ammunition in three containers, including: ï· 232 mortar shells (120mm) with rocket boosters ï· 2280 M61 mortar shells (60mm) with fuses ï· 6 Nasr-1 (C-704) anti-ship missiles ï· 2 naval radars for anti-ship missiles ï· 2 naval control stations for anti-ship missiles ï· 2 C-704 launchers ï· 66,240 bullets for Kalashnikov assault rifles (7.62mm calibre) The instruction manual attached to the Nasr-1 missiles on board the Victoria was in Farsi and carried the emblems of Iran and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps. The mortar shells were manufactured in Iran and accompanied by a range table in Farsi. Iran is prohibited by UNSC resolution 1747 from supplying arms or related materiel. All States are prohibited from procuring from Iran weapons on the UN Register of Conventional Arms, including battle tanks, armoured combat vehicles, large-calibre artillery systems, combat aircraft, attack helicopters, warships and missiles and missile launchers. (4) Yes. According to information provided to DFAT by the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service: (a) Between1 January 2007 and 18 November 2011, twenty four ships operated by CMA-CGM have arrived directly into Australian ports from overseas on a total of two hundred and seventy seven occasions. The majority of the arrivals were into Melbourne (117), Fremantle (71) and Botany Bay (56). (b) Customs and Border Protection manages a range of risks to the Australian border including prohibited, restricted and regulated goods. All air and sea cargo is risk-assessed electronically and all cargo identified as high risk is subject to physical examination. As part of normal Customs and Border Protection business, cargoes on CMA-CGM vessels were subject to these processes, and therefore inspected. No breaches of United Nations Security Council Resolutions have been identified. China: Detention (Question No. 364) Mr Danby asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in writing, on 12 May 2011: Has he raised with the Chinese Embassy in Canberra, the topic of the Chinese Government's detention of renowned Chinese artist Ai Weiwei, and other dissidents in China; if not, why not; if so, when, and can he indicate (a) whether Ai Weiwei has legal representation, and (b) what progress the Australian Government has made on behalf of those detained. Mr Rudd: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Ai Weiwei was released on bail on 22 June 2011. I am aware that Mr Ai currently has legal representation. The Australian Government looks to the Chinese authorities to deal with Mr Ai's case in a timely, fair and transparent manner. I raised Mr Ai's case with the Chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Mr Jia Qinglin, in Canberra in April 2011. Mr Ai was also on Australia's list of cases of human-rights concern passed to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs in April. Australia has made regular representations on behalf of dissidents in China and continues to engage China on cases of concern. Gauging the effectiveness of individual representations on human-rights matters is difficult. It is Australia's aim that our representations, taken together with representations by others in the international community, will encourage respect for human rights in China, including for detained political dissidents. Asylum Seekers (Question No. 433) Mr Morrison asked the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, in writing, on 20 June 2011: In respect of the funding that will be made to agencies under the proposed arrangement with Malaysia on irregular maritime arrivals, (a) what are the names of these agencies, (b) for what specific purpose(s) will each agency receive funding, (c) how will this funding be distributed amongst these agencies, and (d) for each of the 800 persons to be transferred, (i) what sum of funding will be provided, (ii) will payments be made upfront upon transfer, or annually; if annually, over what number of years, and (iii) are payments intended to cover the entire duration, or a fixed period, of each person's stay; if fixed, what is the estimated length of stay per person. Mr Bowen: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: On 13 October 2011 the Government announced that it will not be in a position to proceed with offshore processing of asylum seekers due to an absence of support for necessary amendments to the Migration Act. In view of this, the funding set aside in the 2011-12 Budget for implementation of the Malaysia Arrangement will be re-examined in the context of the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook. Broadband (Question No. 452) Mr Ramsey asked the Minister representing the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, in writing, on 5 July 2011: (1) Is the Minister aware that the town of Streaky Bay in SA has a population in excess of 1000 people and yet according to the NBN Co. Limited website, is not designated to receive a fibre broadband service. (2) Is the Minister aware that Streaky Bay is not designated to receive a wireless broadband service and that instead, the residents and businesses of this town are expected to access a satellite broadband service. (3) Can the Minister explain why the Government's commitment to providing a fibre broadband service to towns with populations in excess of 1000 is not being met in the case of Streaky Bay. (4) Why are the towns of Wudinna and Cummins, being significant centres and both adjacent to optic fibre cables, not designated to receive a fibre broadband service. Mr Albanese: The Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: The Government's objective is that NBN Co's fibre network cover 93 per cent of Australian homes, schools and work places. The indicator of where the fibre network is expected to be rolled out is 1,000 premises, not 1,000 people as suggested in the question. All premises beyond the 93 per cent fibre footprint will be served by a combination of next-generation fixed-wireless and satellite technologies providing peak speeds of 12 megabits per second. These platforms will provide customers with significantly improved service with average data rates higher than most users of these technologies experience today in metropolitan areas and certainly higher than the current average DSL speeds. NBN Co is considering proposals to extend the fibre to the premises coverage in some locations if external funding-such as from state or local governments-can be provided to offset the incremental costs. Broadband (Question No. 454) Mr Irons asked the Minister representing the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, in writing, on 6 July 2011: Why did construction of the National Broadband Network (NBN) not begin in Victoria Park during the second quarter of 2011; when will such construction now (a) begin, and (b) finish; and when will NBN services become available in this suburb. Mr Albanese: The Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: NBN Co Limited (NBN Co) revised the second release sites program taking into account delays in finalising the Definitive Agreements with Telstra, and to align with the government's points of interconnection policy. NBN Co has now released its first 12-month national fibre rollout schedule, which lists the communities in each state and territory where work will begin between now and September 2012. Design and construction work has already begun on the Victoria Park site, which will cover 16,200 premises. A detailed rollout map of the Victoria Park site was released on 14 November 2011. NBN Co expects that it will take on average 12 months from the start of the fibre network rollout in a given area until NBN services become available. AusAID: Tertiary Scholarships (Question No. 459) Ms Gambaro asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in writing, on 6 July 2011: How many tertiary scholarships were awarded by AusAID in (a) 2009-10, and (b) 2010-11, broken down by the (i) total number awarded per country of origin of the student, (ii) total dollar value per country, and (iii) areas of study undertaken by course title. Mr Rudd: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) AusAID awarded 1,401 tertiary scholarships in 2009-10 (b) AusAID awarded 1,766 tertiary scholarships in 2010-11 Please see AnnexA for (i) country allocations, AnnexB for (ii) country expenditure and AnnexC for (iii) course titles for 2009-10 and 2010-11.

representing the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, in writing, on 18 August 2011. Further to his answer to question in writing No. 392 (House Hansard, 16 August 2011, page 90), if, as the Minister indicated, the Implementation Study was not a feasibility study, why did the Government not conduct a feasibility study into the National Broadband Network before proceeding with this investment. Mr Albanese: The Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: As stated in response to Question No. 110, a detailed National Broadband Network Implementation Study undertaken by McKinsey& Company/KPMG was completed in March 2010 and publicly released on 6 May 2010. The Implementation Study provided 84 recommendations for the government to consider, covering technology, financing, ownership, policy and market structure. On 20 December 2010, the government released the NBN Co Limited Corporate Plan, which shows that the National Broadband Network will provide all Australians with world class broadband on a financially viable basis with affordable consumer prices. That is, the project is feasible if structured on the basis of a rate of return above the government bond rate. The government made its investment decision to provide equity to fund the National Broadband Network on the basis of the advice of NBN Co that the project was feasible, supported by independent verification by financial advisory firm Greenhill Caliburn. Consular Assistance: Uninsured Australian Travellers (Question No. 544) Ms Julie Bishop asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in writing, on 18 August 2011: Does his department have an estimate of the number of uninsured Australian travellers; if so, what is it. Mr Rudd: The answer to the honourable memberâs question is as follows: The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade does not keep a record of the number of Australians who travel overseas without travel insurance. The Insurance Council of Australia estimates that around 15 to 20 percent of Australians who travel internationally do not have insurance. Consular Assistance: Uninsured Australian Travellers (Question No. 545) Ms Julie Bishop asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in writing, on 18 August 2011: Does his department maintain data on the proportion of travellers who seek consular assistance and are uninsured; if not, why not. Mr Rudd: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: No. Although the benefits to travellers of appropriate insurance coverage are clear, the department provides consular assistance whether travellers have insurance or not. Consular staff are not always made aware of travel insurance coverage at the time that consular assistance is provided and cannot compel Australian citizens to provide details of travel insurance. Insurance policies are private contracts between travellers and the insurers. Foreign Affairs and Trade: Senior Executive Service (Question Nos 563 and 577) Mr Briggs asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Trade, in writing, on 25 August 2011: How many staff were employed by the Minister's department in the Senior Executive Service (ie, SES) on 1 July (a) 2008, and (b) 2011. Mr Rudd: On behalf of the Minister for Trade and myself, the answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) 198. (b) 216. Digital Switchover Household Assistance Scheme (Question No. 590) Mr Fletcher asked the Minister representing the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, in writing, on 12 September 2011: In respect of the $308.8 million allocated in 2011-12 to the Digital Switchover Household Assistance Scheme for the roll out in regional NSW, ACT, Tasmania, Northern Territory, Western Australia and State capital cities: (1) What is the population of each area, including each State capital city. (2) What combined number of individuals and couples has the Government determined will be prima facie eligible in each area for a set top box by reason of being recipients of the maximum rate of (a) an Age Pension, or a (b) Disability Support Pension, (c) Carer Payment, or (d) Department of Veteransâ Affairs (i) Service Pension, or (ii) Income Support Supplement. (3) How many of those who are or will be prima facie eligible has the Government estimated will not be eligible by reason of already having access to digital television on any of the televisions that they own. (4) Does access to digital free to air services through a pay television service constitute already having access to digital television; if so, how many of those who would be prima facie eligible in part (3) does the Government estimate would fall into this category. Mr Albanese: The Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy has provided the following answer to the honourable memberâs question: (1) This information is available from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. (2) The estimated number of potentially eligible households in each of the switchover areas, based on information from Centrelink, is: Switchover area Potentially eligible households Regional NSW/ACT 308 941 Tasmania (including Hobart) 59 233 Perth 117 473 Brisbane 235 968 Adelaide 142 168 Melbourne 345 632 Sydney 345 960 Darwin6 782 Remote Central and Eastern Australia 18 918 Remote and Regional Western Australia 36 729 (3) Extensive work is undertaken to estimate the number of households that may seek assistance under the scheme, taking account of factors such as digital conversion in the home, including via pay TV. It is estimated the total number of households that will take up the assistance available will be around 700 000. The projected number in each switchover area is not disclosed in advance, as disclosure of this information would compromise future negotiations with tenderers in remaining switchover areas. (4) Yes. See (3) Digital Switchover Household Assistance Scheme (Question No. 591) Mr Fletcher asked the Minister representing the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, in writing, on 12 September 2011: (1) In what areas has the Scheme already been rolled out, and in each of these areas, what (a) is the take up rate, and (b) combined number of individuals and couples has the Government determined would be prima facie eligible for a set top box by reason of being recipients of the maximum rate of (i) an Age Pension, or a (ii) Disability Support Pension, (iii) Carer Payment, or (iv) Department of Veterans' Affairs Service Pension, or Income Support Supplement. (2) How many of those who are or will be prima facie eligible for a set top box has the Government estimated will not be eligible by reason of already having access to digital television on any of the televisions that they own. (3) Does access to digital free to air services through a pay television service constitute already having access to digital television; if so, how many of those who would be prima facie eligible in part (2) does the Government estimate would fall into this category. (4) What is the budgeted cost of the roll out for each area, and the actual costs that have been or are expected to be incurred based on take up. Mr Albanese: The Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) The Household Assistance Scheme (HAS) has already been rolled out to the Mildura/Sunraysia, regional South Australia and Broken Hill, and regional Victoria switchover areas. It is currently being rolled out in regional Queensland. (a) The take-up of potentially eligible households for each area where the rollout has been completed is: (i) Mildura/Sunraysia 35.9%; (ii) regional South Australia/Broken Hill 34.5%; and (iii) regional Victoria 22.96%. (b) The estimated number of potentially eligible households for each area, based on information from Centrelink, is: (i) Mildura/Sunraysia 7 386 (ii) regional South Australia/Broken Hill 29 387 (iii) regional Victoria 120 434 (iv) regional Queensland 123 351 (2) Extensive work is undertaken to estimate the number of households that may seek assistance under the scheme, taking account of factors such as digital conversion in the home, including via pay TV. It is estimated the total number of households that will take up the assistance available will be around 700 000. The projected number in each switchover area is not disclosed in advance, as disclosure of this information would compromise future negotiations with tenderers in remaining switchover areas. (3) Yes. See (2). (4) The 2009-10 Federal Budget allocated $69.5 million to rollout HAS to the Mildura/Sunraysia, regional South Australia and Broken Hill, regional Victoria and regional Queensland switchover areas. The 2011-12 Federal Budget allocated $308.8 million to rollout HAS to all remaining switchover areas. Of these appropriations, as at 30 September 2011, the Department had expensed $23.2 million in relation to the rollouts in the above switchover areas. This does not include expenses incurred by Centrelink. The expense incurred in each rollout area is not disclosed, as disclosure of this information would compromise future negotiations with tenderers in remaining switchover areas. As a demanddriven program, any savings from a lower-than-expected uptake are returned to the Budget. Foreign Affairs and Trade: Advertising Expenditure (Question No. 627) Ms Julie Bishop asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in writing, on 22 September 2011: What was his department's total expenditure on advertising in 2010-11, and what was the program breakdown for this expenditure. Mr Rudd: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Department's 2010-11 Annual Report includes information on advertising expenditure during 201011. This information is summarised below: Program Expenditure on Advertising $'000 1.1 Other Departmental 250.1 2.1 Consular Services 584.4 3.1 Other Departmental 22.6 3.2 Overseas Property 29.6 Asia-Pacific: Curable Blindness (Question No. 631) Ms Julie Bishop asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in writing, on 22 September 2011: In respect of curable blindness in the Asia-Pacific region, (a) since 24 November 2007, what sum of money has the Australian Government spent on addressing this condition, and (b) what countries are receiving Australian Government assistance to address this condition. Mr Rudd: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) Australia has spent about $55 million on addressing preventable blindness in the Asia-Pacific region since 24 November 2007. (b) The countries that are receiving Australian Government assistance to address curable blindness in the Asia-Pacific region are: Bangladesh, Burma, Cambodia, China, East Timor, Fiji, India, Indonesia, Laos, Nepal, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu and Vietnam. Asia-Pacific: Eye Health Professionals Training (Question No. 633) Ms Julie Bishop asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in writing, on 22 September 2011: Since 24 November 2011, what sum has been spent on training eye health professionals, including ophthalmologists and ophthalmic nurses, to support local surgical capacity in the Asia-Pacific region. Mr Rudd: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Noting that the date 24 November 2011 lies in the future, in line with the honourable member's other questions, since 24 November 2007, over $6 million has been spent on training eye health professionals, including ophthalmologists and ophthalmic nurses, to support local surgical capacity in the Asia-Pacific region. Public Housing Residents (Question No. 638) Mr Fletcher asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social Housing and Homelessness, in writing, on 11 October 2011: In respect of the subheading 'Public housing tenants' (page 14) of the Clean Energy, Future Supporting Australian households brochure, where it indicates that assistance will not be included in State government public housing rent setting calculations so that public housing residents get the full benefit of assistance, (a) how can the Australian Government guarantee this claim, and (b) what (i) negotiations are underway between, and (ii) arrangements have been finalised by, the Australian Government and the State and Territory governments on this matter. Ms Macklin: The Minister for Social Housing and Homelessness has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (a) and (b)(i)(ii) State and Territory Governments are responsible for setting public housing rents. It is the Australian Government's intention that carbon price assistance is not included in the calculation of public housing rents by State and Territory Governments. The Prime Minister has written to all State and Territory Premiers and Chief Ministers, seeking confirmation that the Clean Energy Advance and the Clean Energy Supplements be permanently exempt from public housing rent calculations. The Prime Minister also asked that this exemption also be extended to community housing providers to ensure equity with public housing tenants. This request is consistent with the current approach where supplements to government payments, such as the Pension Supplement and Carer Supplement, are excluded from public housing rent calculations. Dawson Electorate: Digital Switchover Household Assistance Scheme (Question No. 640) Mr Christensen asked the Assistant Treasurer, in writing, on 11 October 2011: In respect of the digital set-top box program announced in the 2011-12 Budget, in the electoral division of Dawson, (a) how many pensioner households have received their free digital set-top box, and (b) what sum has been expended under the program (i) in total, and (ii) by postcode. Mr Shorten: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) Based on information provided by the Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy (DBCDE), as at 9 November 2011, the Digital Switchover Household Assistance Scheme (HAS) has provided 1,378 installations to households in Dawson under the measure announced in the 2009-10 Budget to provide assistance to households in regional Queensland to switch to digital television. Installations are expected to continue in 2012 as eligible households are able to opt-in to the HAS until 6 January 2012. (b) Based on information provided by DBCDE, total expenses under the HAS will not be known until conclusion of the installation process, which is expected to be in early 2012. Broadband (Question No. 649) Mr Fletcher asked the Minister representing the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, in writing, on 11 October 2011: In respect of the first report on the National Broadband Network (NBN) rollout (Shareholder Ministers, Government report to Joint Committee on the National Broadband Network on NBN Co Ltd and its subsidiaries as at 30 June 2011, 23 September 2011): (a) what are the findings of the post implementation review following the practical completion of the NBN's five mainland First Release Sites, (b) over the next two years, how many premises in Queensland, NSW and the ACT will be passed by the portion of the network to be built by Silcar Pty Limited, (c) what is the average time period between a developer making an application to NBN Co. Limited, and a contract being signed by both parties, (d) under how many of the 403 developer contracts is construction expected to be completed in (i) 2011-12, (ii) 2012-13, and (iii) 2013-14, and (e) what sum is Fujitsu being paid per premises for construction of the Greenfields networks, and (f) what is meant by '...the transfer of bow wave applications back to Telstra...' (page 11), and under what circumstances might it occur. Mr Albanese: The Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (a) NBN Co is still undertaking its post implementation review to examine the quality of the outcomes in first release sites and to ensure that the lessons have been documented, communicated and applied in subsequent projects. (b) On1 June 2011, NBN Co announced that it had entered into an agreement covering all brownfield construction in Queensland, New South Wales and the ACT which represents almost 40 per cent of national construction activity planned over the next two years. On 18 October 2011, NBN Co released its first 12-month national rollout plan. The schedule lists the communities in each state and territory where work on the fibre network will begin before September 2012. This national rollout plan indicates the following: Built and ready for Work underway Design and Construction service to start within 12 months NSW 7 400 26 000 117 300 QLD 3 000 11 600 85 600 ACT 6 000 14 800 NBN Co has advised that this schedule will be updated quarterly and that an indicative three-year schedule will be released in 2012. (c) NBN Co receives hundreds of new applications each month and as such, the following numbers are taken as at 11 October 2011. NBN Co plans delivery of fibre to precede premises being occupied in all contracted developments. The average number of days from application assessment to contract signature is 33 days. (d) As of 11 October 2011, the number of developer contracts under which construction is expected to be completed is 596 for 2011-12, 341 for 2012-13 and 4 for 2013-14. (e) On 13 May 2011, NBN Co announced that it had appointed Fujitsu Australia Limited as its prime alliance partner to deliver fibre infrastructure to new developments. Under the agreement, Fujitsu will manage the design, construction and associated works for the deployment of fibre to new developments, with the initial value estimated at over $100 million for the first 12 months. Information contained within the NBN Co/Fujitsu contract is a commercial matter for both companies. (f) The bow-wave applications represent the backlog of requests received from developers for fibre deployments that were not completed prior to NBN Co becoming the provider of last resort on 1 January 2011. The transfer of these applications back to Telstra is a one-off occurrence and has already taken place. Broadband (Question No. 651) Mr Fletcher asked the Prime Minister, in writing, on 11 October 2011: Can the Prime Minister explain the apparent discrepancy between her statements to the House (Hansard, 18 November 2010, page 3018) and on ABC Radio (25 November 2010), indicating that a national broadband model with retail price competition results in cheaper prices for consumers; and the statements by NBN Co. Limited (NBN Co. Discussion Paper: Introducing NBN Co's Special Access Undertaking, July 2011, page 26) indicating that the system will result in current retail prices for broadband services being maintained. Ms Gillard: I am advised that the answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The National Broadband Network (NBN) will support increased retail competition, which is expected to result in lower prices for consumer broadband services and drive increased usage by consumers. A number of retail service providers have already released their NBN service plans. These compare favourably with existing ADSL plans, while delivering superior performance and the option to upgrade to speeds much faster than those available on the copper network. In relation to the NBN Co Limited (NBN Co) Special Access Undertaking discussion paper, page 26 discusses NBN wholesale (not retail) prices. E-Books (Question No. 652) Mr Windsor asked the Minister for the Arts, in writing, on 11 October 2011: (1) Has the Governments attention been drawn to claims that the United States digital rights management and distribution company, Overdrive, is dominating the supply of e-books to Australian public libraries and that this domination has led to reduced equity, quality and consistency of access to e-books for the Australian community, as well as an erosion of Australian authors'' intellectual property rights. (2) Will the Government consider the establishment of a national licensing system for the distribution of e-books to guarantee equitable access for Australian readers; if so, will the Government consider involving the National Library in such a scheme. Mr Crean: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The government is aware of such claims. (2) The final report of the Book Industry Strategy Group, set up by Senator the Hon Kim Carr, Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, was released in early November. One of the group's recommendations was that Australian publishers work to clarify the business model for the sale and use of ebooks by libraries. The government will consider and respond to the group's recommendations in due course. National Energy Security Assessment (Question No. 654) Mr Hartsuyker asked the Minister for Resources and Energy, in writing, on 12 October 2011: On what date will he publish the next National Energy Security Assessment. Mr Martin Ferguson: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The 2011 National Energy Security Assessment (NESA) was publicly released on 13 December 2011. It can be found on my departmentâs website: http://www.ret.gov.au/. Australian Rail Track Corporation (Question No. 656) Mr Fletcher asked the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, in writing, on 12 October 2011: (1) Is the Government's $558.2 million equity injection into the Australian Rail Track Corporation (ARTC) in July 2010 included in the 2010-11 (a) underlying cash balance, and (b) fiscal balance. (2) What is the value of the Government's equity holding in the ARTC. (3) On what page is the value of the Government's equity holding in the ARTC recorded in the Budget Financial Statements (BFS), and does it form part of the line item 'Investments in Other Public Sector Entities' in Table2 of the BFS (page 9-4). (4) How regularly are the Government's equity holdings re-valued, and when was the Government's equity holding in the ARTC last re-valued. (5) If the Government's equity holding in the ARTC was re-valued (a) upwards, and (b) downwards, where would this be recorded in the BFS. Mr Albanese: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) No. (2) Refer to BFS. (3) Yes. (4) Annual basis. (5) Within the BFS. Queensland: Roads (Question No. 659) Mr Truss asked the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, in writing, on 12 October 2011: Further to his answer to question in writing No. 405 (I, 7 July 2011, page 8123), what sum of savings have come from the Ipswich Motorway upgrade-Dinmore to Goodna project. Mr Albanese: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Any project savings are applied to other projects as agreed between the Commonwealth and the State. McEwen Highway: Mobile Phone Coverage (Question No. 661) Mr Katter asked the Minister representing the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, in writing, on 13 October 2011: In respect of mobile phone coverage on the McEwen Highway between Charters Towers and Ravenshoe, (a) have investigations been held on the lack of coverage; if so, between who, and can he indicate the outcome, and (b) by when will coverage be made available. Mr Albanese: The Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: The Australian Government understands the importance of mobile telephony to Australians. In recent years the mobile phone carriers have significantly expanded their terrestrial mobile networks. Vodafone Hutchison Australia claims its networks currently cover more than 94 per cent of the Australian population. Optus claims its 3G network provides services to 97 per cent of the Australian population. Telstra claims its NextG network now provides mobile coverage to 99 per cent of Australians. For the most part the recent extension of mobile coverage across Australia has been based on commercial decisions by carriers. In making a decision to extend coverage to a particular area, carriers will consider a range of factors, including site availability, cost structures, likely levels of demand from users and overall economic viability of the service. Telstra is the only carrier that provides mobile telephony in the Charters Towers district. The Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy sought advice from Telstra in regard to mobile coverage on the McEwen Highway between Charters Towers and Ravenshoe. Telstra advised they have on numerous occasions looked at the feasibility of providing coverage to this area. However, they have determined that it is not commercially viable to do so. Telstra also advised they will continue to review investment decisions as part of their ongoing network planning. In areas that are sparsely populated or have little passing traffic, often the only commercially viable option for mobile phone services is via satellite. Unlike terrestrial mobile coverage, satellite mobile phone services cover the entire Australian landmass and population, and are available from a number of providers. The Satellite Phone Subsidy Scheme improves the affordability of mobile communications for people living and working in areas without terrestrial mobile coverage, by providing subsidies for the purchase of satellite phone handsets. The scheme provides up to $1000 for eligible applicants who live in areas without terrestrial mobile coverage or up to $700 for eligible applicants who live in areas that have coverage, but spend more than 180 days across a two year period in non-coverage areas. Under the scheme's rules, those eligible to apply include individuals, small businesses, community groups, not-for-profit organisations, Indigenous corporations, emergency service organisations, health organisations and educational institutions. Further information is available at www.dbcde.gov.au/satphone. National Rental Affordability Scheme (Question No. 663) Mr Christensen asked the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, in writing, on 13 October 2011: What has been the total cost of the National Rental Affordability Scheme (a) nationally, (b) in Australia, (c) in Queensland, (d) in the electoral division of Dawson, and (e) in Mackay in Queensland, and for parts (a) to (e), how many dwellings have been (i) constructed, and (ii) approved but not yet constructed, under the scheme. Mr Burke: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) and (b) Amount provided to Approved Participants as National Rental Affordability Scheme financial incentives (cash or tax offset) by the Australian Government nationally. 2008-09 $593,536.13 2009-10 $6,979,047.96 2010-11 $17,518,104.80 Total $25,090,688.89 Number of dwellings under the Scheme (i) As at 30 September 2011 there are 4,604 dwellings tenanted or available for rent; and (ii) 19,812 incentives reserved (not yet delivered) nationally. (c) Amount provided to Approved Participants as National Rental Affordability Scheme financial incentives (cash or tax offset) by the Australian Government in Queensland. 2008-09 $12,319.08 2009-10 $701,986.57 2010-11 $3,133,216.24 Total $3,847,521.89 Number of dwellings under the Scheme (i) As at 30 September 2011, there are 1,054 dwellings tenanted or available for rent; and (ii) 5,890 incentives reserved (not yet delivered) in Queensland. (d) Amount provided to Approved Participants as National Rental Affordability Scheme financial incentives (cash or tax offset) by the Australian Government in the electorate of Dawson. 2008-09 $0.00 2009-10 $0.00 2010-11 $4,939.35 Total $4,939.35 Number of dwellings under the Scheme (i) As at 30 September 2011, there are 19 dwellings tenanted or available for rent; and (ii) 232 incentives reserved (not yet delivered) in the electorate of Dawson. (e) Amount provided to Approved Participants as National Rental Affordability Scheme financial incentives (cash or tax offset) by the Australian Government in Mackay and its surrounds (postcode 4740). 2008-09 $0.00 2009-10 $0.00 2010-11 $1,633.93 Total $1,633.93 Number of dwellings under the Scheme (i) As at 30 September 2011, there is 1 dwelling tenanted or available for rent; and (ii) 108 incentives have been supported or reserved (not yet delivered) in Mackay and its surrounds (postcode 4740). Human Services: Service Delivery Reform (Question No. 665) Mr Fletcher asked the Minister for Human Services, in writing, on 13 October 2011: What is the progress of Service Delivery Reform and improvements in the areas outlined on page 19 of her department's Reform of Government Savings Scorecard (November 2007 to May 2010). Ms Plibersek: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: In the past year, my department has made good progress on implementing key foundation elements to support Service Delivery Reform. Progress on initiatives outlined in the Scorecard includes: Common service delivery: the Department of Human Services is achieving more cost effective and efficient service delivery by integrating Medicare Australia, Centrelink, and the Department of Human Services (including Chid Support Program) into a single department of state. An expanded range of services is available to customers through co-located Medicare, Centrelink and Child Support services. It is intended that all offices will be co-located by 2014 15. Case management: my department is providing more intensive support for those who need it. Case coordination trials will involve assessing a customer's whole circumstances and providing more integrated support for vulnerable people and people facing complex or multiple challenges. There are seven trial sites as at 26 October 2011, with 44 sites to be rolled out across Australia by 2014-15. Local Connections to Work supports the Government's participation agenda through nine sites offering joined up services to long-term unemployed job seekers. This is a new initiative that provides joint interviews with a range of service providers for people in disadvantaged locations who have been unemployed for some time. There will be 24 Local Connections to Work sites in disadvantaged locations by 2014-15. Automation, authentication and registration: my department is providing better online services for those customers who choose to self manage by moving towards simpler, easier and more efficient interactions through more automation, and streamlined and integrated registration processes. Since February 2011, customers have been able to lodge Medicare claims online. Currently, customers can claim a number of common claim types through online services, without the need to visit a shopfront. A single online entry point has been created for Human Services customers to access their online Centrelink, Medicare and Child Support accounts through australia.gov.au, rather than having to log into three separate accounts. Customers will be able to 'tell us once', if they wish. This means that if a customer wishes to update their information such as changes to address and phone number across different departmental programs, they can do it once, rather than going to each part of the department they deal with. Information will only be shared across the department with the customer's consent. Data management: as part of Service Delivery Reform, my department has carried out extensive work to ensure appropriate privacy protections, including regular consultation with the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner. The department will ensure that databases containing personal information collected for different programs remain logically separated. Service Delivery Reform will not extend to any clinical health records. Apart from the limited data that is already shared across the department, for example between Medicare Australia and Centrelink, personal information will only be shared between programs with customer consent or legislative authority. Joint Light Tactical Vehicle Program (Question No. 689) Mr Robert asked the Minister for Defence, in writing, on 13 October 2011: (1) Can he indicate the current status of the United States Joint Light Tactical Vehicle program. (2) What sum did Australia commit to this program. (3) What benefit has Australia received from this program. (4) What has the Government done to promote the Bushmaster into the United States market. Mr Stephen Smith: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The US Joint Light Tactical Vehicle Program is moving from a Technology Development to an Engineering Manufacturing and Development phase, and should release a Request for Proposal to industry in late 2011. (2) In 2009 Australia committed USD $30.405 million (AUD $43.105 million) to participate in the Technology Development phase of the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle program. It is important to note that no contribution or commitment has been made by Australia to enter the next phase of the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle program. (3) This investment has allowed valuable insights and knowledge into the US program, three Australians to work inside the US Joint Light Tactical Vehicle Product Office, the opportunity for the Capability Development Group to refine requirements and for reliability, user and survivability testing to occur here in Australia. All this will directly support future stages of this project. (4) With specific reference to the United States Market, Thales (Australian Defence Industries at the time) endeavoured to enter the US market with the Bushmaster via a commercial partnering arrangement. The Department of Defence provided support to Thales in this process, including facilitation provided by the Defence Export Unit, and by providing original Bushmaster Protected Mobility Vehicle requirements documentation to the US Government. In addition 'Team Australia', an Australian Government initiative where DMO joined with Australia's defence industry to showcase Australian defence capability solutions, promoted the Bushmaster at the Association of US Army (AUSA) Conference. To date there has been no success. Defence: Energy Consumption (Question No. 690) Mr Briggs asked the Minister for Defence, in writing, on 13 October 2011: What was the total cost of energy consumption for his department in 2010-11. Mr Stephen Smith: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The total cost of energy consumption for the Department of Defence in financial year 2010-11 was $402.6 million. In financial year 2010-11, Defence consumed $282.4 million of fuel. This included $156.6 million on aviation fuels, $88.2 million on marine diesel, and $37.6 million on ground fuel. In financial year 2010-11, Defence spent $113.7 million on electricity and $6.5 million on natural gas. Defence: Corporate Credit Cards (Question No. 691) Mr Briggs asked the Minister for Defence, in writing, on 13 October 2011: How many credit cards are currently issued to his departmental staff, and what was the total cost of the transactions made on such cards in 2010-11. Mr Stephen Smith: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: In 2010-11, Defence and Defence Materiel Organisation (DMO) had 70,061 corporate credit cards on issue, with a total spend of $597 million comprising 1.86 million individual transactions. Defence and DMO use two types of corporate credit cards; the Defence Purchasing Card (DPC) which had 6,682 cards on issue with a total spend of $288 million, comprising 336,611 transactions and the Defence Travel Card (DTC) which had 63,379 cards on issue with a total spend of $309.4 million comprising 1,522,911 transactions. Broadband (Question No. 692) Ms Marino asked the Minister representing the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, in writing, on 31 October 2011: (1) By what date is the National Broadband Network (NBN) scheduled to be rolled-out in the electoral division of Forrest. (2) Which towns in this electorate (a) will, and (b) will not, have a fibre optic cable connection to premises. (3) Through which towns in this electorate will the NBN fibre connection pass without being connected to premises because the towns lay outside the NBN's agreed fibre connection zone. (4) What is the estimated cost of connecting premises to the NBN in each town in this electorate in the year it will be rolled-out, and the subsequent two years. (5) What is the estimated monthly cost of the NBN provision for an average household in this electorate in the year it will be rolled-out. Mr Albanese: The Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) NBN Co has not yet indicated dates for the fibre network rollout in the electorate of Forrest. However, NBN Co has now released its first 12-month national rollout schedule. The rollout schedule will be updated each quarter to include new locations and is available on NBN Co's website. NBN Co plans to complete the rollout of its fixed wireless network, including to some communities in the Forrest electorate, by 2015. On1 July 2011, NBN Co launched its Interim Satellite Service (ISS) which offers improved broadband services to eligible users in regional areas, ahead of the introduction of a long term satellite solution in 2015. (2) Indicative coverage maps published by NBN Co suggest that Augusta, Bunbury, Busselton, Capel, Collie, Donnybrook, Dunsborough, Harvey, Margaret River, Nannup and Yarloop may be served by fibre to the premises technology. NBN Co's maps indicate that the towns of Boyanup and Cowaramup may be served by next generation fixed wireless technology providing speeds of 12 megabits per second (Mbps). All remaining premises will be served by next-generation satellite technology providing speeds of 12 Mbps. These maps are indicative only and the precise optic fibre footprint will only be known when NBN Co completes its detailed suburb-by-suburb, region-by-region designs for the network. (3) NBN Co's current network planning for the fibre footprint includes the assumption that, where transit backhaul passes communities with greater than 500 premises, the fibre footprint may be extended to cover these communities. Under these current network planning guidelines no community with less than 500 premises, even if passed by the fibre transit backhaul routes, will be connected to fibre. (4) NBN Co's detailed expenditure forecasts for cost to pass particular premises are commercial-inconfidence. Information on the expenditure associated with the rollout can be found in NBN Co's Corporate Plan. (5) NBN Co offers a wholesale-only service, and monthly retail costs are a matter for retail service providers. However, prices for NBN plans released to date compare very favourably to existing ADSL plans, while delivering a superior end user experience and the option to upgrade to faster speeds not available over the copper network. For example, Exetel has announced NBN plans starting from $34.50 for a 12 Mbps download and 1 Mbps upload service with 20 gigabyte (GB) data allowance. iiNet has announced NBN plans starting from $49.95 per month for a 12 Mbps service with 40 GB of data allowance. Retail service providers also offer a range of plans with significantly higher speeds and data allowances for interested customers. Importantly, there is no additional line rental fee with NBN services, as typically charged by retailers for an ADSL service. Service providers such as Exetel and Internode provide a phone service at no extra charge with their broadband plans, and iiNet offers a phone service for an additional $9.95 per month with their broadband plans that includes free local and national calls. The government expects that retail service providers will continue to announce competitive NBN pricing plans in the coming months. Immigration and Citizenship: Offshore Commercial and Rental Properties (Question No. 693) Mr Morrison asked the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, in writing, on 31 October 2011: In respect of premises used by his department overseas: (a) what is the location of each, (b) how many are (i) leased, and (ii) owned, (c) what number of staff are in each, (d) what is the size of each, (e) what is the rent per square metre of each that is rented, (f) what is the estimated value of each that is owned, and (g) what are the variable and fixed costs for each. Mr Bowen: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Copies of TablesA and B can be obtained from the House of Representatives Table Office. Contained in the tables: TableA provides details on commercial properties which DIAC lease and includes the number of staff located at each post. TableB provides details on residential properties which DIAC lease as accommodation for A based staff on posting. DIAC is unable to provide any details of the estimated value of the properties owned by the Department of Foreign Affairs as they do not provide these details to tenants. Private Health Insurance (Question No. 694) Mr Christensen asked the Minister for Health and Ageing, in writing, on 31 October 2011: Does she have the power to intervene in matters involving a private health insurance policy holder and a private health insurer; if so, in what circumstances? Ms Roxon: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Minister has a number of powers that are set out in Part 5-2 â General enforcement methods, of the Private Health Insurance Act 2007 (the Act), that enables the Minister to intervene in a matter involving a private health insurance policy holder and a private health insurer that involves the insurer's compliance with its enforceable obligations. Section 185-1 of the Act sets out that the Minister has the power to find out whether a private health insurer is complying with its enforceable obligations and to encourage or compel an insurer to comply with those obligations. The Minister can: (a) set performance indicators for insurers; (b) seek explanations from the insurers; (c) investigate insurers; (d) obtain enforceable obligations from insurers; (e) direct insurers to do particular things; (f) seek remedies in the Federal Court; (g) revoke an insurer's entitlement to offer tax rebates as premium reductions. Section 185-5 of the Act sets out the enforceable obligations an insurer must comply with under the Act. Pertinent to a matter that may involve a private health insurance policy holder and a private health insurer, these are: (a) a provision of the Act; (b) a provision of any Private Health Insurance Rules made under section 333-20 or 333-25 of the Act; (c) a direction given to a private health insurer under the Act. Queen Elizabeth II: Diamond Jubilee (Question No. 695) Mr Slipper asked the Prime Minister, in writing, on 1 November 2011: In respect of the recent visit to Australia by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, and the answer to question in writing no. 198 (Hansard, 10 May 2011, page 3500), is the Prime Minister in a position to (a) provide an update on how Australia will commemorate the Diamond Jubilee of the accession to the Throne of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II in 20 I 2, and (b) advise whether the Government is creating a commemorative Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal (as the Canadian Government is doing) to honour both Her Majesty and the significant contributions and achievements by Australians; if not, why not. Ms Gillard: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The focus of Australian Government recognition of Her Majesty The Queen's Diamond Jubilee will be support for and involvement with the ""Queen Elizabeth Diamond Jubilee Trust "". As jointly announced by Prime Minister Cameron and me during CHOGM in Perth on 28 October 20 II, Buckingham Palace has agreed to the creation of the Trust, which will be chaired by former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom (UK), Sir John Major. Both the Australian and UK Governments have confirmed that they will play their part in supporting the Trust. The amount of money the Australian Government will make available to the Trust has not yet been determined. Both Prime Minister Cameron and I also encourage individuals and businesses across the Commonwealth to mark the Jubilee by supporting the Trust in their own way. I am of the view that together, this will make a very fitting tribute to a very special anniversary. I will make further announcements about Australian Government recognition of The Queen's Diamond Jubilee. I can confirm that the Australian Government will not be issuing a Diamond Jubilee medal. To do so would be inconsistent with the Australian honours system which does not include coronation or jubilee medals. Climate Change (Question No. 696) Mr Fletcher asked the Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government, in writing, on 31 October 2011: Does the Government have information on any engagement by local government of consultants seeking advice concerning the impact of climate change; if so, is the Minister in a position to provide a summary of such engagements, including the cost. Mr Crean: The answer to the honourable memberâs question is as follows: No.",149,House Of Representatives Proposed Amendments To The Standing Orders
