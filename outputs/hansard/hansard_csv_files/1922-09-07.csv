Organized labour will then be able to mate its own arrangements. tralian Government is introducing legislation to repeal the industrial laws of the State, and the unionists of the State will, therefore, be deprived of the opportunity to have their industrial disputes settled in the State Courts. It is rumoured, too, that the Commonwealth Government intends to follow up the action of the State Government by introducing a measure to repeal the Commonwealth Arbitration Act, which, if passed, will deprive the South Australian unionists, and all others who are now in a position to do so, from taking advantage of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. I ask the Prime Ministeri f it is the intention of ,the Government to move for the repeal of the Commonwealth Arbitration Act? very wide field, and I can reply to it only in a general way, though, in doing so, I hope to make the industrial policy of the Government perfectly clear to the people of this country. This Government is most emphatically in favour of the settlement of industrial disputes by legal tribunals; it does not believe in the abolition of legal machinery for the settlement of industrial disputes. But, as I have said many times, the Ministers and, I think, most persons in the community, are dissatisfied with the Arbitration Act as it stands, and, personally, I prefer industrial tribunals to an Arbitration Court. The opinions of the workers are divided. Representatives of organized bodies of workers from all parts of the continent saw me on the subject not long ago, and the balance of the opinion then given was in favour of industrial tribunals as against Courts. My answer to the honourable member's question is that we are not in favour of taking away the means of settling industrial Todisputes by law. We stand for the legal settlement of disputes, but we shall make whatever modifications are necessary in the present law. We are .not in favour of abolishing arbitration, or the settlement of industrial disputes by legal means.

In reference to his remark that there is a notice of motion on the business-paper reflecting seriously upon a Justice of the High Court, I think that honourable members who read the motion referred to will see nothing in it which contains a serious reflection, no matter what may have been in the mind of the honourable member who gave notice of it. In any case, it does not appear on the business paper in the original form in which it was submitted. Later: statement that the Government are not prepared to allow discussion on my motion with regard to Mr Justice Powers, I desire to withdraw it, and I now desire to move the adjournment of the House in order to discuss a definite matter of urgent public importance, namely, "" The award given by Mr Justice Powers in the case of the Australian Workers Union versus The Australian Pastoral Federal Council and Others."" ber is not in order in proceeding to discuss a matter the subject of a notice of motion on the business-paper. His motion cannot be removed until, after to-day. Consequently, it still remains upon the business-paper. vernment are determined to shield a very questionable Judge, and one who is just about as dishonourable as the Government are themselves. NEW SOUTH WALES Minister aware that on account of the increase in the rabbit pest in New South Wales, particularly in the north-western portion of the State, financial institutions are unable to advance money upon holdings unless they are wire netted, and will he give assistance to the State Government, if they require it, to enable them to finance these land-holders upon extended terms of payment, so that they may purchase wire netting? I may explaiu that it only came under my notice Before the honorablo during the past week that this condition of affairs existed. The representative of a big financial institution told me that he would be obliged to refuse to recommend any further advances for the purchase of stock for 'holdings which were not wire netted, and as I think that the State Government would appreciate assistance that would enable them to finance a scheme for assisting land-holders to enclose their holdings with wire netting, I would like to see the Federal Government render whatever assistance it can, so that ample supplies of netting may be made available to enable the holdings to be saved. mitted by the honourable member for view of the Gwydir( Mr Cunningham) covers a very wide field. I quite appreciate the gravity of the position, and realize the attitude taken up by the financial institutions who, of course, requiring security for their further advances, find, to put it plainly, that it is being eaten away by rabbits. But when the honourable member asks whether the Federal Government would be prepared to advance money upon easy terms of repayment in co-operation with the State. Government he asks us to do something which is without precedent in the history of the Commonwealth Parliament. The Government will be very pleased to expedite the passage through this House of that portion of the Treasurer's Budget which proposes to remove the duty on wire netting, which would certainly help very considerably. Perhaps my colleague will take a note of the matter, and make an effort to put through that portion of his Budget at the earliest possible moment. As for the other part of the honourable member's question, without committing myself or the Government in any way, I shall be prepared to consider any proposal which the State Government desires to make upon the matter.

Were any accounts rendered for these calls; and, if so, to whom were they rendered? not available in my office. It is the practice of the Department to furnish such information only on the subcriber's request. General, upon notice1. Has the following regulation been issued to postal employees:"" Officers whose duty it is to receive money from the public should bo held responsible for fraudulent coins. Australian notes, or hank notes accepted by them. In case3, however, where a forged Australian note or bank note is accepted by an officer in the course of business, and it is considered exdents are so frequently subjected? pert knowledge would be required to detect the counterfeit, the matter of refunding thc amount involved to the officer concerned should be submitted to Central Office for consideration by the Treasury.""? 2. If so, is he of opinion that postal employees should be held responsible for receipt of fraudulent coin or notes in the transaction of postal business, especially at busy times? honourable member's questions are as follow:1. Yes. The Postmaster-General, in 1909, considered that all receivers should' be held responsible for fraudulent coins accepted by them, as it could be readily understood that there would be a danger of officers becoming lax, or less keen, in ""the performance of their otherwise. In quoting the instruction the honourable member has omitted the following:"" Each officer whose duty it is to accept AND COINSmake himself thoroughly acquainted with the general and detailed features of each denomination of paper currency in order that he may immediately detect any forged notes that might bo presented to him on account of the Department. Before any officer is allowed to take up any position involving the acceptance of money on behalf of the Department, the head of the branch, or office, or postmaster concerned, must satisfy himself that such officer is thoroughly acquainted with all the features of genuine Australian notes. The officer should also 'be instructed to keep a look-out for fraudulent bank notes, consisting of the backs of two split notes pasted together."" It will be seen that theinstruction is not a new one, but a continuation of what was approved in 1909. 2. I am in favour of dealing with each case on its merits, and that is what the instructions governing the question provide foT. Cases -have already occurred where the officer concerned has been absolved from bearing the loss through the acceptance of fraudulent notes. General, upon notice1. Will he, immediately after the votes for his Department have been agreed to by Parliament, take the necessary action to have the various works, such as postal buildings, telephone lines, &c., proceeded with without delay? 2. Will he consider the advisability of extending the hours of attendance at country telephone oflices from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. 3.

Will he also favour the advisability of reducing the .present high standard of constructing telephone lines by reducing the height of poles, allowing wires to be conducted on existing fences, attached to suitable trees, or other standards, and thus largely lessen' the cost of construction? honourable member's questions are as « 1.

In the absence of details regarding this matter a definite reply, cannot bo furnished at this stage. Inquiries are being made in the matter, and further information w ill be furnished when they are completed. 2.

Does not such determination apply only to examining officers in the invoice rooms of the capital cities at the date of the Arbitrator's award, and those officers who subsequently become employed therein? 3. If so, what is the position of a 4th Class examining officer who had been on the maximum of the class for two years or more prior to the date of such determination, and who, to suit the convenience of the Department, had' been transferred to other branches thereof prior to such determination? 4'.

In the opinion of the Attorney-General, is such determination inconsistent with the provisions of the Public Service Act and Eegulations, and consequently void as against such senior transferred officers, in view of tlie allegation that the Arbitrator failed to comply with the provisions of section 22 (2) of the Arbitration (Public Service) Act? to the rights of officers of the Public Service.

I do not see, however, any purpose in pillorying men who are not responsible for this Bill.

In other words, had those ten men continued in the service until the due date of retirement they would have received in salary, approximately, £4,000; but because they are being retired a few months before the due date they will receive, approximately, £10,000. And that arrangement is proposed under a Bill which is rendered necessary by a policy of retrenchment in the Defence Department! I cannot believe that the Minister framed this clause; I can only conjecture that it was drafted by some of the highly-paid officers who were interested. I can imagine that when they put their heads together there was a jingling of brass hats. A t first the Minister said that there was only one case of the kind I have illustrated; then he said there might be one other; to-day he says there are only two similar cases. Let Is he making a deliberate misstatement, or is he merely juggling with terms ? I am prepared to admit that there are only two cases in which the retiring officers had only seven months to serve -before retiring in the ordinary way, but who will receive nineteen months' pay under this scheme of compensation. But there are four officers who have only two months to serve, and yet who will receive fourteen months' pay. If the Minister's contradiction applied to the two cases which were identical in respect of the unexpired term of service it was a mere quibble. The excuse which the Minister offered for this proposal WPS that in the past it has been the practice to vote a gratuity to Occupation. officers on their retirement.

86,30 39 Q.m. (Stores) Mr Scullin,"I think it was deforty-eight. The term which the Minister applied to that regulation was "" political bribery."" I wonder what language he would find in which to describe the proposals which I have disclosed to the Committee to-day. There is no doubt that this is a policy of genewhen they already have a surplus. That rosity reserved for those who have been drawing high salaries. There is no instance of any member of the rank and file getting such treatment. The Government do not retire a ranker who has two months to go, but men who have been drawing high salaries are being compulsorily retired, and some of them are to receive seven times as much money for doing nothing as they would have received had they continued working. I have heard of a sergeant-major who enlisted, and went to the Front. He rose in the field to the rank of captain, was severely wounded, and, when he returned to the Front, was recommended for his majority shortly' before the signing of the armistice. tralia, he reverted to his former Tank of sergeant-major, and if he is retired, his compensation will be on the basis of a sergeant-major's pay, £250 per annum. I contrast his position with that of an officer who did not go to the war, but rose to the rank of colonel. He is to get nineteen months' pay for seven months unexpired service. Had he not been retired, he would only have drawn seven months' pay before retiring automatically. The sergeant-major-and there were many others like him, who were ad mitted to be the backbone of the Army -wil l get comparatively nothing. W|e shall be told that, amongst the fifteen cases I have mentioned, there is payment in consideration of active service. This Bill is not intended to remunerate men for active service. only three of the fifteen I have mentioned were members of the Australian Imperial Force. There is another aspect of this scheme of "" economy."" Twenty-three of the officers who are being retired have graduated from Duntroon College since the armistice was signed. I do not know what it costs to train cadets at Duntroon, but I have heard an estimate of £1,000 per man per annum for four years. If that be correct, it costs £4,000 to turn out one of these, graduates, and almost immediately after his training is completed, he is retired, and given £150 in compensation. Under the original Bill the minimum amount was to have been £200. Yet the Government still continue Duntroon College, and are still educating and turning out more officers is what they call economy! When honourable members on this side of the House moved to get an extra 2s. 6d. or 5s. per week for the old-age and: invalid pensioners, we were told that there was no money available. When we cite scores of cases of distress amongst the diggers who fought for us-and I know of a great number of men who, I think, are harshly treated under the regulations-w e are told that there is no money for them. But for the heads of the Defence Department there is an overflowing Treasury. Ofiicers may be paid from three to seven times as much in compensation aa they wouldi have received had they worked to the end of their term of service. This is the On his return to Aus"" hottest "" proposition of which I have heard for a long time. Under this retrenchment policy, thousands of .working men are being thrown out of work at a time when there is a good deal of unemployment, but there is no compensation for them; they cannot even get work, although many returned soldiers are amongst their number. They simply receive notice, and. out they go. But for the ofiicers who have been receiving high salaries, there is not only 1 compensation for the work they have lost, but there is also a gift of twelve months' pay. In all our Commonwealth factories, such as the Cordite Factory, the Clothing Factory, and the Harness Factory, the Government are discharging men for two reasons: firstly, because the retrenchment policy in regard to defence renders it unnecessary to keep the factories .in full operation, and of that retrenchment I do not complain ; and, secondly, because the Government refuse to compete with private enterprise, and for that, reason are closing down the Harness Factory and other establishments. Under the regulations, the employees are entitled, after eight years' service, to receive furlough pay on reaching the retiring age. Some men who have reached sixty years of age, and have been . retired, have received furlough pay. Quite a lot of them, under the retrench-",22,Defence Retirement Bill
87,Mr Fleming,We should do so.,23,Defence Retirement Bill
88,Mr Scullin,"Even if we should,ment policy of the Government, and through its refusal to take work from outside in competition with private enterprise, bave been turned adrift before reaching the retiring age, and although they have many years of service, they will not receive a penny of compensation. I have here the particulars of a case in which a man having ten years' service, who has reached the age of fifty-nine years and eight months, is being turned adrift without a penny of compensation, although had he been continued at work a little longer he would have been entitled to three monihs' pay. I ask members to contrast his treatment with that of men who had only two months to go. They were conveniently retired by the Government, and will be given fourteen months' full pay by way of compensation. The provision shrieks of social influence exercised by men in high places. How can members who share in the responsibility of government, preaching economy and posing as safeguarding the public funds, complacently allow such a provision to pass? My amendment is a very generous one. ment's proposal provides for a month's pay for a year of service; but the compensation paid must not'exceed twelve months' pay plus pay for the unexpired period of service. If my amendment is carried-as it ought to be-the compensation given will still be a month's pay for eachyiear of service, but it must not exceed full pay for the unexpired period of the term that the men have to serve. I would like tp hear what argument can be advanced in favour of the Government's proposal as against my proposal. man gets full pay for every month's service of which he is deprived, I think he will be generously treated. It ismanifest by the Bill that those who are' drawing high salaries rule the Ministers, and that the Department is controlled by the "" brass hats,"" who are the only persons who will benefit by the Bill. There is not a clerk who will benefit by it, notwithstanding the insertion of the word ""employee,"" and none of the rank and file will benefit, because none of them will be retired who are so close to the retiring age. Here are ofiicers gazetted to be retired who have almost reached the retiring age. I say that the workers who are being sacked should get better treatment. There should be a juster payment of compensation to those connected with the factories, who should be given what they are entitled to if they are sacked before reaching the age of sixty. I do not believe in lavish expenditure upon those who have been drawing high salaries -in greasing the fatted hog; I take my stand with the poor and lowly. My amendment provides that the maximum that any man shall receive will be full pay -for the unexpired portion of his term. for Defence) [3.25] -The honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) has, in a long harangue, talked at large about a matter to which he has evidently not given serious consideration. The provisions of the Bill apply to every rank in the service in exactly the same way-to the lowliest as to the highest-in proportion to salary. Had the honourable member understood that, he would see that there is no justification for his strictures on those occupying the higher positions in the military service. It is very easy to make an appeal to popular sentiment. There are persons who are always willing The Governto lend a ready ear to the suggestion that too much is being paid to the man who is well off, and not enough to the other fellow That is one of the cheapest arguments that it is possible to use, an argument which the demagogue uses to appeal to the mob, but not to thinking members of the community. It is the most reprehensible argument that can be used in this particular case. If a shall first tell the honourable member for Yarra what I think about it. We are dealing with men who have given their whole lives to the service of the country, and have done nobly arid well the work asked of them. It is a peculiar feature of military service that, rf a man does not rise above a certain rank within a certain .time, he cannot continue in the service. It is a disability peculiar to the members of the Defence Forces which does not apply to other professions. The civil employees of the Department have a safe position until the age of sixty-five years under ordinary circumstances, hut the military officer must retire much earlier if he fails to reach certain rank. Had the honourable member taken the trouble, when going through the list, to look at",23,Defence Retirement Bill

That is why this arrangement was proposed, and it applies to all ranks of the service. whether promotion is, as a rule,, automatic? enough in the Department to be able to give a definite answer, but I , presume that so long as a man is competent his promotion is automatic. are almost invariably automatic. motion does not take place? there are two cases with the military officers in which in all probability there would not have been promotion, or an extended term, and possibly cases are receiving somewhat liberal treatment, hut certainly we are not dealing too liberally with the other cases. Eor quite a number of years it has been the practice, in view of the fact that an officer's service was often cut short at a time of life when he had much useful work in him, and much sooner than the service of civil employees is ended, to give special consideration to those who were being retired. This applied to a great majority of cases. recognised that practice over and over again, and compensation in accordance with it has been voted on the Estimates nearly every year since I entered the House. as the Bill provides for? so. men to go their f u ll term, and have then voted them twelve months' pay. In one or two cases we have voted eighteen months' pay, and even as much as two vears' pay. I take full responsibility for this part of the Bill. When we were considering how best to arrive at a fair basis of compensation, we had regard to Parliament to give men 'who were retiring twelve months' pay. It seemed unfair that men with a short period to go should get the full amount of compensation that a man who had a longer period to go would get, and therefore Conthis provision was put in. And therefore we fix a definite amount as the maximum compensation to be drawn. That maximum is pay for the period of his unexpired service plus twelve months' pay; and if that be less than compensation at the rate of one month's pay for each year of service he gets the lesser amount. If that system, which applies right through the service from the highest to the lowest rank, be adopted, it will be doing, in the main, substantial justice. It will not be too liberal, because our proposals compare very unfavorably with those which have been made in other parts of the Empire. However, as between man and man in our own service, I think it will do substantial justice. No scheme can be arrived at which does not present some anomaly at one end or other of the scale. We tried quite a number of different schemes to see how they would best work out, but we found it utterly impossible to adopt any method which did not it may seem that those present, in some of its features, some anomaly. We believe that what we have put forward will give 'as closely as possible substantial justice-that is to say, a month's pay for each year of service as between man and man. The only reason for inserting the proviso was that a man with long servioe behind him and a comparatively short period of service ahead would, unless the proviso to which the honourable member is objecting were inserted, get an undue amount of comParliament has pensation.

102,Mr Greene,"We have allowed thethe honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) would, for instance, get an undue amount of compensation in comparison with other officers. What we are now proposing to give him is substantially on the same lines as the compensation this Parliament has voted year after year to officers of the Defence Forces who were passing out of the service. Naturally, those who pass out of the service are those who have been in it a long time, and have reached the retiring age. What we are doing now is simply repeating a provision made over and over again for those whom Parliament has singled out for this class of grant, only we are extending it to all ranks instead of to only the few higherpaid officers. We are not doing anything that is more than fair in respect to men who have given us many years of f a it h f u l service, and who, owing to the exigencies of the profession in which they have been engaged, have been called upon to lay down the work they have been doing many years before the average citizen is expected to retire. We have been accustomed year by year to vote sums of money to these men. Had we had, as we ought to have had long ago, a proper superannuation scheme, under which these men would take their pensions and go out automatically upon reaching the retiring age, we would not have had all this trouble. for Y a r r a ( Mr Scullin) suggests that it will cost the Department more to put off these men than to keep them on. the Minister answer that statement? year in respect of these particular men, but their service has to be regarded in respect to the service as a whole.

It is suggested that we should let them remain. ber for Yarra suggests that they should remain and simply go out at the end of their period of service on twelve months' pay. / able member proposes to go back on the procedure which this Parliament has followed for many years. He would not pay these men twelve months' pay on retiring. Supposewe did adopt the course the honourable -member suggests, and leave all these men at the top. the ordinary workers. member would, for a moment, forget politics and cease appealing to the gallery, and if he would give attention to the ordinary work of the Department, he would see that what we have done is the wise thing. If we had l e f t these men at the top, how could we have reduced our personnel, as we were obliged to do, except by getting r i d of the captains instead of the colonels and majors whom the honourable member would retain? And then what would have been the result? The whole service would have been disorganized. We found it necessary to get r i d of the men at the top, and then move higher up the scale the younger men, most of whom had had war experience; and I believe that that was the right thing to do. As a result, we have got more efficient service, which, in the event of trouble arising, will be of more use to the country. It would not Can have achieved the object of Parliament if we had let the older men remain where It costs us more this they were and sought to reduce the establishment by sacking men lower down, whose experience was of greater value than that of the older men, through no fault of the latter. One could not imagine a sillier or more stupid way of going about the business than to do anything of the sort. I believe that we took the wisest course. The whole compensation scheme is based upon one month's pay for each year of service, but since it has been the practice of this ParliaI f these men were not rement to pay twelve months' salary on retirement, I think we are only doing what is fair, just, and honourable as between man and man in the service, and merely giving the least compensation which this Parliament can honestly offer to men who have served their country so well, by adopting the scheme as set out",25,Defence Retirement Bill

The Minister( Mr Greene) has endeavoured to make it appear that the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) did 1 not know his subject, but, as a matter of fact,, he has himself corroborated all that the honourable member stated. Minister failed to do was to give some explanation as to why this legislation should have come before us in its present form. I have a lively recollection of the debate upon the second reading of the Bill, and of the discussion in the early part of the Committee proceedings, when the view was advanced, and apparently the correct one, that there was considerable doubt as to the interpretation which the Minister sought to put upon this clause. The Minister told me that my interpretation was entirely wrong. To-day he admits that I was right. terpretation. in addition to the allowance of one mouth's pay for each year of service, the retiring officers would be able to get an equivalent Of the amount of pay to which they would be entitled if they continued in the servicedid not exceed one month's pay for each year of service. pointed, out the definition set out in the Bill of "" unexpired period of service,"" 1 which is: as follows: ""Pay for the unexpired period of the service are drawing certain allowances in addiof the member"" means the total of the pay which-, ia the opinion of the Naval Board of Administration) the' Military Board of Administration, tlie Air Board, or the Secretary to the Department of Defence, as the case may be, the member would probably have received had he continued, until the age prescribed by law for retirement or discharge therefrom, to occupy the office or hold the rank occupied or held by him at the time of his retirement or discharge under this Act. That definition is very clear. We are discussing a serious matter. Under clause 12, already agreed to, until June next any officer can voluntarily retire, with the Minister's consent, and through getting the compensation payable under this Bill make more money than he would receive by remaining in the service. Yet we are supposed to be retiring these men for the purpose of effecting economy. Because of the Washington Conference we believed that we were able , to reduce the Defence staff and curtail expenditure. This naturally involved the dismissal of certain officers, but now we find that it will cost us more to retire them than to retain them in the service. As the honourable member for Yarra has pointed out, we could save money by retaining ten of these officers on full pay, and allow them to play golf every day. £6,000 in the case of ten men. that the clause under discussion bears the interpretation we put upon it .

148,Mr Charlton,"The Minister hasgiving thein the privilege of retiring and claiming the compensation for which this Bill provides. The honourable member for Yarra has done good service in drawing attention to this matter. On a previous occasion it was said that our interpretation of the clause was wrong, but the Minister now admits that the interpretation placed upon it by the honourable member for Yarra is correct. That being so, we have either to pass the clause as proposed by the Government, and so provide for an additional allowance to certain officers-a n allowance over and above what is a. fair thing-o r else .vote against it . This is not a matter of vital party significance, and no honourable member should consider himself bound to support the Government proposal. Those who believe in economy, and have preached it outside, should practise it in the Committee by voting for the proposal made by the honourable member for Yarra. In that way they will be doing only the fair thing by these officers. the Minister( Mr Greene) first explained the provisions of this BillI thought it was a very welcome measure by means of which he was endeavouring, apparently, to give statutory form to a system that had grown up, in a haphazard way, in the Defence Department, and had operated, in more or less general terms, through the Estimates year after year. I was of the opinion that the submission of a, measure of this kind to the House, in order to gain parliamentary approval of the principle of compensation, and the basis and extent of it was wise. thought, however, that there was a, de.fect in the Bill, which the Minister'3 later 'amendments endeavour to rectify. That is to say, the distinction made between the military and the civil section of the Defence Department, while perfectly understandable, did not appear to me, at all events, to be in the bulk of cases quite justifiable. I know of several cases, most of which I have brought to the notice of the Minister, where men, who had served s for a long while in the military section of the Department, were eventually brought as physical trainers.into th« civil section. A considerable number 01 these men, not only had extensive war service, but, as their recognitions showed, a very creditable record. To treat these men with long professional military service, and au actual meritorious Australian Imperial Force career, merely as clerks-as men who had never done anything else than the work of a clerk-wa s wrong. The proposal now before us puts them all on scratch. Whether the Minister's proposals are over liberal or niggardly does not affect the rectification of the original mistake to which I have referred, or the assertion of the principle of compensation. Owing chiefly to the research of the lin) an issue has arisen at this late stage between the Minister and the Opposition. The honourable member has submitted arguments in support of his contention and an amendment to qualify the more recent amendment of the clause proposed by the Minister. I take it that there is complete agreement between the Minister and the Opposition on two of the three points at issue. They are agreed that if there is to be retrenchment, as unanimously approved by the House, then there ought to ibe compensation, and that, as a matter of principle, that compensation should be based upon a month's pay for every year of service. They agree that there ought to be a minimum, which, apparently, all parties consider should be equal to six months' pay, and that there ought to be a maximum. It is when we come to determine the maximum that the point of disagreement is visible. This, then, is the actual-position: The Minister proposes to provide compensation on the basis of one month's pay for every year of service, subject to the condition that the compensation so granted shall I not exceed what would have been the payment received for the unexpired portion of the man's service plus twelve months' pay. The honourable member for Yarra suggests that the compensation should he one month's pay for every year of service, but that the amount should not exceed the pay which the man would have received had he continued in the Department for the unexpired period of his service. The anomaly is pointed out that., in view of the Minister's explanation, it would be cheaper to keep a man in the Department until he automatically retired if no promotions were to take place. From the stand-point of the Government that is true, judging it only from the position this year; but if they kept the men in the Department, and promotion came along within the next six or twelve",28,Defence Retirement Bill

Mr .SCULLIN -That is not the position granting 'twelve months' pay by way of in the cases I have pointed out. are where men with two months to go have been registered for retirement. Several such cases have been pointed out by the honourable member for Yarra; and in those extreme instances the compensation seems to be excessive. A man who would receive two months' pay if he remained in the Department for the balance of his term of service, would, under thc Minister's proposal, receive compensation equal to fourteen months' pay. mained in the Service, and had there been no compensation, the Parliament, in all probability, would have been asked to vote him compensation equal to twelve months' pay. dealing with the Estimates in past years honourable members,, apparently, have been satisfied with that principle, and under it the men in the cases mentioned by the honourable member for Yarra would have worked for two months, and then have been granted twelve months' pay. The only difference between that arrangement and the principle for which this clause provides is that the Department would have had the benefit of the men's work for two months. Mr 'SCULLIN -'But was the practice of no matter what their rank may be. I giving men a grant equal to twelve months' pay general? there have been many such cases. In my own time as Treasurer groups of such cases were dealt with. favoured few have been so dealt with. number of cases were dealt with at the close of the war.

But the principle of compensation to men who had to retire was. acknowledged and operated by the Department, and frequently approved by Parliament in more or less uniform order. was no superannuation fund. question is whether in the extreme cases to which reference has been made we are being too liberal. The Minister thinks we are not, whereas the honourable member for Yarra and his colleagues of the Opposition consider that we are. I am not concerned with the question of whether or not these men are officers. I do not believe in throwing at men such terms as ""brass hats,"" as long as the principle of the Bill is to apply to the rank and file, and to the junior as well as to the senior officers. That is all that we can insist on, and that principle, I believe, is being recognised now for the first time. practice? ranker who has received this treatment. The Department will not retire the ranker with oniy two months to go. but where men are retired beforehand, and their expectations are threatened by the deliberate act of the Department, then the principle should apply to them, accept the assurance of the Minister that it does, and certainly the wording of the Bill would indicate that that is FO.

That was nearly twelve months ago, and honourable members opposite then voiced their views in favour of such, a reduction.

He has forgotten to mention that the Leader of the Opposition did not stipulate that the Government should save £2,800,000 by reducing the staff, and then spend £300,000 by way of compensating them on their retirement. tlie Opposition has said, not only this afternoon, b u t in earlier speeches on the B ill , that he believes in fairplay to the men who are being retired. Other honourable members opposite, including the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin), have made the same statement. objects to is what he alleges to be discrimination between the officer and the rank and file. It is not. to the principle of compensation that any honourable member of any party objects. being paid more for retiring than for working. adds force to the honourable member's argument. Parliament forced on an obviously reluctant Government a reduction of half a million in the Defence vote. Some of us tried to get further reductions-som e would have made proportionate reductions in regard to the Navy and A i r Porce, but we were deterred by the action of the Government in promising additional economies. for one, cannot grumble, in view of the fact that we unanimously asked fora reduction, differing in degree, but still a reduction,' in the Forces, when the Government propose these economies and retrenchments. I am prepared to deal fairly w it h the men who have suffered as the result of the deliberately considered action of this Parliament and the country in reducing the Forces. Everybody welcomed the result of the Washington Conference, the f r u it i o n of which occurred after the deliberations to which I refer. Surely no Government would have been worthy to, or could have conI t would have meant the tinued to, sit on the Government benches, .which would not, after the completion of those Treaties, have proposed substantial Defence reductions; , These were concurred in , I think unanimously, by the people, certainly with a wonderful degree of unanimity by all the members of the three parties in the House. It is purely a question of how the thing is to be done, and how much we are to give these men. I am prepared to support the Government in giving reasonable retiring allowances to men who are cut off from, their expectations, in most cases after a long period of service in a special arm of the State, which has incapacitated them for industrial, commercial, and other vocations.

We, on this side, stand for a fair deal not only for military officers, but for all other workers in the Defence Department. I should have been more enthusiastic in my support of this measure if the Minister( Mr Greene) had proposed some vote to provide retiring allowances for the workers under his control. The honourable gentleman speaks of the officers as having given the best years of their lives to the military service of the country; but he says not one word about the workers who have done the same thing, and who, moreover, in many cases, have ruined tbeir health in making It the Department a success. There is not one word about retiring allowances for these men in their declining years. In the Department there are men who, under the regulations, are entitled to a sixmonths' retiring allowance after twenty years of service; but, as a matter of fact, there are men who, after thirty or forty years of service, are denied that allowv ance on the purely technical objection that their continuity of service has been broken. During those long years these men may have lost a week or a fortnight through illness, accident, or some other cause, and because of this they are denied retiring allowances. dozens of cases, which I have already communicated to the Minister and every occasion, however, I am met with the same stony reply, "" The continuity of service has been broken.""

This has happened even tomen who are badly maimed, and it is a disgrace that such a thing should have occurred. We should encourage such men to get back their morale, and assist them to dosomething for the good of the country. that the Minister will look into this matter. Another argument put forward by a member of the Opposition struck me as beingextremely peculiar. prior to this retirement scheme being formulated, only colonels and other highly-placed officers had received any refairest possible manner to all concerned. tiring allowance, and then only as an act of grace, whereas now that consideration was "" being brought down to captains."" It seems to me that if in the past colonels had received a retiring allowance, it is fair that captains and lieutenants should get it now. scheme of compensation should be on a graduated scale from top to bottom, and no man should be deprived of his due share of compensation. The interjection that "" Now you are bringing it down to captains,"" as if to do so were offensive to civilians. the Committee, was very unfortunate. The only way to be fair to all officers and men who are being retired is to grade the compensation on a perfectly even scale from the highest to the lowest. The honourable member for Dalley( Mr Department for almost a lifetime, Mahony) told us of men who had been Kr. Fleming. . deprived of their retiring allowance because their continuity of service had been broken by sickness. I hope the Minister's denial that such a thing has been done is well founded. Mi-. GREENE I do not know of such a case, but if there isi one, I will put it right. one step further. The honourable member for Dalley also siaid that at one time the Defence Department threw certain men out of work and subsequently re-employed them, but destroyed their continuity of service. If that happened turbed through no fault of the men. dismissed temporarily on account of a strike, or something of that sort. I do not know what the circumstances were. of employment was broken through the action of the Defence Department, I hope the Minister will place them upon the same footing as those men whose employment was interfered with by sickness, and to whom the Minister has promised to restore the rights that attach to continuity of service. I hope In connection with this measure as a whole there is one factor to be borne in mind. We know that retrenchment is absolutely necessary, and it is the will of Parliament, and the wish of the country, It was that that economy should be practised in the Defence Department, amongst other places, but it should be .practised in the [4.35] I received with satisfaction the decision of the Government to accede to the request made from all parts of the Chamber that the discrimination which appeared in the Bill as originally introThe whole duced should be eliminated,. In deference to the strong feeling that was exhibited upon that subject, an amendment has been brought down which, the Minister assures us, removes all discrimination between military officers and Those men who claim to be entitled to the same consideration were mostly officers who had been in the service for a considerable time, who had practically devoted themselves to their clerical occupations in the Defence and were therefore incapable of",34,Below Bread Line

There is a general desire to be fair to those who have been called on to retire, although much difference of opinion exists as to how they should be treated. Yarra( Mr Scullin) thinks that there is unfair discrimination proposed in the granting of pensions, gratuities, and the like to the victims of compulsory retirement; but we cannot ignore .the statements of the Minister as to what we know to be the practice of Parliament in this connection, and what he says is the practice of the Department. He has told us that, as a rule, instead of officers being called on to retire immediately they reach the retiring age, they are given an extension of service for twelve months, during which they may automatically become entitled to promotion to a higher rank, allowing them a still longer period of service. majority of cases. member for Yarra contends that an officer who is within two months of the term within which in his rank he must retire is not at all likely to gain promotion ent titling him to a longer period of service. But the Minister tells us that the practice is to grant such a man an extension of service for twelve months, within which time he may. automatically be promoted to a higher rank, and thus become entitled to serve for a still longer period. ment is as incorrect as the answer which he gave to me the other week. has also told us, 'and we know it to be the case, that in a number of instances in which the period of service has been extended by twelve months Parliament has granted an additional gratuity of twelve months' pay. tice for years. stances, a man in the position to which the honourable member for Yarra referred, would draw his pay for a period of two years and two months, rendering, of course, fourteen months' service only during that period. Therefore, the proposal of the Minister is not glaringly unfair, al[79] though the honourable member for Yarra has so characterized it . As a matter of fact, a man in the position to which the honourable member has referred is done this apparent injustice: Instead' of being given an extension of twelve months' service and then a gratuity of twelve months' pay, he is being given only a The honourable member for .gratuity of twelve months' pay, together with pay for the unexpired period of his service. I think that the Minister has completely justified the provision under discussion, and that if any one is to complain it is the men concerned, on the ground that they are not being treated as generously as has been the practice of Parliament and of the Department. I accept the statement of the Minister that the provisions of the Bill apply to all ranks. In these circumstances, and believing that there is a distinct effort on the part of the Government to do what is fair and just to the officers whom they are, unfortunately, called upon to retire, I shall support the measure. Although, no doubt, the Minister believes that he has told the Committee the truth about the men to whom the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) has referred, I do not think he knows enough of the practice of the Department to be relied on. Could his statement be taken without reserve, there would not be so .much to complain of, but I shall show that he does not know too much about matters of departmental administration. The honourable member for Yarra read a list of officers, without giving the names of those concerned, and the Minister has told us that certain officers, when they reach the age of sixty years, would get an extension of twelve months and then a gratuity for twelve months. I say, however, that none of the quartermasters are given any extension of their term of servioe. told me only two minutes ago that it was the invariable rule to give quartermasters two years. the only Minister for Defence who has been supplied with false information by his officials.

241,Mr Mcgrath,"The Minister is nothaving made pretty exhaustive inquiries, has assured the Committee that quartermasters get no extension of time; that the terms of their engagement definitely require them to retire on reaching the age of sixty years.

If the practice of the Department was followed, these officers would have no hope of a gratuity. them? thousands of others you are penalizing? ber is keenly desirous of the welfare of men who have been drawing good salaries for years. It may be argued that, because they have been following the military profession for so long, they are unfitted to enter upon ordinary business pursuits; but surely they should be in a better position to struggle against outside competition than are the sergeantmajors, sergeants, and others, seeing that for twenty or thirt y years they have been earning a decent salary. They are more than generously treated in the B ill . challenge the Minister to produce from the Estimates of past years a list of quartermasters who have been granted twelve months' pay on reaching the age of sixty years. You will not find that any quartermaster has been so treated, and I do not think you w ill find that such a gratuity has been given to any one below the rank of colonel. master who has not risen from the ranks. from tbe ranks, and therefore they have not been given a gratuity on retiring. to them getting gratuities under the B ill ? why dividuals should be given an unfairly large gratuity. The Minister's statement is that they are being dealt with liberally in the Bill' because, had they remained on in the Service until they had reached the age of sixty years, they would have received a gratuity of twelve months' pay. Within the past, no such gratuity has been given to quartermasters. Very different treatment from that proposed for officers has' been given to the workers in the munition factories and woollen mills, although these men, under the terms of their engagement, had the right to remain in the Service until they reached the age of sixty years, and then to receive furlough pay for six months. Some of the officials of the Department have .been mean enough to dismiss such men at the age of fifty-nine years and six or eight months, thus depriving them of their furlough pay. Practically no consideration whatever is shown to those employees. I shall vote for the amendment. The list f u r nished by the honourable member for They may not have a "" bean."" answerable argument. He has cited the What about the case of ten officers, who are to be given £10,000 for doing no work, but who, if they had continued in the employ of the Department for the remaining period of their term, would have been paid salaries totalling only £4,000. Such a situation is absurd, and altogether wrong and unfair. It is of no use for the M in ister to say that these officials would have obtained extensions of their periods of service. They were nearing the retiring limit. Some of them were fifty-nine years and ten months old; others were fifty-eight and fifty-seven. Ordinarily,, they would I have gone out from the Department with out compensation. the quartermasters the same compensation as the generals, the honourable member objects.

That honourable member gave the specific case of one sergeant-major who has fought in two wars, who earned the rank of captain in the field, and was about to be promoted to his majority, but, who, upon returning to this his grateful country, was reduced to the rank of sergeant-major, and who will receive something like £250 upon retirement. There are crying instances of differentiations between those highly placed and others in humble circumstances. I know of the case of a woman who lost her boy in the war. She has been receiving a pension of £1 a week, but this sum was reduced by half, on the ground that the mother had been going out working at somebody's wash-tub. Such instances disclose very harsh differentiation. one ought to ""get the sack."" honourable member. to do with this Bill.

The honourable member for Yarra( Mr technical knowledge, his unfailing sense Scullin) has "" p u t u p "" a magnificent case, and, unless the Minister for Defence( Mr Greene) can make it clear to me that the accusations of the honourable member, and the particulars which he has advanced, are not justified or correct, I shall be inclined to support the amendment. I would not complain, however generously the Government might decide to treat our returned men. I am aware that the payment of pensions is not involved in this measure, but I know of many instances where those payments are far from fair or adequate. The men employed by the Defence Department who have gone overseas to fight are entitled to more generous consideration than those who stayed at home. I desire to see fair play all round, and I emphasize that unless the Minister can successfully combat the arguments of the Opposition, I shall be bound to support the amendment. -The honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Watt) and the honourable member for Kooyong( Sir Robert Best) have dealt so ably with the arguments of the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) that it is almost unnecessary for me to say anything further. However, I desire to place on record my appreciation of the fact that the honourable member for Yarra and the honourable member for the best intentions. Buti f the amendment is carrieu it will confer no benefit upon those who are being unfortunately treated. The effect will be to bring about a reduction of the amounts of compensation to be paid to certain persons, while nothing will be added to the sums to be given to those men for whom (honourable members opposite have spoken so sympathetically. That being so, I shall vote against the amendment. I am grateful to the Minister( Mr Greene) for having agreed to amend the Bill to give a greater measure of fair play to the clerical staffa very able and deserving body of men. Many of these did valuable work throughout the war. I am familiar with the services of one person in particular, to whom I shall refer. By his all-round ability, and by his devotion, he saved this country thousands of pounds. I refer to Mr McGuire, who, I understand, was in charge of the Contracts Branch. His of justice, and his liking for hard work, are such as to render him worthy of every consideration; but he, like so many others doing the clerical work of the Department, would have suffered very greatly if he had been retired under the provisions of the Bill as originally presen ted. I know of the case of another officer who had risen to the rank of captain, but gave up the active military side of his career in order to change over to the clerical staff. Had the Bill not been amended in order to give greater consideration to the clerical staff, this man would have retired under great disadvantage.

I also heard the honourable member for Denison indicate that he had been convinced by the remarks of those,honourable members as to the way in which he should vote upon the amendment of the honourable member for Yarra. The honourable member for Balaclava said that employees in the Cordite Factory, and other Government concerns, were not in the same position as professional military men for the reason that the factory workers had, at any rate, learned a trade, and were thus so much the better equipped upon leaving the services of the Government. Employees in the Government Factories do not support that line of argument: A man who has been working, for example, in the military Harness Factory finds himself at a great disadvantage when seeking to enter an ordinary -harness factory. advantage of being trained in a very good school. point is that the school is a different one.

271,Mr Parkermoloney,"I venfifteen of the best years of his life in the servioe of his country amidst the fumes of cordite making, in all probability handicapped for any other form of employment, has nothing done for him. If the Minister is in earnest in saying that he wants to do justice to these men, let him liberalize his Bill, and give them some slight reward for their excellent services, particularly as their health is poorer turn a deaf ear and talk economy. This now than it must have been when they entered the Cordite Factory. But the attitude of the Government is only in keeping with what they are doing every day in the matter of pensions due to the men for whom, according to the Government of the day, nothing was to be regarded as being too good. I had a case under my notice a few days ago. A crippled returned soldier, who had been drawing a war pension for two years on a doctor's certificate stating that he was suffering from rheumatism, was told quite recently that his pension was to cease. A t his request I asked the reason for this, and was told that the authorities had come to the conclusion that the certificate given by the first doctor was wrong, and that the man was suffering from something which was not rheumatism. That is the sort of economy which is practised by the Government, economy at the expense of the "" under-dog,"" the cutting down of the pensions of the men who have no influence. The case I have mentioned is but typical of hundreds of others, in which men have been declared to be suffering, not from the original certificates of medical men, but from other causes which do not entitle them to pensions. But the same Government that preaches this kind of economy at the expense of men who have no influence and whose voice is not heard cater in a Bill of this sort for those in the upper circles of military service, even to the extent of paying some of them 'two and a half times more than they would have drawn if they had remained in employment. . It would be better for the Minister to keep the men referred to by the honourable member for Yarra, even if it were only for the purpose of punctuating the correspondence issued from the Department. It is outrageous that any Government which preaches economy should attempt it at the expense of men who have no influence -unfortunat e war pensioners, maimed in body and suffering in health-whil e giving every consideration to those who have plenty of influence, and who, if they were deprived of their positions to-morrow, would not be obliged to sleep in publio gardens, but, having enjoyed cosy billets, would really have a good time. Honourable members can tell Ministers of the sufferings of soldiers and the abuses of the system of settling soldiers on the land, but to all appeals the Ministry Committee should not accept the bluff which the Minister for Defence has been accustomed to put up lately. We have a duty to perform, and unless the Minister can give some satisfactory reply to the arguments advanced by the honourable member for Yarra, I cannot imagine any one who is anxious to give a fair deal to the men whose cases I have mentioned voting against the honourable member's amendment. am pleased that the Minister for Defence( Mr Greene) has brought forward an amendment, and I intend to support it , for reasons which I thought would have actuated honourable members opposite in supporting it, seeing that it proposes to give the men on the lower rung of the ladder the same privileges as are enjoyed by those on the top rung. During the second-reading debate I notified my intention of moving an amendment to clause 5 to give the "" under-dog,"" of whom our friends opposite think they are the only champions, the right which is the ailments specified in enjoyed by people in a higher sphere; but the Minister has done this. Although he has, certainly, made some differentiation in the amount to be paid, there is no such differentiation, which I contend there should not be, in the scale under the position of warrant officer. In the circumstances, I thought that my friends opposite would be only too pleased to -accept the Minister's proposal; but, apparently, they are like the out-back nigger, who wants sugar .if you give him tea, and milk if you give him sugar.. They always want more than they arooffered. A t any rate, they have no* monopoly in the prosecution of the casefor the'' under-dog.""

There is certainly an anomaly in regard to the position of the two highly-paid men mentioned by the honourable member, but anomalies occur in connection with almost every measure. My sympathies always go out to "" the under-dog."" The honourable member referred to the position of certain quartermasters who really hold the rank of sergeantmajors. referred was that of a major or a captain. quartermasters are sergeant-majors. W ill any honourable member of the Opposition say that a is too well treated in the matter of pay ? The Minister has not only provided for the man on the -top rung of the ladder but, by his amendment, he is giving sergeant-majors acting as quartermasters the right to go up. Instead of dragging down others to their level he is raising them. It is not possible for sergeantmajors in the Commonwealth M i l it a r y Forces to rise to any postion carrying with it a big salary. The majority of them do not get more than £450 a year. If they receive the compensation to which the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) has referred they w ill have somegiven not a pension or a superannuation thing with which to carry on. I am glad that the Minister has submitted his amendment. Many of these men, even if they did not take part in the recent great war, fought in the previous war. In any event they volunteered for service, and were liable to be called upon at any moment to fight. There is very little gratitude in the composition of an honourable member who will cavil at the general rate of compensation proposed by the Government merely because one or two men may get a little more than that to which he thinks they are entitled. It is better to raise the standard rather than to bring down the men at the top. The Minister's amendment provides for a fair thing, and will afford those who have not had an opportunity to rise something on which, when they retire, they may fal l back. I hope it will be carried. The highest compensation payable under this B ill compares unfavorably w it h the payment made under the Indian scheme. As 'the Government are bringing up the lower I mentioned paid men and giving them practically the same rights as are enjoyed by the higher paid men, I think it absurd for the OpI am putting my own position to t r y to destroy the B ill merely because of an anomaly in relation to the position of one or two officers. I have been glancing through the House of Commons ParlioTnentar// Debates and other official documents, and have come to the conclusion that the British Government, notwithstanding their enormous load of debt, have, in many oases, treated the men who were in the ranks during the war better than we have treated those who went from this country to the Front. The British Government have, apparently, realized their responsibility to a set of men whom the Comsergeant-major monwealth Government seem to be prepared to t u r n adrift. I refer more particularly to those who were engaged in the manufacture of munitions, as well as in naval shipbuilding. Many such men in Great Britain who carried out that work while in private employment were well treated by the British Government when, owing to necessary reductions in staff, they were thrown out of employment. I have pleaded again and again with the Government to do something for men and women in our munition factories who have been suddenly sent to the righ t about. I have asked that they shall be allowance, but work. Many of these men are in a very serious position. Men who went to the Front and on their return were employed or resumed their employment in the Publio Service have also been discharged. I shall vote for the amendment of the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Yarra( Mr. Scullin), not because I want to pull down, since I believe in the policy of levelling up, but by way of general protest against the treatment that is being meted out to the rank and file, many of whom have been to the Front, while others have been employed in our .munition factories. When a man complains to me that men in the Public Service are in a better position than he is, that they have regular work, and are granted annual holidays, I say to h i m , "" W h y t r y to reduce the conditions of employment for such men?

I could bring before the Minister men who were engaged ten years ago to work in the Cordite Factory, and were told that they would be permanently employed, but whose services have been suddenly dispensed with. Their health, has been impaired as a result of working in the factory, but they have been thrown out of employment without any consideration by the Government. I have made appeals for the f a ir treatment of these meu, bufc the Government have only given me the cold shoulder. Men who during the war were working in the Munition and Cordite Factories, are entitled to fair play side by side with others who are receiving very generous treatment in deed. By way of illustration I would refer to the position of an officer in the Defence Department who is about sixty-three years of age, but whose services have been retained, although I understand that he is practically over the retiring age. He is a wealthy man, with sufficient capital to enable him to erect half-a-dozen shops in a city area where land values are high. He is drawing a f a ir salary, and his services are retained, whereas men w i th nothing to fal l back on are being dismissed. The arguments advanced by the Opposition in support of the honourable member for Yarra's proposals are exceptionally strong. The honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Watt) did not agree altogether with the views expressed by the honourable member for Yarra, but he went a long way with him. opposite seemed to take to himself and his party all the credit for the remodelling of this B ill . If under these amended proposals greater consideration is being given to the civil side of the Department, ifc is owing chiefly to the opposition offered by the Labour party to the B ill as originally introduced. It is not the faul t of the Opposition that men have been kept waiting for their retiring allowance. brought in much earlier. As a matter of fact, the Minister has taken a considerable time to remodel it , and he now asks us to rush it through the Committee. I am not prepared to deal out lavish emoluments or compensation to those who are high up in the Service while the Government deny a fair deal to the men and women who worked in the munition factories of this country. have been dismissed in the .most ruthless fashion. A brigadier-general, a colonel, or a major seems always to be able to get the ear of the Minister, and as a rule a B ill relating to naval and military matters bears the impress of officers of high rank. A Parliament sujch as this should not tolerate that sort of thing. I intend to support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Yarra( Mr. Scullin), not that I am delighted to deprive men of privileges which they happen to enjoy, but as a protest against the treatment meted out to the rank and file in both the Naval and Military Forces, and particularly to the general employees of the Department. members opposite are satisfied, as they say they are, with the statement of the Minister( Mr Greene), all I can say is that they are very easily pleased. The Ministerdefinitely stated on a previous occasion that the case of the colonel I cited was the only one of the kind, w it h the addition, perhaps, of another. I have to-day cited fifteen cases which are definitely proved, and yet the Minister does not apologize or make any explanation. There is one fact that some honourable members seem to have lost sight of. This is not a Superannuation B ill , but a B ill to compensate men who have suffered in j u r y in the loss of their employment. W it h that object I agree. There haa not been one word said by any honourable member, certainly on this side, objecting to men, An honourable member whether officers or privates, getting adequate compensation for in j u r y done. A point I wish to emphasize is covered by clause 13, which provides that the measure shall not apply to any person who is discharged on having reached the age of retirement. Yet the whole of the M in ister's defence is that it is the practice of the Department to give some gratuity to men who retire. Whatever may have been the practice, it does not affect the ThisB ill could have been present question at a l l ; this is a B ill to provide compensation to men of different ranks because they have been deprived of certain years of service to which they are legally entitled The Government 'are dismissing a number of officers, the list of which I have not been able to exhaust owing to want of time.

278,Mr Scullin ( Y A R R A ) [ 5 . 3 5 ],"I fto keep them employed. There has been no answer to that statement, except one to the effect that there has been a practice, right. The honourable member for Kooin some cases, of giving gratuities. When we point out that these gratuities have usually been given to those of high rank, such as brigadier-generals, and so on, we have the retort that that is a funny argument on the part of the Labour party in support of an objection to paying those of all ranks. But this treatment will not apply to all ranks, nor does the practice of giving gratuities apply to all ranks. The honourable member for Robertson ( Mr Fleming) raised some questions to WhichI should like to reply. of the cases I quoted are those of men over fifty-nine years of age, while three are over fifty-eight-the retiring age of all being definitely fixed at sixty. major-quartermasters and captain-quartermasters are in an entirely different position from that of the average officer, a fact of which the Minister did not inform honourable members. These men are engaged for a definite period, until tbe retiring age of sixty, irrespective of whether they rise in rank or not. The ordinary officer, when he reaches the age of, say, fifty, drops out automatically, unless he has obtained promotion, which gives him an increased term. The remark of the Minister would apply, to some extent, to those cases; but the cases I cite are all of officers who have definite terms of service in the Military Forces. the colonel, leaving fourteen cases of the kind. The case of the colonel is admitted to be an anomaly. The whole of the fourteen officers, as I say, are men who cannot be retired before sixty, or continue in the servioe beyond sixty; it does not matter if they never rise to a higher rank, they do not retire earlier, as they would in any other arm of the service. It is these cases in which the majors and captains, and not the sergeant-majors, as the honourable member for Kalgoorlie said, are affected. Some of these majors and captains only have two months, six months, seven months, and eleven months before they will be retired in the ordinary course. those particular cases. member for Yarra puts them. ber for Robertson ( Mr Fleming) is quite yong ( Sir Robert Best) expressed himself as satisfied with the Minister's explanation, because, he says, the men are due for automatic rises. Nothing of the sort; they are not due for automatic rises, but due for retirement; and under clause 13 they are specifically exempt from the operation of the Billi f they reach the age of sixty years. Clause 13 provides, as I have said, that everybody,' on reaching the retiring age, shall retire without a penny of compensation; and Eight all who reach the retiring age in the future, even when this Bill is passed, will, with the exception of a specially-favoured few, be retired with nothing. The MinisThe ter talked about the Bill applying to the lowest rank as well as to the highest. I challenge the Minister to give me the name of a ranker able gentleman call a ranker ? major who can give you 160! major who is fifty-nine years of age, and who is getting two years of pay for retiring. I ask the Minister to give me the name of a sergeant-major, a non-commissioned officer, or a member of the rank and-file, who is fifty-nine years and ten months old who is being retired on fourteen months' pay. do so. But even if the Minister could give me the name of such a man, I am still opposed to his proposal. If this retrenchment policy had not been introduced those men would automatically have Retired at sixty, and the country would not have been put to the expense of providing this extra money. This is a retrenchment and economy proposal; but if it had not been introduced these men would haveo automatically dropped out, without compensation, as they have been doing ever since there was a Department. A retrenchment measure is now before us which gives a man fourteen months' pay because he is retired two months before his time.

289,Mr Scullin,"The Minister cannotment for services rendereda point that was emphasized by the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell). This is not a Bill to pay for. any services rendered, but a Bill to compensate men for the injury done in dismissing them before their time is up. The Minister talks about men who are qualified for higher rank, but I have shown that in all the cases cited by me the men cannot be employed beyond the age of sixty, and I wish to know how much promotion a man can get in two months. Here is a list of the cases, showing men aged fifty-nine years and ten months, fifty-nine years and seven months, and fifty-eight years and ten months, the youngest in the list being over fifty-seven years of age. If the Government brought down a superannuation scheme that would be another thing, because it would apply to every one, but this measure cannot be applied to other members of the Defence.

Men are being dismissed from the Harness Factory, the Clothing Factory, the Cordite Factory, the Small Arms Factory, and so forth, without compensation; worse than that, the Government, by dismissing men before the retiring age, are depriving them of accrued furlough pay. These men were engaged on the promise that after so many years' service they should receive this pay, but they cannot, of their own accord, retire before sixty and obtain it. Of course, if a man's own misconduct brings about his dismissal it is his own fault, but here we have men, with many years of faithful service, who were drawn into those factories on the promise I have indicated, and who are now being deprived of their furlough pay. Within four months of a man reaching the age of sixty-and there are other cases not quite as bad-h e is discharged after ten years' service, and without his furlough pay. Yet we on this side are told that we are parsimonious when dealing with the military heads. The Minister has declared that the Government are compelled to retire the3« men, and contend that the service would be rendered more inefficient if other men than those selected were retired. My answer is that if the Government cannot carry out a retrenchment policy withonl retiring this class of officers, my advice is to keep those officers on playing golf or some other game, and save £6,000 out of the £10,000. If the Government desire 'superannuation, let them introduce a measure, and, if they so choose, make it retrospective. If compensation ""were paid to these men retired from the factories, or even if jobs were provided for them, there would not be a word of protest from this side of the House. The Minister meets our arguments by saying that "" it is all politics"" with us. What do.es the Minister mean by "" politics"" ? Does he mean that we always stand by the men who have been on the ""breadline"" all their lives? If that is politics, I stand for it. The men affected by this Bill have had high salaries and many years of generous treatment; but the man on the ""breadline"" goes out without a farthing of compensation, or any attempt the meantime, we to provide him with a job, while, at the same time, he is deprived of his accrued furlough pay. answered yet. orable member for Balaclava said that this Bill was placing on the statute-book a sort of haphazard practice of the past. Nothing of the sort; there is nothing permanent about this Bill, which provides only for specific cases. It is not a superannuation Bill providing for all in the service, and, as I say, officers who remain in the service will drop out automatically as hitherto.

If that were all, there would be something in the honourable member's argument, but it is not all. Section 27 of the DefenceA c t gives special power to extend their term of service for two years. exercise it now that he is retrenching his staff? that is my point. Regulation 134 provides thatofficers and soldiers of the Military Forces shall be retired at the ages set forth in the following table, but in special cases of an exceptional nature the Governor General may extend the prescribed age of retirement for a period not exceeding two years. As a matter of fact, it has been the almost invariable practice of the Department to extend the services of quartermasters for the maximum period of two years, and but for this policy of retrenchment, the quartermasters would have had two years added to their term of military service. I was particularly anxious to treat these men well, because there is scarcely a man holding the rank of quartermaster to-day who has not risen from the ranks. However, when it is suggested for the first time that they shall be placed, upon the same basis as the higher-paid military officers, and receive twelve months' pay as compensation, the honourable member for Yarra and his associates oppose the proposal, and say that these men should not get that treatment. The quartermasters have risen from the ranks, and, owing to ability and industry, have carved out for themselves a special position in the Forces, and those are the men who, should not get the compensation that is given to the higher officers. What we are proposing to do is quite fair. The official life of these men is being cut down, in such cases as cited by the honourable member for Yarra, by at least two years and two months, and all we are proposing is to pay them that retiring allowance which Parliament has always paid to higher military officers upon their retirement. and file? on the same level aa the general. The honourable member for Yarra compared the treatment of officers w i th the treatment of sergeant-majors, but I tell him that there are 160 sergeant-majors who are leaving the service, and we have applied to them exactly the same rules as we have applied to the higher military officers.

The Minister claims to have endeavoured to make the Bill as free of anomalies as possible, and to apply it justly to all the classes of persons coming under it ; but the cases to which I direct attention are such as this: A person employed in the Commonwealth Harness Factory, who would have qualified for a substantial retiring allowance on reaching the age of sixty years, is discharged shortly 'before he does so, and thus loses at once both his employment and hie prospective retiring allowance. Such dismissals seem to me almost in the nature of sharp practice; and to be most unjust.

I would point out, however, that the officers whose case we have been discussing this afternoon have no legal claim to the year's pay that the Government propose to give them. I understand it to be the statement of the Minister that he will give compensation in all cases where a sufficiently long period has been served to qualify for consideration. served is eight years, and a man has served four years, I shall try to arrange that he shall be paid proportionate compensation. which men have served ten years but have not reached the age of sixty years, compensaiion will be paid for the years of service. shall arrange for that. appeal to the Minister for Defence( Mr Greene) to give consideration to the case of a number of men who have been employed in the naval dockyard. Under regulations, they are entitled to six months' retiring allowance after having given twenty years' service. I do not suppose that there are more than a dozen or eighteen men concerned, but the greater number of these have been employed for Only a limited number of considerably more than twenty years, first under the State and latterly' in the Commonwealth service. The employees in whose behalf I am speaking have been deprived', purely on a technicality, of their right to a retiring allowance. The Department has taken the stand that if an employee loses any time, no matter for what reason, the lapse amounts to a break in his continuity of servioe, and the retiring allowance is withheld. The Department is adopting a very mean and paltry attitude. About eighteen months ago the naval dockyard was closed down through no fault of the workmen. The authorities now say that the continuity of servioe of all the employees has been broken. No notice is taken of the reason for the compulsory stoppage of work. The Government should give sympathetic consideration to this matter. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a third time. Sitting suspended from 6.2fr to 8 p.m.",47,Third Reading

We have never had a financial statement in which so much endeavour has been made to throw out sops on the eve of an election to every section of the community. In the Budget now under' discussion thei'e has been something for everybody, with the exception of that very deserving portion of the community who are struggling on a small pittance at a time when the cost of living is greatly in excess of what it was years ago. I refer to the invalid and old-age pensioners, who ought to have had first consideration in the matter of improving their conditions. sideration had been given the honourable member would also have described it as a sop. Minister is quite wrong in making that assertion. On numerous occasions I have urged the Government to utilize the accumulated surplus for the purpose of increasing invalid, and old-age pensions. As a rule Treasurers leave a very big margin in the Estimates on which they are working. For instance, in 1921-22 the estimated revenue was £61,787,350, but the actual revenue was £64,897,046, a considerable increase above the amount forecasted, and our present Treasurer is, apparently, following on the lines adopted by his predecessor ( Sir Joseph Cook). He £62,518,250, which he says is an increase of about £730,900 as compared with the -estimate of 1921-22, but as the figures of the actual revenue for that year were known to him, I submit that he should have made his comparison, not with last year's Estimates, but with last year's actual revenue; and then, instead of an increase of £730,000, there would have been an actual decrease of £2,378,796 as compared with the amount of revenue received last year. Any one reading the we were actually to receive more revenue this year than last year, whereas the Treasurer anticipates receiving £2,378,796 less. The Treasurer estimates to expend out of revenue this year £62,023,693 as against last year's actual expenditure of £65,106,949, a decrease of £3,083,256. Here, again, the casual reader would conclude that the cost of government was being reduced to that* extent, whereas, as a matter of fact, the amount is in excess of what was estimated to be expended last year; because we are not to lose sight of the fact that £3,200,000 is to be taken out of the accumulated surplus and used as revenue for the purpose of defraying the cost of administration. Taking that. £3,200,000 into consideration, the actual estimated expenditure for the current financial year is increased as compared with last year's expenditure by no less than £116,744, notwithstanding the fact that the Government propose to spend £1,177,459 less on defence from revenue this year. Therefore, there will be considerably more expenditure this year, and not less, as the Treasurer would have us believe. cannot get away from the faot that we propose to spend £62,023,693 this year as compared with an expenditure of £65,106,949 last year. am putting another complexion on the figures by presenting the actual facts. Although the Government estimate that they will spend £62,023,693, it does not follow that the amount will cover the whole of the expenditure from revenue for the year, because a sum of £3,200,000' is. to be taken from the Surplus Revenue Trust Fund. the total expenditure of £62,023,693 by has estimated a revenue of one farthing. will be spending that £3,200,000 in addition to what we are taking from revenue.",48,Third Reading

These three items added to the £724,934, to which I have just referred, give us a total of £770,949, which last year was provided for out of revenue, b u t which this year iis to come out of loan accoimt. It is an easy matter for the Government to make the financial position look well by adopting such a system. The figures submitted by the Treasurer, when caref u l l y examined, are capable of a very different construction from that placed upon them by the honourable gentleman. The true position is revealed in the facts I have just given. The total increase in the expenditure, which should come out of £887,693. The Treasurer, as the result of hia polioy of providing for certain works out of loan account instead of meeting them out of revenue, as was done last year, is better off to that extent. These figures are really appalling, and demand very careful consideration. The expenditure out of loan in 1921-22 was: War £5,246,503, or a total of £12,823,480, whereas for 1922-23 the loan expenditure is to be £17,250,924, or an increase pf £4,427,444.

The honourable member for East Sydney( Mr West) recently p u t to the Treasurer a question as to the relative cost of loan notations in Australia and abroad, and the answer he obtained shows that the loans that we float outside the Commonwealth cost considerably more than do those raised within Australia. We are too prone to r u n abroad for loan money. The Government seem to be ever ready to float a loan overseas instead of tapping the local money market. During the war, we tried the local market,, and it responded nobly to our demands. Australia to-day is better off than any other country that took part in the war, revenue this year, is actually yet the Government are raising money overseas. member should not forget that the Government drained the Australian market very dry. the Government borrow in Australia soon loan, £7,567,977: works loan, finds its way back through the ordinary, channels to the banking institutions, so that it is again loaned out, and is used to develop the country. to bring in fresh capital. the cost. The honourable member for East Sydney asked the Treasurer, on notice, the following question: Will he give the following particulars in regard to loans raised during the period that SirJoseph Cook, late Treasurer, held office:£3,660,000; and 1924-25, (a) The number of loans.

A £5,000,000 loan floated in London cost this country £166,303, whereas a loan of £26,612,560 floated in Australia cost us only £109,318. The Australian loan was floated at par, whereas the loan in London was floated at 95, so that, in addition to having to pay a great deal more by way of flotation charges, we got only £95 for every £100 of the issue of £5,000,000. It will also be seen that the cost of floatThe year before last we had a sinking ing a loan of £10,086,940 in Australia was only £52,860 as against £153,177 which we had to pay by way of costs on the floating of a loan of £5,000,000 in London. practically within twelve months. I do not know how to account for the difference. underwriting charges. has to be made for the stamp duty in connection with all the British loans. pared with the underwriting costs. remarkable that, although we can float a loan here for about one-third of the cost of floating a loan abroad, the Government insist upon obtaining money overseas. This is a matter that should be carefully considered. The Treasurer, as a shrewd man, no doubt will carefully watch the money market, and whenever money is cheaper will do his best to liquidate some of our present loans as they fall due. We are not justified, however, in paying so much as we have done for the floating of loans overseas. It is about time that we were advised of the reasons for the increased cost. We have a High Commissioner in London to attend to these matters, so that the cost should not be excessive. It may be as the honorable member for Balaclava says, that the underwriting charges are largely responsible for the difference. float a loan in London except through the proper channels. exactly what those ""proper channels"" were-if the whole matter were fully explained to the House-w e might be able to change the system. It seems, however, that the Government have got into a rut and cannot get out of it . ' Our gross national debt on 30th June last was £416,070,509. Of that amount we can expect to recover £74,949,731 r leaving us. with a net national debt of £341,120,778. Alterations are being made in the rate of payment to the Sinking Fund. The Treasurer now proposes that the Sinking Fund shall be £ per cent., and Ihe tells us that will enable us to redeem the national debt in fifty years. fund of 1 per cent.

I think that there should be a special Committee, consisting of members of all parties, to go into the whole question of the indebtedness of the Commonwealth. I do not think it should be a party matter at all. Treasurer has dealt very fairly with the national debt? Treasurer ( Mr Bruce), like all other Treasurers, is doing his best in the face of a very difficult problem; and that is why I suggest, in order to assist him , that there ought to be a. Committee of representative men from, different sides to go into the question of our. debt and to report to the House. I now t u r n to the question of immigration, in regard to which the Government have taken up an entirely different attitude from that indicated by a statement made by the Prime Minister in this House. When we were dealing with the question some little time ago, the Prime Minister said that, so f a r as the Government were concerned, they would not assist in bringing immigrants to this country unless there was employment for them and provision made for their reception. were endeavouring to make some arrangement with the States to this end, but immigrants would not be brought out here and thrown promiscuously on the .labour market in the different capital cities. The sum set down under the head of immigration is £200.000, and some time ago I asked the Prime Minister the following questions: In connection with the migration agreement just signed by the High Commissioner in London on behalf of the Commonwealth, will he state(a) For how much money is the Commonwealth committed? (6) For what period has this agreement been made? (c) 'What portion of the money for which the Commonwealth is responsible will be recoverable, and from whom? (d) How many immigrants' passage money will this cover? (e) Were definite arrangements for settling This the men on the land made with every State before the agreement was signed? (/) If so, what is the quota desired by I do not know whether it each State during the period mentioned in the agreement? The replies of the Prime Minister werei(a) and (c) £200,000-£100,00 0 of which is to be advanced by way of loan to approved immigrants and subsequently recovered. (6) For a period expiring on 31st March, 1923. (d) Approximately, 16,000 to 20,000. (e) No. (/) See (e). This agreement is not ""a migration agreement in the sense conveyed by the question. It is a passage agreement made D o not you thin k the between the British and Commonwealth Governments, under which the British Government undertakes to share equally with the CommonI third? that the wealth in defraying the passages of any approved immigrants during the period mentioned. No immigrants oan be brought to Australia .under the above agreement unless and until they have been requisitioned by the States. This, then, evidently is no part of the arrangement entered into with the States, but one made w i th the British Government. There is no doubt that if the immigrant is fortunate enough to obtain employment he may return 'money that is advanced to h i m ; but there is no guarantee of employment. The answers to my questions are a direct negative to what the Prime Minister had previously stated fro m his place in the House. What are these expected immigrants going to do? Are they going to join the already large armies of unemployed in our cities? Isi t a fair thing to bring men out here when we cannot find employment for our He added that the Government own people? W ill such a policy improve Australia in the eyes of Great Britain? In my opinion, the result must be disastrous. We are going, to spend £200,000 -whic h I suppose will be borrowed-no t in a direction that w ill be reproductive, but in a way that will give a bad name to this country for years to come, and prevent the general influx of population. If we can find employment for our own people and there are vacancies here for others, I have nothing to say against immigration. If , however, we can make Australia sufficiently attractive we shall find plenty of people in other parts of the world ready to come here;, make the conditions good and we shall not lack immigrants. I do not -wish to labour the question further than to show that the policy of the Government is a direct departure from what the Prime Minister",52,Budget 1922 23
382,Mr Atkinson,,53,Budget 1922 23
383,Mr Charlton,"aaid when we were dealing with the question some time ago. I repeat that in every State of the Commonwealth to-day 'there are thousands of able-bodied men unemployed; and it is for that reason that we desire public works to be started to absorb them, and to assist at the same time in developing the country. There is' no likelihood of those men getting work for some years to comes-that is, until the impoverished conditions prevailing in other parts of the world improve, and there is a greater demand for the commodities we produce. Immigration with some people is really a '' fad ' ' ; they have party has been in power. an idea that all they have to do is to shout "" Immigration!"" and get the press behind them in the agitation, in order to show that they are doing something for the country. The true patriots are those who would make provision for their own people and afterwards bring their fellowmen from overseas when there is work for them to do. This heedless cry of immigration will not help the country, but, on the other hand, must do an immense amount of injury. Then we have to consider the question of old-age and invalid pensions. said at the beginning, we have been endeavouring for the last few years to get the pension increased, realizing that the old people are entitled to more consideration. proaches in that direction we have received the ""cold shoulder""; yet it is proposed |to take trust money for the purpose of reducing the taxation of people who are in a much better position than other sections of the community to bear it . I have nothing to say against the reduction of taxation, if it can be done legitimately; but we are not justified in removing the burden from shoulders that are well able to bear it , while the pensioners are not able to live on the pittance they receive. people should be our first consideration, and when their claims have been satisfied we may do what we like in regard to the reduction of taxation. The trust fund has hitherto been recognised by members of this House as created for the purpose of paying invalid and old-age pensions. Just before the House rose last December we passed a measure providing that the pensions might be paid out of the surplus; and here I may say that the particular surplus the Government is operating on for the purpose of reducing taxation was chiefly accumulated by members on this side when they were in power. In 1910, when the Labour Government was returned, there was a deficit of some £656,149, but in 1913, when we left office, there was' a surplus of between £2,000,000 and £3,000,000. When the Labour Government came back to power, in 1915, that surplus had been reduced by over £1,000,000, but when we leftoffice after the breach in the party, the surplus had increased to something like £5,000,000. Very little has been added to the surplus, except when the Labour in the fund in 1916 when the breach took place-the highest figure was £3,000,000. correction; but, at any rate, I can say that the surplus grew while the Labour party had control. the war. The surplus I speak of was accumulated prior to the war-in 1910-13. However, the point is that that money As I was always regarded as being tliere for the purpose of paying old-age and invalid pensions. not increase the pensions as the present Every time we have made apGovernment have done. had we been returned at the last elections the poor people would have been receiving £ 1 per week all through. Further, if we are returned at the next elections, one of our first acts will be to increase the amount. On the 30th June, 1922, there were 144,115 pensioners, and an extra 5s. per week would amount to £36,029 per week, or £1,873,408 per annum. The Government can take £3,200,000 to relieve the These poor old taxation of the general public, but an extra 5s. per week, which would amount to the figure I have just stated, is denied to the poor people. It is said that the extra money cannot be granted, notwithstanding the fact that there is over £6,000,000 in the surplus fund. If evenhanded justice is to be dealt all round, we might, at least, take these pensioners into consideration and appropriate as much from the surplus as will give them each 5s. more per week. But no; these are the only people who are to be denied. One wonders why they are denied. It is",53,Budget 1922 23

Evidence of that desire is provided by the meetings that are held from time to time to advocate the abolition of the Arbitration Court. What do the public servants say about that policy? This is a letter that was sent to me to-day by the General Secretary of the Commonwealth Public Service Clerical AssociationDEAR SIB, Proposed Amendment to Arbitration [Public Serviee) Act: Treasurer's Budget. I have been directed by the executive of my Association to invite your consideration of the proposal made by the Commonwealth Treasurer in his Budget:""That the Arbitration (Public Service) Act 1920 should be amended to the extent of excluding from its provisions officers of the Service in receipt of salaries exceeding £310 per annum."" This proposal meets with the strongest .possible objection from all Commonwealth public servants, irrespective of the salaries enjoyed by them. Conferences of .public servants have been held to discuss the matter, and ihe following considerations have been advanced as proof of the unanimous contention that the Government's proposal will mean both a loss of efficiency to the Service, and an injustice to officers:(1) The right of submission to Arbitration Tribunals of claims in respect of salaries and conditions of employment was granted to Commonwealth public servants in 1911, when nine years' experience 'of Public Service control and management had proved that this was advisable. (2) The present Arbitration (Public Service) Act was passed at the end of 1920, largely in order-(1 ) to facilitate the hearing of claims by public servants; and (2) to insure a uniformity in judgments in regard to sueh claims, which had not been possible when cases were heard by a number of Arbitration Court Judges. (3) The Public Service Arbitrator has only been functioning a little over one year, and yet during that time, over thirty cases of all kinds have been conducted before him. It would he a matter of very serious public loss if the Arbitrator were cut short in his work just at the time when a number of important cases were listed for settlement, and when his carefully prepared views on certain subjects are calculated to prove of very great Public Service value. (4) Whatever demerits might exist in respect of the arbitration system in ordinary industrial matters (and that any such do exist of an essential nature is not admitted), yet, so far as arbitration for the Public Service* is concerned, nothing but admiration is felt from the whole Service for the theoretical principle. (5) The Arbitrator is, in effect, more than an Arbitration Court Judge. He iB a public servant of very great value to the administration of the Service. Claims are submitted for his consideration comprising very many matters besides salary conditions."" It is confidently asserted that the Arbitrator is in a better position to rectify certain kinds of anomalies than either the present Commissioner is, or the proposed Board of Commissioners would be. (6) It is -to be remembered that the Arbitrator hears both sides of every question^ Access to the present Commissioner is practically impossible. The present Commissioner "" sits aloft in awful state,-"" .and all 'submissions to him have to be made through the unsatisfactory medium of written communication. The Arbitrator is able to hear evidence on various matters, and can form 'his conclusions after having looked at the matter from all possible points of view. The decisions of the Commissioner are ex parte, and the point of view of officers is never adequately considered. The Commissioner has adopted the slogan that ""the Public Service is not instituted for the good of public servants."" This is readily admitted, hut it is pointed out that a rigid insistence upon a narrow formula leads to frequent injustice. Public servants have a right to consideration, at least, and the public, whose servants they are, would be the first to admit this. (7) Many of the judgments made iby the Arbitrator have been of material assistance to the Commissioner himself, and the ventilation of the point of view of officers 'has led to reforms which would never have been contemplated had not the higher-class officers been in a position to .place their case before the Arbitrator. (8) The Treasurer's proposal makes an invidious discrimination between classes of officers. Surely, if arbitration ior public servants is sound in principle, it is sound for all officers. Public servants are organized upon lines in which no clashing of interests of higher and lower class officers can possibly 'arise. After ten years of arbitration experience, associations are so formed that no dangers ever occur in regard to administrative discipline. From the highest officer to the lowest, the principle of arbitration has been universally embraced, and all officers are 'anxious that the present system should remain in force. (0) The proposed division of officers into reduction was proposed!; on the contrary, two camps will have a catastrophic effect upon the efficient administranow than they did a few months ago. tion of the Service, and will make the task of the Public Service Commissioner incomparably more difficult than it is at present. Yours faithfully, A. V. LAKGKEH. The publio servants are opposed to any effort to deprive them of tbe benefits of arbitration, and they are perfectly justified in making a protest. They have a right to claim that their grievances shall be referred to arbitration, and unless that is conceded, we shall have little chance of getting a satisfactory and contented Service. If the publio servants are constantly at loggerheads with the Commissioner, and have no means of adjusting' their differences, there can be nothing but dissatisfaction in their ranks, and that will not conduce to the benefit of the Commonwealth.' The Treasurer stated that the Government did not intend, at the present juncture, to propose a reduction in the wages of publio servants, but they are of opinion that the allowance that has been granted to officers of the Commonwealth during recent years should be reduced in accordance with the reduction in the cost of living. We have heard a good deal about a reduction in the cost of hving. At the end of last year a bold effort was made to break down the conditions of the workers on the ground that the reduction in the cost of living and the economio circumstances warranted a reduction in wages and an increase in working hours. The State Government of New South Wales recently reduced the basic wage of the Public Service to £3 18s. 6d. per week, and ever since the cost of living has been rising. I read in the press during the last few days that, even in Victoria, the living wage was fixed at £4 la. 6d. on the basis of the Statistician's figures. It is anticipated that the New South Wales Government will permit the Board of Trade-I admit the Board of Trade may act only with the permission of the Government-to declare an advance in the basic wage to £4 Is. in that State. an endeavour was made which, I am sorry to say, -was supported by men in this House, to reduce wages and working conditions on account of the reduced cost of living. To-day, we find that the workers are in no better position as regards the cost of living than they were before the Mr Charlton. they have to pay more for their living That experience illustrates how careful we must be in regard to these matters. ister said that the cost of living was falling, and tliat wages would have to fall in proportion. ster and the Premier of South Australia and others were advocating a reduction in wages in order to restore economic stability-as if the starvation of the people who (have to produce tha wealth of the country will conduce to the country's welfare. Whilst the Government say that they will not reduce the wages of public servants at the present time, they intend to approach the Arbitrator from time to time for a review of the cost of living allowance. Nobody can take exception to their approaching the Arbitrator on this matter, but I da strongly object to them depriving men in receipt of a salary of over £310 per annum of the right of appearing before that tribunal. It is to be left to the Government to decide what salaries and conditions are fair for those men. be appointed who will decide that. Commissioners be appointed, why should the higher-paid officers be deprived of the right of going before the Arbitrator, to whom they and the Government could state their case, leaving it to him to decide on the evidence adduced ? No system could be fairer than that; but if it be right to take the privilege of arbitration away from men receiving upwards of £310 per annum, we should, to be logical, take it away from everybody. Arbitration is as necessary for those men as it is for those receiving less pay. Throughout Australia there is a class of men who, though they would have nothing to do with arbitration years ago, are now clamouring for it. Bank clerks, since they adopted the principle of arbitration, have received ever so much more pay Yet than they received before. School teachers would never have entertained the thought of arbitration in years gone by, but to-day they are asking that their claims be referred to arbitration. In New South Wales they swear by arbitration, because they know of the benefits' that it is likely to yield them. The Trea-",55,Budget 1922 23

403,Mr Charlton,"Even if threesurer was careful to point out that whilst the Government do not intend to reduce the wages of public servants at the present juncture, the whole matter will receive further consideration at a later period in the light of the conditions then obtaining. That is identical, almost word for word, with the statement made by Sir George Fuller during the recent State elections in New South Wales. He said to the public servants, "" Do not be afraid; support the Nationalist party; we shall not interfere with the conditions cf employment and salaries if we get into office."" been in office only a few months, and every public servant has suffered a reduction, and a further decrease is in prospect. Of course, a party must always be careful before going to the people to tell them that they do not intend to follow a policy of reduction, but as soon as the election is over, the successful party gives the people a taste of the medicine it had in store for them. NowI come to the question of members' salaries. action of the Government, particularly of the Prime Minister.. I cannot understand a man who introduced a measure for the increase of members' salaries, and who, on a subsequent occasion, when tbe increase was challenged by the honourable member for Swan( Mr Prowse), again supported that increase, now saying that he proposes to reduce the salaries by £200, apparently for no other reason than that he is about to go to the country. Either we are not worth £1,000, and were not justified in increasing our salaries to that .amount, or we should stand by that increase. I say now that I shall not flinch from the position I have taken up on previous occasions. 1 would not vote for a reduction, and then go back and face my constituents for all the gold that is in the Commonwealth. I shall stand by what I have done. I believe that a member of this House is worth every penny he is getting; any man who has to maintain two homes, and incur all the other expenses incidental to parliamentary life, has not much of his salary left. I do not like to refer to these matters, but how many members of this Parliament have died during our servioe in this House, and have left their wives so poorly provided for that they have had to go to work? AmI to be told that if I give the best' years of my life to the service of my country, acting conscientiously in accordance with my principles, I should be able to provide for my wife and family? Men in less important positions outside Parliament are in many cases getting twice as much as we are paid, and nothing is said against them. Now, however, when we have to face the people in the near future, the Government propose to practically undo what we did at their instigation at the beginning of this Parliament. But the people of Australia will resent the pusillanimity of those who stultify themselves by voting to inThe Fuller Government have crease their salaries at a time when the election is two years off and vote to reduce these salaries by £200 per annum when the shadow of the election is upon them again. Those who do that must answer to their constituents, and they will not find that they have gained by their action. There is sufficient backbone in members on this side to enable us to place the true position before the people. the honourable -member has just referred I am surprised at the are returned to Parliament, cannot they raise their salaries again? is justified. With one exception-and the gentleman to whom I refer has been thoroughly consistent in the matter-the members of this party, having voted for the increase of salary, will stand by what they did. We shall not run away from the consequences of our action because the Prime Minister and his Government now propose the reduction of the parliamentary allowance in order to gain votes. Those who do so will pay the penalty. Prime Minister repeated that the position of a member of Parliament is worth £1,000 a year. policy of the Government is not to compete with private enterprise, and the Commonwealth factories, . if the Government Departments cannot absorb their output, are to be closed. This is a departure from the earlier policy of the Prime Minister and his friends. The right honourable gentleman, with many others on that side, took a prominent part in establishing these factories, which have done good work, and stand to the credit of those who brought them into existence. It cannot be said that they have not been profitable, because they have paid their",57,Budget 1922 23

Government talk of the need for reducing wages, and at the same time do all they can to keep up the cost of living; they do not assist the people to get things more reasonably. Their view is that a Government factory must not come into competition with private enterprise, lest it should supply articles too cheaply. have spent millions of pounds on machinery and plant, and this capital is to be allowed to remain idle so that Government enterprise may not compete with the private enterprise of the friends of the Ministry. support. They fear, too, a breach in the Coalition party. To prevent these things they throw principle to the winds, and are prepared to get rid of the Commonwealth factories, or to allow them to remain unproductive. The Treasurer said that many of these factories, which have been giving work to large numbers of men, are for the future to be carried on with just sufficient hands to keep them going. Thus hundreds of thousands of pounds' worth of machinery will remain unused so that Government enterprise may not come into competition with private enterprise. Ministers and their friends say, "" Let these public factories be sold. Do not use them to bring down the cost of living and make things cheaper for the people."" They do all they can to make the conditions of the workers harder, and at the same time cause them to pay exorbitant prices for the commodities they use. That is the present policy of the Government regarding these Commonwealth trading concerns. A t Bendigo the Prime Minister( Mr used to assist our primary producers, and Hughes) declared that, so far as he and his Government were concerned, not one stone of the temple of Labour would be removed; yet the right honourable gentleman is now not merely removing the stone, but is also taking away the very foundation of that temple. said at Bendigo, but at North Sydney he will say something different.

Married men should have such an allowance. There should also be an increased deduction for children. At any rate, the result of these remissions will be of benefit to the working people, and the only regret I have is that the proposals do not go far enough, and were not brought in years ago, because we find working people with a limited income asked to pay income tax when they are unable to do so. Quite a number of men have waited on me within the last few months because they find that they are unable to pay their income tax. They may have had a good time last year, but they have received their assessments just when, through unemployment or because they have had intermittent work, they find they have not the money with which to pay the tax. I cannot understand the attitude of the Government in regard to the proposed bounty on the manufacture of wire netting, fencing wire, and galvanized iron, whioh is to be accompanied by a reduction of the protective duty on' those articles. It seems to me that there is little justification for the removal of a duty imposed only a short time ago by this Parliament. impending election. member is quite right in anticipating an early election. The iron and steel industry afforded the protection which it is now sought to remove, and there is quite a number of subsidiary industries drawing their raw material from the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company which will also be affected. .What inducement will there be to manufacturers to establish works in Australia for making galvanized iron or wire netting if the duties are removed? guarantee in a bounty. liament can decide at any moment that the bounty shall not be paid; and if that is done there will be an end to the particular industry concerned. out a duty at any time. a rule, it is not done.

There are 3,000 men employed at the BrokenH ill Proprietary's steel works at Newcastle. It is certainly true that during the last seven or eight months the works have been practically idle, not more than 700 or 800 men being engaged. The following remarks made, by the chairman of directors of the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company Limited at a meeting of shareholders, as reported in the Argus of 26th August last, are very interesting:"" The statement made by the Federal Treasurer last week that the Government was reducing the duties upon wire netting, fencing wire, and galvanized iron imposed eight months ago, aud introducing a bounty in its place, is most perturbing in its incidence, ttnd adds to thc many anxieties under which we are at present labouring.

The two should be combined. In fact, they should have been combined long ago. they have not been so combined. whose fault it is. I believe it was a mistake to take away the administration of war pensions from the Old-age Pensions Office. It was done, possibly, with the idea of keeping the Repatriation Department in evidence at a time when its work was gradually being reduced. I believe that money could be saved by transferring the administration of war pensions to the ofiice which formerly undertook it satisfactorily, and that the little work then remaining to be undertaken by the Repatriation Department oould be taken in hand by other Departments. There are many ways in which money could be saved, but no attempt is made in that direction. There is no improvement in this Budget so far as the finances are concerned, and, as I have already indicated, the expenditure has been increased, and not reduced. is an old and trite saying that government is finance, and finance is government. The suggestion underlying it, although not new, is true, that the base of all government is money. condition our policies, our resources govern our ambitions. There never was a time when those statements were truer than they are to-day. The importance of a clear vision and correct appreciation of finance to the Commonwealth and to the nations who engaged in the recent war, in the present decade, cannot be exaggerated, although, having, regard to the few honourable members who are present in this Committee of Supply, one would hardly think that was so. [REPRESENTATIVES.] (1922-23). appears to me that when so serious a subject as the Budget is before, the Committee the bulk of the members of the House should be present. Spectacular or If honourable members will go dramatic subjects, however, usually attract more attention and a larger attendance. In the Budget we ought to take stock of our resources; we should honourable look at the immediate past, survey the present, and speculatively scan the future. Upon our understanding of the past and the present, and our accurate It is ridiculous that anticipation of the future, depends almost entirely the wisdom or folly of our ambitions or objectives. The Treasurer ( Mr Bruce) has given us his views and the views of his professional ofiicers upon these questions in a statement that, I think, was admirably clear both in mode of presentation and in matter. I do not always agree with his interpretation of facts or his enunciation of policy; but there was no mistaking the meaning of his statement. In some respects, at was quite a frank, an unblushingly frank, statement; but there were one or two subjects on which he was scarcely so candid. Some important and pressing problems were postponed for subsequent consideration and settlement. Broadly, I agree with the Leader of the Opposition. This is an Election Budget, designed to influence the voters in the constituencies in favour of the Government. I do not say that is sinful. I believe that every Government exhibits a tendency to flirt with the electors, but some of them do so more audaciously than others. It is an error in tactics, however, to do so openly and to be so transparent about it. This Budget may or may not prove to be a votecatcher. It was clearly intended to be; but, unfortunately for the Government, the snare was set in the sight of the bird, and although the bird will probably conOur means sume the crumbs, he may prove wary when dealing with the snare itself. L do not object to gifts for the taxpayer, but I believe the taxpayer will ask that those gifts be provided from a different source than that contemplated by the Treasurer. I think the taxpayer, would rather have them from definite and continuing economies, and not from a squandering of our patrimony. Of that, however, I propose to speak later. I desire, first of all, to take a very It brief look at the immediate past. Last",62,Alteration In Tariff

459,Mr Watt (Balaclava) [9.30],"Ther eyear according to the Treasurer's figures, t the Government showed a deficit of £209,000. Honourable members will probably recollect the treatment of last year's Budget in Committee of Supply. The Committee was alarmed at the magnitude of the proposed disbursements, and made resolute and sustained endeavours to reduce the proposed expenditure. In that it was successful. According to the records we lopped off, in one lump, £500,000. We should have gone further but for the persistent assurances of the Government that it would cut the expenditure to a still greater extent as the year progressed. The Committee, trusting to the pledge of the Government, desisted from further efforts. What happened? The Estimates as submitted by the then ( Sir £64,604,458. We cut that down to £64,104,458. We took off half a million. The Treasurer, however, admits that he spent last year not £64,104,458, but £65,118,628. In other words, he admits that he and his predecessor, between them, disbursed £1,000,000 more than the Parliament authorized, and £500,000 more than the amount for which the Government originally asked. The wishes of this Committee were as plain as the sun at noon-day. The Government, however, took no notice of our wishes, nor did they have regard to their own promises to the Committee. The more frugal the Parliament was the more prodigal became the Government. This Committee asked for a decrease. It got an increase, and no apology or explanation has yet been offered the Committee. I do not want to place undue responsibility for all these things upon the present Treasurer, because, if I remember aright, he took office at the end of the second quarter of the year. Honourable members who have held ofiice as Treasurer know that commitments are very often arranged in perhaps too lavish a scale for the first half of the year,, and that a Treasurer who comes to take charge of the Treasury for the last two quarters finds that the brake is probably not equal c to the pulling power of the Departments. But as government is a thing possessing continuity of existence, we must put the responsibility on the Government; and, except in a few individual cases, the Government responsible for the start of this financial year is responsible for the finish of it. After this very brief, and, I hope, justifiable, comment on the expenditure of last year, I should like to outline the outstanding features of this year's Budget as they occur to me. The first point is that the Postal Department is still to be used as a taxing machine. The Leader of the Opposition made allusionto the profits earned last year and expected this year. It is clear that postal receipts are again to be used in aid of revenue, and that the Department is to be used as a taxing machine. The second point is that we had last yearj as I have already mentioned, a deficit of £209,000. The third is that ordinary expenditure is still rising. Treasurer According to the Treasurer's figures, it Joseph Cook), amounted to has risen 100 per cent, in eight years. TEe fourth point is that the total disbursements this year are to be greater than last year by £1,344,000. The Trea-' purer, as reported in the newspapers, said at the Rotary Club luncheon yesterday, that the expenditure this year would be £3,000,000 less than last year. If he was reported in extfnso, he did himself an injustice. expenditure out of revenue. mention that the expenditure referred to was out of revenue. According to the newspaper reports, the honourable gentleman said that his expenditure this year would be £3,000,000 less than ifc was last year. The expenditure out of revenue is certainly £3,000,000 less, but the figures which were alluded to by the Leader of the Opposition, but not summarized, are these:1921-22. Loan expenditure . . £12,S23,480 Expenditure out of revenue 65,106,949 Total .. . . £77,930,429 1922-23.

I am not",63,Alteration In Tariff
460,Mr Bbuce,I was speaking of the,64,Alteration In Tariff
461,Mr Watt,"The newspapers did notcomplicating the argument at this stage by a reference to the remission of taxation alluded to by the last speaker. It appeared to me that he used the figures in a way that I should not feel justified in employing them. I have given a fair comparison of the bare figures of revenue and loan expenditure in the two years 1921-22 and 1922-23. The fifth feature of the Budget is that this increase of £1,344,188 is proposed notwithstanding huge savings in defence expenditure, induced primarily and justifiably by the results of the Washington Conference. The sixth point is that this increased expenditure is also notwithstanding the natural and inevitable falling off in expenditure under three distinct headings, namely, on war pensions by £278,000, repatriation by £321,000, and other war services by £779,000, or a total falling off this year, as compared with last we sanction this, we are truly a prodigal year, on these three items of expenditure, of £1,378,000. Notwithstanding savings in defence, and these fallings off, in the region of between £3,000,000 and £4,000,000, our expenditure is still l£ million pounds greater than last year. The seventh point is that, even allowing for these savings and fallings off, the surplus of £494,000 anticipated for this year is contrived by transferring expenditure, as the Leader of the. Opposition has wisely and forcibly said, from revenue to loan account. I do not trouble honourable members with all the figures; but, broadly, in one Department -that of the Postmaster-General£3,000,000 is expressed in those transfers. or wholly. The first method would have gentleman's pardon. tently led into a mistake. That is the sum. transferred this year,' and the sum last year will have to be taken off it . The eighth point is that when all this is taken into account-al l these important 'factors of our finances-if the redemption fund were not deprived this year of a substantial contribution this surplus would then be turned into a deficit. These facts are more alarming when it is remembered that recently a new source of revenue-the note issue profits of £1,150,000 anticipated for this year-ha s been brought to account and swallowed. priated to revenue in last year's Budget for the first time, though I do not think it was a full year; but this year the full amount is expressed in anticipated receipts. If it were not for those figures our position would be worse by that amount of £1,150,000. Let me recapitulate briefly, and gauge the cumulative effect of all these factors. After gigantic savings in defence and the natural falling off in the expenditure on war pensions, repatriation and war services, transfers to loan of large sums of money formerly borne by revenue, the starvation of our redemption fund and the consumption of the profits of the note issue, we are only able to show a surplus of less than £500,000. In the face of these startling and interesting facts, the Treasurer proposes to remit taxation out of the reserves of past years, amounting, broadly, to £3,200,000. I think that if and easily satisfied people. My friend, the Treasurer, calls this sound finance. to bankruptcy, if we go on long enough. Let me now take the proposal of the Government to use the accumulated surplus in the relief of taxation. When the Treasurer sat down to design his Budget he could have attacked his task in either of two ways. He could have repressed expenditure to the utmost limits of prudence, and have reduced taxation by the amount saved; or he could have laid hands on the surplus, and dissipated, it partially been irksome and, in some quarters, unpopular, but the second method was I was inadverpleasant, and the Treasurer succumbed and took the easy road. He elected to play the role of a dispenser of gifts rather than that of economist. He consequently borrowed the savings of his predecessors rather than make them himself, and he leaves to his successors the uninviting task of putting revenue and expenditure on a sound and enduring basis. Non-recurring savingsI use the word advisedly, and dwell on it with pardonable emphasis-non-recurrin g savings are to provide for recurring doles. One encore to that performance, and his resources are exhausted. Then what? I think the only man who would be It was approundisturbed by that question would be the late lamented Wilkins Micawber.

I have here figures recently published in the press, originally, I believe, in the Sydney Daily Telegraph or in the Age of Melbourne, and though I have not had time to verify them completely, my investigations lead me to believe they are approximately correct. They give a comparison of the number of employees of the Commonwealth and the State Services, and the total amount of their salaries, in the years 1900 and 1921. In 1900 the number of employees, State and Federal, was 89,831, and in 1921 it was 248,976. In 1900 the salaries of these emplovees amounted to £11,733,815, and in 1921 to £55,689,613. I believe thafc fche people have also resolved that the activities of Government must in the future be more confined than in the past, and reduced to the absolutely essential services the community demands, at least so long as this country, which so ardently shrieks for development, has the unproductive wan debt under which we^ unfortunately labour. In other words,* the nation, like the individual, must live within its means, and if it cannot afford luxuries it must ""cut them out."" This community I believe, is not prepared to continue indefinitely to pay heavy war imposts just because it is difficult or disspecial appropriations, and he stressed in agreeable to enforce economies in the public Departments of the Commonwealth and States. If economies are not practised, theso remissions of taxation must surely be reimposed. If we do not presuppose that, we must suppose something else that no member of the House will agree to;that is to say, that our Protectionist Tariff, which we hoped would block importation, and stimulate our secondary and tertiary industries, will settle down as a large revenue collector. I do not believe that, although the present condition in London of the balances in favour of Australia certainly incline leading financial and mercantile houses to a larger system of importation at present. That, however, is because Australia's credits are swollen there, and it is the only way they can be transferred to Australia. We hope the Tariff will effect its purpose; but if it does not Tariff, but becomes a big. revenue earner, I hope that in the near future the Government will amend it. It was designed, not to collect heavy revenues, but to protect the industries of this country. The Treasurer may say, in his own admirable way, smooth things about statutory commitments. He may suggest, as the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) on more than one occasion has suggested, by direct expression or implication, that we must honour our war obligations-that there must be no repudiation at all of our statutory commitments. To me there is nothing sacred in statutory commitments as statutory commitments. The Government that introduced them may recommend alteration, and the Parliament which sanctioned them may approve of the alteration. No one suggests the dishonouring of definite obligations into which this country and Parliament cheerfully and intelligently entered. The Treasurer may talk to us about special appropriations; but there is no sanctity about special appropriations as special appropriations. member that in all my speeches I have said' that there is nothing sacrosanct about either.

I remind thc Treasurer of this axe, because I do not believe either the Treasurer or other Ministers, with the multifarious duties they have to perform, can possibly attack the question of saving money in the Departments and at the same timedischarge their administrative tasks. The British Government recognised that, and appointed a special commission, at the head of which was Sir Eric Geddes, who was supported by a body of influential and powerful commercial .men. members of the Commonwealth Government require the assistance of such men I would not hesitate for a second, if I were in their place, in securing the services of capable men to deal with this problem. member appoint such a Commission when he was in ofiice ? a report, which has been placed in the archives for mice to nibble.

I would have done my best to give effect to its recommendations had I remained a member of the Government, which, as honourable members will doubtless recollect, I did not. good reasons for pigeon-holing the report. During the war the taxpayers, I believe, cheerfully submitted to the heavy impositions placed upon them, but I do not believe they will continue to submit. to such impositions if Parliament does not attempt to return to normal expenditure. I agree with the Treasurer that we cannot hope to get back to a pre-war basis, because this country has marched many leagues since 1914. But economies may be effected, and if this Government cannot discover in which direction money can be saved, their successors will be bound to do so. Let me speak for a few minutes on the remission of taxation. I do not think it would be wise at this juncture to occupy the time of the Committee in discussing the taxation proposals in detail, because they can be dealt with more fully when The Treasurer has the measures to give effect to them are submitted for our consideration. In the first place, it is proposed to l if t the exemption from £104 and £156 to £200, and to abolish the distinction between single and married taxpayers. This may be a popular proposal, but I do not approve of it . People should have a visible interest in keeping down taxation, and the rates of £104 and £156, which I consider were appropriately applied before, might well be maintained. The figures in regard to the number of If the persons who paid income tax and the yields from taxation are interesting. I have not had time to get later figures than for 1920; but the Treasurer will have those for later years. The Government Statist's figures show that 4 per cent, of the taxpayers-no t of the people -pa y 80 per cent, of the taxation. And 96 per cent, of the taxpayers pay 20 per cent, of the taxes. Puttingi t in another way, one twenty-fifth of the taxpayers pay four-fifths of the taxation, and twenty-four twenty-fifths of the taxpayers pay one-fifth of the taxation. I believe, as I shall have occasion to show .shortly, that we are treating some of the .heaviest taxpayers i h the Commonwealth in an injurious and ruinous way. I gave some illustrations in Committee of Supply last year which honourable members will find interesting. I quoted, I think, four cases where men were paying the great bulk of their income to the Treasury, although they were embarking and persevering in important industries in this country. I have. been intrusted with a further illustration by an ex-member of this ChambeT, who has given me the liberty to use it. No one will doubt the word of the Honourable Agar Wynne, who figured so conspicuously in this Parliament for a long while. He gave me an illustration of what is happening to-day with the Caloola Pastoral Company, in Queensland, which has two properties, which were purchased for £123,000. During the seven years of the company's existence it has paid one dividend amounting to £7,000, or rather less than 1 per",66,Alteration In Tariff

I believe that the State Governments, who will have the responsibility of operating the unified system and financing the conversion charges on top of the present capital charge, are as good judges as are any in this House as to whether the unification of gauges should be proceeded with quickly. Apparently the Government of New South Wales is divided in purpose, but with a leaning towards saying "" No "" to the proposition, and questioning, ""Why should we spend £7,000,000, which is the Suggested debit on that State, when no real benefit will accrue to the cash-box of the Railway Commissioners? "" Viotorian Government, on the other hand, say, ""Why should we be debited with these untold millions in order that our system, which is perfectly satisfactory to us, may be ripped up, and during the process of conversion, disastrous dislocation occur in the handling of freight and passengers throughout the State?"" It is unwise for any Government in charge of Commonwealth affairs to try to force the hands of the States, which are in as good a position as are we to decide how far these millions, which they may be called upon to spend, would go in their own developmental projects. Victoria or New South Wales or any of the wider States might easily say, "" The five, ten, or twenty took in hand the work is proof of the million pounds which we are asked to pay as our share of the cost of this project would go a tremendous distance in further increasing our population, land settlement, and the conveniences and comfort of our people."" . looming on the horizon of Australia within the next decade, why should we, with a huge war debt and £400,000,000 of other public debts, spend £50,000,000 or £60,000,000 upon the unification of railway gauges? able member against the unification of the gauges ? circumstances of Australia, financial and governmental. AndI hope that if this proposal does come before Parliament in ' agreement form there will be a keen debate, free of paTty politics, on the question of development as against the rectification of the gauge differences. In reference to the figures of postal receipts and expenditure, I believe it is time that we made a clear cut between general revenue and postal receipts, and between general expenditure and postal expenditure. In otlier words, we snould do with our trading department as the States have done with their principal trading department-segregat e it entirely in regard to finance. The States deal with railway revenue in a way totally different from that in which they deal with ordinary revenue. They keep it on separate sheets and show it separately. The people, accordingly, know whether The freights and fares snould be raised or can be lowered. They know whether receipts or expenditure are rising or falling in a clearer way than this information has hitherto been shown in the balance-sheets of the Commonwealth. And the Commonwealth's great trading department, the Post Office, should have its finances shown separately and distinctly. I commend the work of the Notes Board. The Government chose with wisdom the personnel of that body, and the men associated with this new responsibility have interpreted the desire of the Government and Parliament with singular fidelity. The reduction of the issue which has been achieved since the Board knowledge and wisdom that has guided them in their deliberations.

I do not suggest that the honourable gentleman harbors it , but I say that one may draw those deductions from his words. The Treasurer's suggestion to the lay student of this matter is that there is some magic in compound interest which, if you apply it , produces a better result with a lower contribution to a Sinking Fund than with a heavier contribution to a Redemption Fund. There is, of course, no magic in compound interest. There are defects in . our existing method of a Redemption Fund, but they can be remedied. There are difficulties and dangers inherent in either of the two forms of Sinking Fund that neither its creators nor its administrators can successfully guard against. While a Redemption Fund has striking and obvious advantages, its principal drawback is that the payments into it for redemption, and. the payments for current interest, decline with the decline of the debt. The Treasurer has very properly put his finger upon the indefinite, b u t noticeable, diminuendo that goes on in a debt when you operate in that way. But if Parliament desires, it can establish and operate a constant in stead of a diminishing payment for both purposes, and that would remove the only plausible or reasonable objection to a Redemption Fund. The arguments against a Sinking Fund are, to my mind, these. I have said that there are two kinds of sinking f u n d . From the Treasurer's remarks, I am justified in assuming that he desires to establish one which would hold and manage its f u n d as one entity until the debt was wiped out. In other words, it would l if t , hold, and invest, say. £22,000,000 per annum for, say, fifty years', and would, liquidate our war debt. The £22,000,000 would be made up of £20,000,000, interest £2,000,000, representing a contribution of \ per cent, per annum on a debt of,, say, £400,000,000. Like all heroic debt extinction' measures, it seeks to put a heavy load on posterity, If his reand, in my judgment, will surely f a i l. Its first and chief danger is that it would amass gigantic funds, which would be at the mercy of any impecunious Government in the future. Y o u may p u t the f u n d in trust. I have seen that done in That is a legitimate this honest little State of Victoria, and when a Government came along which was needy enough and strong enough, it took it out of pawn and used it . Politics, no matter how high the flight of its leaders, will always savour, in young countries at least, of opportunism in finance as in policy, "" t r u s t "" precautions notwithstanding. To create a huge f u n d like this would inevitably, in the near future, tempt the cupidity of some party or Government, or Treasurer, who would break down the very purpose of the original Act, and all the precautions would go to the winds. We have had experiences of that all over Australia, and those of us who have tried to read the reasons see that they are likely to recur. That danger must be guarded against; but it cannot be guarded against with a huge permanent fund . The second drawback is in relation to the employment of . this huge fund . If it is conceivable that Parliaments of the future would permit the gradual evolution of this f u n d u n t i l it attained, say, £200,000,000-whic h is half our national debt-o r £300,000,000which is three-quarters of the debt-the f u n d would be too heavy to secure profitable employment in this country. A sum of £300,000,000 would be as large as the total mobile resources of all the financial institutions in Australia not employ this money to buy up its own bonds? fund , not a redemption fund . I am speaking of a sinking f u n d which puts money in the safe and only takes it out to earn interest, and uses that interest to earn further interest, u n t i l the whole sum, in for t y or f if t y years, is sufficient to redeem the debt.

The third objection is that it would not make for cheap money. 1 would like my honourable friend the Treasurer to analyze that statement, and, in considering the uses to which such a f u n d could be put, to guess what its probable effect would be upon the money rates of the country. to earn as high a rate of interest as they could on the sinking f u n d . The Treasurer's duty is to get as cheap money as he can. once and constantly a conflict between the Trust and the Government which would not make, 'as the present system makes, for easing the redemption position ih respect of our national debt, because the two would work in opposite directions. The fourth consideration is that this, according to the Treasurer, is to be a slow extinctidh proposal, only \ per cent, per annum being paid into the fund. the actuaries, would extinguish the debt in a little over forty-eight years. the honourable gentleman assumes would be earned; but that seems to be too high a rate tocalculate upon safely. That is probably why he has allowed an extra two years to give him leeway. If we found a fund in that way, the duty of the Trust will be to keep money high, so that the fun d may effect its purpose, while the Government and the people will do all they can to depress money rates with a view to the encouragement of Government and private undertakings. As this extinction proposal is to operate so slowly, it must presuppose no fresh world conflict, no other war that would interfere with the gradual and complete development of the scheme. Now, who can say safely that it is correct finance to spread impede him, and to the extent that it our commitments for debt extinction over a period of fifty years on the assumption that no further calamities will come upon us to upset our calculations? . Another feature of this proposal-which , of course, been already effected, and our debt would is not final, but must be considered-is the precipice at the end of the fifty-year period.. If we contribute to a f u n d £22,000,000 per-annum for a. period of fifty years, and then suddenly stop, what I say will happen to the finances of the country wben the period closes? An Honorable MEMBER T h a t will notworry us. R.

A t the end of the fifty-year period, or towards This contribution, according to the end of it , there will be preparations to defeat the accomplishment of the scheme, or a saturnalia of expenditure the like of which has never yet been equalled in any British community. None of these objections, except perhaps the.precipice at the end, can apply to a redemption f u n d . The cancellation and reduction of the f u n d by the contributions that, go to it from the Treasury takes money out of the reach of the Government of the day, and finally cancels that portion of the debt. There are no mammoth funds created to tempt Treasurers or to dislocate money markets. some cases, both.

We should take, as I believe the Treasurer has done, long' views on this question, but I do not think that we should take too long steps> in case we may defeat the very purpose of these, views. We cannot read the minds of our successors who will have charge of. this country,, or foretell their actions. Therefore I say,, let us do in the next twenty or thirty years whatever the resources, of this country will allow to reduce and cancel a substantial proportion of the war debt of this country. I would at present,, instead of making wholesale, remissions out of savings, prefer to embark upon an economic search., and, pending that, to pay at least f per cent, of our debt as a definite and constant contribution, say, fbr ten or twenty years, to a redempton fund to be operated, if you will, by trustees in the manner prp>posed by the Treasurer. The honourable gentleman dealt with one other matter relating to this scheme in an informative and instructive way: the conversion of the loans ahead. point may I tell the honorahle member for Hunter, who inquired ahout some of the features of London finance, as compared with Australian finance, how it is' that the difference in loan flotation expenses is made up? All the loans we floated in Australia during the war were floated without payments for underwriting. raising the money comprised commissions to the broker, advertising, and the general cost of publicity and collection. But. in London, where finance has been bedded deep for two or three centuries at least, they.have made their own tracks, and it does not matter how influential a Government may be, when it goes to London to borrow it cannot cut its own way through the forest. '[81] enterprise 1 system that the conservative British minds think better than anything we may suggest We to them. They say, ""This is the way we do business: these are our charges.""

He. had his clientele of subordinate brokers to whom he passed a proportion of the loan, and to whom he paid part of the underwriting charge. Thus Britishfinanceflowsthough a large congeries', of people all' interested in making the success' of a loan. They do make a success of it ; but you have to pay them for what they do. The advertising charges are not much heavier in Australia than in England; but there is, in addition, a, stamp duty, which in certain circumstances is called a' composition, duty, 'and it amounts, I think, to 12s. Gd. per cent; on the. capital value, of the money raised. Those two charges, of underwriting, and stamp duty are not borne, by loans, raised in Australia, hence the extra money to be paid away when we raise money in Great Britain. My friend the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) knows as well as any other honourable member that there, are other considerations that must guide a Governr ment than the expense, of floating a loan. For war. purposes Australia raised in one year £114,000,000. Suppose, that On that money fell due on one date. Would you transfer that, to Great Britain by raising the money there, or would you transfer to' Australia some of the loans we raised in England?
