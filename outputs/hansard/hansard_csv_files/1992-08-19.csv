The first point is that the That deserves to be put on record.

I commend the Clerk and you, Mr Speaker, for the actions you have taken. The point was that we did not as a chamber deliberate on the same matters considered in On the substance of the measure, I have no the Senate. For that reason it would have been doubt the honourable member for Bradfield diminished in its stature. As my colleague the will speak in detail. Like he and every other honourable member for Berowra (Dr Harry member of the House, I regard this as being· Edwards) says, the certificate was provided on quite remarkable in its timing. This is one of the basis that it was the intention of the the areas where the Government is adding to House of Representatives to accept whatever the imposition of business, at a time when it amendments the Senate might have passed to has produced a Budget which it says is about us.

To go around and pretend July until such time as it goes through? The that the matter is a bit of a giggle, a bit of a Leader of the House is putting the view that laugh and a usual procedure is not only the guarantee charge will be considered to treating the Parliament with contempt-to say have been law throughout. The point that I whether the Parliament passes this matter or was putting is that that is very much a matter not is unimportant-it is also treating its own that will be open to legal debate and no doubt motion with contempt. Its own motion, on the will be challenged. substantive provisions that it has, is an attempt to say that it is important to get it right; There is unquestionably an argument that will be put the other way. The point that it is important to have the records completely arises from this is: even if the rectification in agreement; it is necessary for that to be the motion does have the effect that it will have case before the royal assent can be given; it made the superannuation guarantee charge is necessary to have the royal assent for a Bill law as from 1 July 1992, nobody was entitled to become law; it is necessary to have a law in the interregnum to assume that.

That is, even on the himself. He said that the Commissioner of most generous assumptions that this can be Taxation was entitled to go out and advertise given, retrospective validity. If it cannot be, and treat this as law, assuming that one day of course, that is wasted money-money that it would be picked up. He said that this was has been expended in the interim. considered to be usual procedure. Well, it is not usual procedure to advertise, and expend It would be a very bad day if we said that public moneys on advertising, something as all of this does not matter, that all of this can law when it is not law. It cannot become law be somehow brushed aside, that this is not until such time as it is passed in identical unusual, that this is an unimportant matter, form through the House and the Senate and that this is somehow just a technical hiccup has received the royal assent. and that we should not let the processes of the Parliament stand in the way of what we, the The reason that the rectification motion has Executive, have decided to do. It is no light been moved is that it is quite clear that that matter whatsoever, and it is no light matter had not occurred. It is quite clear by reason for the Leader of the House.

But now as the Disability Discrimination Bill 1992, is the outlook for jobs for people with inappropriate these days when there are a disabilities is horrific. We have put so many number of laws in Australia that prevent disincentives in the way of people with people being discriminated against. disabilities who are trying to get employment.
