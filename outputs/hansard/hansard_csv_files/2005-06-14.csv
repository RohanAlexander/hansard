Ms BURKE (Chisholm) (4.00 pm)-When I was here for my stunning three minutes last time. I was talking about the disparity of poverty in this world and how this budget was doing nothing to assist that. During the last election a group of charitable organisations held a series of forums and ran an election campaign to highlight the plight of the forgotten people in our society, the poor. The Salvation Army, St Vincent de Paul Society, Anglicare Australia, Australian Catholic Social Justice Council, Catholic Health Australia, UnitingCare Australia, Catholic Welfare Australia, Conference of Leaders of Religious Institutes and Jesuit Social Services-the usual ratbag suspects out there pushing their agenda-ran a campaign titled ‘Vote [1] No More Poverty’. These institutions of impeccable standing in our community, MAIN COMMITTEE who do invaluable work, were all saying that there is a crisis-a crisis that needs urgent attention and action now. They are all seeing a massive increase in demand for their services and a growing disparity between the rich and the poor. The demand is for the basics of life: foodthe ever increasing need to find food vouchers; housing-assistance with meeting utility bills so that the gas and the electricity can stay on; and support for children to stay at school. The campaign stated: There are 3.6 million Australians living on a household income of under $400 a week and over 800,000 children living in a jobless household. We are faced daily by the despair that fills their young lives. Australia has the 4th highest rate of poverty in the industrialised world. We are witnesses to a clear failure to provide fair and adequate levels of full-time employment, education, health, and affordable housing for low income families. The campaign aimed to highlight the plight of many in our society-many who have not been carried along with this gangbuster economy, an economy which seems to have impacted on the coffers of the Treasury, which has produced jobs and wealth for some but not all and which can justify one man being paid $3 million a year in base salary, his total being $11 million before he takes options, and another being paid $21 million to exit a company he has brought to its knees but cannot find enough to support the most marginalised of our society. The Vote [1] No More Poverty campaign asked all Australians to address poverty in this country. ... we believe that a National Forum must be held to develop a National Strategy to combat poverty in Australia. Only a national approach can solve a problem of national proportions. Cooperation, rather than buckpassing between political parties and Federal and State governments is the only way forward. It is crucial that such barriers must be overcome-crucial to the interests of those living in poverty. We cannot afford to be silent while the children of today grow up to become a permanent underclass. How can we as a nation live with the consequences of this? That was the request of the campaign. Was that request heeded in this budget? No, it was not. This budget does absolutely nothing to lift those struggling out of their dire circumstances. It provides no hope or support for them and it does little even to help the many institutions that are struggling to fill the gaps left by the government. I quote: Two nations; between whom there is no intercourse and no sympathy; who are as ignorant of each other’s habits, thoughts, and feelings, as if they were dwellers in different zones, or inhabitants of different planets; who are formed by a different breeding, are fed by a different food, are ordered by different manners, and are not governed by the same laws. [I speak of] The rich and the poor. So said Benjamin Disraeli in 1845, but sadly it is as true today. There is no understanding of the poor from this government. They see those less fortunate than themselves as shirkers, and so screamed the newspapers the day after the budget: ‘Workers1 Shirkers 0’. So there has been no progression, no realisation, particularly from this government that it needs to do more for those marginalised in our society. It sees them as trying to avoid work at all costs, wanting to live off the welfare system, gambling, drinking and smoking their lives away. It was not that long ago that the Minister for Health and Ageing made those statements in a national media program. The government wants to demonise the poor, not assist them out of welfare dependency. MAIN COMMITTEE Again this budget fails to address severe disadvantage in a systematic way. Instead it is offering tax breaks to the wealthy and reduced benefits to the marginalised. But there is no strategy. Where is the access to affordable housing, employment and educational opportunities and other essential services for the long-term unemployed, for people living in disadvantaged rural and urban communities, for children living in jobless households, for people with a mental illness, for people who are homeless? The list goes on. It is a pity that the government did not use a budget in surplus to address the cycles of disadvantage that see too many Australians entrenched in poverty. Again the government claims this is a reforming budget, one that addresses the welfare to work conundrum. But again the budget is a lost opportunity to break the cycle and structures of poverty that are deeply entrenched in Australian society. This issue has been highlighted in a recent article by Tim Colebatch in the Age titled ‘Twoclass welfare system is a long-term recipe for disaster’. He said: The key fact behind welfare change is that our system splits beneficiaries into two groups. One is those deemed deserving poor, such as those on the aged pension, disability support, and sole parents. The other is the undeserving poor: the unemployed on the Newstart allowance. For the deserving group, the single benefit is $238.15 a week, and is indexed to rise in line with average earnings, which grow by 4 to 5 per cent a year. For the undeserving group, the single benefit is just $199.65 a week, and rises in line with consumer prices. These rise by just 2 to 3 per cent a year-half as fast as wages. Those aren’t the only differences between the two. Those on disability support or the age pension who get a job are allowed to earn far more while keeping their benefits than those on the dole ... Those on the higher benefits face no work test. But on the lower benefits, you are required to look for workand if you miss a job interview, for example, you lose benefits. The Government’s welfare changes ... in essence ... will work by shifting people from higher benefits to lower ones, mostly below the poverty line. Ministers believe this privation will make people capable of working go and get a job. And that is what this budget has done. As a stark example of how bad things are getting, Victorian Relief, the state government food bank, has recently announced that it will have to charge for the distribution of food to charities because it simply cannot keep up with the demand and must augment its spiralling costs. Four years ago Victorian Relief was delivering $1 million of goods to the charitable sector; this year it has just gone over $6 million. The demand on its services is huge. Food banks are also now having to produce more stock as that donated by manufacturers has fallen by about 40 per cent as improved manufacturing processes see less wastage from business. This situation, of course, has seen charities in my electorate concerned they will not be able to keep up with demand from the poor in our society. Syndal Baptist Food Bank has helped 280 families so far this year. This is up 100 per cent on last year’s figure. You have to bear in mind that my seat is described as the leafy green suburbs-obviously not as salubrious as some, particularly some on the other side of this place, but it is considered a fairly liveable and comfortable middle-class area-where we are seeing people struggling. We are seeing people in Chisholm in real need. The St Vincent de Paul Society in a submission to the poverty inquiry in 2003 said: Regrettably, consideration of solutions to the rich/poor gap has for too long been distracted by arguments about where to draw the line in the sand, the absence of political will to even address the known problem, and stop gap measures such as Welfare Reform. These distractions, combined with the dehuMAIN COMMITTEE manisation of the poor and disadvantaged, have allowed decision makers to avoid addressing national strategic planning to begin to solve the problems of poverty. It is remarkable how these words, said in 2003, are so eerily repeated in this budget. Measures such as welfare reform and not strategic planning are again the mantra. How will removing $20 a fortnight from a single mum improve her circumstances in life? How will breaching her if she finds a bar job but no child care for her kids assist her out of the poverty cycle? How will slashing millions from the Job Network see her getting the training and reskilling needed to enable her to re-enter the work force after many years looking after her children? And why do stay-at-home mums with partners intact get paid to stay at home while single mums are forced back to work? Answer me that riddle. The budget will slash $77 a fortnight from disability pensioners. How is this going to help them break the cycle of welfare dependency? How are those in our society in need of extra support going to achieve their desire for a full life with a disability when the government cannot even reach its own target on employing people with a disability? There is strong evidence of the benefits to business of employing a diverse work force. People with disabilities, as employees, take less sick leave, stay in the job longer and value their work more than their non-disabled colleagues, yet in the decade since the introduction of the Disability Discrimination Act there has been no real progress in the economic participation of people with disabilities. The unemployment rate for people with disabilities is twice that for the rest of the community. At a time of high economic growth, the Australian government’s investment in assisting people with disabilities to secure employment is less than the OECD average. Further, ABS figures estimate that between 11.8 per cent and 15 per cent of the Australian work force has a disability, yet the percentage of federal public servants with a disability has fallen from 5.8 per cent to three per cent during the time of this government. Why has the government delayed the training and employment measures announced in the 2002 federal budget? Why has the government failed to implement a key finding of its employer incentive strategy to develop a public awareness campaign aimed particularly at employers to encourage them to hire people with disabilities? What steps are being taken to increase the participation of people with disabilities within the federal public sector? The answer is not a lot. Yet again, there was nothing in this budget that will actually go to address these measures. This budget is not smokes and mirrors; it is very clear political bias-bias of support for those with wealth and biased against those without. A recent article by David Wroe in the Age highlights the contempt and folly of this government’s budget: Nearly 400,000 Victorians, including 120,000 children, live in poverty, according to Commonwealth figures that show huge wealth disparities across Australia. Despite 14 years of unbroken economic growth, nearly one in 10 Australians lives below the poverty line, which is set at half the average disposable income. … … … Australian Council of Social Service president Andrew McCallum said the wide geographical disparities highlighted the folly of the Government’s push to get people off welfare and into work. “The Government should take note of this report and understand the demographic and geographic MAIN COMMITTEE",118,Notices
152,"Aspects Of Poverty Rather Than Just Using A Great Big Stick For Everyone,” Mr Mccallum Said. “This","shows where the Government should put infrastructure for job creation. Poverty goes with high levels of unemployment, and these places are so bereft of jobs.” More than 500,000 Australian children and almost 1.7 million Australians, or 9.3 per cent of the population, live in poverty. So, instead of saying, ‘Here is a big stick,’ what the government needs to do is very clearly articulated in a very good paper put out by the Parliamentary Library that says poverty is actually entrenched in postcode. Why are we not doing something to assist those areas? The budget will entrench this divide between the haves and the have-nots when the tax cuts take effect. An article in the Canberra Times cites work by Dr Andrew Leigh, an academic at ANU, who has found that the richest five per cent of households will receive 19 per cent of the benefits from this budget. So five per cent are getting 19 per cent of the benefits. Since when on these issues were oppositions not allowed to vote against government initiatives? The answer is pretty simple: when governments get control of the whole show. Obviously, oppositions are meant to just step aside and not say anything, and that seems like the rational debate we are having now. It seems a lot like what goes on in totalitarian regimes where dissent is not encouraged. Where does this leave the budget’s ability to help the Howard battlers? It does nothing for them. Indeed, it entrenches the division and makes it greater. A recent report by the St Vincent de Paul Society, released just after the budget, describes the reality of income inequality in Australia and makes compelling reading. The report states: Official ABS Household Income Data shows that over 8 million Australians (42% of the population) have an equivalised disposable income of less than $21,000 per annum. Of these 8 million Australians, 4.5 million of them (23% of the population) are in households with an aggregate income of less than $400 per week. This is in stark contrast to the government’s statement, based on NATSEM’s modelling, that they have increased the income of low-income households, who have enjoyed the strongest private incomes over the period that they have been in government. I do not think this holds true on the ABS data. The report also finds that, while the government purport to have helped those in need through welfare redistribution, a lot of this is actually going to middle-income households at the expense of those in crisis. The report from the St Vincent de Paul Society concludes: We can choose the current headlong dash into the chasm of inequality, the gap that lies between the rich and the poor, our own “two Australias”. If governments deny that we even have a problem or that we can work towards a solution, then growing numbers of our people will be consigned to the “other Australia”. They will be abandoned to market forces that, left unchecked, can only further entrench the outcomes of inequality and unfairness. If governments refuse to do what the market cannot, this course is guaranteed. On the other hand, we can choose to face the problem. We can choose to mobilise all levels of government towards producing a solution. International evidence is unambiguous in demonstrating that domestic policy settings are able to achieve this. Professor Peter Saunders of the University of NSW Social Policy Research Centre has estimated that it would cost only 2% of our GDP to lift all Australians out of poverty, concluding that: “We can thus pay to remove all Australians from poverty if we want to: the fact that we don’t do so is a matter of choice, not affordability.” If however we choose to do nothing, we assist the unfettered growth of injustice and want. MAIN COMMITTEE This budget does nothing. In fact, it entrenches the poverty, the distinction. It does not help those most in need. We need to see vision-a dangerous word, I know, in this place; vision, because the government of the day has the means. It just does not have the desire to help those in most need. better positioned to deal with the economic and social challenges of this century than Australia. We have almost completely eliminated federal government net debt-$96 billion of Labor’s debt has been paid off. Not only are the Howard government no longer imposing new liabilities on our children and grandchildren but also we are putting aside the surpluses of today to meet past liabilities for which no provision has been made. The Future Fund, a central feature of the budget, will ensure that our children and grandchildren do not have to pick up the tab for the Commonwealth’s single largest liability-its unfunded superannuation obligations to its employees, amounting in present value to $91 billion. This is such a responsible and prudent move that it has been quite properly widely applauded-but not by the Labor Party. Not content with racking up huge debts while in government, now while in opposition they object to them being provided for. The member for Melbourne, for example, made a rambling critique of the Future Fund, the gist of which was hard to distil, but his alternative was to say: The money should be given back to taxpayers and in the most effective way, which is into individual occupational superannuation accounts. That means that the money would go to investment and not consumption. The Future Fund is all about investment. It constitutes a massive exercise in saving. Instead of having a government which ran up deficits and imposed on successive generations the responsibility of paying off the price of its own extravagance, we have today a government which is not only running surplusesA division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 4.19 pm to 4.31 pm is in fact all about saving. Instead of having a government which ran up deficits and imposed on successive generations the responsibility of paying off the price of its own extravagance, today we have a government which is not only running surpluses-saving, in other wordsbut relieving future generations of existing liabilities. Some critics of the Future Fund, including the member for Melbourne, have argued that this amounts to prepaying future liabilities. But these superannuation liabilities for Commonwealth public servants are as real as any liability of the Commonwealth, and now they are being provided for. I am not aware of any other comparable nation which is being managed so responsibly or so prudently. Other OECD nations, such as the United States, are running large budget deficits and, of course, some of our OECD colleagues are running enormous budget deficits. Labor’s criticisms of the tax cuts in this budget were a reversion to the envy based class warfare of old Labor so beloved of their former leader, Mr Latham. The honourable member for Chisholm, who preceded me in this debate, quoted Disraeli and said that nothing had changed since 1845. One may as well have said 1345 or 45 AD.

154,Mr Turnbull,"Before the suspension I was talking about the Future Fund. As I said, itleagues will always present the Liberal Party as governing for business and for the wealthy. But the facts tell a different story. In 1996 the top 20 per cent of taxpayers paid 53 per cent of the total personal income tax take. In 2003 they paid 57.6 per cent. So much for governing for the rich. The top 20 per cent are paying a bigger share of personal income tax today than they did under Labor. What about growth in average weekly earnings? Average weekly earnings were $328 in March 1983, $664 in March 1996 and $976 in December 2004. If you convert all of those into 1990 prices, the 13 years of Labor saw average weekly earnings increase by 4.76 per cent, yet in the nine years of the Howard government real incomes of Australian workers on average weekly earnings increased by 19.35 per cent. In other words, nine years of coalition government have delivered more than four times the growth in real income for people on average weekly earnings than did 13 years of Labor. So who have been the winners in the Australian welfare state under the Howard government? There can be no better authority than Professor Ann Harding of NATSEM. Her work demonstrates that in the Howard years there has been a significant shift in resources from the top 20 per cent of income earners to the bottom 60 per cent. The highest growth in private household income from 1995 to 2003 was in the bottom two deciles. For example, as is set out in the budget papers, between 1996 andMs HallMr Deputy Speaker, I seek to intervene. accept a question? Ms Hall-You were quoting Ann Harding’s figures. Would you explain the difference between what Ann Harding is saying and what St Vincent de Paul are saying in their recently released study? mier economic modelling institute and the numbers I have quoted are straight from their presentation to the Melbourne Institute conference. For example, between 1996-97 and 2006-07 a single income couple on average wages with two children will have had a 30 per cent improvement in real disposable income. The point at which tax paid by such a couple exceeds benefits received will have increased in real terms from $33,931 to nearly $45,000. So, when John Howard says the coalition government is the best friend the Australian worker ever had, no amount of catcalling, huffs of indignation or quotations from Benjamin Disraeli can contradict the simple economic facts of the matter. There can be no wonder that Labor’s efforts to make a case that the tax cuts are unfair because they give greater cuts to higher income earners has failed to draw any public support. Australians are not as stupid as the Labor Party would like them to be or would encourage them to be. Higher income earners pay the largest share of income tax. For example, in 2003 the top 3½ per cent of taxpayers paid more than 25 per cent of personal income tax.

After all, it was their money in the first place. One of the stark differences between our side of politics and those on the other side is that we respect the fact that every dollar and every cent which this parliament raises in income tax is somebody else’s money which has been appropriated from him or her by force of law. It is not the government’s money. The government has so little right to spend that money that it has to pass an appropriation bill every year. We live in a highly competitive world. The most valuable and most competitive capital is not financial but human capital. Taxes are a cost to business and to families. Every dollar taxed carries a cost over and above the amount of the tax. It acts as a disincentive to invest, to work longer hours and to be more productive. Of course, when those tax dollars are spent they should generate a benefit at least as great as, and hopefully greater than, the disadvantage. But there is a cost associated with every dollar of tax. It obviously acts as a disincentive to live and work in countries or regions where tax is high. Last week I was in Boston and met with members of Advance, the new organisation set up at the initiative at our Consul General in New York, Ken Allen, to link up members of the Australian diaspora. What did they cite as the principal obstacle to their returning to Australia? The high rate of tax. The OECD’s December 2004 survey of Australia identified a number of areas requiring further economic reform. It said: Commendable progress has been made towards reforming the tax system but issues remain. What were those issues? They included the relatively low-income level at which the top marginal rates cut in. The OECD recommended that the priority for tax reform should be the raising of that threshold to a more competitive level. Instead of our top marginal rate cutting in at about 1.2, an average production worker’s earnings, it will cut in from next year at about 2½ times the average production worker’s earnings. That is a significant improvement both in absolute and relative terms. As the budget papers show, it puts Australia in the middle of the field-but only in the middle-both in terms of the threshold and the top marginal rate. It must be noted, however, that these OECD averages and comparisons are rarely weighted. European countries-many of them small-represent 76 per cent of the OECD by number but only 35 per cent in terms of the total OECD GDP. There are in reality three OECDs: Europe, where taxes are relatively higher; the Pacific, dominated by Japan, where they are lower; and North America, dominated by the United States, where they are lower still. The majority of the OECD GDP naturally consists of the United States and the Japanese economies. Those who feel the tax cuts in this budget have gone too far have got to ask themselves this question: do we want our tax regime to be competitive with Luxembourg and Belgium or do we want it to be competitive with our major trading partners, in particular the United States, which is overwhelmingly our major competitor in the contest for talented human capital? Our new thresholds, while higher, remain significantly lower than those of the United States and Japan, not to speak of other Asian countries. So the notion that this is a radical budget, a budget which dramatically rewards the higher income earners at the expense of the less well off, is simply not borne out by the facts-facts which show that people on lower levels of income have seen their disposable income improved, both absolutely and in relative terms, durMAIN COMMITTEE ing the nine years of this government and of course by comparison with those in other similar or comparable economies. The other matter the OECD recommended for urgent attention in the field of taxation was high effective marginal tax rates. This term is somewhat of a misnomer as it suggests it is largely a function of tax. Effective marginal tax rates measure the sum of income lost to the government-in effect, surrendered to the government-by a taxpayer for each additional dollar in tax paid and benefits withdrawn. High EMTRs-in some cases as high as 80c in the dollar-operate as a disincentive to work, especially for people working part time who are contemplating undertaking additional hours. It has to be said that they are an inevitable consequence of means tested benefits. The only way to eliminate EMTRs entirely would be to remove the benefit entirely or to remove the means test. Clearly that is an issue that has to be dealt with, and it has been addressed in this budget. The introduction of the new tax system had already reduced EMTRs through changes in marginal tax rates and increased tapering of family tax benefit part A as well as selected pensions. The changes proposed in this budget will help to further reduce the problem of high effective marginal tax rates by firstly lowering the tax rate and spreading the range of the EMTR profiles. The proposed budget changes will lower the actual level or rate of EMTRs through, firstly, the reduction of the 17 per cent marginal tax rate to 15 per cent and, secondly, the reduction of the taper rate for Newstart allowance, youth allowance, widows allowance, partner allowance, mature age allowance and sickness allowance. For every additional dollar earned over $250 the maximum taper rate is proposed to be reduced by 10 per cent to 60 per cent. Finally, reduction of the taper rates for students receiving youth allowance, Austudy and Abstudy will also take effect. The maximum taper rate is proposed to be reduced from 70 per cent to 60 per cent. Several measures in the budget also more equally distribute the range over which the EMTRs are applicable. This has been done by increasing the income threshold for the Medicare levy to $15,902 for individuals and $26,834 for families, increasing the income threshold for the Medicare levy to $19,252 for pensioners below age pension age and extending the income range of the 50 per cent taper rate for Newstart allowance, youth allowance, widows allowance, partner allowance, mature age allowance and sickness allowance. The income range over which the 50 per cent taper applies is proposed to be increased from between $62 and $142 to between $62 and $250. Combined with the changes to the maximum taper rate, a lower taper rate extends over a larger income range and the maximum taper rate accordingly begins later in the income distribution. The income threshold for family tax benefit part A is to be increased from $33,361 to $37,500. Low-income families will be able to earn an additional $4,139 before their family payments are affected. Changes to the taper rates and income thresholds for various benefits are consistent with the view that changes to the social security system itself-changes to welfare and the way in which welfare benefits are withdrawn as income rises-rather than adjusting marginal tax rates, are required to make an effective or substantial reduction in the incidence of high effective marginal tax rates. These reforms, which are consistent with the government’s objectives of promoting greater productivity and participation in the workplace, exclusively benefit those on lower incomes and benefits. They are yet another example of the way in which the government is delivering real benefits to all Australians but in particular Australians on lower MAIN COMMITTEE incomes-yet another example of why the Howard government is truly and factually the best friend the Australian worker has ever had. Ms GRIERSON (Newcastle) (4.45 pm)-I rise to speak on the appropriation bills. I support the Labor amendment moved by the shadow Treasurer, the member for Lilley. These five bills constitute the estimates bills for 2005-06, most of which provides for the ordinary annual services of government. The total appropriations under these bills are $55 billion. But this is the annual budget that has an overriding function-that is the setting of fiscal policy appropriate to the current state of the economy and the desired long-term state of our national economy. So if this budget were fiscally responsible then it would be very clear that the Treasurer and the government well understand the state of Australia’s economy and were responding accordingly. Let us look at the state of the economy right now. Firstly, I guess every Australian would like to know whether our nation is in the black or the red. The government would say we have a surplus, so we must be in the black. But let us look below the surface. The reality is that foreign debt is the highest ever recorded, surging in the last quarter to $425 billion. That is actually half the size of our economy. That means that our annual interest bill on our gross foreign debt is $20 billion. What is the picture for average Australians? They are in debt too. The household savings ratio fell from 5.6 per cent in 1996-97 to minus 3.3 per cent in 200304. That savings ratio shows no sign of improving. Household credit debt at September 2004 was worth $28 billion with banks now gaining more revenue from credit card fees than from mortgage interest fees. In fact, Australians today owe more on their mortgages and own less of their houses than their counterparts of 20 years ago and owe far more than Australians 20 years ago could ever have contemplated. As a result of the housing boom of 2003-04, Australians increasingly use equity loans on their mortgages to fund their consumption. That boom, which saw an increase in the rates of housing loans, in turn reduced household and national savings and also diverted investment into housing rather than the share market, reducing investment in manufacturing and services for exports. In effect, household and private investment in the housing boom contributed to the current account deficit, with banks having to increase borrowings from overseas to meet that demand for loans and, in turn, adding to our capital account surplus and our net foreign debt. Looking at the overall picture, Australia now has the highest current account deficit it has ever had. Despite the commodity boom and record commodity prices of the past, in the March quarter the current account deficit stood at $15.6 billion or 7.25 per cent of gross domestic product-reflecting the latest figure of 41 consecutive trade deficits. It is also of concern that imports of capital goods fell by a value of $409 million in the March quarter but that imports of consumption goods soared five per cent or a value of $575 million. So Australians are still spending on cheaper imported goods in what some economic analysts speculate is the Gregory effect in operation. I predict that will continue while Australians continue to buy cheap imported goods at this rate. Certainly our local economy cannot keep up with that demand and consumers will have to turn somewhere else. I assume the economists are right in saying that the Gregory effect will remain, and that will certainly require radical changes in our economic policy. MAIN COMMITTEE The trade performance is critical to our national wealth, but under Howard our share of exported global services has shrunk by a third. Growth in exports of advanced manufactures has been just four per cent in seven years. World freight rates are plummeting, suggesting that China’s economic growth is beginning to slow. And, unsurprisingly, business confidence and investment dived from a 30-year high to a serious state of anxiety. With a third of the profits from minerals exports being sent overseas through royalties paid to foreign owners, the net current account deficit does not look like improving in the near future. So on the debt front the economy is not looking so good. Perhaps the government would say that growth is being sustained. That surplus is real, but one would have to ask: how sustainable is it? The fact is that our economy is slowing, recording this year the worse productivity growth in 19 years. GDP of 1.9 per cent is not reassuring, with some economists suggesting that the Reserve Bank of Australia was overly optimistic when it said, at the March hearing of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration, that Australia would have to get used to growth figures beginning with two or three per cent. We wish! What is also emerging is divergence in the national economy, with some states-particularly Western Australia-showing growth whilst others, particularly the most populous states of New South Wales and Victoria, are showing a significant slowing in growth. It seems we are riding on the commodity and resource back with very little to replace it should the resource boom slow down. Business investment fell by 2.6 per cent in the last quarter and retail sales flattened in March and fell in April, with department store sales registering an alarming 11 per cent fall in April. Housing sales continue, with no sign of a crash fortunately, but the pace is slower and house values have dropped. It is evident that an interest rate adjustment in March had a profound effect. So the Reserve Bank thinks it has done its job, but it had lots of advice for the government on fiscal policy. Although growth is still evident in some parts of our economy, there is mounting evidence to confirm the general slowing. With these economic indicators showing restraint in growth, it is important that government look at what is constraining our economy and do something about it through economic reform and fiscal policy. The Reserve Bank, in its March presentation, made it clear that monetary policy was a limited tool in economic management and strongly suggested to government that it should be responding to the infrastructure, skills and work force problems and shortages which it identified as contributing to supply constraints. So how did the budget do on those fronts? Let us look at infrastructure. Despite this budget coming off the back of record terms of trade, record high commodity prices and record high minerals and petroleum exports to China-and despite the unexpectedly strong revenue growth which comes from these factors-it failed to invest in long-term productivity improvements. The week after the budget, the OECD reported in its 77th economic outlook: Supply constraints and transport bottlenecks seem to have held back commodity exports. The OECD report followed the release of the DHL Export Barometer on 24 May indicating that 27 per cent of Australian exporters considered infrastructure capacity constraints a negative. Of course, that has been reinforced by the Business Council of Australia, the Australian Industry Group, the Productivity Commission, CEDA and Engineers Australia. I think everybody has had their say on it; it is just that the government has not been hearing them. They MAIN COMMITTEE have been calling for sustainable improvements to freight, exports, and to water and energy supply, citing the need for those to be consistent and affordable to increase productivity. But the Howard government was silent on infrastructure, despite the Reserve Bank warning on 11 separate occasions since May 2001 of the negative impact that infrastructure capacity constraints are having. Under pressure, the Prime Minister finally announced the formation of an exports and infrastructure task force and has released its findings. I do not think it told us anything new. We await the detail of this report, but it is unbelievable that the Prime Minister can assert, as he did, that there is no crisis with Australia’s export infrastructure. The Prime Minister says that most of the problems causing bottlenecks are with regulation rather than any physical aspects of our infrastructure. Apparently this government believes that if you get the regulation right everything will be fine. That is not what business is saying. Yes, regulation is brought into play-as it was in the port of Newcastle-when things are difficult, when there are physical and capital constraints. At times regulation has assisted. In our case, the ACCC assisted the local providers of services and the users of those services to find an equitable way of getting the best out of a very limited system. But that will not replace long-term improvements. Labor offers Infrastructure Australia, an initiative that offers a coordinated and objective approach to the long-term planning and development of nationally significant infrastructure: planning and development that we need after nine years of neglect. In my electorate of Newcastle, we had a wish list for infrastructure. Certainly, we wanted to see more funds given to the ARTC, the Australian Rail Track Corporation, to improve the coal and freight trains. We know that there was an increase, but speculation and rumour in our community says that it will not be enough. We are having major problems, and those problems will only be set right if the funds are forthcoming. We also have seen major growth in our regional airport. The transport links from that airport, both road and rail, are significantly deficient-another infrastructure need towards which we would like to see some contribution from government. Unfortunately, it is not even on the radar. We were pleased to see some improvements in the budget for Newcastle’s broadband access. No business can flourish without access to IT. And, of course, we would have liked to see a $20 million commitment to complete our stadium. But those things did not happen. In looking at infrastructure as a constraint, let us say: ‘Okay, we have been very focused on commodity. What are we doing, in case that commodity boom ends, to increase our exports and to lower the current account deficit? What are we doing about manufacturing something particularly important to my electorate?’ Unfortunately, the budget contained no substantial investment for the future of Australian industry. The government knows that our manufacturing sector urgently needs support to boost skills, promote innovation, improve transport infrastructure, and build export markets and market share. But this budget had nothing to say about those matters: nothing on innovation, nothing on research and development. The release of the Australian Industry Group’s Australian performance of manufacturing index again illustrates the Howard government’s economic complacency and its disinterest in Australia’s manufacturing industry. The PMI figures revealed the lowest May level of manufacturing activity in three consecutive years, with the chemicals, petroleum and coal products, and fabricated metals sectors all recording slow growth throughout May. In fact, production declined in six sectors, including textiles, clothing and footwear; wood and wood products; MAIN COMMITTEE furniture; and paper, printing and publishing. In the past four years, manufacturing has reduced its share of GDP by one per cent. The Australian Industry Group Chief Executive, Heather Ridout, has echoed those concerns: An upturn in Australia’s manufactured exports is desperately needed ... export underperformance is a major public policy issue that needs to be addressed. If this budget and this government’s appalling record in manufacturing is anything to go by, Australian industries should not hold their breath waiting for a commitment, let alone action, from the Howard-Costello government. Similarly, the call for investment in skills, education and knowledge is something that will also have to wait. R&D is seen by this government as a luxury item, apparently, rather than part of knowledge infrastructure. Its neglect of universities and TAFEs has been so significant that I note today that the Minister for Education, Science and Training said he may have to assist universities through financial experts to bail them out of their problems. Given that six out of 10 universities in New South Wales are in the red, I am not surprised that they may need some assistance. I hope that comes soon. Other countries are certainly passing us on the knowledge front: Singapore, India and China all invest much more than we do in education, skills and training. The OECD says our investment in knowledge has dropped compared to most other developed nations. While other countries are investing, we are making it more difficult for universities, students and their families. Labor’s policy was to assist apprentices. We would have liked very much to see that in my electorate, where the teenage unemployment rate is 30 per cent. We would also have liked to see a policy that matched Labor’s additional 4,000 training places for year 11 and 12 students, with a $1,750 per student loading to schools. But apparently the approach to the skills shortage that the government plans is to import more workers from overseas, because that is all we saw in the budget: an increase in the intake of skilled migrants. Despite some investment in skills training, the government’s proposals do not put a single new skilled graduate into our work force until 2010. In Newcastle, we certainly were looking for more improvements on the education front, the knowledge front. We would have liked regional status to be granted to the University of Newcastle. As up to 600 people face loss of their jobs, we would have liked financial assistance for our university and targeted programs for youth-specific locally based programs providing local solutions. We also would like to have seen retraining incentives for people who have left the work force or cannot get jobs, particularly those who were once trained in priority skills areas. The other thing that was important in this budget was Welfare to Work and work force participation. The Reserve Bank has made many comments about the need to increase participation in the work force, but again all we saw from this government was an attempt to move people to cheaper welfare under the guise of Welfare to Work. The targets were sole parents, people on disability support pension and women, who got a particularly hard approach from this government. I wonder sometimes, when I look at the budget and at who benefited most, whether members opposite have any idea what it is like in most electorates in Australia. Newcastle is what is called an average electorate. It sits right in the middle of average income. In my electorate almost 3,000 people are sole parents and more than 7,000 people are on the disability support MAIN COMMITTEE pension-we rank as having the seventh highest number of DSP recipients in Australia and the second highest in New South Wales. Over the time. I have been here, I have researched how many people with a disability the government employs in my electorate. With more than 14,000 people with a disability who are of working age in my electorate, the Commonwealth employs just 57 persons-that is, less than 0.4 per cent. If this government is serious about helping people with disabilities into the work force, it should take the lead and start employing more people with disabilities in federal government departments and agencies. This budget had a particular approach to women. IfI were a highly skilled GP with a husband supporting me and I decided to stay at home, that would be fine. I would be rewarded for that and would get an allowance. But if I were a sole parent trying to do the best for my kids, once they turned six that would be it and I would be out in the work force. There is some rather disgraceful hypocrisy in this approach. The one big area of the budget that perhaps the government would claim is very competitive, saying that it will increase competition in our country, would be taxation. I have been quite amazed by the media frenzy and the approach to Labor’s stance on these taxation cuts. One would think we were cutting supply, although I do not recall that happening for some time-it was the government that thought it was okay to block supply. All we are trying to do is to give a decent and fair tax cut to the majority of Australians, increasing it from $6 to $12. Yet the media and the government see it as absolutely untenable that we might try to amend or improve their approach to taxpayers, even though our spend would be very much the same and would result in 7.4 million Australians getting twice the tax cut-the same people who, in the last six years will have received, with this tax cut, $10 in total. The government say they have given lots of hand-outs and, yes, they have, but if you do not have children there was nothing in it for you-there still is not anything for you. The majority of the staff in this parliament who work for members of parliament do not have children. They are going to get $6 a week, while we, their employers, are going to benefit in what is a greedy initiative and one by which Australians are quite appalled. I absolutely support Labor’s stance on the government’s tax cuts. We should certainly oppose them and try to amend them. It is up to the government to change their position so that they do give $12 to taxpayers around Australia instead of punishing people by giving them just $6. Clearly, this budget did not deliver fiscal policy that would sustain our economy for the future. Clearly, this budget was a bit of a tussle between two people vying for leadership of the Liberal Party and it rewarded many of the people who will vote for them in a leadership contest. It certainly rewarded the people who might donate to their political aspirations. This was a budget that certainly failed my electorate of Newcastle. It can only disappoint all economic commentators who would say, ‘When is this government going to respond to the supply constraints in order to sustain our economy’s growth and perhaps sustain prosperity for all Australians?’ health system, not just about what the Australian government is doing to enhance services we are responsible for but also about the parlous state of Queensland health. I realise that this is a bit of a departure from what members normally do in speaking in the debate on the appropriation bills. I sacrifice other matters in this my budget speech because of the gravity of the situation and the emphasis that I want to place on the issue.

161,Mr Neville (Hinkler) (5.05 Pm),"I would like to take this opportunity to talk about ourGiven the horrendous results of the surgical procedures performed by Dr Jayant Patel at the Bundaberg Base Hospital, it should come as no surprise to members that I have been speaking on this matter of public health services for quite some time now, both publicly and in this place. I have told the House of the appalling situation which has emerged at Bundaberg Base Hospital, responded to local letters to the editor, attended public meetings on the issue and spoken to some of Dr Patel’s former patients as well as to some nursing staff. TodayI am putting to the Queensland government, the health minister, Queensland Health and its administrators of the Bundaberg Base Hospital that they are on notice to clean up their act or face the continued and well-deserved wrath of the general public. Some of the revelations which have emerged from the Morris royal commission of inquiry are almost unbelievable: the public servant who signed off on a one-way flight for the errant surgeon, letters of commendation sent days after his negligent actions had become apparent, a minister who tried to keep hospital staff quiet, and the government which tried to spin its way out of trouble rather than listen to whistleblowers and the long-suffering patients. The general public has quite rightly identified the Beattie government as allowing, if not fostering, a systemic framework in which more than 80 deaths associated with Dr Patel were allowed to occur. I am horrified by the botched oesophageal operations which led to death, by the cases of people entering for simple procedures and dying a few days later and by the refusal to send patients at risk to Brisbane-this, I might add, in a town which has its own aerial ambulance. It is not as if it is a big effort: 10 minutes up the road from the hospital you can be on a plane to Brisbane and possibly within a hour and a half to two hours you can be in Brisbane hospital. I am horrified also by the loss of Barrie Johnson, a former tourism colleague of mine-as you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, I was in regional development before I came into this place. His loss was a very sad event for his wife, Cheryl, and his friends. But the cavalier arrogance of Dr Patel reached its high point when a junior doctor was told to turn off a life support system. I find that horrifying, and I will tell you why. At that stage, brain death had not been established; nor, to the best of my knowledge, had the family been consulted. When the patient’s doctor returned from a break, the life support machine had been turned off and the guy who had been in the bed was gone. That is horrifying. That is not mercy killing; that is convenience killing. To my way of thinking, that was one of the worse things to emerge from this whole exercise. It showed the depth to which that hospital could have sunk if Dr Patel had stayed on any longer. It is also interesting that, not content with initially blaming the National Party member for Burnett for Dr Patel’s escape-it was the member for Burnett, Mr Messenger, who blew the whistle in the state parliament-the Beattie government has, I suspect, pulled strings to create a barrage of criticism which has hit Mr Messenger since he raised the matter in the parliament. In fact he was absolutely vilified for the first 48 hours. But, of course, as this agenda started to roll out, all of a sudden people were rushing for cover. Even worse than that, it has since been revealed that the ALP member for Bundaberg-the adjoining seat-though earlier denying it, was aware of complaints against Dr Patel two years ago. The Acting Speaker of the Queensland parliament ruled that shequestion?

163,The Deputy Speaker ( Mr Wilkie),"Is the honourable member seeking to ask apublic inquiry suggest that there would be murder charges brought against Dr Patel? against Dr Patel but an inquiry was going on by a Queensland doctor at the time that Messenger brought up his complaints. Messenger had to weigh up whether he wanted to wait for that inquiry to come out or whether he would stop Patel in his tracks. He chose to stop Patel in his tracks, and happily so because, if he had not, God only knows how many more people would have died before that earlier inquiry came to light. So it was certainly a very serious matter. The Acting Speaker of the Queensland parliament ruled that the member for Bundaberg should not be disciplined for her actions or lack thereof. Why did Mrs Cunningham launch this vicious attack on the member for Burnett and imply that Bundaberg had lost a good doctor if she knew that Patel was under a cloud? How many people were maimed by the doctor while those who had a duty of care closed their eyes to his most dangerous practices? Staff with genuine complaints were simply not listened to. Initially, even the AMA came blindly to Dr Patel’s defence. The AMA state president was defending him for a few days, I might add, and then changed his position completely. Quite clearly the issue is wider than the doctor involved. It goes to the nature of public health administration in Queensland: a culture of silence through fear and intimidation in Queensland Health, the sloppy practices of the Medical Board of Queensland, the absence of adequate complaint procedures, and the denigration of many competent and dedicated nursing and medical staff who wanted to raise these matters. The new President of the AMAQ, Dr Steven Hambleton, said as much last week. When responding to the Patel fiasco he said: ... I think it’s really an indication that this is what happens when there’s government interference in the standards of medicine. They ... can’t be trusted. His statement backs up my belief that a health system that is top-heavy with bureaucrats will eventually tip over, and that is exactly what happened here. At the start of the year the national Productivity Commission released figures which support my argument. Its report showed that Queensland has the worse public hospital outcomes in Australia: short stays, lack of rehabilitation services and chronic underfunding. While average state government expenditure on public hospitals for 2002-03 was $895 per person, the Queensland government spent only $712 per person. And in its $5.35 billion health budget, which was brought down just recently, the Beattie government did not allocate one cent to help alleviate the problems which have developed at Bundaberg Base Hospital. We just have to take their action on trust. Bundaberg Base Hospital has a medical staff turnover 10 per cent higher than the Queensland average-but then most of Queensland’s public hospitals are struggling to survive under the Beattie administration. Some of the shocking facts and figures uncovered by the AMA include a four-year waiting list for orthopaedic outpatients at the Princess Alexandra Hospital in Brisbane; waiting lists of between eight and 10 years for some surgical outpatients at Royal Brisbane and Women’s Hospital; a 3,000-patient increase in Queensland elective surgery waiting lists for category 1, 2 and 3 patients; a 13 per cent increase in the waiting list at the MAIN COMMITTEE",133,Appropriation Bill No 2 2005 2006 Appropriation Parliamentary Departments Bill No 1 2005 2006 Appropriation Bill No 5 2004 2005 Appropriation Bill No 6 2004 2005

168,Mr Neville,"The royal commission has said that murder charges should be broughtGold Coast Hospital for all categories; a 21 per cent increase in the waiting list at the Logan Hospital; a 10 per cent increase in the waiting list at the Mater Adult Hospital; and an 18 per cent across-the-board increase at the Princess Alexandra Hospital. These are not small country hospitals. These are the cream of the Brisbane and Gold Coast hospitals. Imagine what it is like out in what the Leader of the Opposition refers to as the boondocks. Perhaps the most disturbing fact is that in Queensland almost 500 very urgent category 1 patients have been waiting for their operations since 1 January this year. I could go on and on, but I think the AMAQ’s immediate past president, David Molloy, hit the nail on the head earlier this year when he said: Clinicians at the bedside are saying that an ever increasing number of ‘can’t do’ administrators are swallowing up funds directed to patient care ... There are many examples where an administrator or project manager has been appointed at the expense of hospital equipment, bed increases, or additional clinical staff. When you realise that the number of Queensland health administrators has increased 75 per cent in five years, you get a true idea of the problem the Beattie government has let develop on its watch. I do not want to be unduly political but the Queensland ALP are serial offenders at overadministering. During the Goss years, the Queensland government created, in addition to the Brisbane bureaucracy and the bureaucracy at the hospitals, 13 regional health authorities-very similar to the New South Wales ones, which were also a dismal failure. They employed some 300 to 400 administrators or clinicians who were moved to administrative jobs. The next minister, the National Party minister Mike Horan, cut out these regional health programs with hardly a ripple on the pond of Queensland health care. Let me tell you another story. It is said that there are currently 77 administrators at Bundaberg Base Hospital for 46 doctors. Did you get that? Seventy-seven administrators for 46 doctors. A former South African doctor now in private practice in Bundaberg, who, prior to coming to Australia to practise medicine, administered a large public hospital in South Africa four times the size of the Bundaberg Base Hospital, had an administrative staff of 22. Twenty-two to administer a medium-sized hospital in South Africa and 77 to administer a smaller hospital in Australia. No wonder people are disturbed. Premier Beattie tried to use the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare’s hospital statistics for 2003-04 as a smokescreen, claiming that Queensland has the shortest hospital waiting lists in the country. What he failed to admit was that his government was the only one that did not provide any details or explanations as to why patients had been removed from waiting lists and how long they had been on waiting lists before they were removed. How can a premier, who is the only common thread throughout this current disaster in public health, claim the shortest waiting lists when he is withholding the relevant information on which you can base an apples and oranges comparison? But we should not be surprised. At a public meeting of Dr Patel’s victims, the state Labor member for Bundaberg made the extraordinary claim that the situation was the fault of the federal government for not having trained enough Australian doctors. The crowd response was swift and resolute. In fact, it was the most frightening example I have seen in a public hall in my political years. Immediately, the audience erupted with disbelief that she would try MAIN COMMITTEE to duckshove the blame. Many booed her and others called for her to leave the microphone. I have never seen that happen before in Bundaberg. While we would like to see more Australian doctors, and we have been boosting doctor numbers, I make the point that Australia’s medical work force problems are about not so much specialists and GPs being trained but their distribution. Many parts of Australia are well endowed with specialists and GPs while others, notably outer metropolitan and country areas, do not have the requisite number of doctors. To address this, the federal government has set in place a system to deal with district work force shortage and the member for Bundaberg would be well aware that last year the Australian government allocated six GP positions, four of them bulk-billing, to Bundaberg. On the matter of doctor training, it is the coalition government which, since 1996, has boosted the number of publicly funded university places by 30 per cent-well in excess of the change in population over the same period. It is the coalition’s Strengthening Medicare package which added another 234 publicly funded medical places last year and will see that number increase to 246 from this year onwards. It is the coalition which has applied a bonding program under which 100 graduates per year can receive a scholarship of up to $20,000 per year, provided they bond themselves to country practice for six years. It is the coalition which has supported the establishment of five new medical schools-the one already established at James Cook University in Townsville; one at the ANU in Canberra; one at Griffith University in Brisbane; one at the University of Notre Dame Australia in Sydney; and one at the Bond University on the Gold Coast. It is the coalition which is committed to helping build another three new medical schoolsone at the University of Wollongong, for which $10 million has been allocated; one at the University of Western Sydney, with an allocation of $25 million in total; and, as I said, one at the Notre Dame University in Sydney, where $4 million has been allocated for 60 funded medical places. It is the coalition which has opened up the medical schools to full fee paying students, on top of-not in exchange for-those that are publicly funded. The coalition has established 10 clinical schools in provincial areas so that students from the capitals can do part of their training in the country. Tangible proof of the success of the policies was outlined by my colleague the member for Riverina in the Main Committee chamber in the last sitting period. The rationale for training these people at places like Townsville and Wollongong is based on the fact that people who do their university work and clinical training in the country are more likely to stay there. Similarly, people from outer metropolitan areas are more likely to stay in outer metropolitan areas if they do their training there. This has not been proved yet, but the member for Riverina has a very good indicator from the Charles Sturt University in Wagga. Of the 42 people that graduated in pharmacy-pharmacy being a shorter course than medicine-39 have gone to pharmacies in country areas. So the system works. In the few minutes remaining I want to talk about a return to hospital boards. Hospitals need to have an element of not just public ownership but community ownership. Local hospitals are one of the great confidence builders of the community. You cannot have centralised control from Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne or Adelaide; you have to bring administration closer to the hospital. Certainly, you have to bring smaller rural hospitals under a base hospital or some form of regional administration-and I would prefer a base hospital administrationMAIN COMMITTEE but the board itself has to be made up of people from the community. These must be people with skills. They cannot be political hacks; they have to be people who know what they are doing. They have to be accountants, doctors and so on. I served on the Bundaberg Base Hospital board for 15 years before the Goss government came to power, and we never had anything like the Patel case. Our worse crisis over those 15 years would have been like a Sunday school picnic compared with events in Bundaberg over the last six months or so. We had the right to hire and fire. We stood up to the state government on buildings; we had a blazing row with the Bjelke-Petersen government over one building. We had a blazing row over optometrical services. But we had authority. We were not beaten into the kind of submission that the Beattie government and the Goss government imposed upon their people-a culture of silence and intimidation. When I left that board in 1990 we had plans for a three-storey complex with theatres, wards, a laundry and other things. The Goss government came to power and cancelled it. It was 6½ years before that block was built. Central control does not work. I hope the royal commissioner will consider very carefully, when making his report, a return to local ownership-a return to administration not by mickey mouse boards but by statutory boards controlled by local people. ment was in the political ascendancy at the last election-and supremely so. In comparison with the 2001 election, interest rates, inflation and unemployment had fallen. In those circumstances, no opposition has won office in Australia since the end of World War II-and I put forward that no opposition in a democratic country anywhere in the world has ever won government from that position. Yet what did the government do? Leading up to the campaign, it got spooked and went on a $60 billion spendathon, putting at risk the very same low-interest, low-inflation and low-unemployment statistics. Good governments champion ideas that release the necessary creative energy to devise appropriate and coherent strategies and processes and work to attain the very best in outcomes for all citizens in both the short term and the long term. What did this government do? It simply embarked on a tawdry election campaign and a spendathon. But the coalition had the opportunity to raise the political bar with little or no risk, championing ideas of international competitiveness, building infrastructure and building the technical, professional, educational and social capital of the nation. But what did the Howard government do? It wimped out on all of those possibilities-all of them. Any thought of a world-class society or economy in the long term was simply shelved. ‘Gutless’ and ‘gormless’ are adjectives that come to mind over and over again when judging this government. And the federal budget simply repeated the process. As I have said, good governments champion ideas. Tax cuts are not ideas; they are an outcome. The distribution of tax cuts is not an idea; it is a process. Addressing fundamental questions about personal income tax did not see the light of day. Even the government’s own propaganda, which embraces the term ‘internationally competitive’, was just that: propaganda. Moving Australia into a world-class internationally competitive economy should have been the idea driving taxation reform. But what did the government do? It simply juggled the thresholds-and what a nonevent that will turn out to be. One of the most telling statistics about personal income tax is its percentage of GDP. It is currently 23.1 per cent. The salient MAIN COMMITTEE",134,Appropriation Bill No 2 2005 2006 Appropriation Parliamentary Departments Bill No 1 2005 2006 Appropriation Bill No 5 2004 2005 Appropriation Bill No 6 2004 2005
169,Mr Sawford (Port Adelaide) (5.25 Pm),"There is no doubt that the Howard governquestion to ask is: what will it be in 12 months time? The answer-you guessed it: 23.1 per cent. Nothing has changed. It is all huff, puff and duff. There are some on both sides of the House who support the reduction of the top rate of taxation to, say, 40 per cent, the rate in the United Kingdom, or perhaps to 39 per cent, the rate in New Zealand-the argument being that a lower rate will provide an increased taxation yield to redistribute to the poorer and needier people in our society. Whatever you might say about the merits or otherwise of a reduced tax rate, at least it would be addressing the idea that wages and salaries for the highly skilled should be internationally competitive. If that idea were introduced, coupled with a minimum rate of personal taxation and a more dinkum effort to tackle taxation avoidance, it might just do what its proponents claim. At the same time, removing workers on low to lower-middle incomes from the personal taxation system would not only be possible but also overcome the still too many bewildering disincentives that sap the energy and enterprise of both the economy and those people on low remuneration. Could it work? Of course it could, because a world-class internationally competitive economy-the idea that is driving the reforms-is the right idea to determine a fair, personal income taxation system. Taxation can be advanced in a spirit of compassion and fairness. It does not have to be about aggression and partisanship for some but not for others. We on this side of the House believe that tax revenues collected should be spent on projects for the common good. One such project which could have done with more federal assistance is the recently announced project for opening rail and road bridges over the Port River in my electorate. The Treasurer announced a surplus of around $9 billion in this budget, yet the battle in Port Adelaide to build opening bridges rather than fixed bridges hinged on a meagre $20 million difference. Mind you, there was a terrible campaign by the South Australian Farmers Federation, the RAA, Business SA, the South Australian Freight Council and the South Australian Road Transport Association-that so-called gang of five-who wrecked the upper reaches of the Port River in 1961 with a similar stupid campaign. In the end, the state government to its credit announced that opening bridges would be built despite the federal government and despite the gang of five, but it is bizarre that, with such a massive surplus, the federal government refused to chip in that extra bit of money. It just shows what its priorities are: skimp on infrastructure, give tax breaks to the rich and tighten the clamps on those on the lowest incomes. That is really the agenda, isn’t it? This country is enjoying the unprecedented fortune of a booming economy in China and the highest prices in living memory for our commodity exports. That is great for our country and very lucky for the government, but the thing to understand is that, like everything, it will not last. That is why it is important that the government ensures the funds from the boom in export prices are invested wisely for the future. Most households save and invest during good times to help them when things turn difficult-or the smart ones do. Granted, governments do not really save. However, governments can plan for the future when perhaps times will not be so good. Unfortunately, this government is doing nothing of the sort. There is no real future money in this budget for developing the infrastructure this country needs-nothing significant for roads, rail, water, power, communications, shipping and all the rest of it. There are a lot of words but not very much action and not much expenditure. One of the major differences between successful economies and stagnant economies is the quality of the infrastructure provided by government. If you go to the airport at Stockholm in MAIN COMMITTEE Sweden, you can get on a train that goes 205 kilometres an hour. We cannot even get any fast train at that level in this country. An economy cannot function properly or grow freely if that infrastructure is not in place. And, of course, we could have had the Denmark bridge. Could you imagine anyone in Australia coming up with an idea like the bridge in Copenhagen? They would say you were mad if you came up with that idea in this country. They would say you were mad, like all those people who came up with the Snowy Mountains Scheme and the Alice Springs-Darwin railway. And they still knock it. They have got no imagination. The lack of imagination in this country is breathtaking. But what if the roads are clogged-and they are-and the traffic is slow-and it is-and if the wharves are too small or river channels too shallow and if the railways are not standardised and properly linked and we have not got the higher speeds that we have talked about for so long? And what about our electronic communications, which are so hopelessly slow in so many places? A measure of that dismal failure is the broadband penetration rate in this country. Australia is slipping further behind in the provision of broadband services, and that failure is an impediment to business development, and that means an impediment to jobs growth. My electorate of Port Adelaide is not out in the sticks; it is very close to the centre of a capital city. YetI have had to handle numerous complaints from constituents in business and residents struggling to get dial-up internet. It is an absolute farce. The government has failed to require Telstra to keep to the broadband roll-out schedule. The importance of that physical infrastructure should be self-evident. Unfortunately, the government seems blind to it. The government is also blind to the need to secure better human infrastructure, and that failure is just as costly to our nation’s future. For example, the failure to put the funds from the current boom in China towards our education and training institutions is scandalous. Some people in this place may not be aware of the following fact: 25 years ago 100,000 tertiary students in this country took on pure mathematics and logic. Today less than 16,000 do. You can see the results in the stupidity that is written in our national papers and in the stupidity that goes for public comment on our television. And you can often see it in some of the dribbling, stultifying, stupid contributions that are made in this House. This country is suffering a chronic skills shortage, and for this the government is entirely to blame. The government has neglected the need to provide the infrastructure to enable Australians to gain the skills this country needs to grow and develop, and Australians are now being forced to import those skills. Too many Australians have missed out on the opportunity to develop their skills, because year after year for the past 10 years the government has cut funding to our educational institutions. Billions have been cut from our universities, and the training sector has been wilfully and disgracefully neglected. This year-just cop the sense of this20,000 skilled migrants will be brought into this country while 40,000 Australian citizens will be denied entry to TAFE. Isn’t that just so dumb? It is not as if the skills shortage could not be foreseen: this pattern of skimping on training for Australians while spending big on bringing in skilled labour from overseas has been going on throughout the past decade. The member for Hinkler talked about doctors being trained, but he forgot to talk about how they are selected to be trained. We have more than enough doctors in this country to service the whole nation; they just do not want to do it. They do not want to go out into the country; they do not want to work six days a week; they do not want to work long hours. They want two days a week, and they want the rest of their lifestyle. If we had selected these people a bit MAIN COMMITTEE more carefully in the beginning and taken a bit more note of where they might serve, we might have made some better decisions. Australia spends big on bringing in skilled labour from overseas; as I said, it has been going on for 10 years. In that time, 270,000 people have been denied the opportunity to develop skills at a TAFE college-just think of that-while 180,000 migrants with those skills that we needed have been brought in to take the jobs. I am not against immigration-do not take that at all-but I am against us bludging on the rest of the world in terms of migrants and failing to train our own people. We know that it is cheap for the government. It is unfair for those seeking to learn new skills to earn a decent living. It seems that the more glaring the problem, the greater the indifference by government. Let me take the New Apprenticeships scheme as an example. Forty per cent of participants fail to complete their training. You would think that says something about the selection process. The same drop-out rate applies to our universities. It damn well should not. There ought to be a better selection rate there as well. It is obvious that something is drastically wrong in the transfer of young people from school to tertiary education, whether training or university, but the government continues to ignore the situation. There is a need for an incentive selection and monitoring scheme in the transition from school to further education. That is obvious, whether it is doctors, teachers or nurses. You name it; it is any tradesman. Yet the government prefers the cheaper option of importing the skills required. The government should immediately and dramatically increase the number of school based apprenticeships in traditional trades. They will have a problem: who is going to train these young people? The government has suddenly discovered that no-one is training people in the vocational education area-no-one, not one of our tertiary institutions. It is not forgivable that this sort of nation building role, which ought to be the core of responsibility, is simply overlooked. This issue almost defines the difference between Labor and Liberal on values. Labor seeks always to assist young people in danger of missing out on the education and skills training they need to be able to earn an income. It seems that too many conservatives simply do not care: they allow people-young people especially-to slip away and be lost in the system, to be candidates for dole queues, very low remuneration and low-skilled, non-sustainable jobs. The government’s attitude to those in need of support pensions is devoid of ethics and care. There is nothing worthwhile in this budget to assist those needing assistance to get from welfare to work, and absolutely nothing to encourage employers to take them on. In fact, the government has initiated a two-tier welfare system. Of course, that accompanies a two-tier education system and a two-tier health system-at least it is consistent. Those in our society who are disadvantaged as a result of illness or accident or as a result of poor vision or hearing or because they were born with a medical condition need our assistance, not our neglect. Also in dire need of assistance are the carers, often close family members, who look after those with chronic disabilities. The government is reaping an enormous taxation bonanza on the back of high commodity prices and it would be reasonable for it to direct some extra assistance to those who need it most. The carers in our community are one such group. I recently received a letter from a constituent in my electorate, aged in her mid-60s. Her husband died seven years ago and she is the sole carer of her son, now 31, who was born with down syndrome. They both live on her age pension and she banks his disability pension in the MAIN COMMITTEE hope that it will provide for decent care for him after she dies. The dedication of such carers has saved the public purse a considerable sum over the years, and she suggests they should be entitled to a basic unskilled wage for their efforts-worth some consideration, I would have thought. The coalition’s time in government has seen a litany of wasted opportunities and outright attacks on the more vulnerable in our society. There is no doubt that the coalition has changed the style of government in this country, and it has been aided by a very willing press gallery. Unfortunately, we have moved from a representative democracy to a manipulative one. I know the member for Grey, who is in the chamber, though I do not know the other member so well. The member for Grey is a representative member-he does represent his community-but he and I both know that the power base in both our political parties has narrowed considerably. The government is more and more constrained, more and more controlled and more and more conforming. Government processes and commentary by the media have been corrupted over the last nine years. It is easy for some people in political parties to get with senior journalists who love to be seduced by information and so on-put on the spin, manipulate the information and put forward a slanted view. That seems to be the story of media commentary, particularly recently. There is not one person in the press gallery who has any analytical skills whatsoever-not one. We used to have Malcolm McGregor, whom those on our side used to get a little upset with, and we had Gerard Henderson. Even the Age has woken up to him-it has sacked him. But there is no-one else up there who has any analytical skills whatsoever. They think they have, but they do not. They are on about outcomes and they are on about process, but they are certainly not on about ideas. The Public Service has been demoralised and the obvious results are there for all to seefor instance, in immigration. Immigration-you’re not wrong! What a demoralised department that is. Security is another one; transport is another one; and there is agriculture, education and health-demoralised almost on a daily basis. This is what happens when outcomes and not ideas drive the government of the day. It has happened before. Those who have a sense of history of the 1920s and 1930s will know that this is what happened in many European countries. The election campaign last year was down-market and tawdry. The 2005 federal budget continued the trend. It is a budget bereft of ideas and processes. It took on secondand third-order issues. In fact, with a leadership challenge or the Prime Minister’s retirement imminent within 12 months-probably sooner-and with interest rates and inflation rising, this government has the beginnings, only small, of looking like a corpse waiting for a coffin. The Howard government was supported by the Australian electorate in 2004overwhelmingly so. However, some have failed to observe that that support was given with a quiet sullenness that can be turned into rejection at the next federal election in 2007. I quite confidently predict it will be turned into rejection in 2007. Many Australians are fervently tired of political parties with their propensity to spin, their refusal to offend, their refusal to state what they believe in, their concentration on focus groups and their downright refusal to engage and champion ideas. Our side of politics has been set a challenge-there is no doubt about that-but it will have to champion ideas. It will have to reunite, renew and reconnect with real people and talk the talk of ideas, processes and outcomes in a language the electorate understands. But we need to do one more thing: reject the narrow, manipulative democMAIN COMMITTEE racy that is so prevalent today and champion the broad, representative democracy that the Australian electorate wants and deserves. on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2005-2006 in the Main Committee. This has been a fulsome debate. Every year when debate on the appropriation legislation rolls around, members rush to take their place because it gives you an opportunity to speak in broad terms about the direction of the government, of our community, the options that lie before us, the future of our great nation and the way in which the government, through this budget, is positioning our country for that future. Obviously, the opposition want to put their case as well as to the direction in which they believe we should be going. This occasion is an opportunity for us to take a look at the whole picture because the great depth and breadth of the issues that have been addressed in reform by the Howard government is now pretty much all encompassing. The government has made efforts in practically every sphere of government endeavour to reform the ways in which we go about our activities to create a stronger natural current for the benefit of Australians, and we have done that right across the board. It is worthwhile at this time reviewing some of the basic numbers, which have come into very sharp focus in recent times. We hear continually from the Prime Minister and the Treasurer the runs on the board which have been achieved by the government over the period since 1996 when it won government. When you look at the basic indicators, the question of the often repeated 14 per cent increase in real wages is felt every day in the hip pocket of average Australians. Across the board, certainly in the vote at the last election, there was a clear indication that people had experienced improvement in their real circumstances and that it was a real experience which had been noted by Australians. That is a very positive thing and is something that people have given the government a tick for. A lot of the reputation that the government has built for economic management comes down to a figure such as that. Also, the family payments which the government make indicate that a family with two children, earning up to $46,000, is not paying any net tax at all. That is significant. Basically, a structural reform of our society has occurred over the period of the Howard government. It has not been a big bang type of reform but gradual reform where we have gone from a situation where, if you were in a family, you would feel part of a threatened species to a situation where families now really can feel that there is a government policy that cares for them, is focused on their needs and is determined to build a better case over time going forward. This budget focuses on those issues and once again delivers real benefits for Australians through the tax cuts which the government has been determined to implement despite the opposition of the Labor Party. Why they are opposing them. I have no idea. Instead of fulminating and frothing at the mouth about things they object to and instead of, in a knee-jerk reaction, criticising steps that the government had taken, if members opposite stood back for a moment and spent their time focusing on their reform objectives and what it is they would like to see happen, perhaps we would currently be having a much more comprehensive and meaningful debate. I was very interested in some of the things that the member for Port Adelaide had to say. But, by and large, inflated rhetoric attacking the government on one small point or another really does not go to the core of the matter when the situation for Australians has improved so much over this period. One thing that has become apparent is that the alternative range of MAIN COMMITTEE",137,Appropriation Bill No 2 2005 2006 Appropriation Parliamentary Departments Bill No 1 2005 2006 Appropriation Bill No 5 2004 2005 Appropriation Bill No 6 2004 2005
170,Mr Cameron Thompson (Blair) (5.45 Pm),"It is a pleasure to speak in the debatepolicies that Australians could look to from the opposition have become lost-I do not know whether it is in the fog of war or what it is. It appears there is no direction being offered from the opposition benches. At the moment, people are naturally looking to the government for innovation, and it is good that a constant stream of improved policies are being put forward. As I said, we have the proposal for the tax cuts and we have the industrial relations reforms. These are important new initiatives, but we also have a good track record in both those areas. Mr Deputy Speaker, you must remember the absurd claims that were made by members opposite about the reforms on the waterfront that were made some time ago by this government. All kinds of emotive language was adopted by members opposite and there were claims that what was being sought by the government simply could not be delivered. They said the container rates just could not happen, that they were a physical impossibility. Of course, they have all happened and, as a result of that process, we have a much more efficient waterfront across Australia. tion? dertaken have resulted in very predictable scaremongering and ridicule from members opposite. We had the claim, firstly, that they were going to roll back the GST. Of course, it never happened. No roll-back of the GST was ever offered by the members opposite; it all came to a crashing halt. The scaremongering about the GST was followed by the same sort of scaremongering about the waterfront. If we had stayed with the Labor proposals on the waterfront, we would have had a series of never-ending reviews that would have resulted in the same pathetic lack of outcomes that we saw year after year under the Labor government. Of course, it took the coalition government to attack those big issues and to deliver the outcomes that Australians have found, from their own experience, to be absolutely worthwhile and worth the trouble. The discredited sloganeering that we saw during that period from members opposite has made them lose a lot of credibility. As I said, people in Australia are looking forward to the opposition finally sitting down and developing some real policies as opposed to just a series of slogans. We have seen the same kind of performance over Medicare. When the Minister for Health and Ageing says that the coalition government is the best friend that Medicare has ever had he gets a head nod these days from Australians. He has achieved a situation where the government through its track record has delivered real improvements in Medicare, unlike the illusory proposals from members opposite. And the problem is that when they do come forward with a proposal they face a basic lack of credibility, which does them no credit at all. One current issue that I think is in fact the burning issue that affects Australians in my neck of the woods, in south-east Queensland, is the question of infrastructure. Infrastructure is a basic government responsibility. We have obligations to provide the infrastructure needed so business can get about its activities. We do it through reforming the tax system, through reforming industrial relations and through reforming the waterfront. But, at the end of the day, we also need the cranes, the conveyor belts, the roads, the rail, the bridges and all those kinds of things to be able to operate.

173,Mr Cameron Thompson,"No. The series of reforms that the government have unIn Queensland we have come to an impasse in relation to infrastructure. This has obviously been documented in the case of Peter Beattie’s navy-that great number of ships anchored off Dalrymple Bay and going nowhere. Those ships are sitting out there, waiting and waiting, when we have real new opportunities for coal exports. Yet our ports, Dalrymple Bay in particular, are incapable of delivering the kind of throughput that we desperately need to earn those export dollars to address issues such as the current account deficit and to make those dollar incomes to improve employment opportunities for Australians. We need that infrastructure to be able to deliver those outcomes. In my own neck of the woods the most interesting and challenging question has been in relation to the Ipswich Motorway, which has, through a series of failed Labor government initiatives over the years, had bandaids applied to it. We have never had an outcome which achieves the long-term vision of moving traffic through this region effectively. In fact, back in 1994 the then Queensland roads minister, David Hamill, and his Labor federal colleague Laurie Brereton opened the last upgrade of the Ipswich Motorway. When they did that in 1994 they opened a road which had all the merging points on the wrong side of the road. They trumpeted at the time that they were opening a road for the future. Yet today I have constituents writing to me saying, ‘Why didn’t the incoming coalition government just two years later begin the work to upgrade that road again?’ Isn’t it incredible that two governments-the state government and the federal Labor government-in 1994 could have trumpeted and proclaimed the construction of a road that had a time horizon of two years, that was capable of dealing with traffic for two years? Incredible. Of course, there was no initiative from the state government to upgrade that road and the proposal for them to upgrade that road never came forward until 2001. When they did propose in 2001 to upgrade the road, what did we have? We had a proposal to upgrade and nothing else. Despite the fact that consultants did say it would be a worthwhile proposition to look at alternatives-a bypass of the road instead-there was nothing done in relation to that kind of alternative. In the end what was presented was yet another Labor Party bandaid proposing that we dig up this road after 7½ years and produce a road which would for a very short time be able to cope with the traffic. That is what I call a very substandard outcome. To its credit, the federal coalition government took a different point of view. The coalition government has taken the view that what we need is a long-term outcome. That is, after all, what is written in the documents of AusLink and its predecessor. It has always been the case that if you are going to build a national highway you look to a 20-year time frame. So it is totally incomprehensible to me how the state government could ever suggest a road which would fail at the moment of its completion as a solution to the problems on the Ipswich Motorway. I suppose they think: ‘That is what we did the time before-back in 1994 when we completed that totally inadequate and failed project. Let’s just repeat the exercise.’ One of the objectives they were seeking in doing that was to ensure that the Commonwealth government would pick up the tab for the construction of that road and also, when it had immediately failed, the pressure would come back on again to upgrade it to, say, eight lanes or to provide the bypass at that time. What was being prepared by the state government was not a proposal to solve the traffic problems of south-east Queensland but a proposal to ambush the Commonwealth and to try to extract money from the Commonwealth to save state government expenditure. However, the Commonwealth in responding to this has come up MAIN COMMITTEE with a very effective proposal to create the bypass, which has now been the subject of a feasibility study. This is also the proposal that the Commonwealth put up during the recent election campaign, which resulted in swings in my seat, in the areas most affected by the motorway, of between 10 and 16 per cent to me. In the seat of Ryan we had nine per cent swings in the booths in areas most affected by that motorway. I think they were the strongest swings anywhere in the electorate of Ryan. There were swings right across the board that basically endorsed this proposal. What the Commonwealth was proposing at that time, and has continued to propose right through to today, is much more effective because it does not involve digging up the existing road. It is an incredible thing that, at the same time as they are considering this project, half the state government is out there directing the lion’s share of growth in south-east Queensland into this area served by the Ipswich Motorway. The other half of the state government is running around planning to spend up until at least 2010 digging up the only road that goes there. This is an example of planning under the state government: half the state government is looking to develop all this area, build it up and make sure that it is the focus for growth in south-east Queensland, and the other half is ensuring that for five, six or who knows how many years it will be impossible to travel there because there will be so much disruption on the motorway due to construction gangs and alternative routes. The state government has tried to claim that it has a network of service roads that it will develop over time and that it will build them one at a time so that all the traffic will be able to find its way around these various diversions to the places that it wants to go to. You just have to review some of those notes and you see they are planning to implement, for a start, traffic lights. People who at the moment come to a grinding halt along the motorway just because of traffic snarls would be thrilled, I am sure, to countenance the state government’s proposal to also impose traffic lights. There would be hold-ups on that road 24/7 if you had traffic lights as well. Not only would they occur at peak hour, but freight operators in the middle of the night would find themselves being held up by serious traffic delays. That is another point: in this same crazy scheme the state government are proposing to divert a whole lot of traffic onto another road where there is a low bridge. I do not know if they have noticed-it has not really occurred to them, I suppose-that there are B-doubles going down this road, as it is a B-double route. When they get to the low bridge they are going to have to divert around it, and so we are going to wind up with this heavy freight-these Bdoubles-tracking down Brisbane Terrace, a little suburban street where a lot of the yards do not have fences. It would be incredible if you were out there with your kid playing with a ball and the dog and along came a B-double. It is an incredible example of state government incompetence-absolute incompetence. The notion that this is an effective plan is something that the state government, as recently as last weekend, trumpeted in the paper in full page as. They are trying to maintain that there is some advantage for locals in having their whole road dug up until at least 2010-and if you read the review that has been done by engineers you will see it will probably be for much longer. That is a bad idea. The people who use the road know right now that it is very difficult to use. The Commonwealth through its proposal is seeking to ensure that the disruption on that road is minimised during the construction process-that we have the lion’s share of our MAIN COMMITTEE construction on the greenfield site and that we undertake the bits that are necessary first to complete that road and to make sure that we have an effective bypass. All up, what we wind up with then is a separation of the through traffic from the local traffic. We wind up with a total of two routes so that we have network redundancy and if there is a hold-up on one of them the traffic can divert to the other. These are all logical ideas that, unfortunately, the incompetents in the state main roads department just cannot get their heads around. It is incredible to me, because this is the same department that under the coalition government from 1996 built from scratch the entire Pacific Motorway-the entire M1 project to the Gold Coast-in four years. Yet this same group has taken four years merely to install a group of electronic billboards to direct traffic through this incredible imbroglio. I have no faith at all in anything that the state government plans. WhatI have faith in is the clear vision that the Commonwealth has articulated in building a bypass. We are seeking to divert trucks from the centre of Brisbane, to create a separate route for traffic. This is the only long-term vision, the only option that provides a long-term solution for south-east Queensland. That is the question of infrastructure. That separates the vision of the Commonwealth, of the coalition, from the incompetence of the Labor state government in absolute stark, black-and-white contrast. (Time expired) Ms HOARE (Charlton) (6.05 pm)-This debate on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 20052006 has highlighted the gross unfairness of the government’s changes to sole parent pensions, to disability support pensions and to the tax system. But I want to start by discussing public education and Commonwealth funding for public schools. TonightI want to speak about events celebrating public education and the great achievements of public schools which were held around the country last month. The achievements of our public schools, teachers, students and their communities stand as testimony to their commitment to public education even in the face of attacks and underfunding by this government over the past nine years. In my electorate of Charlton there are 41 public primary schools and seven public high schools and each of those schools holds a proud tradition of teaching our children literacy and numeracy skills, social behaviour and many values, including tolerance, sharing, equality, democracy, fairness, respect and generosity. The theme for public education week this year was ‘Public education-worth the investment’. Celebrating public education also provides an opportunity to showcase our schools and to encourage parents and friends of public education to heighten our calls for governments to provide greater investment in our education system. Since the election of the Howard government there has been a massive shift in the way schools are funded by the Commonwealth. Between 2005 and 2008 the government will provide only 26.3 per cent of recurrent government funding to public schools while 73.7 per cent of recurrent funding will be delivered to 32 per cent of all students-those in private schools. Angelo Gavrielatos, the Senior Vice-President of the New South Wales Teachers Federation recently stated: Given the role of public schools and colleges in shaping our cohesive, democratic society, it is incumbent upon all citizens to call on elected representatives to preserve and enhance the quality of public education by lifting the level of government investment. While welcoming the federal government’s extra $1 billion election campaign promise for small capital works projects in schools-the first time since 1996 that funding has been split MAIN COMMITTEE 70-30 in favour of public schools-the New South Wales Teachers Federation has called on the federal government to allocate the $700 million funding over four years for public school capital works projects in a fair and orderly manner. Labor will of course be monitoring closely the allocation of these funds to ensure they are not used to pork-barrel marginal seats held by coalition members and that they fairly reflect the needs of all public schools across the country. I have kept all of the schools in my electorate fully informed of this program and I have actively engaged the parents and teachers and encouraged them to apply for much-needed funding for their schools. I will personally and actively support every application from schools in my electorate. I can only encourage the government, on behalf of students, teachers and their communities in my electorate, to put aside partisan politics and to ensure that needy schools receive needed funds. The government’s tradition of partisan politics has been recently emphasised in relation to the school flagpole program. Remember when the Prime Minister and his Minister for Education, Science and Training accused public schools of not teaching values education to students, and how offensive and vulgar those comments were and still are. The minister went further by indicating that if public schools had values they would fly the Australian flag. Minister, most already did. The minister then set about encouraging schools to purchase a flagpole, install it and place on it a plaque to indicate the school’s appreciation of the Prime Minister for providing this flagpole. The school would then apply to the minister for reimbursement of the money spent on the pole but not on its installation. An unveiling ceremony had to take place and the school would then be duly reimbursed. I attended and officiated at a couple of these ceremonies in my electorate until the minister decided that a government member had to unveil the flagpole because the government had provided the funding. Excuse me, Minister, but those funds belong to the Australian community: it is not your money. The first time this decision by the minister came to my attention was when a local high school bought the flagpole, installed it and then applied for reimbursement. The exchange went something like this: ‘You can’t receive the money until you have a ceremony,’ to which the school representative replied, ‘That has been arranged with our local member.’ ‘What electorate are you in?’ The school representative replied, ‘Charlton.’ ‘Who’s that? Labor. Well, no, you must have a member of the government unveil the plaque on the flagpole or you won’t receive your money.’ This, of course, was duly arranged. Here we have a government falsely accusing public schools of being valueless. Then it provides a flagpole, which schools have to pay to erect, and it does not even entertain the possibility of a three-pronged flagpole to enable schools to also fly the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander flags. Many schools in my electorate have significant Indigenous populations, and even those which do not still teach the values of inclusiveness, tolerance, respect for others and for other cultures. Yet this minister cannot provide a way for all schools to provide the flags significant to the Indigenous culture within the schools. Here is a minister who walked with me and hundreds of thousands of Australians for reconciliation in 2000 and who now will not provide the assistance to schools to fly the Indigenous flags of the country alongside the Australian flag. This is a really sorry state of affairs. I am pleased to say that when I present the three flags to schools the students are proud of all of them, they are aware of their significance and they treat them with respect and fly them proudly within the school grounds. MAIN COMMITTEE I also want to record in Hansard a couple of examples of schools in my electorate which highlight the wonderful achievements of all of them. While singling out a couple in the time that I have, I am not deflecting attention from the various wonderful and innovative programs initiated by other schools and the various awards won by all schools. I attended the public education celebrations this month at Fennell Bay Public School. During the assembly, which was extremely well attended by parents, I had the opportunity to listen to the principal, Ms Nielsine Oxenford, detail the wonderful achievements of the Fennell Bay students, teachers and community. One achievement announced was that the Fennell Bay Public School senior choir has been selected for a third time to perform at the annual primary choral festival. The students are learning a repertoire of 12 songs which will be performed at the Opera House in November as part of a massed choir of 700 students from schools across the state. Conductors from Sydney will travel to the Hunter in August to listen to the students at a combined cluster rehearsal. The students and school community are extremely proud to have been selected again for this prestigious event, as there is very strong competition to be chosen for the festival. The children rehearse before school every week as well as during lunchtimes to perfect their performance. The Fennell Bay Public School now has three operational choirs, from infants through to year 6, which have earned a positive reputation within the wider community and are asked to perform at many functions throughout the year. The QUEST, Quality Environment for Students and Teachers, program has also been introduced at Fennell Bay Public School for year 6 students to improve their leadership skills. I had the honour of awarding these students with their badges for leadership at the school assembly. The program aims to help students support and lead their peers in a positive way. It also help students become role models who can show younger students how to work and play together. The training helps students recognise and address the issue of bullying. Students will learn throughout the year how to create a quality learning environment. Well done to those year 6 students, and congratulations. Speers Point Public School is another school in my electorate which receives many awards and accolades for its commitment to public education and the welfare and advancement of the students. In 2003 the school received the national award for quality teaching for commitment to the student welfare program Making Connections-Building a Safe School. This was presented by the minister to the principal, Ms Judy Harrison, at a special ceremony here in Parliament House. In 2004 Mrs Susan Olsen of Speers Point Public School received a New South Wales quality teaching award for her outstanding contribution to quality education. In 2004 the school received the New South Wales Minerals Council environment award, an honourable mention for the Lake Macquarie environmental education program and a healthy canteen award. In 2005 the school received grants for technology and sports equipment for the special education kids and a National Safe Schools Framework grant, which will enable Speers Point Public School to continue its student welfare project on citizenship. Congratulations to Judy, the teachers, the students and the school community of Speers Point Public School for their ongoing outstanding achievements. Fifteen schools in the Hunter Region have elected to participate in a Canadian program called Roots of Empathy. In the Charlton electorate, the schools which are participating are: Fennell Bay, Booragul, Biraban, Edgeworth Heights and Mount Hutton. The program is being MAIN COMMITTEE piloted in year 1 classes here and in Western Australia to bring awareness to students of others’ feelings and needs. Again, congratulations to all those schools involved. Public Education week was concluded during a reception at Warners Bay High School on 19 May. During the reception we were entertained by the violin ensemble from Warners Bay High, a choir from Booragul Public School and individual performers Julieanne Handcock from Toronto High School and Katie Wright from Belmont High School. Over 350 school captains, principals and teachers attended the reception along with John Mather, the regional education director of Hunter and Central Coast. All of our public schools are leading the way. I now move to showcase another extraordinary, spectacular show reinforcing our region’s talents in our public schools. Public education is to be celebrated in Australia, and in the Hunter region there is no greater celebration of public education than Star Struck. This entertainment extravaganza is a remarkable showcase of the Hunter’s young talented students and of the efforts and commitment of all the workers, parents and volunteers in the greater school community of the Hunter in helping our children and public education. With a cast of over 3,600 performers from 130 public schools throughout the Hunter and Central Coast region, Star Struck is the largest variety show in Australia and it is now in its 13th year. It is an annually produced variety and entertainment show which provides performance opportunities for students from kindergarten to year 12, and it showcases performing arts programs taught in government schools in the Hunter district. Star Struck is a spectacle with the biggest professional lighting and sound rig seen at the Newcastle Entertainment Centre for any variety show. It is three hours of live music, drama and dance featuring 70 featured singers, a 600-voice choir, 2,500 dancers, 250 actors and variety performers, three marching bands, a 20-piece show band, four student bands, a string quartet and 15 featured musicians. The Newcastle Entertainment Centre’s web site describes this year’s program: “On the Move” takes us on a journey away from home to other lands and places. We travel by road, sea and air. We travel in trains, boats and planes. We will visit all styles of music from percussion to swing to rock, pop and classics. This is a ‘spectacle’ on a huge scale. It is an energy burst that will leave you breathless as the biggest cast yet assembled give you an experience you will not forget. I am looking forward to attending once again, this Friday evening, and I hope the member for Dobell will also take the opportunity to attend Star Struck this year. The production of Star Struck relies only on private sponsorship for its continuation and, as costs continue to escalate, the future of this great show could be in doubt. I use this opportunity in this budget debate to urge the Prime Minister, the Minister for Education, Science and Training and the Minister for the Arts and Sport to avail themselves of the opportunity to experience Star Struck and, once they have done this, to provide some Commonwealth funding to ensure the continued success of this extravaganza. Our local schools pride themselves on teaching compassion, inclusion, commitment to excellence and a passion for learning. The values public education teaches are core Australian values, and public schools in Charlton are doing a fantastic job educating tomorrow’s great Australians. Our public school teachers are one of our greatest assets and one of the most important reasons that public schools enrich so many people’s lives. I turn now to the tax cuts outlined in this budget-Treasurer Costello’s 10th budget. This government’s tax cuts provide $85 a week extra for high-income earners, $65 a week extra for MAIN COMMITTEE members of parliament and just $6 a week for eight out of 10 Australian taxpayers. This is a tax cut system which is grossly unfair. the question? her tax cuts: is she going to keep them or is she going to give them to charity? gross unfairness of the difference between the tax cuts provided to me as a member of parliament and those provided to eight out of 10 workers in my electorate of Charlton. Just before the budget was delivered, we heard the newly elected members of the government crying poor because they would be the recipients of a parliamentary superannuation scheme which is in line with community standards. This is a wide group of MPs who could surely shore up support for the Treasurer when he challenges for the leadership of the Liberal Party. The Treasurer delivered to those backbenchers in the form of a $65-a-week tax cut. In opposing these obscene tax cuts for the rich, Labor have proposed an amendment which will double the tax cuts received by 80 per cent of Australian workers to $12 a week. This is what Australian workers understand. This government under Howard and Costello is far from being the best friend workers in this country have had. Workers understand that their best deal in relation to their taxation arrangements, their working conditions, their living standards, their access to health care and education and their retirement incomes will come with a Labor government. These are the issues we will be highlighting during the course of this parliament and in the lead-up to the next election. Workers will understand and differentiate between the government and Labor in these areas of major concern to them, and they will toss this government out. I refer now to the changes made to the arrangements for disability support pensioners and sole parent pensioners. In the budget, the government has proposed that people with a disability who can work more than 15 hours a week will be forced onto the Newstart allowance from 1 July 2006. The government has quarantined those already on a disability support pension and, in doing so, has created two classes of disability support pensioners. Those with a disability who are currently on a disability support pension and who may be able to work 15 to 30 hours a week will stay on the disability support pension. Those who cannot work more than 15 hours a week will be entitled to apply for the disability support pension, and those who can work more than 15 hours a week will have to apply for Newstart and be subject to activity tests. Disability support pensioners who can do some type of work would be working already if there were jobs available to them. And what kinds of jobs would these be? They would be jobs which were flexible enough to accommodate a worker’s disability, they would be jobs that provided support to a worker with a disability and they would be jobs which provided between 15 and 30 hours of work per week for a person with a disability. If those jobs and that support were out there, many disability support pensioners would be out there working. The clear fact is that those jobs do not exist.

178,Ms Hoare,"WhatI will be doing with the tax cuts is highlighting in the community theAlso, these proposals do not take into account the varying nature of people’s disabilities. People with disabilities or with a chronic illness have good days and bad days, good weeks and bad weeks, and good months and bad months. These variances cannot be anticipated, and they apply particularly to people with a mental illness. Not only are the jobs not there for people with disabilities; the support is also not there for people with disabilities. But a person who has been assessed as being able to work between 15 and 30 hours a week but who has a bad week, who does not turn up for work and who gets the sack will then be penalised by this government for not continuing in a job or in training, for that matter. Similar circumstances apply to sole parent pensioners. The government has now said to sole parents: ‘Once your youngest child turns six, drop them off at school and then get yourself directly to an employment agency to get a job.’ Once again, many sole parents struggling to raise a family on a very limited income would be working if they could be working. But there is not the support or the jobs for sole parents. If there were the jobs then most sole parents with school age children would be working in those perfect positions available between 9.30 am and 2.30 pm each weekday. Upon the Howard government’s election in 1996, it abolished employment support programs for people with disabilities and for sole parents. The programs initiated under Paul Keating’s Working Nation for disability support pensioners allowed them to be case managed individually with support from the CES, the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service and the old Department of Social Security. This case management also provided support and incentives for employers to employ somebody with a disability. This program of disability support panels was abolished by the Howard government. Similarly, under Working Nation the JET scheme was set up to provide support for sole parents who wanted to work. This scheme, administered between the CES and the Department of Social Security, provided training incentives and child-care support for sole parents. Since 1996 this program has had its funding slashed, and it remains a shell of the program it once was. In the past it has not been able to adequately support sole parents returning to work and it will now fail dismally in providing support to the many more sole parents who are being forced into employment. In both cases, of people with disabilities and of sole parents are being forced onto the Newstart allowance, not only are they being forced to undertake training or to look for a job but all the support services are being taken away from them and they are expected to undertake these activities on a reduced income. Absurdly, during the Senate estimates process and following questions to the Prime Minister in the House of Representatives, the government has been unable to provide a guarantee to sole parents that, if they refuse a job because they cannot find suitable child-care arrangements, they will not have their income support reduced or cancelled. It also came to light that, because of the differences between the pensions and the Newstart allowance in the reduction of payment because of other income earned, sole parents and people with disabilities could be up to $250 a fortnight worse off. As I and many other speakers on this side have highlighted during this debate, this is an unfair and irresponsible budget and this government will be condemned by history for it. of the 2005 budget handed down by the Treasurer. This budget tackles head-on the need to ensure greater labour force participation and productivity in the economy. This will provide MAIN COMMITTEE",150,Appropriation Bill No 2 2005 2006 Appropriation Parliamentary Departments Bill No 1 2005 2006 Appropriation Bill No 5 2004 2005 Appropriation Bill No 6 2004 2005
179,Mr Ticehurst (Dobell) (6.25 Pm),"It is with pleasure that I stand to speak in supportbenefits now and into the future. For the first time, this year’s budget incorporates projections that employment and economic growth will be lower in this decade as a result of the ageing population. The need to take steps to prevent an unsustainable burden falling on future generations while we strive to enhance the well-being of today’s generation is becoming more urgent. It would be easy to put decisions off until another day, but the government does not consider this an option. The government is committed to addressing the challenges and taking advantage of the opportunities that will drive change now and in the future. The government recognises that we are in a good position to address challenges because our economy is in good shape. Responsible economic management by this government over the past nine years has delivered a strong economy and strong budget outcomes. By making the tough decisions today, the government will help sustain Australia’s prosperity over the decades ahead. At the outset, I take this opportunity to express my utter disappointment at the Labor Party for blatantly ignoring the interests of Central Coast taxpayers by recently voting against the government’s $21.7 billion tax cuts. The Leader of the Opposition must give up this useless opposition so that all Australians can have tax relief on 1 July. My constituents deserve tax relief, and these tax reforms will provide extra incentive which will be good for our local economy. The 2005 budget will allow for tax cuts for all taxpayers in my electorate of Dobell and nationally. It will increase the rewards from work and saving and heighten incentives to work. This is in addition to the $14.7 billion in tax cuts provided in last year’s budget. These personal income tax cuts will assist low-income earners and boost disposable incomes, and they demonstrate the government’s commitment to rewarding participation and hard work. Measures in this budget mean that over 80 per cent of taxpayers face a top marginal tax rate of 30 per cent or less. Our strong economy, lifestyle advantages and changes to the top two thresholds in this budget will increase incentives to work for all Australians. The Australian Labor Party need to understand that getting into the work force is not a bad thing. There are many people who want to return to work, and tax cuts will only serve to further encourage those people to participate. Dobell’s senior Australians will also benefit from tax reform. From1 July 2005, senior Australians who receive the senior Australians tax offset can earn more without paying tax and will not pay the Medicare levy until they begin to incur an income tax liability. The Howard government has also continued its unprecedented support for Central Coast families, with an allocation of $3.6 billion in areas of demonstrated need to help people make the move from welfare to employment. Welfare recipients who are able to work part time will be obliged to do so. The payment structure will be changed to provide better incentives to work. One of the most important aspects of the Welfare to Work package will be the allocation of $266 million for additional child-care support to allow parents of school-age children to either remain in or re-enter the work force. Under this legislation, a mother can be on the parenting payment until her youngest child turns six and begins school. They will then have an opportunity to look for part-time work. There are already a lot of mums in the work force on a part-time basis and we want to encourage others to work part time. In addition to these measures, the level of family income allowed before family tax benefit part A starts to be withdrawn will increase to $37,500 a year from 1 July 2006. This means that you can earn more before you begin to lose your benefit. This will assist many families in Dobell by providing increased MAIN COMMITTEE assistance of up to $12.55 a week. I congratulate the Howard government on these reforms, which reflect its unwavering commitment to families in Dobell. On the education front, many of Dobell’s primary schools have been seriously let down by the New South Wales Carr Labor government. It is unfair but true that state school students in my electorate are paying the price for the state Labor government’s economic mismanagement of this state. Thankfully, these schools are set to benefit from the Australian government’s budget commitment to capital works in schools. This includes an additional $163.3 million for state schools in 2005-06. Under the program, state school communities will determine their own funding priorities and apply directly to the government for funding. This means that funding will not get caught up in the priorities of state education bureaucrats. I also welcome additional funding of $80 million in 2005-06 for the less well off Catholic and independent schools. Again, the school communities themselves will determine their priorities. Unlike Labor, the coalition does not believe in a divisive school funding policy that provides funding for some students by cutting funds from others. This funding will help to restore and build Australian schooling infrastructure that will provide for current and future generations of young Australians. More than 70 per cent of students do not go directly to university from school, so vocational education and training are of paramount importance. In a significant boost to vocational education and training and in line with the government’s election commitment, the Treasurer has provided funding for the establishment of 24 technical colleges throughout Australia. One of these will service the Central Coast. The abolition of technical colleges by the states has meant that over the past few decades young people have lacked training skills pathways. The price we have paid for this is the skills shortages we are experiencing in many of our key industries. Indeed, when I went to school in Granville we had a Granville technical college. Many kids learnt a lot of their hands-on trades at that school. That school no longer exists. The establishment of a local college is great news for my electorate of Dobell, and for Australia. This will allow years 11 and 12 students on the coast to learn the best trade skills for the future benefit of our region, and will help to address serious skill shortages and youth unemployment. The Central Coast community also welcomes the announcement of an additional 4,500 pre-vocational training places for people interested in a traditional trade, and an additional 7,000 school based new apprenticeships so more students can begin their apprenticeships while continuing their school studies. I will lobby to ensure the Central Coast receives its fair share of these places. I would also like to take this opportunity to express my ongoing commitment to working with the Minister for Education, Science and Training, Dr Brendan Nelson, to support the ongoing viability of the University of Newcastle’s Central Coast campus in light of its current situation. Minister Nelson is well aware of the valuable service that the Central Coast campus provides to our local community. He has visited the campus on many occasions, he understands that we have a rapidly growing region and has always been committed to ensuring that we have the additional resources to support this growth. In fact, last year the minister allocated over 1,000 places to the Ourimbah Campus over four years to meet student demand and support the growth of our region, on top of 164 nursing places. AndI am pleased to say that these places are being taken up in line with that projection. MAIN COMMITTEE In addition, the University of Newcastle as a whole will receive $193.9 million from the Australian government in 2005. That is up from $168 million in 2004. I also welcome the minister’s recent move to give the university a $10 million advance on its Commonwealth Grant Scheme funding. If the Labor Party wants to do anything to help the university, it can lobby its state colleague, New South Wales Premier Bob Carr, to stop slugging the university more than $10 million each year in payroll tax. I will continue to fight for our university. However, the New South Wales Carr Labor government also needs to take an interest in our university and its students. In saying this, I also trust the university’s council to take the necessary steps to ensure its long-term financial viability and to protect the interests of its students. Another issue that I have been lobbying hard for since I first came into office in 2001 is to bring about family law reforms. I am delighted that we are making headway with the provision of $397.2 million over four years for family law reforms-the biggest ever investment in the family law system. The Australian government recognises the impact of family breakdown on hundreds of thousands of children each year and on the wider community. It is committed to tackling this difficult issue with bold family law reforms and by funding more than 100 new services to assist families experiencing relationship difficulties. The government wants to bring about a cultural change in the way family breakdowns are handled. This funding will give separating parents the support they need to sit down across the table and agree what is best for their children rather than fight in the courtroom. The centrepiece of this package is $189 million to establish 65 family relationship centres, where all families can go to get help with their relationship difficulties. The centres will be a visible entry point into the family law system which will provide some mediation services and refer families to other appropriate services. The 2005 budget also delivers on the government’s election commitment to invest in securing Australia’s water future through the $2 billion Australian government water fund. This announcement is great news for the Central Coast community, as our water catchment is one of the most precious assets on the coast and is something we must work hard to protect. A total of $320.9 million has been allocated under the water fund. The National Water Commission will administer $272.7 million of this through the Water Smart Australia program and the Raising National Water Standards program. The remaining $48.2 million will be allocated in grants under the Community Water Grants program. I am working closely with the GosfordWyong joint water authority to secure funding for an important local water project to improve our dwindling water supply. a question? to get behind the initiative and apply for funding for water conservation projects, including funding to protect The Entrance channel. The money is there; we just need to make a valid submission for it. This program represents a major investment by the Howard government and will vastly improve the way we manage our water resources.

182,Mr Ticehurst,"No. I am encouraging local councils, community groups and schoolsthat the Carr Labor government in New South Wales has never come to the party locally, failing to provide the one-third share of the funding for the dredging of Tumbi Creek. My constituents are very grateful for the Howard government’s generosity which allowed us to double our funding offer to over $1.3 million to cover the state’s share as well, but they are losing their patience. Local residents are still waiting for the state government to give final environmental approval so that Wyong Council can begin the dredging work. Sadly, in its recent budget the Carr government has again failed the Central Coast by not providing any funding to help our ailing water supply. It is an absolute disgrace that the Labor Party cannot see the importance of securing the Central Coast’s water future. Our local projects specifically provided for in the budget include $125,000 in federal funding for the Central Coast rescue squad to proceed with initiatives to ensure an even more efficient service in the future. I secured funds for the volunteer squad in the lead-up to the 2004 federal election under the Australian government’s Regional Partnerships program. The Wyong volunteer rescue squad is a dedicated team of hard working volunteers who are making a real contribution to our area and who really deserve this level of support. This is the first funding they have received directly from any government. The Warnervale and Wyong areas are also set to benefit from the budget’s provision of funding for the link road, for which $1.7 million of the $2.5 million in funding will be provided in 2005-06 to construct an access/link road from Britannia Drive, Watanobbi to Sparks Road, Warnervale. The new road will play a vital role in supporting the planned development at Warnervale. It will connect Watanobbi and the Wyong township to MacKillop Catholic College, the Lakes Anglican Grammar School and the employment areas being developed in Warnervale. This funding will also ensure that public transport between Wyong and the proposed Warnervale district centre is linked. I am committed to supporting the Central Coast lifestyle and ensuring that adequate infrastructure is in place to assist our growing community, especially the rapidly growing Warnervale area. This project is great news for the Warnervale community. As the chair of the government policy health and ageing committee, I also welcome the Treasurer’s announcement of $5.5 million over two years to raise national awareness of skin cancer and funding of $45 billion towards a first-class health system in 2005-06. This budget also makes dementia a national health priority with $321 million to improve the quality of life of dementia sufferers and their carers, including 2,000 new extended aged care at home places for people with dementia. One final element of the budget that I would like to discuss is the announcement that 1,200 carers across the Central Coast who provide constant care for a disabled person or child and receive the carer payment are going to receive an additional one-off payment of $1,000. Those receiving the carer allowance are to receive an additional $600. I welcome the Howard government’s decision to assist our selfless fellow citizens. These people are helping those who cannot look after themselves and we really appreciate the work they do. In conclusion, this budget is about sharing the benefits of a strong and well-managed Australian economy with all Australians, and preparing for our future as a solid and secure nation. I commend this legislation to the House. Ms VAMVAKINOU (Calwell) (6.41 pm)-This is the fourth budget I have spoken to since coming into this place as the member for Calwell and it is by far and without doubt the MAIN COMMITTEE most unfair and the most misdirected of all. This is a post-election budget that is framed within the context of a massive surplus at a time when skills shortages are jeopardising future work force participation, tax reform is desperately overdue and the overwhelming majority of Australian workers-some seven million-will miss out on getting a bigger and fairer share of the tax cuts. These are workers who drive the prosperity that so many Australians enjoy. They work hard and many of them-in fact, most of them-have families and mortgages. They are doing it much tougher than the better off 10 per cent of Australians and they deserve a much bigger slice of the pie. They deserve it for their efforts and sacrifices, but unfortunately the government, and the Treasurer in particular, did not see fit to reward them adequately. There appears to be a preference for the wealthier side of town. It is on this basis that Labor is opposing the government’s tax cuts-because they are so blatantly unfair and misdirected. My constituents are a part of the overwhelming 90 per cent of taxpayers who will miss out on an equitable and meaningful tax cut. For us in Calwell there are mixed realities and mixed feelings. The budget will be welcomed in some areas amongst the self-employed and the small group of high-income earners who will receive, no doubt, some very handsome benefits. However, these people comprise only a very small number whilst the vast majority of my constituents will not be doing so well. BeforeI talk about some of the disadvantages this budget will impose on my constituents, I would like to make the point that there are some aspects of the budget which are positive and will be of benefit to the federal seat of Calwell. I refer particularly to the funding for the completion of the Craigieburn Bypass and other Hume Highway works, which we do welcome because we have a high accident rate on the Hume Highway. As recently as the weekend someone was seriously injured. We look forward to the completion of the Craigieburn Bypass. Also, and I know I say this on behalf of South Pacific Tyres, we welcome the abolition of the three per cent tariff on imported goods not produced in Australia. This is an issue South Pacific Tyres raised with me two years ago and I raised it in the House last year. They are very pleased that finally the Treasurer delivered on his promise, which is about two or three years late, to remove this levy. South Pacific Tyres employ a lot of people in my electorate. It is always good to make sure large employers are viable and able to maintain that strong level of local employment. In addition, the implementation of the government’s election commitments will be welcomed by Kangan Batman TAFE in Broadmeadows. However, as Kangan Batman’s chief executive, Ray Griffiths, has noted, it is disappointing that publicly funded TAFEs did not get much of a boost in direct funding for additional places. I am afraid I agree with Ray’s comments because the budget has not provided any general growth funding for additional TAFE places, especially when we learn that 40,000 people were turned away from TAFE institutions across Australia last year. This is a paradox when, as we all know, the debate around town at the moment is that Australia is experiencing a national skills crisis. It appears absurd to me and to others that this government would not invest in increased education and training at our TAFE institutions. It does indicate that the government perhaps is not as serious about addressing the serious decline of apprenticeship completion rates which further add to the ongoing skills shortages that we are experiencing. When apprenticeship completion rates are so low at around 60 per cent, the Labor Party’s proposal for a trade MAIN COMMITTEE completion bonus of $1,000 halfway through and another $1,000 at the completion of their apprenticeship is a very sensible way of acknowledging and addressing a problem that, rather than enhancing our skills development, actually adds further to the growing skills crisis. Discussions with the executive director of the northern region’s business and development network, Mr Mick Butera, indicated that the tax cuts in this budget did not go far enough and that small business would suffer due to a lack of trainees in areas, particularly in the building industry. It appears the budget has not adequately addressed the immediate problem of the shortage of trainees. Small business needs trainees today rather than in six or seven years time. Given the government appears to be so committed to helping small business and talks about freeing small business from the so-called burden of unfair dismissal-the government promises that should small business be exempt from unfair dismissal then miraculously 40,000 jobs will be created-it is a paradox where small business will find these specially trained people it requires in order to create these jobs. As I mentioned earlier, the few high-income earners in my electorate will obviously welcome these tax cuts. However, the majority of my constituents fall into the middleand lowincome levels, so I am afraid that all they have to look forward to is their $6 a week tax cut, which in reality will not even cover the rise in mortgage repayments from this year’s interest rate rises. So there is not much of a bonus for my constituents in the $6 a week tax cut. The government is the highest taxing government in Australia’s history, with the Treasurer collecting 70 per cent more tax since this government came to office. That is largely due to the impost of the GST, which leaves the average family paying $12,000 more in taxes than they were nine years ago. With this year’s considerable budget surplus, it seems pretty clear that Treasury is collecting more taxes than it needs and the common sense approach is to return some of those taxes in a fair and equitable manner. Labor has put forward a fairer tax package with a $12 a week tax cut for the majority of Australian workers. No doubt many of them are in my electorate, and they would benefit far more with a $12 a week tax cut than with the government’s $6 a week. The reality is that the government is squandering the budget surplus on skewed and unfair tax cuts which ignore 90 per cent of taxpayers, yet it seems to be putting some pretty unrealistic pressure on the disabled and sole parents in our community. I think that the budget targeting the most disadvantaged in our community and increasing the burdens that they already face is not the sign of a government that views people in a fair and equitable manner. I am particularly concerned about this because in my electorate of Calwell we have a large number of people who receive disability support and parenting payments and many of them have already written to me and called me to express their concerns about how the government’s Welfare to Work policy will affect them in the course of their daily lives. We have over 6,000 disability support customers in Calwell and, as I indicated in this place last week, many of them would actually like to work. Contrary to the image that is being put out by many, including those in the government, people on disability support are not welfare bludgers and there are many who would actually like to work and improve their financial circumstances. In addition to improving their financial circumstances, working means that they would get a sense of purpose that comes from interacting with other people in the workplace, and they would also benefit from the opportunities that come their way when they are working and acquiring more skills. MAIN COMMITTEE The reality is that there are not any jobs for people with disabilities. I know that for a fact because I was a member of the Standing Committee on Employment and Workplace Relations in the previous parliament which conducted a public inquiry and most of the evidence submitted to that committee indicated very strongly that employer attitudes towards people with disabilities was very negative and very discriminatory and that many barriers existed for the employment of people with disabilities. Those barriers include the obvious: negative stereotyping of people with a disability, discrimination and prejudice that comes with that stereotyping, inappropriate or inadequate assistance and support for those who are lucky to go into the work force, lack of information for employers to enable and encourage them to employ people with disabilities and lots of inappropriate jobs and inflexible working arrangements that militate against people with disabilities actually entering the work force. The committee’s report also noted the evidence submitted by Disability Action Inc. that people with disabilities effectively need adequate support in order to access job training and employment opportunities. They need access to adequate personal assistance and care, to accommodation and to transport, and they need access to buildings and other infrastructure, to communication technologies and to the community. Presently those things are not available. We do not know how these people are actually going to be able to find jobs and then be able to sustain themselves in a working environment without all these additional supports. On the basis of my experience, I am not very optimistic that people with disabilities are actually going to be able to find meaningful employment. It does concern me that the government does not appear to have considered these barriers adequately and does not appear to have provided some sort of mechanism to bridge the gap between welfare and work in a sustainable manner. Not only do many disabled people want to work but many currently do work, and this government should be focused on doing more to encourage employment of people with a disability. It is no good saying that they actually have to go and work; you have to encourage the employment sector to employ them. An organisation in Calwell called Distinctive Options specialises in finding employment for people on disability support pensions. My daily contact with them tells me that they have incredible difficulties in placing people. For a while, my office took some of their clients as a way of providing some form of work experience. I particularly mention young Adam who, after working in my office for a period of about 12 months, eventually secured a job at the Melbourne Fire Brigade. This is a success story that, unfortunately, is the exception and not the rule. Today, Adam is still with the Melbourne Fire Brigade and doing very well. This is a perfect example where, if an employer has a will to employ people with a disability, they can be gainfully employed and make a very constructive contribution. EarlierI mentioned the barriers to employment and said that discrimination is one of the most common and potent barriers to employment. If we are going to ask people with disabilities to go back into the work force, it is very important that we seriously address employer attitudes and practices towards people with disabilities, as well as their discriminatory practices, so that some results can be achieved. The focus should be on employers’ willingness and attitudes, if the government’s Welfare to Work policy is going to make any inroads or be successful in any meaningful way. We need to make the employer the issue for a change, rather than constantly speak in terms that impute guilt or unwillingness on the part of the disabled and make them the scapegoats, as they appear to be throughout this debate. MAIN COMMITTEE I also want to talk about Brite Industries in my electorate. Over the last 20 years they have led the way in giving disabled people opportunities to gain meaningful employment. They are a caring, dedicated employer who understand the needs of their employees. That is the key to their success and commitment: they are compassionate people who understand the needs of their employees. Brite currently provide employment for 126 physically and intellectually disabled residents at their packaging factory and commercial nursery. It is employment arrangements such as these which should be further supported and encouraged by this government, rather than subjecting them to the increased burden of productivity assessments, as is currently occurring at Brite Industries. Unnecessary and unfair pressure is being placed on the management of Brite and, indeed, on those individuals employed there. The budget does not appear to be doing anything to encourage long-term secure employment for people with disabilities. It does not appear to address employer attitudes and it does not seem to do anything substantial to reverse the decline in disability employment by the Commonwealth, which I understand has dropped from 5.6 per cent to 3.8 per cent. The Commonwealth itself is not leading by example. It is telling people with disabilities that they have to go out and get a job. As one of our major employers, it suffers from the same problem as other employers do-that is, an attitudinal problem. The Commonwealth could start to lead by example. Jobs need to be created that are appropriate and sustainable. If this government is to drastically restructure the lives of DSP recipients, it has a responsibility to make a positive impact, not a destructive one. Similarly, the government’s changes to the parenting payment obligations concern me, as the member for Calwell, and my constituents-particularly given that there are over 7,000 parenting payment recipients in my electorate. The overwhelming number of these are sole parents and they are already undertaking the precious task of raising children in often very difficult and trying circumstances. Essentially, this policy of requiring sole parents-in this case mothers-to go back to work once their child turns six takes away choice. In a twoparent household, parents can choose whether they stay home; the mother or father can choose whether they stay home while the child is still at school. Sole parents no longer have that choice once the youngest child reaches six. This is rather ironic coming from a government that constantly argues about the importance and the value of individual choice. It seeks to deprive sole parents of choice. It seeks to deprive sole mums of the option of staying home and being with their children, particularly while they are at primary school. The government has not carefully thought out the ramifications of this for the children, the schools and the communities involved. I find it despicable that we are almost designing two classes of parents. It is despicable because those children who are in single-parent households are the ones most at risk. They are the ones who need, more than anything else, at least one parent to be at home with them and to support them through the critical years of early childhood education. We do not know what the social ramifications for children in sole parent families will be. The reality too is that those sole parents who will be expected to return to work will require retraining. They are not going to walk into a job. No-one is going to employ them. They are going to have as much difficulty getting a job as people on disability are going to have because there are also many prejudices out there about employing a sole parent. I worry about what will happen to sole parents when the government implements its industrial relations reform agenda. Exempting small business from unfair dismissal will put a very MAIN COMMITTEE large number of the Australian working population in this position. Many of them will be sole parents and mothers. If they happen to be lucky enough to get a job selling whatever in a shop, or wherever it may be, and if they have to go home or they get called away once too often from their work to attend to their child who may have taken ill at school-it happens, I know; it happens with my children, it happens all the time-the employer might decide: ‘This worker is not acceptable because she has to keep leaving so I am going to give her the sack.’ So this strange convergence is taking place. (Time expired) priation Bill (No. 1) 2005-2006. This is the Howard government’s 10th federal budget, a remarkable and commendable achievement. Like all good anniversaries, its celebration entails an affirmation of what has been achieved so far and a commitment to continuing in the same vein. The budget is based on tried and true principles: sound financial management underpinning a budget surplus, the further repaying of outstanding Commonwealth government debt, funding for important areas of current community need, structural reform, allocation of funds for long-term priorities, tax relief for ordinary Australians and a positive economic outlook in a difficult international environment. I have made these points before when speaking to previous budgets but the fact is that we have become accustomed-dare I say wedded-to these pillars of monetary good practice. But the fact is that they are only comparatively recent achievements. When I first entered parliament in 1994, the expectation of the federal budget was somewhat different: $10 billion blowouts, last minute privatisations of national institutions, 17 per cent interest rates, 11 per cent unemployment, negative economic growth and rampant inflation. These are all fragments of a past that should not be forgotten. The Leader of the Opposition in his address-in-reply to the budget attributes today’s vastly improved economic position to good fortune. Nothing could be further from the truth. There is luck in economics, certainly, as there is in politics. This government has had its share of good luck, including strong export prices, but it has also faced and overcome some unprecedented challenges-the Asian economic crisis, share market instability, the devastating drought, September 11 and the ensuing economic malaise in the US, Japan and Europe. The government has been able to navigate these shoals and capitalise on the positive aspects of the current environment because of sound economic management, careful attention to detail and a sensitive balancing of competing priorities. My views could be dismissed but this is not just a matter of partisan political opinion. Indeed, the OECD in its 2004 survey of the Australian economy noted: ... in the last decade of the 20th century, Australia became a model for other OECD countries ... [S]tructural and macro policy anchors conferred an enviable degree of resilience and flexibility on the economy. The combination resulted in a prolonged period of good economic performance that shrugged off crises in its main trading partners as well as a devastating drought at home. The short-term outlook is for continuing strong growth of productivity and output, low inflation and budget surpluses accompanied by tax cuts. I have to say that occasionally the OECD gets it wrong, but the budget certainly made the OECD’s forecasters look pretty good in this case. In 2005-06, the budget will be in surplus by $8.9 billion. Economic growth is expected to be around three per cent and inflation should MAIN COMMITTEE",154,Appropriation Bill No 2 2005 2006 Appropriation Parliamentary Departments Bill No 1 2005 2006 Appropriation Bill No 5 2004 2005 Appropriation Bill No 6 2004 2005
183,Mr Georgiou (Kooyong) (7.01 Pm),"I am pleased to speak in support of the Approremain below three per cent. Unemployment is likely to remain at around five per cent. Commonwealth government debt will be cut to just $6 billion, down from $96 billion in 1996-and, yes, as the OECD anticipated, there will be tax cuts. Some years ago, the Treasurer outlined the government’s fundamental position with respect to tax cuts. Once the budget was balanced, a proportion of outstanding debt repaid and important new services funded, consideration would be given to cutting taxes. Over the last few years, this approach has delivered substantial tax cuts for all Australians. In previous budgets, taxpayers earning up to $50,000 a year received tax cuts of up to $56 a week. Now, thresholds on the middle and higher tax brackets are being adjusted to reflect the government’s long standing aim of ensuring that at least 80 per cent of taxpayers face a marginal tax rate of no more than 30 per cent. The 42 per cent threshold will increase from $58,000 to $63,000 on 1 July 2005 and to $70,000 on 1 July 2006. From1 July this year, the 47 per cent threshold will increase from $70,000 to $95,000 and on 1 July next year it will increase again to $125,000. The lowest tax rate, of 17 per cent, will be reduced to 15 per cent, delivering deserved relief to lower income earners. The income threshold at which the maximum rate of family tax benefit A is payable will increase to $37,500 from 1 July 2006. This will give low-income earners the opportunity to increase earnings without affecting family assistance payments. Also, the superannuation surcharge will be abolished. I do not need to remind the House that the Labor Party oppose these tax cuts. Much has been said about this seemingly strange decision, so I will not harp on it. It seems to me that the Treasurer’s comments and the trend in the polls have made a bottom-line judgment on the efficacy of these tactics. However, while the tax cuts are undoubtedly a centrepiece of the budget and their implementation has been the central issue in the ensuing debate, there is a great deal more in the budget than just tax. The critical role played by carers in looking after disabled members of our community is again recognised through a one-off bonus of $1,000 to recipients of the carer payment and $600 to carer allowance recipients for each eligible care receiver. The Strengthening Cancer Care initiative will invest $189 million for new cancer screening programs and awareness campaigns and a range of coordinated mechanisms that will tackle treatment, research and support for families, carers and patients. Dementia will be made a national health priority. There will be an additional $321 million invested over five years for early intervention, additional care services and carer training. The object of this is to improve the quality of life for people suffering from this debilitating condition. The seniors concession allowance will be extended to more than 44,000 gold card holders who are of veteran pension age and who do not already receive the allowance or the twiceyearly utilities allowance. The three per cent tariff on imported business inputs that do not have substitutes manufactured in Australia will be abolished. This will cut costs and improve the competitiveness of thousands of Australian businesses. I am very pleased that the preceding speaker from the Labor Party-the member for Calwell-recognised this fact. Twenty-four Australian technical colleges will be established. These will provide quality education and trade training for senior secondary students. An additional 5,000 places will be provided through the New Apprenticeships Access Program. A new Welfare to Work program will invest $3.6 billion to increase work force participation by people with disabilities, parents, the long-term unemployed and mature age people on income support. Critically, existing MAIN COMMITTEE recipients of the disability support pension and parenting payment will not lose access to their payments. These measures will be supported by an additional 14,700 rehabilitation service places, 84,300 child-care places and a new $48 million employment preparation service. A new Future Fund will begin to fund liabilities which have already been incurred but not yet provided for. Earnings will accumulate in the fund, which will be safeguarded by legislation and managed by a statutory independent board. Additional investments in the AusLink program will bring government’s five-year investment in upgrading Australia’s transport infrastructure to $12 billion. The government is also providing an additional $150 million to expand the Roads to Recovery program and $90 million to continue the Road Safety Black Spot program. As I said at the outset, this budget is based on the tried and true principles of sound financial management, repaying debt, funding important community programs and long-term priorities, structural reform, tax relief and a positive economic outlook. The government has an ambitious agenda which it has pursued creatively and successfully. Certainly, there is always room for improvement. To admit anything else would be a sign of complacency, but to suggest-as does the Leader of the Opposition-that the government is lazy on reform is a little unreasonable. I think that all politicians are sometimes subject to selective recollection, so we should not be too critical, but the fact is that the golden era of reform about which the Leader of the Opposition waxes so lyrical was characterised by 10 per cent unemployment, double digit inflation, 17 per cent interest rates and a wildly fluctuating economy. What is also neglected is that, unlike the Liberal Party through much of the 1980s, the Labor Party has led an opposition to all reform and actively frustrated reform in the period of the Howard government at every possible turn. Labor has opposed the measures introduced to return the budget surplus. Labor opposed the overdue reforms to our tax system through 1998 and 1999. Labor has opposed every initiative the government has taken to improve the flexibility and efficiency of Australia’s labour markets. Labor has opposed reforms to increase the affordability of private health insurance and correct the imbalances in the tax system. It has opposed initiatives to revitalise Medicare and bring it into the 21st century and now in this budget it is opposing straightforward tax relief for ordinary Australians. Undoubtedly, the role of the opposition is to oppose but, once you see the list, it may seem that this may be a bit excessive. I commend the bill to the House. missed opportunities. I think that is the correct description. In other debates, I have spoken about the missed opportunities to improve the long-term economic prospects of the nationmissed opportunities like the failure to invest to meet the challenge of the skills shortage, the failure to invest to resolve infrastructure blockages and the failure to invest in business research and development to drive the jobs and exports of the future. I am also deeply disappointed at the failure of the Treasurer to get his proposed Future Fund right. I have been advocating such a fund for years. Here was a unique opportunity to get it right, and all we got was a half-baked, ill thought out proposal which may well do more harm than good in the long term. Important as those issues are, tonight I want to focus on other missed opportunities, on some things the budget failed to address or, to paraphrase Robert Frost, ‘the roads that were not taken’ in this budget. If an interest or an issue is not addressed in this budget, you can tell MAIN COMMITTEE",160,Appropriation Bill No 2 2005 2006 Appropriation Parliamentary Departments Bill No 1 2005 2006 Appropriation Bill No 5 2004 2005 Appropriation Bill No 6 2004 2005
184,Mr Mcmullan (Fraser) (7.12 Pm),"This budget has been described as a budget ofit is an extremely low priority for the Howard government. As Deutsche Bank suggested in May this year in its budget reflections document, as it called it, the government’s starting point for the budget before the decisions took their effect was that the surplus this year would have been $17 billion and $22 billion for the subsequent year. When a government starts with such an extraordinarily large surplus, you can safely conclude that, if any particular spending priority does not feature, it is a pretty low priority for the government. This evening I want to highlight three of those areas: some specific issues with regard to the arts, some with regard to Indigenous affairs and some with regard to the rapidly developing fight against global poverty. In the area of arts policy, there is virtually no initiative in the budget and certainly no reform at all. What we see is an array of missed opportunities. There are, for example, many reports that have been presented to the government over recent years which have made recommendations about arts policy which the government continues to ignore. I want to refer to one of those and then to another issue which this budget fails to address and which the government will need to do something about during this financial year. The first arts issue is the question of resale royalties for visual artists as recommended in the Myer report. The government has indicated some positive attitude towards this excellent recommendation from what was a very good report prepared by Rupert Myer. For years, people have said that resale royalties for visual artists will in some way be a deterrent to the arts market. They will be an inhibition on purchasers. I thought the choice of Rupert Myer as the person to write the report was a reasonably good recommendation right from the start. ThenI had the chance to meet with him, and I was very impressed and thought that he brought a lot of strengths to the report. In particular, one thing he brought was the experience of someone who has been very significantly involved in the arts acquisition end. The Myer Foundation and the Myer family have been very big participants in the arts market. If he can cut through and see that having resale royalties for visual artists is a correct principle in recognising the right of an artist to benefit as the value of their art increases and recognise that it will not in fact be a deterrent in the market if properly introduced, it is time the government actually got involved and implemented this important principle. It is not that we do not know how to do it; it has been done around the world. We would not be the first to do it. We do not have to break new ground. All we have to do is put into effect the policy that Rupert Myer recommended. I strongly urge the government to take that step. It is very important for visual artists in general and particularly for Indigenous artists. Many of us know stories of artworks sold originally for a small price by an artist living in poverty while the art resells for hundreds of thousands of dollars, and from that transaction the creator of the art gains nothing. That is the first thing I want to speak about and urge the government to do something about. I want to refer to a positive thing about the arts before I go on to my second concern. I acknowledge and welcome the funding for orchestras in this budget and, in a parochial sense, the first very small but nevertheless welcome recognition of support for the Canberra Symphony Orchestra. My concern is that what this welcome initiative in support of orchestras displays is an attitude that permeates the arts and is reflected in the next issue I want to raisethat is, that the government are not really focused in this area. They allow crises to develop and then they expect to get applause for responding to the crises that they allowed to develop in the first place. MAIN COMMITTEE The crisis I want to refer to now relates to the cash crisis for the ABC, which is leading to a collapse in the production of local drama. I refer in particular to an article by Amanda Meade in the Australian of 19 May. I will be quoting extensively from that article but I will also be referring to some other discussions I have had with senior ABC people. They were private discussions, so I certainly will not be disclosing the names of the individuals. But very senior people in the ABC have confirmed the accuracy of this report. The article says: The ABC will stop producing Australian drama altogether if the federal Government does not increase its triennial funding this year ... That is a warning from the Managing Director of the ABC, Russell Balding. There is a quote from him: The ABC is nearing the day when it will not be able to commission any Australian drama at all because of the cost and the funding restraints ... The ABC had local drama output in 2001 of 102 hours; in 2004, it was 21 hours. That is an 80 per cent fall. I repeat the alarming situation whereby the ABC might ‘stop producing Australian drama altogether’. It has now fallen behind the production performance of the commercial television channels. It is lagging a long way behind. In fact, if it were bound by the requirements that the commercial channels face to produce a certain proportion of local drama, it would be in breach of those. The article refers to ‘high-end drama’, high-end drama being about quality, and ‘long-form drama’. Long-form drama includes long-running series like GP, Police Rescue and the other innovative programs that have transformed Australians’ recognition of themselves and their society and have made a big contribution to our understanding of who we are and what we do. Long-form drama, which is in crisis, is significant culturally and significant in terms of opportunity for not just actors-although we all see television shows as jobs for actors-but the musicians, writers, technicians and a whole range of people who produce these dramas and create the basis for the successful film industry of which Australians are so proud. That will be in jeopardy if we do not get that core building block of ABC drama production right. I know there is a triennial review of the ABC funding this financial year and I urge the government to do something to ensure that we re-establish the necessary basis for drama production by the ABC. I want to briefly turn to the issue of global poverty. It is very hard to deal with it briefly as it is such an enormous issue, but I have had other opportunities elsewhere to speak on it so I will be brief tonight. The international community, through the United Nations, set down in 2000 the Millennium Development Goals-eight specific goals-and a timetable to achieve them by 2015. Since then there has been a great international debate about the best way forward, the best route to achieve these shared objectives, and the Australian government-the Howard government-has been noticeable by its absence in that debate. There have been some positive initiatives in this area by the government. I support what it has done with the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands and its attempts to inject improved aid performance into Papua New Guinea. It has run into some problems there but nevertheless I support both of those initiatives. I think the humanitarian response to the tsunami was correct both in magnitude and method and I was pleased to hear today-as I know you were, Mr Deputy Speaker Quick, from previous conversations we have had-the statement by the Treasurer indicating support for the debt relief initiative outlined by the G7. He referred to it as the G8 but in terms of this particular decision it is the G7. But all those initiatives, welcome MAIN COMMITTEE as they are, are missing the main game, which is how best to provide the additional funds required to achieve the Millennium Development Goals by 2015. It is a great disappointment to me that Australia was one of the few developed countries to fail to make any significant commitment to increased funding to meet the Millennium Development Goals at the Monterey summit to discuss these issues. Nothing has been heard from the Treasurer about British Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown’s important proposal for an international finance facility. This is the best option around. There has been a lot of debate, hyperbole and wild speculation about what might be able to be done to fund the achievement of these important goals. Broadly put, they can be summarised as trying to attack systematically the problem of global poverty and the collapse in living standards of people in the poorest developing countries, most particularly in but not only in Africa. I strongly support the international finance facility although I do not think it is perfect. IfI had my way, it would be slightly modified, but it is a way to take advantage of the commitments that most of the developed countries made at Monterey and subsequently to increase their aid funding. However, that aid increase will be too slow to achieve the Millennium Development Goals by 2015 and the international finance facility is front-end loading that allows international borrowing with government credit ratings so that the money can be borrowed cheaply and made available in an early and predictable manner to the developed countries while the repayment becomes the responsibility of the developed countries through their increased aid commitment. That is a very abbreviated summary of this important initiative, but we have not heard a word from the Treasurer and the Howard government about this. There are many other proposals around, but this is the only one I can see that has a realistic chance of success in driving significant, additional, predictable funds early enough to contribute to the internationally laudable goal of ‘making poverty history’. It is the biggest international finance issue in the world at the moment, but the Treasurer seems to be struck mute-which is not a problem he seems to suffer from often. He either does not have a view about it, cannot get the Prime Minister to agree with his view or does not want Australians to know what his view is. It is time the Treasurer made it clear whether he is going to support this proposal, because it needs support if it is going to succeed and flourish. It is not the only good idea around. The Americans have proposed the Millennium Challenge Account, which I think has some positive features. It is a bit controversial-not many people on my side of politics around the world support it-but I think it has some positive features. It is distinctly additional; it is grant based, not loan-based; it is untied; it is based on objective criteria for targeting the countries that can use the money well; and it is targeted at the lowest income countries. I do not think the criteria are quite right for Australia; if I were doing it, I would not go for exactly the same criteria. If Australia were to accept it, we should of course vary it to have more focus on some of the countries in our region, particularly in the Pacific. I think that one or the other, or both, of those initiatives needs to be supported by Australia so that we are making a more concrete contribution to achieving the Millennium Development Goals. Finally, I suggest that an approach similar to that taken in the fight on global poverty be taken on Indigenous issues here in Australia, and tonight I want to focus on Indigenous health. We need to set down specific goals and timetables for outcomes on key issues concerning the MAIN COMMITTEE relative living standards of Indigenous Australians-similar to the Millennium Development Goals that have been set down to deal with those suffering from massive global disadvantage-so that we can measure our success against those goals and timetables. We are always talking about inputs in Indigenous affairs, but we ought to be talking about outputs, achievements and how we are going against reasonable targets-and we are not doing well. Starting with health, I applaud the Australian Medical Association. They have been doing a great job over recent years in highlighting the issue of Indigenous health. In 2002 they exposed what some of us knew but what was not significantly recognised: the large and growing gap in life expectancy between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. Let us be honest about it: we have world’s worse practice here. There are essentially four countries that are in similar circumstances in terms of their colonial experience and the relationship between their indigenous population and their non-indigenous population: New Zealand, Canada, the United States and Australia. The gap in life expectancy between Indigenous and non-indigenous people is wider in Australia than in any of those other three countries. In the other three countries it is narrowing, but in Australia it is getting wider. We have to acknowledge that reality. I am not trying to make a political point against the government: this has been a problem for a long time. But we are not being honest with ourselves. In 2002 the AMA did the right thing by highlighting the problem. In the following year they explicitly said, ‘It is clear that the funding to deal with the issue is inadequate, and nothing is being done’-and effectively nothing has been done since. In 2004 they talked about the important issue of the shortage of Indigenous medical staff in the work force. They were talking about doctors and nurses, but I think it is also true for dentists. In 2005 they have raised the issue of low birth weight children and premature babies. They have pointed out that the program they want to focus on to reduce the number of low birth weight and premature babies amongst Indigenous families could be done for $20 million per year. In this budget, the starting-point surplus was $20 billion per year. The AMA have put forward a modest, achievable program to deal with the crisis of low birth weight and premature babies amongst Indigenous women for $20 million a year. The government have not taken it up and it is time they did. There are some issues we need to set specific goals for-life expectancy, an Indigenous medical work force and low birth weight and premature babies-so that we can narrow the life expectancy gap and lift the birth weight of Indigenous children. There are other areas, if we were setting goals, where we would want to do it-health, education and housing. But let us start by setting down some of these goals and seeing how we might address them. In its most recent report, the AMA said, ‘Indigenous children are more than twice as likely to be born with low birth weight as non-Indigenous babies, putting 1,140 children a year at physical and developmental disadvantage.’ This points to some of the ongoing crises in Indigenous health-for example, renal failure, obesity and high blood pressure. These issues are often caused by malnutrition of the baby while it is in the mother’s womb. We are seeing long-term crises costing a lot of money, if you want to look at in those terms, and having profound and disturbing social consequences for Indigenous communities, particularly remote communities. But this report makes very clear that this is a serious problem for Indigenous people in urban environments as well. We need to adopt, as a national goal, the improvement of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander child health. The number of low birth MAIN COMMITTEE weight babies and the number of premature deliveries should be set as indicators to monitor the achievement of this goal. As the AMA says, it is quite simple: a program which does not reduce these two indicators is a program that is not working. I commend the AMA for their work on the issues of life expectancy and low birth weight children. Let us face the difficult task. We have failed badly in this area; we are going backwards instead of forwards. There are some manageable, achievable, short-term things we can do and there are some long-term goals we need to set because this is a crisis in our country that we cannot allow to continue. the 2005-06 federal budget. This budget, like the nine before delivered by the Treasurer, continues this government’s commitment to ensuring Australia has a strong future. I take this opportunity to congratulate the Treasurer on another excellent budget and on his contribution to the future of our great nation. This budget will secure the future for our children, as well as provide real assistance for all Australians right now. The responsible economic management of this government has seen $90 billion of Labor’s $96 billion government debt repaid, which, I might add, saves us $5.5 billion in interest per year. Inflation has been halved, our interest rates have reduced and we have the lowest unemployment rate in 28 years. This budget also delivers some very important benefits for Australians right now. The personal tax cuts for all Australians appear to be the issue that is causing the most controversy, with Labor Party members divided on this issue. They had their chance here in the House, only a week and a half ago, to say to the Australian taxpayers, ‘Yes, we will vote for tax cuts and make sure you will receive your increase in your take-home pay from 1 July.’ But, as we all know, they said no. They deliberately set out to cause uncertainty to the taxpayer and the Australia business community. Why? Because they wanted to implement their own policy, a $12-a-week tax cut. You may ask: what is wrong with that? The catch is they were deferring these tax cuts till 2008. Forgive me, but this sounds very much like an l-a-w policy. They want to wait until after the next election. Fair enough, they can wait. If they are elected-and it is a big if-then they can implement their policies. But, until then, the Howard government was elected to govern and to bring down responsible policies. I can assure the members opposite that the constituents of my electorate are hopping mad at the Labor Party’s delay tactics that may stop them from taking home more money in their pay packets now and not until 2008. They know, as well as I, that it would be expected that the opposition vote against tax increases. But not in your wildest imagination would you ever expect them to vote against taking home more money for our working Australians. I urge the opposition leader to make amends and advise the Labor Party in the Senate that he has made a mistake and that they should support the salary workers of Australia and pass this bill quite swiftly. I must congratulate our Treasurer, Peter Costello, on this package as it will provide $21.7 billion in tax cuts over four years and will ensure that 80 per cent of our taxpayers will not pay a marginal tax rate above 30 per cent. Labor is busy saying that these tax cuts are only for the wealthy. However, they are designed to ensure everybody receives benefits and to provide incentives to those who are paying the highest tax rates. As the Treasurer reminded us in the House today, the taxpayer receiving $65 a week tax cut is only receiving 20 per cent tax rebate while the receiver of the $6 a week tax cut is receiving a 50 per cent tax rebate.

185,Mrs Elson (Forde) (7.32 Pm),"I am very happy to be given this opportunity to speak onThe budget is about rewarding hard work and encouraging participation, which brings me to the new Welfare to Work program. The greatest thing you can do for the unemployed is to give them a job that gives them a feeling of self-worth and a chance to better themselves, earn an income and make plans for their future. They all deserve this. The welfare to work measures are not about forcing people who are not capable of working into the work force; they are about ensuring able-bodied people of working age are given the opportunity to gain skills in full-time or part-time work and about promoting a stronger culture of self-sufficiency. While it is clearly understood that people who are unable to find work deserve support from those who are working, those who are working should not have to support those who are capable of working and will not. On the other hand, I have spoken to many parents who have stayed home and raised their children only to find that when the children have grown up and moved out it is almost impossible to find a job because they have not been in the work force for around 20 years and therefore do not have the skills that employers are looking for. The welfare to work measures will assist workers with disabilities, with more than 20,000 new places under the disability employment assistance plan. The new employment preparation service will assist parents with a support service, including skill assessments and training, to help them back into the work force. I am also pleased that Work for the Dole programs will continue and may become compulsory for very long-term unemployed people. I have had the honour to be involved with many Work for the Dole programs in my electorate of Forde over the years and I am always amazed at the confidence of and the skills learnt by the participants, and their pride in the important work they contribute to our community groups. On a regular basis I have men and women approaching me and thanking the government for giving them the opportunity to prove themselves. I believe this is a step in the right direction to encourage participation in society and a contribution to our nation’s prosperity. Families are the cornerstone of our society and I am delighted that parents once again have been recognised for the important job that they continue to do every day by raising their children. Having raised eight children I know the many challenges faced by parents-not just financially. I am pleased to be part of a government that recognises the importance and the value of the efforts of parents and recognises that they are providing an enormous contribution to our nation’s future. The continuation of the $600 per child family tax benefit bonus I know will be welcomed by parents in Forde, and the increase of the income threshold at which the maximum rate of family tax benefit A is payable will provide 400,000 families with an extra $12 per week in higher benefits. Parents raising children certainly know of the importance of obtaining child care, so I know the extra 87,800 child-care places will be welcomed. The continuation of the 30 per cent child-care rebate will continue to ensure that the cost of child care remains affordable. I am also pleased that provisions have been made for grandparents to gain access to childcare benefits. I know of many grandparents in my electorate who are raising their grandchildren alone. They thank this government for listening to their concerns and reacting in this positive manner. I am sure this support will help make things a little easier for them. I would like to congratulate them on their commitment to their grandchildren. At a time in their lives MAIN COMMITTEE when they should be taking things a bit easier they have committed to do the best thing for their family and forgo their retirement plans to ensure that their grandchildren have a stable and secure family life. As I stated earlier, unemployment is at its lowest rate in 28 years at just 5.1 per cent, so it is essential that investment be made in higher skill levels to ensure that employers are able to obtain the skilled labour they need for the future. This budget delivers 4,500 prevocational places for people wanting to pursue a trade career, and a further 7,000 school based new apprenticeships. These school based apprenticeships will encourage young people to stay at school and finish their education, and will give students a definite career path along with experience training in a trade. This program gives them choices while they are continuing their education. This also builds on commitments made during the election for the establishment of 24 technical colleges and extending Youth Allowance, Austudy and Abstudy for over-25s for apprenticeships. Three of my sons are tradesmen and I am proud of their profession and the pride they have in their work. I believe it is important that we present trades as a real option for our young people who may not be university minded. By encouraging them to be involved while still at school, we will be successful in boosting the skilled labour in Australia. This budget also recognises our ageing population. Because of our strong economic management, the Howard government are able to invest $45 billion in health and aged care this year. I am also pleased that importance has been placed on early intervention, additional care services and care training to improve the quality of life of people suffering from dementia. I also welcome the $196 million that is being invested in cancer-screening programs. These are two diseases that affect the daily lives of so many families in our communities. It is a step in the right direction to put programs in place to increase awareness and support patient, family and carers. This budget also recognises the valuable role filled by our carers, by continuing the $1,000 bonus for carer payment recipients and the $600 bonus for those receiving carer allowance. As I have said, this is a budget about preparing for the future, and this government has taken seriously its commitment to do that by setting up a Future Fund. It is anticipated that the number of people over 65 will double in the next 40 years. This will cause enormous pressure on those in the work force who will be relied upon to provide pensions, aged care and health payments. The Future Fund is being set up so that future generations will not have to pay liabilities incurred by our generation. The fund will be the first of its kind and will be independently managed to ensure that future governments will not be able to squander the money. It is pleasing to see a government not just worried about what is happening now but also concerned about how we are going to afford to pay for things in the future. I commend the Treasurer on this initiative. Once again, this is only possible through the sound economic management that the coalition has displayed over the past nine years. This budget also brought down many other significant changes, but I do not have sufficient time today to speak about them all. Briefly, though, I welcome the improvements for small businesses, including the removal of the three per cent tariff applying to business imports; the renewing of funds for small business programs, including small business assistance programs, small business monitoring programs and the succession program; and the recently launched Business Entry Point web site-a great asset for any person wanting to start a business. There MAIN COMMITTEE is increased funding for the Defence Force, up from $10.6 billion in 1995-96 to $17.5 billion in 2005-06. I also welcome the $86.2 million upgrade of the Canungra Land Warfare Centre in my electorate. Through the budget, the government are ensuring our health programs are sustainable, rather than leaving the burden for future generations. We are boosting our national security funding, continuing to deliver on the comprehensive AusLink land transport program and protecting our environment by providing $200 million over five years in community water grants, $40 million towards the National Weeds Strategy, $43 million to combat illegal fishing in northern Australian waters and $24 million to eradicate the red fire ant. I am very honoured to stand here today as a member of the government. Having balanced the budget, we have been able to deliver real practical benefits to Australia like tax cuts, increased family benefits and child-care places, better aged care, more apprenticeships, the Future Fund-the list goes on. These benefits are real and, whilst providing for the future, they are also helping to make a real difference in the lives of ordinary Australians today. I am pleased to commend these appropriation bills to the House. Ms BIRD (Cunningham) (7.44 pm)-I hope that the previous speaker knew that you get 20 minutes to speak on this, so if she had wanted to extend her comments there was plenty of opportunity to do so. Budgets are clearly an indication of a government’s priority. It is the one piece of legislation that comes before us each year where we see, laid out, how the government view the future of the country and how they intend to try to advance that over the subsequent 12 months. I have been in this House for eight months and I have found it particularly interesting to observe what I thought was a schizophrenic characteristic of this government. It appeared that the messages were very mixed, and this budget seems to reinforce that. I thought this was a pro family government. Listening to the rhetoric and seeing some of the policy positions the government have put in place, such as family tax benefits, it seemed that this was a government who said, ‘We value people being at home and bringing up their kids; indeed, that is something that governments should support as an investment in our future.’ ThenI heard the budget speech and I realised that that does not apply to single mothers. If you are a single mother and your child turns six, you are no longer making a valuable contribution to society; indeed, you should be back in the work force. I found the two messages rather conflicting. A similar sort of thing could be seen in the government’s commitment to choice. I thought this was a government who sincerely believed in choice and believed that people should be freed of the shackles of impositions which denied them the opportunity to make decisions and to be self-determining in how they take their lives forward. Indeed, much of the rhetoric around industrial relations and so forth has been about giving people real choice-except, of course, if you want to make the choice, as a small business, to be represented by a trade union organisation. Again, I thought that was a slightly schizophrenic position for the government to be putting forward-unless you had two potential leaders, which could perhaps be contributing to that schizophrenic tendency. However, when you look in all seriousness at this budget you will see a government that is about picking winners that suit its perception of how people should live their lives. What this government does is the most extensive and blatant social engineering that we have seen for an awfully long time. I find that a particularly interesting development, given that we have had a MAIN COMMITTEE good many decades of conservative party criticism of the Labor Party and progressive parties for being social engineers. It seems to me that this particular government takes the cake for achieving the greatest capacity to socially engineer the lives of families, communities and individuals in this country. The government has made a great deal-as did the former speaker-of the fact that it is proposing tax cuts and an extension of family tax benefits. All of this, as the Treasurer and the Prime Minister have said consistently in the House, is about the fact that they are the best friends of whoever you want to name, but particularly of workers and lower and middle income earners in Australia. Budgets are not just about figures and rhetoric. If you talk to people out there in the community about how they feel about their financial positions, you find that it is not all smiles; it is not all wine and roses. In fact, the vast majority of families will tell you that they feel as if they are barely keeping their heads above water. Despite all the claims that the government make about increased wages and the wonders of the family tax benefit scheme, families still feel under enormous financial pressure and they still feel that they can barely cover their living expenses. Indeed, that is reflected in the fact that we now have one of the highest rates of credit card debt we have ever seen and one of the lowest levels of household savings that we have seen for a long time. Indeed, we have a real problem with the level of consumption driving inflation in the economy. The reality for many families-and this is something that I spoke about in my first speech in this place-is that they are balancing one form of credit with another. In many areas the cost of housing has skyrocketed over the last 10 years. Whilst that gives a level of wealth investment for those who own a home, for those who are entering the market the loss of housing affordability has become a real burden. For young families the capacity to service a mortgage is a serious issue. Quite often they finance their other costs of living on the credit card. That is a very concerning issue which we should all be coming to terms with. What it means is that, when you go through the large new housing estates in suburbs throughout my electorate-and indeed the electorate of my colleague the member for Throsby-you see mansions built by people because they could access credit. Within two years you see a ‘for sale’ sign going up. This is happening because families are accessing credit to the point where they are under pressure. They are then having to finance their lifestyle on credit cards, with the resultant increase in financial pressure. I would suggest to the government that while they are enjoying the claims of their tremendous achievements they are also sensitive to the fact that there are an awful lot of people in lower and middle-income Australia who do not believe that they have never been better off financially and will not reflect that when you ask them how they are coping. Much of that is driven by the fact that the cost of living has increased so significantly for them. One of the most extensive responses that I have had to any discussion in my electorate in the six months of this year was on the issue of private health insurance costs. The government said to people when it brought in its Lifetime Health Cover: ‘Yes, there is a stick in this. You have to join private health insurance, but it’s really not going to be that difficult to deal with because forcing all the people over the age of 30 into some sort of private health insurance will, by sheer numbers, ensure that the cost of the premiums will come down.’ That was four years ago. Not once have we seen a decrease in the cost of premiums. When I was critical in the local media about this and about the fact that I think it is one of the biggest con jobs we MAIN COMMITTEE have ever seen, I was inundated with people ringing me to complain about the fact that, while the health minister had approved an average eight per cent increase in private health insurance premiums, most people had seen a 14 to 22 per cent increase. When I asked them what effect this had on their decision making, the majority-maybe 60 to 70 per cent-said to me directly that they were now considering letting their private health insurance go. It had reached the point where they could no longer afford to service the premiums on a fortnightly or monthly basis. That is the reality of the costs of living for many people in our communities. In my electorate we have the largest commuter corridor in Australia. There are 16,000 people travelling from Wollongong and surrounds to Sydney every day for work. Many of them use the train, but the vast bulk of them drive. I can tell you that they are pretty upset about petrol prices cutting into the family budget. There is also the impact of the GST, particularly on services. I hear people say: ‘When I take my car down to be serviced I now pay 10 per cent on the labour. That is something I never had to do before.’ When you add the cumulative effect of all of these cost of living increases, you find that people do not feel like things have never been better-in fact, quite the opposite. People feel under pressure and financially squeezed. Why that matters to us as an economy is that people are not saving. When people are not saving it does not just make their individual and family futures less secure; it is not a good outcome for the nation. In terms of the tax legislation and Labor’s proposal, which is still before the Senate, we believe that the arrangements for tax cuts put forward by the government are incorrectly balanced. Quite simply, we do not feel that the government have got the mix right. In fact, the level of income tax cuts at the top end of the scale is overly generous and at the lower and middle points of the scale it could be more generous. As a result, we have put together an alternative tax package. We could argue the tactics of that within the opposition and with the government-indeed, many in the government would probably like to argue the tactics because it takes the issue of tax cuts away from the proposal that Labor have put forward. I know that the government feel that we are on a loser here, that we cannot get support for this proposal, that people just see it as not providing them with their tax cuts on 1 July and that we are playing around with tactics. Why? Because the reality is that, if you ask people, ‘Do you want $6 or $12?’, quite clearly they will go for the option of $12. If you ask people like us, who sit in this House, ‘Do you want $65 or $40?’ we will probably say that we want $65. In my electorate, the percentage of people who will be able to access the top level tax cuts and who will be better off under the government’s tax policy program than ours is 5.1 per cent. The other 95-odd per cent of people in my electorate would get a bigger tax cut under Labor’s proposal. The Daily Telegraph conducted a poll after running story after story and headline after headline criticising Labor’s position on tax. I do not remember seeing a single word in support of what we were putting forward in our alternative tax policy. When asked, ‘Should Labor oppose the government’s tax cuts?’, 52 per cent of people said, ‘Yes’. And that was after a concerted effort by the Daily Telegraph to ridicule and denigrate the package that we were putting forward. SoI would suggest to the government that, whilst it is easy to take cheap shots in this place, the vast bulk of people in the community would very much like to see a greater tax increase than the government is offering. Given that we are offering a bigger MAIN COMMITTEE tax cut to everybody earning up to $105,000, that would probably apply in most electorates, as in mine, to 90 to 95 per cent of the electorate. The other issue that I want to touch on in the budget priorities is the Welfare to Work program. I have already touched on that briefly in terms of the government picking and choosing winners. There are two areas that the government specifically talks about in its proposed reforms for welfare to work in this budget package. One area concerns single-parent payment recipients. The member for Forde made the comment earlier that many parents who stay at home while bringing up their kids and who wait until their kids are 16 or 18 before going back into the work force find that they have lost skills and that returning to work is very difficult. In many ways I would agree with that argument and I would certainly encourage women to seriously consider going back into the work force earlier, perhaps on a part-time basis, in order to maintain current skills in the work force. The reality is that the vast bulk of single parents do exactly that. If they have the opportunity to take up work that fits in with school requirements and is within a system where they are able to access child-care services, the vast bulk of single parents do take up work opportunities. Why do they do that? For all the reasons the rest of us do. They do so not only for financial security and career security to keep their skills up to date but also for the social interaction and the capacity to establish friendships and a broader support circle, which many of us rely on in our workplaces. In this place we probably get a slightly biased view of the nature of supportive workplaces. That is the reality for many single parents. Many parents are unable to access work, not because they do not want to do so but because they are not able to access appropriate work to support their role as a parent bringing up children by themselves. If the government wants to talk about incentive measures to support those people-and I notice there is an indication that more money will be put into child-care places-that is fine and good and I would support it entirely. I would also support the message to single parents to consider the importance of keeping their job skills up to date. But to then come out and say that those new people going onto the pension who have not done that will be punished when their children turn six is counterproductive. It is against the family-friendly policies the government claims it stands for. It is unnecessary. If there is a percentage of recalcitrant single parents who never want to go back to work, it is a very small percentage. The vast bulk of single parents certainly want to be in the work force. I think that the government’s proposal to put them onto this new form of Newstart, which will significantly decrease the family income, is not a productive way to go. In fact, to me it really smacks of the picking and choosing of winners that I referred to earlier. The government is deciding which families are worthy of support and which are not. It is a form of social engineering that leaves us for dead, to be honest. The other group that the government is talking about with its welfare to work reforms is disability support pensioners. The government makes the statement that people do not need to panic if they are already on this program because a grandfather clause is in place and it will only apply to new people coming into the system. I find that a fairly distasteful argument to put anyway. I think that saying to people: ‘Don’t worry. Look after yourself. You’re fine. You’ll be okay. Don’t worry about anybody else that might enter those circumstances,’ is distasteful in itself. It also seems to reflect a lack of understanding about the reality of disability MAIN COMMITTEE for many people. I have in mind a young woman that I have been dealing with who is on the DSP as a result of mental health issues. She is an architect. Because of her illness she can work for stretches of 12 or 18 months at a time before she experiences another episode that requires her to be out of the work force for perhaps two, three or four months. What concerns me is whether, when she goes back onto the payment because she is unable to work, she will come under the proposed new regime and its implications. Generally speaking, the disability support pension people that I have spoken to, people who come to my office, do not object to the concept of doing some work, but they live, by and large, on very narrow means; they barely make ends meet. I believe that supporting them into work with, again, a stick as well as a carrot approach was an unnecessary decision by the government. Certainly the carrots-the opportunities, the support and the training-are welcome, but I do not see why you need to get a stick out to these people and say that they are going to be in effect financially disadvantaged by going in and out of work, as would occur in these sorts of circumstances. I think the number of representations I have had from people with family tax debts will be well and truly overridden by people in our offices asking for some sort of help with understanding this new two-tier and more complex regime of welfare payments. I would anticipate that even government members are not going to find a great deal of joy in the long term as they deal with people coming into their offices. Finally, I want to touch on the growing inequality of income in our communities, which concerns me. It is something I mentioned briefly in my first speech. St Vincent de Paul recently released a report indicating that the income gap is growing worse in Australia; that people are relying on irregular, unreliable, casual, short-term work; that they find it harder to plan for the long term; and that they often suffer financially when one event goes wrong in the family in terms of income earning and they end up at St Vinnies’s door. Thank heavens that people like St Vinnies and the Salvos are there, but I think this budget will only contribute to a growing workload for those organisations rather than what was in effect a very great lost opportunity to invest in skills and infrastructure for the future. (Time expired) Ms PANOPOULOS (Indi) (8.05 pm)-I rise with great pleasure to speak on the appropriation bills. BeforeI address the bills in some depth it would be remiss of me not to comment on some of the quite bizarre statements by the member for Cunningham. She complained about people building huge mansions. One wonders what the Labor Party is proposing. The member for Cunningham talked about social engineering. How bizarre to criticise people over the size of the house they build. Perhaps the member for Cunningham proposes a particular tax on a certain size of house. Perhaps she can come up with a proposal to add to the lack of policies from her party that have any serious consideration in the community. The member for Cunningham also complained about the cost of living. Where has the member been? This government has delivered the trifecta of low inflation, low unemployment and low interest rates. Where was the member for Cunningham when housing interest rates reached 17 per cent and when business interest rates were over 20 per cent? Then there was the whinging about petrol prices. I do believe it was the Labor Party that indexed petrol excise and I do believe it was this government that ceased to index petrol excise. Perhaps the member for Cunningham has spent too long on the factional warfare of the Labor Party in New South Wales instead of brushing up on recent political history. Be that as it may. MAIN COMMITTEE As the internecine warfare unravels within the Labor Party about their response to the 2005-06 budget, it is worth pondering that this very day will go down in Australian political history as the day when the Labor Party-for a fleeting moment-made the Australian Greens and the Australian Democrats look responsible. Therefore, it is an absolute delight to be speaking on these appropriation bills on this momentous day. Imagine the forlorn sight on budget night within the Labor Party’s leadership team-all huddled together, all singing from the same hymn sheet in their absurd political strategy, which saw a modern, supposedly democratic political party oppose tax cuts for all Australian workers. There were a few dissenting voices, with the member for Franklin rightly questioning the wisdom of his party’s leadership team when he asked: ‘Why should we delay them getting the six bucks?’ The Premier of Western Australia even went as far as calling the tax cuts ‘excellent’. But if we go back a bit further, and not too far back, we find that the member for Lilley in his past role-before becoming a rooster-talked about tax cuts under a policy called rollback. Rollback involved a tax cut of about $1 for every Australian. The member for Lilley said, ‘If you are going to miss out on $4, that means a hell of a lot if you have a tight budget.’ He went further, saying that the coalition ‘do not understand what a dollar a week, $2 a week or $4 a week means to someone who is battling’. All of this makes the spectacle of the Australian Labor Party opposing a generous tax cut for seven million Australian workers quite absurd and, in the confused world of Labor Party policies, you have to wonder where it is all headed. Personal income tax thresholds at both the high and low end of the tax scales will be raised and additional assistance for low-income earners will be provided. It is this government over the last nine years that has reduced taxation for all Australian workers, particularly those on the lower income levels. Over this period workers on about $20,000 a year will have had a reduction in their taxation of over 30 per cent, with workers earning $10,000 receiving a tax cut of over 50 per cent over this government’s term in office. It is not only through tax cuts that the government has delivered real dollars into the hands of Australian families. About two million families receive family tax benefit part A, with a base rate for each child of over $1,600. Senior Australians will benefit through the raising of the threshold for the senior Australians tax offset, allowing them to keep more of their money before paying any tax. A particularly important initiative in these bills is the continuation and development of apprenticeships-more school based apprenticeships to further increase apprenticeships and the trade based work force. In my electorate of Indi, with a booming economy and an unemployment rate lower than the national average, this is particularly welcomed. When the Labor Party was last in government, there were 1,040 local apprenticeships. Now that figure is closer to 5,000 in my electorate. The Australian Education Union and the Labor Party are happy to talk down the new apprenticeships. They seem happy only when they are miserable. This opposition flies in the face of research that shows that more than 90 per cent of people who complete a new apprenticeship gain employment within three months of its completion, and yet the Labor Party still complains, still runs down New Apprenticeships and is apparently still living on past glory. It seems to say that, when the economy is going well and there are good figures and good results, that is the result of the Hawke-Keating government and MAIN COMMITTEE when things do not appear to be that good it seems to be the result of the Howard-AndersonCostello government. It can never seem to make its mind up. It has been quite fascinating over the last few weeks to listen to some of the members opposite as they seem to hark back, perhaps due to the political doldrums that they find themselves in, to the days of the Keating government. It was the member for Lilley who started reminiscing in an almost romantic manner about those particular days. We were told by the Labor Party in this chamber that we should hold up Mr Keating and remember and venerate his legacy. What was the legacy he left? The legacy he left was the recession we had to have. What was the legacy he left? It was the legacy of political correctness, where ordinary Australians, in a cafe or in a pub, felt restrained about what they could say about the society and the country they lived in. What was the legacy he left? It was the legacy of the snob, the epitome of the elite-most poignantly when he said, ‘If you’re not living in Sydney, you’re simply camping out.’ Apparently all my voters are just camping out, and all other Australians who do not live in Sydney are camping out. That is the legacy that they want us to uphold. It is a joke. It is time for the Labor Party to get real, in common parlance. It is time for the Labor Party to start being a serious opposition. It is what the Australian people deserve, and it is what this parliament deserves. I am pleased to be supporting the appropriation bills, particularly as they relate to my electorate. The budget provides over the next year $178 million for the construction of the $524 million Albury-Wodonga freeway and Bandiana link by 2007. I had the great honour to officially turn the first sod for this project last month. It is the single biggest road project in country Australia, with the Commonwealth contributing $518 million of the $524 million. It was a particular honour because there have been many people of vision who have persevered for over 40 years to have this major piece of infrastructure built on an iconic Australian highway. After 40 years, the money is there, the contract has been awarded and construction has commenced. The upgraded road will bypass 17 sets of traffic lights and five right-angle bends on the existing highway corridor. Even for those who do not live and work in country Victoria or southern New South Wales, it is a road of national importance which not only will be of benefit to the growing economic needs of local businesses but will assist with increasing traffic and transportation, particularly helping to relieve some of the traffic caused by the booming success of regional businesses. All of this has occurred despite the delays by and politicking of the Victorian government, whose recalcitrance in assisting with this project led to a significant increase in costs. Despite that, the Australian government remained steady and maintained their commitment to the completion of this project. Another very important program that has continued through this budget is the Regional Partnerships program. We have seen a lot of smarmy attacks by the Labor Party on this particular program, but I am delighted that the Regional Partnerships program will continue to be of benefit to the people of Indi. Only last week I met with local olive oil producers in Rutherglen to present to them a demonstration cheque for funding through the Regional Partnerships program. This grant was to assist the local olive oil production industry in north-east Victoria by giving it access to an olive oil pressing machine to ensure the long-term viability of this growing niche market in the region. Rutherglen is within the Indigo shire in my electorate. This shire contains two-thirds of the olive growers in my electorate. The 2005 north-east Victoria regional agribusiness profile report indicates that the rapidly expanding industry is leadMAIN COMMITTEE ing to an increasing number of olive farms that will contribute significantly to north-east Victoria’s agribusiness base. The value of olive oil production in the north-east of Victoria is calculated to grow by between $11 million and $14 ½ million, which is wonderful news for the region and me. Earlier last week I was in Euroa to present yet another demonstration cheque, this time to the Strathbogie Shire. This was a Regional Partnerships grant to assist its coordinated tourism and marketing strategy for the benefit of the Strathbogie area. In Springhurst earlier this month I met with Kevin McMahon and his team to present a Regional Partnerships funding grant to the fire brigade groups who are responsible for fire control in vast areas of irrigated horticulture and in sheep, beef and wheat farming areas. The vehicle funded will also have flow-on benefits, enabling brigade members to attend meetings and fire prevention activities, including educational activities to help people better prepare for the unfortunate event of fire-an occurrence that the people of Indi are unfortunately all too familiar with. All these recent announcements-and there have been many others over the three years that I have been the member for Indi-point to the fact that the Regional Partnerships program is doing remarkable things in rural and regional areas. It is kicking goals in the communities that make the most of-and stretch every single dollar that is contained in-these grants. That is why it is important to remember what the Leader of the Opposition says about Regional Partnerships grants. He wants to get rid of them; he wants to get rid of the program. People in my electorate have begged me to keep it. They have said: ‘Sophie, this is an extremely important program. We cannot use other grants to have the flexibility to be able to get the sorts of machinery and facilities that we actually need. Please ensure that the government continues with this program.’ But the Leader of the Opposition wants to do a roll-back on it. Earlier this year the Leader of the Opposition said, ‘The program’s got to go; we are going to fight like blazes between now and the budget to force them to cancel the program.’ He is not alone. The member for Wills, which electorate is in suburban Melbourne, harangues the supposed ‘maladministration’ of the Regional Partnerships program. The member for Throsby, which electorate is in suburban Sydney, talks of the ‘scandal’ of the program that she claims is full of ‘rorts’ whilst the member for Denison sums up Regional Partnerships grants as a ‘disgrace of public administration’. I would invite all of them to come and meet the dozens of recipient organisations in my electorate who have benefited from Regional Partnerships grants and-even more-to speak to the communities who have benefited from these grants. Perhaps they share the feeling about Australia that their glorified former leader had-that if you do not live in Sydney you are camping out. With all of this disparaging talk it is little wonder that the Australian people entrust the Australian Labor Party with just four rural electorates in Australia. People in rural and regional Australia may not be trendy sorts and may not be politically correct, but they are independent thinkers. They can see a pup when it stares them in the face-and let me tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, they see this opposition and this opposition leader for the big sulking pups that they are. One other aspect that particularly affects those of us who live in rural and regional Australia is the environment. Unfortunately, weeds and feral animals play a significant role in destroying our natural environment. If the Victorian government were a private land-holder they would be sued for millions of dollars over their incompetent management of Crown land. MAIN COMMITTEE Weeds and feral animals are the greatest threat to the natural environment in Victoria. The state government’s negligent management led to a tremendous build-up of fuel that provided additional fuel for the disastrous fires of 2003 that burnt over 900 million hectares in my electorate, including significant areas of the Alpine National Park. They had the opportunity to right a wrong and start all over again after the fires had stopped, but all we see is an extraordinary attack on those who care for the natural environment in rural Victoria-the mountain cattlemen. All we see is an attack on those bush users who actually look after the natural environment. All we see is an attack on rural land owners who try to look after their neighbour’s property-namely, the Victorian government’s property-as best they can. They get penalised. The responsibility for weeds particularly and the management of Crown land is squarely that of the Victorian government in my state, but the Commonwealth is coming to the party and this budget does contain $40 million as part of a national weed strategy for the eradication of Australia’s most threatening and invasive weeds. Funds from this strategy will be used for research, biological control and community awareness. I hope-we can be positive-that there may perhaps be a light at the end of the tunnel or on top of the hill or wherever it is, but a light nonetheless, that the Victorian government sees and acts to match the federal government’s commitment to this extraordinary problem that only private land-holders seem to be tackling at the moment in Victoria. I hope they see that the real environmental threats and disasters arise from inadequate control of feral animals and almost no control of weeds. There is much to commend in the appropriation bills. There is continued and extended recognition for carers-those unsung heroes in our society that deserve extra recognition. Those who receive carer payments and carer allowances will receive $1,000 and $600 respectively. There is a massive increase for child care, which is a great relief to many in my electorate. There are massive increases in out of school hours child-care and family day care places. One pleasing development in child-care provision in the north-east of Victoria in my electorate was the announcement recently that Euroa had been selected for one of the 13 long day care centres established under the Australian government’s long day care initiative scheme. Euroa is one of only 13 new day care places to be established in Australia in this round, and I congratulate the new service-just little people-for their success in making this project a reality. Of course there is additional funding for aged care. My electorate was a beneficiary recently of a $1 million capital grant to Westmont Aged Care Services in Wodonga, which also received an additional 25 residential aged care beds. (Time expired) thought I would start my contribution by reminding the House of an article in the Blacktown City Sun. It concerns Valentia Gythalovesa, a 16-year-old student from Blacktown Girls High School, who unfortunately has been in detention at Villawood Detention Centre since 7 March this year. I am pleased to say that Bernie David, a Blacktown solicitor, is representing this student pro bono. I commend him because he also represented Sylvester Aben, a student from Rooty Hill High School, who was also in detention at Villawood Detention Centre. I am pleased to say that the students at Rooty Hill High galvanised me into action in trying to get him released from the detention centre. I went out to visit Sylvester and his mother who, although they are in detention, actually came to Australia legally. They were not illegals in Australia when they first came here. Sylvester is a 14-year-old student and, I have to say, a great MAIN COMMITTEE",167,Appropriation Bill No 2 2005 2006 Appropriation Parliamentary Departments Bill No 1 2005 2006 Appropriation Bill No 5 2004 2005 Appropriation Bill No 6 2004 2005
186,Mr Price (Chifley) (8.25 Pm),"I am pleased to speak in this appropriations debate, and Iguy. He has spent 10 of his 14 years in Australia. He is more Australian than Filipino. For all the cultural connection he has with the Philippines, which is his country of birth, you may as well send him to Saudi Arabia. I am absolutely delighted that we were successful in getting Sylvester out of Villawood Detention Centre. It is a horrible detention centre. I have been there a couple of times. The irony, though is that, because he has been in the detention centre for some months, he has been charged an accommodation charge which needs to be paid prior to his status being sorted out. There are some unanswered questions in this case. He and his family-his mum and dadcame here legally. His father was undertaking studies. He completed those studies and eventually returned to the Philippines with a view to lodging appropriate papers for the family. Those papers were never lodged. He is actually working on a contract in PNG for the Australian government. The point I am making is that Sylvester is as Australian as my children are. All his values, all his mates and all his norms are Australian. Not only am I pleased that he is out of Villawood Detention Centre but also I am grateful for the ongoing representation Bernie David provides. I regret that my colleague the honourable member for Greenway has not met with the same success with Valentia. But I do hope, in a most genuine way, that she is successful in getting her out of detention and that she speaks up in the party caucus room and in any subsequent debate in the House for a more humane system that does not have young children and teenagers locked up in detention when we know their health and security do not require it. I look forward to hearing from the honourable member for Greenway. Having wished her success in the quest to get Valentia out, I hope that she might be so moved as to question her government’s approach. One thing that the member for Greenway and I share, in the Blacktown LGA, is the largest Filipino population in Australia. I am inordinately proud of that fact. They are wonderful people. They make great Australian citizens and are such diligent workers. But I have to say that amongst the more elderly Filipinos there has been great concern and consternation caused by the detention of Australian citizens-that is, people who have come to this country, become permanent residents and become Australian citizens but who then get locked up by the department in detention centres and, in the case of Solon Alvarez, are actually deported from Australia. Many of the elderly Filipinos who first came here were in fact refugees from a very corrupt Marcos regime. Indeed, Bernie David himself, as a human rights advocate in the Philippines, was locked up under the Marcos regime. These elderly Filipinos do not understand how it is possible for Australian citizens to be locked up in detention centres when, as in the case of Solon Alvarez, not only did the Department of Foreign Affairs know that she was an Australian citizen but in fact so did the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. What sort of a country is Australia where we have a department that locks up Australian citizens in detention centres-in some cases, as we know, both in the Solon Alvarez case and in the case of Cornelia Rau, where they are suffering severe mental illness? What sort of a country is it where we give the head of the department a gong-for locking up Australian people in detention centres and, in the case of Solon Alvarez, an Australian citizen originally from the Philippines, actually deporting them? MAIN COMMITTEE We know-it is on the public record-that there are 200 other cases that are subject to an inquiry. And we know that Mr Palmer, charged with inquiring into them, does not have the resources or the time to make any recommendations. Mr Deputy Speaker Baldwin, I do not apologise to you and I do not apologise to government members when I say that I think this is absolutely outrageous. We need to get to the bottom of it. We need to have a transparent, open process that fully examines all these cases. I hope that, at the end of it, it will not be the case that we give gongs to more individuals in the department of immigration as a result of their handling of these things. I would hope that there will be no officer who is accountable and responsible for these 200 cases, as well as the two that I have mentioned, who gets a promotion as a result of it-and we know that that is the form of this government. But I say to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and to all other honourable members: there are elderly Filipinos in my community who are genuinely perplexed, genuinely concerned. And, I might say, there is a level of fear that if it can happen to Cornelia Rau, if it can happen to Solon Alvarez, then perhaps it can happen to them. I think we need to treat this seriously. I think we need to get to the bottom of it. I sincerely believe that we need to have the royal commission that Laurie Ferguson, the shadow minister, has called for. We need to have an inquiry with power, transparency and authority to get to the very bottom of it. In the same edition of the Blacktown Sun, I was reminded of a quote that I made one week after being elected in 1991. I will read it to you-and please forgive me for indulging myself. It said: Chifley MP Roger Price, in his job for less than one week, said his major priority was a public senior high school in Mt Druitt. “BeforeI finish, it’s the one goal I want to achieve,” he said. At that stage, of course, I was always very proud that I had been part of a campaign to have the first ever public senior high school established in my electorate. That was St Marys Senior High School, and what an outstanding institution that is. It actually attracts students from private schools to do years 11 and 12 and has outstanding results academically as well as for those who want to go into the world of work. I am also pleased to say to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that we did get that senior high school for Mount Druitt: it is Chifley senior high school. It has the best senior campus, I think, in Australia and, although it is only about three years old, I think it is going to make a significant contribution to developing the potential of young people. I have got a terrific crop of young people in my electorate. I believe they are going to benefit from it inordinately. WhilstI am on that subject, there are some differences between the government and the opposition in relation to training. We believe that one of the most important things you can do for the country is to develop the skills of our Australian citizens, not only those who are already in work but also those who are out of work and in particular our young people. I am pleased to say that I am interested in having more school based apprenticeships. Already the Labor Party have said that we want to encourage more people to complete apprenticeships by offering them a completion allowance: $1,000 in the middle of their apprenticeship and $1,000 upon its completion. In relation to school based apprenticeships-and I am sure the honourable member for Kingsford Smith will agree with me-question time after question time we get lectured about our lack of interest in it. Well, I must say the federal government provides only 20 school based apprenticeships for my electorate and it is not dissimilar in surrounding electorates. In Western Sydney we have a disproportionately high number MAIN COMMITTEE of people who see the world of work and TAFE as a way of enhancing their skills. It works out to be not much more than one apprenticeship per high school. I think you would agree, Mr Deputy Speaker, that that is a pretty poor performance. On Friday, I will be having a meeting in my office and I have invited a variety of people to that meeting with a view to exploring how we can increase the number of school based apprenticeships in my electorate. Talking about being lectured to, one of the other refrains of the government is that Australian interest rates are historically low. That is true; they are historically low. But what the government never says is that Australia’s interest rates are amongst the highest in the developed world. In fact, we have the second highest interest rates in the developed world. I have a chart here, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I am happy to table that for the convenience of honourable members. I seek leave to table the chart. Leave granted. above seven per cent, they are much higher than in the UK, the US, Canada, Germany, Sweden, Greece, Austria, France, Italy, Portugal, Ireland, Belgium, Spain, Finland, the Netherlands and Japan, all of which have lower interest rates. When the government talks about interest rates under Labor being 17 per cent, that is true. But what is not said is that the percentage of the mortgage in terms of people’s earnings was even smaller then, even under a 17 per cent rate, than it is today. But we all know we are never going to return to the interest rates at that level and that is a good thing. I must say that during the last election campaign it was the case that many people, listening to the government’s rhetoric, expected there would be low interest rates and no rate increase. Even though there has been a very modest rate increase of 0.25 per cent, it has hurt a lot of people. It has hurt a lot of people in my electorate because they are battlers and they are so proud to get into their homes but even a small increase, given the prices that people pay for homes today, hurts. The Reserve Bank was speculating about the need to increase interest rates by a further quarter of a per cent. That would have hurt new home buyers even more. It is interesting to speculate-and I guess that is all we can do-that interest rates are going to rise in the future, but by how much? I also want to mention in this debate on the appropriation bills some of the issues that are of concern particularly in terms of our trade performance. Although the Prime Minister, as we heard today, says that our trade performance is impressive, when you look at the record there are areas for concern. We have at the moment Australia’s largest ever current account deficit-$15.4 billion for the March quarter, more than seven per cent of GDP. That is a quite alarming figure. We have had a record 42 monthly trade deficits in a row-I repeat: a record 42 monthly trade deficits in a row. We have had four years in a row of net exports detracting from economic growth, not adding to but detracting. There has been flat-lining of export volume since 2001 and an export growth rate of 5.3 per cent-that sounds pretty healthy but it is less than half of Labor’s export growth at 10.8 per cent. The performance on manufactured exports was even weaker. It was 3.7 per cent under the Howard government compared to 13.7 per cent achieved under Labor. Who will ever forget the debt trucks in 1996? What we are told in question time is that we should not worry about debt because government debt has been substantially reduced. That is true; I do not argue it. But the truth is that we have a record foreign debt of $425 billion. Mr MAIN COMMITTEE",178,Appropriation Bill No 2 2005 2006 Appropriation Parliamentary Departments Bill No 1 2005 2006 Appropriation Bill No 5 2004 2005 Appropriation Bill No 6 2004 2005
187,Mr Price,"It shows quite clearly that, with our interest rates in Australia at slightlyDeputy Speaker, if you want to translate that into what it means in your electorate, my electorate, that of the member for Melbourne Ports or that of the member for Kingsford Smith, it means that for every man, woman and child Australia owes $21,056.

But what she says is: ‘It doesn’t matter.’ Mrs Gash interjectingGilmore is making. I have a regard for the honourable member for Gilmore. that direction. He will get on with his speech. lion is okay? It is private debt. We have to service that debt as a nation and it costs us $20 billion. In other words, it is 20 parliament houses every year. We have to find the money that it took to construct this Parliament House 20 times every year and it is growing at an extraordinary rate every month. There were other matters that I wanted to raise-for example, the fact that Blacktown council mayor Leo Kelly is very concerned that, notwithstanding the fact that the council runs 22 child-care centres, not one dollar has been announced to assist them. (Time expired) budget. The first is that it rewards government supporters; the second is that it punishes social groups which the government sees as expendable; and the third is that it neglects Australia’s future economic and social needs. In other words, it is a self-indulgent, vindictive and complacent budget. Let me look first at the government’s tax changes. Many speakers in this debate have drawn attention to the fundamental unfairness of a budget which gives the biggest cuts in taxation to those on sixor seven-figure incomes while tossing $6 a week to those on lower and middle incomes-to the seven million Australians who do most of the work in this country. This is a prize example of the government using a post-election budget to hand out rewards to its own supporters and friends in the hope that, by 2007, the majority of taxpayers who have been shafted by this budget will have forgotten about it. I represent a relatively wealthy electorate by per capita income, and many of the people in my electorate will get the full tax cut from this budget. I know a lot of them. They are successful people in business and the professions. I have no problem with wealth or success. Many of them are my supporters. I know that most of them-even the wealthiest of themrecognise that a country’s taxation system ought to be based on fairness and that, at a time when profits are high, dividends are high and businesses are doing well, the government ought to be ensuring that the benefits of all this prosperity flow through to all Australians and are not reserved for those at the top of the tax table.

193,Mr Danby (Melbourne Ports) (8.45 Pm),"There are three things that distinguish thiseconomic system are smart enough to know that capitalism works best when everyone shares in the growth and prosperity that it generates. IfI might digress into theory for a minute, this is the difference between laissez-faire conservatism, doctrinaire socialism and social democracy. The conservative says, ‘Let’s rig the system so that we and our friends get richer, and everyone else can go hang.’ The doctrinaire socialist says, ‘Let’s punish the successful through a confiscatory taxation scheme so that everyone is equally poor.’ The social democrat rejects both of these approaches. The social democrat recognises that only the free market system can generate wealth, but argues that it does so most effectively when wealth is equitably distributed-not equally distributed but equitable distributed, fairly distributed, so that everyone has a stake in the success of the free market. The principal instrument for achieving equity is the tax system. This government has consistently used the tax system to build more and more inequity into Australian society. This is a dangerous game because it jeopardises the social consensus in favour of the free market system, something the Hawke and Keating governments in their pro-market reforms of the 1980s were careful to maintain. That is why I support the alternative tax proposals of my friend the honourable member for Lilley which provide genuine tax reform within a framework of overall equity. Whilst some people in my electorate will benefit from this budget’s tax changes, there are also a lot of people in Melbourne Ports who will miss out on its benefits. I am not at the moment talking about the poor, the disabled, the single parents or the unemployed. I am talking about the mass of employees-those on incomes in the order of $50,000 a year-who are paying the great bulk of tax revenue flowing into the government’s coffers and funding government largesse for its friends and supporters. In my electorate, as in most urban electorates, these are the great majority-the responsible, hard working families who expect a reasonable share of the prosperity which their labour has created. These families have now learned that their share is to be $6 a week. They are not impressed. Even the Daily Telegraph, in an article today, revealed that a lot of people who had been told that this was a workers budget were not impressed. And who can blame them? At the same time as it rewards those who are already doing well, this government-this budget-has continued its usual practice of penalising those who are not doing well and adding to their burdens. This year it is single parents and the disabled who will be required to meet a tougher work test in order to qualify for their benefits. I am all in favour of encouraging people to work when they are able to, but this budget does not address the real challenges that these people face getting back into the work force, as many of them would like to do if they were able to. Instead, the government intends shifting a large number of people from the parenting payment or the disability pension onto Newstart. As the member for Sydney has pointed out, people on Newstart lose 60c in the dollar for every dollar they earn instead of the 40c they lose on the parenting payment and the disability support pension. This budget thus actually discourages people from moving from welfare to work. In its nine years in office this government has done almost nothing to address this welfare to work interface. Even more astonishing is the budget’s attempt to force single mothers into the work force by imposing a tougher work test on them while doing almost nothing to tackle the single greatest disincentive for women with children who want to re-enter the work force-the lack MAIN COMMITTEE of appropriate and affordable child care. One of the reasons women leave the work force is because it is almost impossible to find child care for children under the age of five. There is an acute child-care shortage in many areas of Australia, particularly in inner city areas such as my electorate, where all the child-care facilities traditionally run by the churches are being closed as the churches choose to reallocate their resources to outer suburban areas and where the very high cost of real estate is a serious disincentive to anyone wanting to build a new child-care centre. At present in my electorate, which runs from Melbourne to St Kilda, approximately 1,300 child-care places are required in the City of Port Phillip alone. The area has a waiting list with approximately 1,600 children on it, a figure which has increased by 41 per cent since May 2004. A few months ago I spoke to a rally of angry Port Melbourne parents protesting the lack of affordable child care. Their anger had been brought to a head by the imminent closure of the Scott Street Presbyterian kindergarten in Elwood, where I went as a child many years ago, and St Bede’s Anglican Early Learning Centre. I have worked very hard to see that there are alternatives to those two child-care centres, but even if we are successful they simply replace the number of places; they do not expand them. I do not blame the churches for rationalising their resources in this way. I do blame the federal government, which until now has persistently denied there is a child-care crisis. Now they are proposing to make the situation worse by pushing more women with young children off parenting benefit and into the work force. The government’s solution is to announce funding for 84,300 new out of school hours child-care places in this budget. As the relevant shadow minister, the honourable member for Sydney, has said: ‘We will believe this when we see it. We were promised 40,000 new child-care places in the 2004 budget. We now learn that those places have not even been allocated yet, let alone actually provided to parents.’ The majority of places created this year will not come online until 2008. Half of the funding for these places is not available until 2008-09, but the proposed changes to the parenting benefit come into effect in 2006. So there is a gap of at least two years and probably longer between the extra demand created by the government’s welfare changes and the supposedly new supply to meet that demand. Furthermore, because of this government’s aversion to anything which looks like planning, there is no guarantee that these new child-care places will go to the parents who need them most-those who are being pushed off the parenting benefit by this budget. In fact many of them will go to the more than 30,000 children already on waiting lists, and others will go to affluent parents rather than to those low-income parents who need them the most. In any case, the real crisis is in the provision of long day care, and this budget does nothing about that at all. There are 174,500 children missing out on the child care which would allow their parents to re-enter the work force. It is a real scandal that not a dollar has been allocated in this budget to long day care. As a result, many parents with young children will be unable to return to work, no matter how much they want to, because of the critical shortages in long day care. We have asked for assurances that single parents will not be kicked off the parenting benefit if they are unable to accept a job offer because of the unavailability of child care or because they cannot afford private child-care services. We have received no such assurances, Mr Deputy Speaker, as you know. IfI were a suspicious person, I might conclude that this was all designed to force more people into the arms of the private child-care sector. The bigMAIN COMMITTEE gest operator, Mr Eddie Groves, is now a well-known friend of the former president of the Liberal Party in Victoria, who in fact sold him ABC Childcare, and he is a generous donor to the Liberal Party. I am sure that these kinds of considerations never entered into anything, with ABC Childcare owning 23 per cent of all private child care in Australia now! What do we find when we read the small print of the budget? We find that the government are reducing access to the Jobs, Education and Training program, an excellent program established by the Labor government, which provides child care for people who are undertaking training-the very people the government say they want to encourage. The budget excludes from the JET child-care scheme people whose courses take longer than a year-and many courses do take longer. This is typical of this government’s slapdash, laissez faire attitude to skills and training. There are currently 1.3 million people on either disability benefit or parenting payment. They are the people the government say they want to move from welfare to work, yet this budget creates only 7,600 new vocational training places for disability support pension recipients. At the same time, the government are proposing to abolish the Australian National Training Authority, one of the most successful programs of the Keating government, apparently purely for reasons of ideology. ANTA is a cooperative venture between the Commonwealth government and the states, and it gets in the way of the desire of the Minister for Education, Science and Training to run everything himself. So it has to go, despite the excellent work it has done in the very area the government claim is a high priority. Overall, the training measures in this budget are manifestly inadequate. Moving people from welfare to work is a desirable objective but this budget makes no more than a token contribution to that objective. This budget leaves it open to suspicion that the government’s real objective is cutting costs and benefits so that more money is available to hand out to their supporters. I also want to say something about schools funding. During last year’s election campaign, the minister for education came to the electorate of Melbourne Ports and tried to scare parents, particularly in one section of non-government schools in my electorate-the poorer parochial Jewish schools-by telling them that a Labor government would cut funding to their schools. That was untrue. Under the funding formula announced by Labor none of the schools in Melbourne Ports would have lost its funding. Their funding was guaranteed. But the minister’s claim was mainly designed to divert attention from the real scandal in school funding in my electorate. During the 2001 election campaign, the then minister, Dr Kemp, came to East St Kilda and promised to review the SES funding formula which grades schools according to the socioeconomic status of the postcode areas in which the parents live. This formula was designed to channel more money to schools like Geelong Grammar, which has many wealthy parents living in non-wealthy rural areas. It has the consequence-if I were charitable I would assume it was an unintended consequence-of disadvantaging poorer parochial Jewish schools, particularly orthodox schools in my electorate, which have mostly non-wealthy parents, many with large families, living in relatively wealthy postcodes such as Caulfield. Dr Kemp came and saw for himself the disadvantaged circumstances under which some of these schools operate, even though they are classed as wealthy schools because of the postcode area in which the students live. The parents of the children who attend these schools live MAIN COMMITTEE in those areas for religious reasons: they have to live in close proximity to synagogues, to which they walk on the weekend, and it is impractical to live further afield. Dr Kemp did nothing. Nothing has been done by his successor, the current minister. For all their promises just before election time, and for all their rhetoric, nothing has been done about this situation in the budget. The parents in Melbourne Ports are still waiting for this government to keep a promise which they made four years ago. How much longer do they have to wait? I said at the start of my remarks that this is a complacent, self-indulgent, vindictive budget. This budget rewards the government’s friends while punishing those the government do not care about, such as mothers waiting for child care in Elwood and St Kilda. It is a complacent budget because it ignores the looming skills crisis and the looming infrastructure crisis, both of which the government have been warned about many times and which have the potential to derail our strong economy and the sustained growth, which were created by the reforms of the Hawke and Keating governments and on which the government have coasted along, benefiting from them, for nine years. Australia’s future prosperity depends on developing a world-class infrastructure and a highly trained and educated work force as well as a tax system which gives people incentives to improve their skills and get into the work force. This budget ignores the priorities, concentrating on short-term gratification. It is the budget of a government which has grown complacent, arrogant and lazy-a government which has been in power too long. I endorse the concerns of the member for Chifley. Given that, as the Leader of the Opposition has said, Australia’s credit card is nearly ‘maxed out’, with over $400 billion in foreign debt, or seven per cent of GDP, it particularly concerns me that, some time soon, when American interest rates increase, foreign investors will see Australia’s very large foreign debt overhang and will demand big increases in Australian interest rates. They could start to pull out of the Australian economy. As the member for Chifley said, one of the most frightening things about the current economic situation is that, even though interest rates are at 5.5 per cent, more than 30 per cent of the average person’s disposable income is spent on mortgage and credit card debt, the same level as when interest rates were at their highest during the recession of the early nineties. Imagine the effect on ordinary people if there were just a small increase in interest rates. With that $400 million foreign debt overhang, we have to maintain a positive differential between our interest rates and American interest rates. Mr Greenspan, in some senses, holds Australia’s future in the palm of his hand, with the unintended consequences of future increases in American interest rates. This country will pay a high price in the long term for this government’s neglect, arrogance and self-satisfaction, which are reflected in this budget. Melbourne Ports in my comments on this year’s budget. This is obviously not a budget for the millions of ordinary working families of this country, who expect a number of things of government, one of which is that it be fair or, if required, fix unfairness wherever possible. We have not seen any sign that the government has any regard for ordinary working familiesordinary Australians-in the way it has decided to deliver $24 billion worth of tax cuts. The government may have managed to mesmerise some in the media about potential delays that could arise if the Senate were to delay the tax cuts, but it is very important to focus primarily on the difference in approach between Labor and the government on spending that large MAIN COMMITTEE",182,Appropriation Bill No 2 2005 2006 Appropriation Parliamentary Departments Bill No 1 2005 2006 Appropriation Bill No 5 2004 2005 Appropriation Bill No 6 2004 2005
194,Mr Brendan O’connor (Gorton) (9.02 Pm),"I am happy to follow the member foramount of taxpayers’ money-that is, putting it back into the pockets of Australian workers. Labor has looked to have a fairer approach by ensuring that millions of workers would receive twice as much as has been offered by the government. I think that those working people who have come to understand our position have, in the main, supported it, and those who are yet to fully understand it will do so once they have realised the alternative to Labor’s fair position-a very unfair one. The government likes to dress this up as the politics of envy. If I-or any other member of the parliament-do not agree with the Prime Minister on any tax matter and like to argue for a fairer way to approach it, the government likes to say it is the politics of envy. But it is not; it is the politics of compassion and of ensuring some equity in a system which can accumulate enormous wealth which is not equitably distributed. SoI think it is a fair thing. All social democracies, all liberal democracies, would certainly put at their heart the capacity to intervene in the economy to rectify structural inequities that exist because of the nature of capitalism. It is a long standing view that governments for many a decade-certainly before World War II and some would say particularly after the Depression-in many Western countries that had a liberal or social democracy would intervene to make fair an unfair outcome of this economic system that we have. The difference between the current government’s position and ours is relatively stark. It is quite clear that when you are trying to deliver some tax relief to many millions of people it is not easy to raise the amount that you need to deliver to each and every recipient below, say, $50,000 or $60,000 per annum. However, I think the fact that Labor has managed to propose a doubling of the weekly amount is commendable, and the more Australians hear about this the more they will agree that that is important. I do not think we should be supporting a proposition that 40 per cent of the $24 billion goes to the top 10 per cent. It just seems to be grossly unfair. And, yes, it may sound populist but it is also a reality that we, the parliamentarians, are in receipt of the highest sums delivered to taxpayers. We, being in the threshold that we are in, receive 10 times the pay of child-care workers. I hear a lot of debate about child-care workers-the need to establish their value, the need to put them in a position commensurate with their responsibilities. However, I have yet to see any effort to rectify their situation. WhatI do know is that, ultimately, as a result of this budget bill being passed, if it is not amended by the two houses, I and every other member and senator will receive more than 10 times the amount received by all child-care workers in this country. That is not just grossly unfair; it is obscene. I do not think it is really argued away by putting up the mantra defence of the politics of envy. There is another point that is important to note, and it was made clear by the shadow minister for industry and workplace relations. It was interesting and it was very demonstrable that the government intervened in the Australian Industrial Relations Commission national wage case and argued in a supplementary submission that the measly $6 per week tax cut being received by workers should be taken into account in the decision to reduce the minimum wage for about 1.5 million workers. It was interesting to see the Commonwealth authorise the department to intervene to say, ‘Those people who receive the least’-less than one-tenth of what parliamentarians receive-‘should also take a hit when the Industrial Relations Commission hands down its last decision on the minimum wage.’ But it was not the case for the Remuneration Tribunal. We did not see a similar situation where the government intervened in MAIN COMMITTEE the Remuneration Tribunal decision-making process and said, ‘Hang on here, the politicians are about to get an increase of some amount and therefore maybe they should get some reduction in the $65.’ It seems to me that that example-where it is fine for high-income earners to be in receipt of large tax cuts and, in some cases, wage increases but it is not okay for lowand middleincome earners, for hard working Australians who are below $60,000 or thereabouts-is extraordinary. That is why Labor members get up and say it time and time again, and that is why wherever I go, when asked why we have held our position and why we are advancing the view that there should be amendments to the tax arrangements, we have a very valid argument to put forward to all people, whether they are in receipt of $60 or $6. I am quite comfortable talking to people on $100,000 saying, ‘Look, maybe you should only be getting a tax cut of $45 so the millions that are getting $6 can get $12 and so that people who are finding it tough, the people who are having difficulty paying their rent and the people having difficulty paying for their fees at university have the capacity to live a decent life.’ I am happy to argue that anywhere, whether or not it is agreed. I also concur with the comments of the member for Melbourne Ports on child care. Clearly, this government has been mean and tricky with the child-care announcements and indeed the way in which people may be affected by the changes to social security. What the government has mooted is that there will be many child-care places available for single parents to put their kids in and, as a result, they should understand that there will not necessarily be the same welfare moneys afforded to them. Clearly, there is an interesting difference in the time line for these things. The changes to welfare-call it assistance or call it whatever you like but I mean the money that is provided to people in need-will take effect next year. But the bulk of the after school hours child-care places will not take effect until 2008. That is a mean and tricky provision of the budget. It was not boasted by the Treasurer on budget night and it was not spruiked by the Treasurer, any other minister or indeed the Prime Minister. But clearly it is a mean and tricky thing, saying ‘You’ll be in a position to take up work because your child or children will be able to be taken care of,’ but the places are not there. Indeed, there are no places provided for long day care-and that is the area where we have a real shortage. SoI think there are a number of areas where the government really has not been truthful with the Australian people in explaining the budget. Indeed, the more we can explain that to the community the better. I think this has been lost a bit because of the debate over tax, but I think the way in which the so-called Welfare to Work policy has been announced is atrocious. The government says it wants to attend to finding job opportunities for people with disabilities. On the face of it, that is a perfectly reasonable proposition. Indeed, it is good public policy to enable people with disabilities of whatever sort to have the capacity to be gainfully employed-for all sorts of reasons, but let us start with their own integrity, their own self-esteem, their own values, their sense of self-worth in society and those things that would instil in an individual their worth as a community member. Let us also say that, for economic purposes, it is very good for community members to be able to be productive in order to produce a greater sized cake, metaphorically, and for people to be able to share in that cake. There are good reasons for governments to argue that we should be trying to provide opportunities. But this is the problem. There are not sufficient resources put aside to create any new work. There has been no eviMAIN COMMITTEE dence put forward by the government to explain where these jobs will come from. In my electorate-and I am sure it is the same for many other members. I have thousands of people who are currently on a disability pension and who are frightened to death that they are going to be forced into an income bracket and forced onto the dole because, notwithstanding the good intentions inside the headlines of the government policy, there are no jobs for them to go to. I think that is the concern many people share. We have a situation where the government says welfare to work, but clearly it is welfare to welfare-welfare to a lower level of welfare. Indeed, it is a welfare process which will be more prescriptive and place more pressure upon them. I could actually accept that this would be good policy if there had been any effort put in by government to ensure that there was a greater capacity for people with disabilities currently on the disability pension to find work in their area. But I do not think there has been a great deal of effort in that regard. I think that, once the community hears more of it, they will start realising how nasty and pernicious this government can be in relation to the most vulnerable in our society. You do not see too many government members, publicly or otherwise, explaining how fair that policy is. I have not heard one government member boast about the way in which they are going to handle the policy affecting people on disability pensions. Why? Because they are embarrassed. They are ashamed of it. Once you get past the headline of welfare to work, most members know, government members included, that this is not a policy that is going to afford people with disabilities any decent opportunity. I hope I am wrong, but I think that in the main, in relation to this area, I am not. The one thing that we can glean from the budget is the way in which the government will look after itself. I am not just talking about the pay increases. On the last occasion I was in this chamber I went through all the grants that have been provided to lower house members of parliament. On1 June, I think it was, I noticed that an extraordinarily large proportion of the grants that go to sporting and recreational grounds went to the seat of McEwen. I thought: ‘That’s a neighbouring electorate. I will see how many they have.’ SoI went through the budget and found that, of the 27 Commonwealth grants, 15 went to the marginal Liberal electorate of McEwen. That is what I said; that is in the transcript. I am sure many of these grants are probably reasonable grants. They would be footy associations, sporting clubs and so on, seeking, probably quite rightly, some support from the Commonwealth. They put in their applications, and I am sure thousands of other applications-or, certainly, requests of members of parliament-also went in for help with ovals, sporting facilities and the like. It was amazing that, as I said then, 15 of the 27 went to one electorate when there are 150 electorates. I was wrong. SoI want to get up today and correct that for the record. It is not 15; it is 16. Sixteen out of 27 Commonwealth grants went to one electorate. I think that is quite extraordinary. I thought I would check how my electorate, a neighbouring electorate, went by comparison. There is a recent report that identifies how impoverished particular electorates are. It uses a number of indicators. Unfortunately, I am in an electorate which is in the bottom third. But, if you look at it in terms of metropolitan electorates, it is probably in the bottom 10 per cent. In other words, people are doing it pretty tough. How many grants do you think they received, Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins? The answer is zero. They received no grants. Of course, McEwen, on the other hand, as an outer metropolitan regional area, would not be seen to be impoverished. It has some beautiful areas and lovely communities. I was fortunate enough to MAIN COMMITTEE represent many of them: the townships of Gisborne, Macedon, Mount Macedon, Woodend, Romsey and Lancefield. They are fantastic areas. However, the fact is that I could not see any discernible reason why the electorate would receive 16 grants as opposed to zero in my own neighbouring electorate. The only thing I can conclude is that this was not about Commonwealth resources-taxpayers’ money-being provided to these regions for services because they are in greater need than any other area but, I have to say, about looking after the political hide of the Minister for Small Business and Tourism. It is unfortunate that I have to say that, but the only conclusion I can reach is that the member for McEwen has managed to sequester out of the budget more than 60 per cent of the Commonwealth grants in this region. That really sums it up-that the government has no concern for the marginalised. It has a concern for the marginals-I will grant you that-but not for the marginalised. It is about time it started turning its attention to those people in need. It does not matter whether they are people with disabilities-who seem to be being pushed onto the dole with no regard for their future-whether they are single mothers who have to find work before child-care places come on stream or whether they are people who are receiving $6 a week, many of whom are receiving a national wage minimum of $17 for the last time. This government is interested purely in itself and in its own survival. The ability of the member for McEwen to be given more than 60 per cent is a reflection of this government’s desire to hold on to power at all costs, irrespective of the needs of Melbourne and other areas outside of McEwen. I certainly hope the media pick up on this. I know there have been some reports recently that I am sure will help the media to alert the public about what exactly is happening in relation to the grants. I am sure there is a lot more to come as we look more closely at the budget and the way this arrogant government has decided to spend taxpayers’ money in looking after its own hide without any regard for people in need. This government has no regard for the people it has decided will take a hit as a result of this budget. I feel very happy and very comfortable in attacking this government and in explaining why to the people of Australia. (Time expired) Debate (on motion by Mrs Gash) adjourned.

(18) No. Regional Partnerships (Question No. 308) Mr Andren asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, in writing, on 6 December 2004: (1) In respect of the Regional Partnership grant for (a) Blayney Sea Link, and (b) MacSmith Milling Manildra in the electoral division of Calare announced during the 2004 election campaign, (i) what date was the project approved, (ii) what date did the Area Consultative Committee recommend funding the project, (iii) which Regional Partnerships eligibility criteria did the project satisfy, (iv) what are the expected employment outcomes for the project, (v) what sum was contributed to the project by the applicant, (vi) when did the project satisfy due diligence requirements, and (vii) what supporting documentation was supplied with the application. (2) Is he aware that his Parliamentary Secretary told ABC Radio in Orange on 26 November 2004 that the due diligence investigation of the two projects was yet to be completed. (3) Is he (a) aware that the recipient of the Manildra grant told the same ABC program that an offer “was on the table”; and (b) satisfied this comment indicated the project had been satisfactorily approved. (4) Can he confirm that the statement in the Western Advocate on 29 November 2004 quoting his spokesman as saying “funding is yet to be approved for the Blayney Sea-Link service” was correct at the time. (5) Is he aware that the then Parliamentary Secretary informed me on 28 and 29 September 2004 in separate letters that the projects had been approved. (6) Can he explain the contradiction between the two announcements. (7) Has each project received its funding; if so, when did this occur. (1) (i) (a) Blayney Sea Link, 31 August 2004 (b) MacSmith Milling Manildra, 31 August 2004 (ii) (a) Blayney Sea Link– Central West ACC – reviewed at 30 March 2004 meeting. (b) MacSmith Milling Manildra– Central West ACC – reviewed at 5 August 2004 meeting. (iii) (a) Blayney Sea Link– was assessed as meeting the outcomes, partnership and support, applicant viability and project viability criteria. (b) MacSmith Milling Manildra– was assessed as meeting the outcomes, partnership and support, applicant viability and project viability criteria.",193,Questions In Writing
197,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(iv) (a) Blayney Sea Link employment intended outcomes – 40 new jobs within 12 months (b) MacSmith Milling Manildra intended employment outcomes – 7 new full time (FTE) positions with further additional 4 FTE by year 3 of mill operation. (v) (a) (b) I am not willing to divulge this potentially sensitive information without the approval of those partners. Funding inputs provided by project partners are not outcomes of the Minister’s or Parliamentary Secretary’s decision-making processes and do not represent funding which will be received from the Government. Regional Partnerships funding represented 48.08 per cent of the Blayney Sea Link project and 5.49 per cent of the MacSmith Milling Manildra project. (vi) (a) Blayney Sea Link: This project is part of a multi stage development on which a full scoping and business plan was completed by Deloitte Touch Tohmatsu in 2002. The Department was satisfied the Commonwealth’s investment represented a low risk. The funding was for a component of one stage of the project (this being the service connection); there was significant financial investment from the applicant; and there were plans for future investment from the applicant. The Department considered undertaking an external viability to be unnecessary in these circumstances. (b) MacSmith Milling Manildra: Verbal independent advice was received from Westpac regarding the strength of the business case and Westpac advised that it would conduct its own due diligence checks but did not anticipate any problems. Considering this the Department felt it would be unnecessary duplication to undertake a further review, however, a condition of the funding contract was that written confirmation of applicant and partner funding from the managing financial institution (Westpac) was received before the first payment will be made. (vii) (a) Blayney Sea Link– documents supplied: Business Plan Consolidated Profit and Loss for year end 30 June 2003 Consolidated Trading Account for year end 30 June 2003 Consolidated Balance Sheet as at 30 June 2003 Budget Report for 2003 through to 2007 Letters of support from Bartter Enterprises, Simplot Australia, Central Tablelands Water and Blayney Shire Council. (b) MacSmith Milling Manildra– documents supplied: Copy of Development Approval Business Plan Statement of Financial Performance for 3 years (2001 – 2003) and year to date 2004 Quotes from Equipment Suppliers Copy of Certificate of Company registration Profit and Loss Statements 2003-04 Financial report as at 30 June 2003 Business Tax Returns (2002-03, 2001-02 and 2000-01) Land site drawing and plans (2) Yes (3) Yes (4) Refer to the answer to part (1)(a)(i). (5) Yes (6) The information quoted by my Parliamentary Secretary on the 25 November 2004 and my spokesman in the Western Advocate on 29 November 2004 was not correct. (7) (a) Blayney Sea Link– first payment of $57,255 (GST inc) was made on 12 October 2004 – second payment of $144,474 (GST inc) was made on the 7 December 2004. (b) MacSmith Milling Manildra– first payment of $303,787 (GST inc) is due to be paid on 30 April 2005.

200,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(6) What is the name and address of each recipient? (1) Yes. Regional Partnerships. (2) The Area Consultative Committees (ACCs) are responsible for promotion of the Regional Partnerships and are allocated operational funding to fulfill this responsibility. The Central Highlands ACC markets Regional Partnerships in that region through the following activities: A monthly article “CHACC Who” in the local press ‘Courier’. A quarterly 4 page self published newsletter, which is distributed via database throughout the region including local government and resource centres. Face-to-face marketing via presentations to business and community groups. The Australian Government Regional Information Directory and the Grantslink web site also provide information on applying for Regional Partnerships’ funding. (3) (a) Regional Partnerships’ purpose is outlined in the Regional Partnerships guidelines: The Australian Government’s approach to regional development is to work in partnership with communities, government and the private sector to foster the development of self-reliant communities and regions. This approach is consistent with the Commonwealth’s framework for developing Australia’s regions: Stronger Regions, A Stronger Australia. Regional Partnerships is a programme that delivers on the Australian Government’s approach to regional development. (b) In accordance with the Regional Partnerships’ guidelines, the Department of Transport and Regional Services assesses applications and makes recommendations to the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary. Based on this advice and the recommendations made by ACCs, the Minister or Parliamentary Secretary decides whether to fund or not fund the project; the level of funding to be provided; and whether any conditions should be applied to the funding. (4) to (6) Funding under Regional Partnerships was not available in 2001-2002. Centrelink (Question No. 626) Mr Albanese asked the Minister for Human Services, in writing, on 17 February 2005: (1) In respect of the imminent closure of the Ashfield and Strathfield Centrelink Offices in Sydney which are to be amalgamated into one office at Burwood, what community consultation took place before the decision to close the offices was made? (2) What client consultation took place before the decision to close the offices was made?

202,Mr Hockey,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(2) Due to concerns about parking and poor access to the office raised by Ashfield customers, staff have for some time been advising customers that plans were underway to find more suitable accommodation and customer feedback has been very positive. Staff have also been advising customers who visit the office for regular appointments about the planned move. The response has been favourable and no concerns have been raised by customers. (3) For the majority of customers, the new location at Burwood will be more convenient and will have better transport options than those currently operating at Ashfield. The new office at Burwood is closer to the local railway station than the Ashfield Office and has more direct bus services than Ashfield. As is the case now, elderly and immobile customers are able to request a home visit if they are unable to get to the Burwood office. (4) It is planned to have Family Assistance and Retirement Services on the ground floor. There is ramp access to the main entrance. Ramp access and stairs are available to Level One, which will provide Employment, Youth and Disability Services. In addition there are three lifts in the main building foyer, which also has ramp access. (5) The full range of Customer Service Centre services will be available at Burwood. These include Employment, Youth, Retirement, Disability, Families, Social Work, Psychology, Financial Information, Personal Advisers, Jobs, Education and Training, Multicultural Services and Interpreters.

A search undertaken of departmental databases has been unable to identify any incident reports relevant to the alleged assault committed against Mr Tappeh at either Villawood IDC or any other detention centre. Further, the Department has been unable to find any record of a complaint lodged by Mr Tappeh alleging that he was assaulted at VIDC or any other detention centre. An allegation from a third party was received by the Department in relation to an alleged assault on Mr Tappeh during his removal from Australia. This allegation was immediately acted on and the removal process of Mr Tappeh was reviewed. The outcome of the review was that there was no evidence to substantiate the allegations. On the occasion of this alleged assault, both a senior departmental officer and officers from the New South Wales Police were present. Debt Notices (Question No. 773) Mr Brendan O’Connor asked the Minister for Human Services, in writing, on 9 March 2005: When sending a debt notice, what obligations does Centrelink have to its clients in respect of (a) an explanation of the reason for the alleged debt, (b) a presumption of a client’s innocence in respect of the alleged debt, (c) the time permitted for a client to respond to the alleged debt, and (d) the time from notification of a debt before requiring repayment. (a) Under the Social Security Act 1991, section 1229 (1) and Family Assistance (Administrative) Act 1999, section 77, Centrelink has an obligation to provide information when issuing a debt notice. Relevant sections of the Social Security Act 1991 and Family Assistance (Administrative) Act 1999 are below: Social Security Act 1991 Notices in respect of debt section 1229.(1) “If a debt by a person to the Commonwealth under the social security law has not been wholly paid, the Secretary must give the person a notice specifying: (a) the date on which it was issued (the date of the notice); and",208,Questions In Writing

(c) The legislation states ‘the outstanding amount of the debt is due and payable on the 28th day after the date of the notice’. There is currently no time limit on reviews and appeals, even after a debt has been finalised. (d) The legislation specifies that a debt is payable on the 28th day after the date of the notice. Ipswich Motorway (Question No. 823) Mr Ripoll asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, in writing, on 7 March 2005: (1) Does the Government have a preferred outcome for the feasibility study into the northern bypass of the Ipswich Motorway. (2) Will the Government accept the outcome of the feasibility study into the northern bypass of the Ipswich Motorway. (3) How did the Government determine that a northern bypass of the Ipswich Motorway would solve the traffic problems on the motorway. (4) Is it the Government’s intention that the northern bypass on the Ipswich Motorway will become part of the national highway network if the feasibility study determines that the project is feasible. (5) Is it the Government’s intention that the Ipswich Motorway will cease to be part of the national highway network if the feasibility study into the northern bypass determines that the project is feasible. (6) Is it the Government’s intention to build the northern bypass of the Ipswich Motorway regardless of the outcome of the feasibility study. (7) Do the claims made by the Member for Blair during the 2004 federal election campaign that the northern bypass of the Ipswich Motorway would take “half the time” at “half the cost” of upgrading the Ipswich Motorway, accurately reflect Government policy; if so, what study or report is the basis of this view. (8) What sum has been allocated for the construction of the northern bypass of the Ipswich Motorway and when will it be made available. (9) What other options are being considered to deal with traffic problems on the Ipswich Motorway. (10) Has the community been consulted on the construction of the northern bypass of the Ipswich Motorway; if so, when and by whom. (11) What is the Government’s timeframe for solving the traffic problems in Brisbane’s south-west, in particular, in relation to the Ipswich Motorway. (12) Is the statement that the Government has committed $627 million to this project over the next five years made in relation to the Ipswich Motorway by the Prime Minister on 4BC on 28 September 2004 still Government policy; if so, when will the money be available to complete the full-upgrade of the Ipswich Motorway. (1) No, the Government does not have a preferred outcome. (2) The Government will await the outcome of the feasibility study which will inform any decisions. (3) The Government was concerned that the proposed upgrade of the Ipswich Motorway would not, on its own, address the long term traffic problems of this area of urban Brisbane and asked the Queensland Government to examine the potential of a northern option. (4) It is premature to anticipate the outcome of the independent feasibility study in relation to the scope of the AusLink National Network in this area. (5) No. The northern option feasibility study is examining the potential for a feasible alternative to that part of the Ipswich Motorway from Dinmore to Gailes, not the full length of the Ipswich Motorway. (6) The Government is awaiting the outcome of the independent study before making any decisions. (7) The cost of a northern bypass of the Ipswich Motorway is the object of a feasibility study. (8) No funds have been allocated for the construction of a northern bypass. A total of $627 million is available in the first five years of AusLink for the Brisbane urban connectors. (9) Some interim safety works are being carried out and the Australian Government has committed to the upgrade of the Logan Motorway/Ipswich Motorway interchange. (10) I understand there has been limited targeted stakeholder consultation by the Consultant in the preparation of the feasibility study. (11) Resolving the issues on the Ipswich Motorway have high priority and timing will depend on what is feasible and achievable within the funding available in partnership with the Queensland Government. (12) As stated in the National Land Transport Plan in the AusLink White Paper, project priorities and investment levels will be determined in the context of an integrated urban solution for the Brisbane urban corridors. $627million has been provided for this purpose in the current five year period.",209,Questions In Writing
206,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Science Education (Question No. 908) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Education, Science and Training, in writing, on 17 March 2005: (1) Will the Government address the decline in participation in science education at the (a) primary, (b) secondary, (c) undergraduate, and (d) post-graduate level; if so, how; if not, why not. (2) Will the Government address the skills shortage of scientifically trained professionals in Australia; if so, how; if not, why not. (1) The Australian Government is addressing the decline in participation in science education in the following ways: (a) Primary Level and (b) Secondary Level: Several recent studies (including the Government’s 2003 independent Review of Teaching and Teacher Training) have reported that in primary schools, science is often either not taught or not taught systematically. A key issue is the lack of confidence of primary teachers due to limited experience in science. In 2004, the Australian Government approved funding of $1.8 million from its Quality Teaching Programme for the second stage of Primary Connections (the Primary School Science and Literacy Project), being undertaken by the Australian Academy of Science. The Project will build primary students’ knowledge and understanding of science while also focussing on the development of their literacy skills. This Project is being developed in collaboration with representatives from all State, Territory and Commonwealth education jurisdictions, along with Catholic and Independent sectors and professional associations. Stage Two of the Project is developing, trialling and evaluating curriculum materials and an associated professional learning model. (http://www.dest.gov.au/Ministers/Media/Nelson/2004/08/n834030804.asp) The Government also supports Primary School outreach programmes such as “SMART” (Science, Mathematics And Real Technology) Programme (run through the University of Newcastle) and EngQuest, an initiative of Engineers Australia. On6 May 2004, the Prime Minister announced a raft of initiatives (a package totalling $5.3 billion over seven years) under the second round of Backing Australia’s Ability Building Our Future Through Science and Innovation. These initiatives included, in response to the 2003 report of the findings and recommendations of the Review of Teaching and Teacher Education, new funding of $38.8 million over seven years from 2004-05 for measures to strengthen science, mathematics and technology education, increase the number of talented people attracted to teach in the fields of science, technology and mathematics and build a culture of continuous innovation in Australian schools in the long term, through the Boosting Innovation, Science, Mathematics and Technology Teaching (BISTMT) Programme. The main element of the BISTMT Programme is the Australian School Innovation in Science Technology and Mathematics (ASISTM) Project, through which funding will be available for groups of schools (both primary and secondary) and their partners (including tertiary education institutions, science, industry and business organisations) to promote innovative approaches and improve the teaching and learning of science, technology and mathematics in Australian schools.",211,Questions In Writing
207,Dr Nelson,"The answer to the honourable member’s questions is as follows:As an integral part of these projects, schools will engage teacher associates – tertiary students, researchers and other specialists in science, technology and mathematics to provide positive role models, excite student interest in these subjects and assist with other aspects of projects. The linking of schools with local industry and business through ASISTM projects will help develop in students an interest and understanding of science and technology applications in the real world. The first round of ASISTM applications is currently being assessed. Round two will be advertised in the middle of this year. The Australian Government has also provided funding for a range of other initiatives to encourage and improve the teaching and learning of science and mathematics in schools. These include: investment of almost $300 million from 2000-2009 through the Australian Government Quality Teacher Programme (AGQTP) to improve the professional skills, knowledge and understanding of teachers in specified priority areas (including science, mathematics and numeracy, and technology/ICT), and to enhance the status of teaching; establishment of the National Institute for Quality Teaching and School Leadership (NIQTSL) with initial funding of $10 million from the AGQTP. The Institute, run by and for the profession, aims to raise the status, quality and professionalism of teachers and school leaders. The NIQTSL has four key functions: professional standards development, professional learning, research and communication, and promotion of the profession; development of science materials and infrastructure as part of the $68 million Le@rning Federation – Schools Online Curriculum Content Initiative; development of Curriculum Corporation’s ScienceLynx website to provide a science web portal linking to a variety of resources and support materials. development, through the Australian Council for Educational Research (ACER), of the Science Education Assessment Resources (SEAR) project, an online assessment resource to improve assessment of science learning in schools. collaboration with the States and Territories to develop national statements of learning for science and maths; the $2.5 million National School Science Project to enhance the quality of primary and secondary science education in Australia; Australia’s participation in the Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS); development by the Australian Science Teachers Association (ASTA) of National Professional Standards for Highly Accomplished Teachers of Science; the School Community Industry partnerships in science (SCIps) Project, which supports a diverse range of science-based partnership projects in schools; the National Skills Shortages Strategy, which includes the Adopt a School initiative to better connect students in regional schools with local industry to increase awareness of industry careers, including those based on science and engineering skills, and a Science and Emerging Technology Careers project to create a better understanding of the potential for entry into science-based jobs and careers; Questacon and CSIRO Education; programmes to maintain and increase students’ interest in science, and to influence their decision to pursue science education beyond Year 10 – including the Science Connections Programme (SCOPE), which is supporting: elements of science programming available through “The Lab”, the ABC’s on-line science resource, including ‘The ExperiMentals’, a 21st Century version of ‘Why is it So?’, ‘Ace Day Jobs’ – a series on some of the fascinating jobs in Australia that require a science background (forthcoming); and News in Science; National Science Week, an annual celebration of science involving partnerships with CSIRO Education, ASF Ltd, the ABC’s Science Unit and the Australian Science Teachers Association, and including a grants programme which assists community participation nationally; The Australian Science and Mathematics Olympiads programmes, which offers students the opportunity to compete internationally in Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Mathematics and Informatics; The University of Newcastle’s Science and Engineering Challenge, an inter-school competition which introduces students to practical applications of science and mathematics and which is expanding nationally with SCOPE funding; The Australian Museum’s “Science in the City” programme, including new outreach activities in western Sydney; and the Prime Minister’s Prizes for Science, which are awarded annually to the best of our scientists and science teachers. (c) Undergraduate and (d) Post-graduate Level: Teaching is the most important school-related factor shaping student learning. The Australian Government has provided considerable funding to strengthen teaching through initial teacher education as well as teacher professional learning. Relevant Government initiatives include: On2 July 2004 I announced the allocation of new higher education places to start in 2005. This includes around 1,700 teaching places throughout the sector, which will grow to around 4,700 places by 2008. In addition, the Government has allocated 150 teaching places to private higher education providers. making teacher education a national higher education priority allocating additional places, ensuring HECS fees do not rise above CPI and investing an extra $109.2 million for the costs to universities of the teacher practicum. At the higher education level, the Commonwealth has several initiatives in place to support enrolments in science fields. Under Backing Australia’s Ability, the Commonwealth has provided 5,470 higher education places in the fields of science, mathematics and information technology. $151 million was provided for this initiative over the first five years (2001-2005), with a further $200 million being provided over the following five years. The success of this has been demonstrated by the rise in student numbers in the broad field of science. In 2003, the number of students in the Natural and Physical Science field of education totalled 70,556, an increase of 14% since 2001. Under Backing Australia’s Future, the reforms to the higher education sector have provided for 9,100 new Commonwealth-supported higher education places to publicly-funded higher education institutions in 2005. This will grow to 24,883 places by 2008 as students continue in their courses. By 2008, almost 2,000 of these places will be in science-related disciplines. (2) Addressing the skills shortage of scientifically trained professionals in Australia The Government is undertaking an audit of science, engineering and technology skills in Australia that will address the rates of participation in science subjects in education and training as well as any shortages in science professionals. The audit will include the collection and analysis of new data as well as high level analysis of existing data. The supply of science, engineering and technology skills from all levels of education and training will be analysed including schools, vocational education and training and higher education. A report on trends in the supply of science, engineering and technology skills over time will be developed. The audit will also include research on school students’ perceptions about the study of science and mathematics, their future study intentions in respect to science and mathematics and their future career intentions and aspirations. This research is important for understanding the factors influencing trends in the study of science and mathematics. The audit will also analyse the extent to which the demand for science, engineering and technology skills are being met by the education sectors and examine the changing nature of the skills required in science, engineering and technology to address industry needs. Consultations with industry representatives and the public will be conducted to assess current and projected skill needs and to quantify such factors as skill movement, difficulty in recruitment and staff shortages. Short and long term trends in the international mobility of science, engineering and technology skills will also be analysed. This will include a report on the likely impact of international developments on the future supply of science, engineering and technology skills in Australia as well as an analysis of the likely international demand for Australians with science, engineering and technology backgrounds. This will also cover the possible effect on the supply of skilled people for Australia’s skilled migration program. The audit is a multi-faceted approach aimed at encompassing all possible routes of skill development and supply and the utilisation of these skills by Australian industry. Financial Assistance Grants (Question No. 923) Mrs Irwin asked the Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads, in writing, on 17 March 2005: What sum was allocated in local government financial assistance grants during (a) 2003-2004, and (b) 2004-2005 to the (i) City of Fairfield and (ii) City of Liverpool. Each year the Federal Government provides financial assistance grants to Local Government paid through the States under the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act 1995. The financial assistance grants have two components – general purpose grants and identified local roads grants – and both components are untied in the hands of the receiving council. This means that councils are able to spend the grant (including the local road grant) according to the priorities of their communities. The Act specifies how the quantum of the grant is determined and how it is distributed between States. Within States, the grant is distributed to councils according to the recommendation of the respective Local Government Grants Commissions established by each State as a condition of receiving funding under the Act. Further details are provided in the Report on the Operation of the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act 1995 (commonly known as the National Report). The latest report was tabled in Parliament on 26 May 2005. In the following table, financial assistance grants for 2004-05 are estimates.

Millennium Development Goals (Question No. 1138) Ms Plibersek asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in writing, on 10 May 2005: (1) Who will be representing Australia at the United Nations Summit on the Millennium Development Goal Progress in New York in September. (2) What package of initiatives to progress the Millennium Development Goals will the Government take to the United Nations Summit. (1) At this stage, no final decision has been taken on attendance at the United Nations Summit. (2) Australia is playing its part to progress the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) through Whole of Government policies and actions, promoting the conditions necessary for development and poverty reduction. In particular, we are supporting broad-based and sustainable economic growth to assist in lifting people out of poverty and accelerate progress against the MDGs. Australia’s aid program promotes such growth by assisting developing countries to provide security and stability, improve governance, undertake economic reform, open up to trade and allow the poor to participate in growth through rural development and increased market access. Australia is advancing the MDGs in this way by providing well-targeted and effective aid, appropriate debt relief, duty-free and quota-free market access to goods from the Least Developed Countries, and by promoting and supporting global economic growth, including through more liberalised world trade. Australia’s aid program also invests directly in specific MDG areas. For example, in 2005-06, targeted expenditure on health and education will increase by $81 million to over $600 million. The aid program is also contributing $152 million for better water and sanitation and $305 million for environment-related programs. The Government’s multi-year $600 million HIV/AIDS commitment, including the $75 million commitment to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, directly addresses the goal to halt and begin to reverse the spread of HIV/AIDS. Australia will provide an estimated $2.491 billion in Official Development Assistance (ODA) in 2005-06 an increase of $358 million on the 2004-05 Budget Figure and a real increase of 11.7 per cent. This marks the fifth successive budget that the Government has delivered real growth in ODA.

Disability Blind Pension (Question No. 1145) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, in writing, on 10 May 2005: (1) Are recipients of the Disability Blind Pension (DSB) subject to an income and/or an asset test; if so, what are the details; if not, why not. (2) Are recipients of the DSB required to report their income to Centrelink. (3) Are DSB recipients who are not in residential care and not receiving Centrelink rent assistance but have a partner receiving Centrelink benefits subject to a Centrelink income reporting obligation; if so, why; if not, why not. (4) Is it the case that DSB recipients may have their DSB benefit withheld if they have a partner receiving a Centrelink benefit who fails to report income to Centrelink; if so, why; if not, why not. (5) Will the Minister guarantee that DSB recipients not in residential care or not receiving rent assistance will not be sent Centrelink Income Reporting Maintenance Period letters; if so, when; if not, why not. (6) Will the Minister guarantee that DSB recipients not in residential care or not receiving rent assistance will not have their benefit withheld if they have a partner receiving a Centrelink benefit who fails to report their income to Centrelink; if so, when; if not, why not. (1) Yes, in certain situations, explained below, DSP (blind) recipients are subject to income and assets tests.",220,Questions In Writing
214,Mr Andrews,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(a) DSP (Blind) recipients who are also claiming, or in receipt of, Rent Assistance. This is because Rent Assistance is paid subject to income and assets tests. For DSP (Blind) recipients the combined rate of DSP and Rent Assistance is the greater of: the rate (including Rent Assistance) that would be payable after applying both the income and assets tests as if the recipient was not permanently blind; or the maximum rate of DSP payable not including Rent Assistance. (b) DSP (Blind) recipients who have a partner who is not permanently blind and who claims, or is in receipt of, a payment that is subject to the income and assets tests. The income and assets of the DSP (Blind) recipient are required to determine the partner’s eligibility for, and rate of, payment. DSP (Blind) recipients under Age Pension age can also accrue and deplete working credits if their income details are provided for the purpose of payment of Rent Assistance or to establish their partner’s entitlement. (c) Single DSP (Blind) recipients who have variable employment income. These recipients are placed on ‘stimulus reporting’ which means they are required to notify Centrelink of their income before their payment can be paid. A recipient can ask Centrelink to change their reporting obligations to suit their situation, for example where: the employment income earned does not impact upon the rate payable; or the DSP (Blind) recipient receives Rent Assistance and the requirement to report each fortnight places unrealistic expectations upon the customer. (2) If the DSP (Blind) recipient is not in one of the three situations above, they may disclose the income and assets to Centrelink if they wish. In these circumstances, their rate of payment will remain unchanged as they are not subject to the income and assets tests. (3) Yes. A DSP (Blind) recipient who is not in residential care and not receiving Rent Assistance, but has a partner receiving Centrelink payments, will be subject to a Centrelink income reporting obligation, if: the partner is not permanently blind and is in receipt of a Centrelink payment subject to the income and assets tests; and both the recipient and the partner are under Age Pension age; and the partner has variable employment income and receives a Reporting and Income Statement (RIS) (a notice under section 68(2)(b) of the Social Security Administration Act 1999). In this situation, the DSP (Blind) recipient will also receive a RIS. The RIS is a notice issued to certain recipients who are required to provide a fortnightly report of their employment income and other changes in circumstances. Recipients need to contact Centrelink on their reporting date and answer a series of questions in relation to employment income and other changes in circumstances that affect their Centrelink payment. The RIS is sent to both members of the couple to provide flexibility where the “worker” is unable to report on a particular day due to work commitments. Only one member of the couple needs to report to Centrelink on behalf of both members of the couple. Centrelink require notification from either the DSP (Blind) recipient or the partner to ensure the correct rates of payment are made and working credit balances are adjusted, if necessary. (4) Yes. The DSP (Blind) recipient may have their payment withheld if they, or their partner, or both members of the couple, receive a RIS and neither party reports their employment income to Centrelink on their reporting date. If their partner fails to report income or any other changes in circumstances to Centrelink, the DSP (Blind) recipient may have their payment withheld if it has been incorrectly paid and they have incurred a debt. (5) No. I assume that the Member is referring to the Reporting and Income Statement (RIS) when he asks about the Centrelink Income Reporting Maintenance Period letters. A RIS is sent to recipients in the following situations: (a) Single DSP (Blind) recipients who are not in residential care or not receiving Rent Assistance will receive a RIS if they have variable employment income and have not agreed to alternative arrangements with Centrelink. (b) Partnered DSP (Blind) recipients will receive a RIS under the circumstances outlined in (3). (6) No. See response to (4). Telstra Mobile Online SMS Business Services (Question No. 1164) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister representing the Minister for Family and Community Services, in writing, on 10 May 2005: (1) In respect of the provision of Telstra Mobile Online SMS Business Services or similar services to the Minister and the Minister’s staff, (a) does the Minister’s department provide such a service to the (a) Minister and (b) Minister’s staff; if so, when was the service first made available to the (i) Minister and (ii) Minister’s staff. (2) What has been the cost of providing the service to the (a) Minister and (b) Minister’s staff since it was introduced. ing answer to the honourable member’s question: The Department of Family and Community Services does not currently provide Telstra’s Mobile Online SMS Business Services, or similar services, to the Minister, or the Minister’s staff. Letters of Credence and Recall (Question No. 1204) Mr Melham asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in writing, on 10 May 2005: Why are Letters of Credence and Letters of Recall for foreign Ambassadors accredited to Australia addressed to Her Majesty the Queen and not to the Governor General who signs the Letters of Credence and Letters of Recall for Australian Ambassadors accredited to foreign countries. The Commonwealth Constitution provides for the Governor General, as The Queen’s representative, to exercise many powers and functions traditionally associated with a head of state. The Governor General signs the Letters of Credence and Recall in this capacity. However, while the Governor General can be regarded as the effective head of state in Australia, The Queen remains the formal Head of State in the conventional sense and it is customary that Letters of Credence and Recall are addressed to her when foreign countries are giving official notice of the movements of their Government’s representatives. Indian Ocean Tsunami (Question No. 1206) Mr Gibbons asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in writing, on 10 May 2005: (1) Is he aware that in some areas of Aceh survivors of the tsunami are still without adequate housing, food and water?",221,Questions In Writing
215,Mr Hockey,The Minister for Family and Community Services has provided the follow,223,Questions In Writing
216,Mr Downer,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(2) Can he say how long it takes for money donated by the Australian community to reach the tsunami survivors? (3) Is the money donated provided to the Indonesian Government or directly to the aid organisations? (4) How long does it take for Australian Government funds to reach the tsunami survivors? (5) Are Australian Government funds provided to the Indonesian Government or directly to the Aid Organisations? (1) We are aware of the continuing need to provide short term humanitarian aid including food, water, shelter and medical supplies to vulnerable communities in Aceh. The Australian Government is continuing to provide humanitarian aid through the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN OCHA) Humanitarian Relief Fund. We have also provided support to the World Food Program which has fed communities for five months and is continuing to distribute food supplies. CARE and Surfaid are being funded to deliver food and non-food items on Simeulue and Nias. In addition medical treatment is being provided to affected populations, as well as measles immunizations, tetanus vaccine and nutritional support for mothers and children. The Australian Government has directly transported food, equipment and personnel to vulnerable communities and is continuing to provide logistical support. We are also providing technical support to the Aceh Reconstruction Agency to coordinate the aid effort. (2) No. The Australian Council for International Development (ACFID) are reporting on this aspect. (3) Again, this question can only be answered by ACFID or the specific NGO’s concerned. (4) Australian Government assistance to tsunami affected areas was immediate. The Australian Government’s response to the Boxing Day tsunami commenced on 26 December. Essential supplies and medical teams arrived in Aceh on 29 December 2004. Australia’s emergency response to Indonesia included: deployment of five civilian medical teams, totalling over 100 Australian doctors and nurses, to provide urgent medical assistance; provision of a 90 bed Australian Defence Force Field Hospital located in Banda Aceh; provision of water purification plants to Banda Aceh, pumping 480,000 litres of clean water a day; emergency provision of tetanus toxoid vaccines and tetanus immunoglobulin to treat and prevent disease; sourcing and delivering 129,000 20L water containers to Banda Aceh; chartering vessels and light aircraft to deliver urgent food, shelter equipment and medical supplies and medical personnel to affected areas on the West Coast; and distribution of dry food baskets of rice, oil, tea and salt as well as blankets, clothing, cooking sets and tents to 40,000 families in Banda Aceh. Australia’s assistance to tsunami affected areas is ongoing. (5) Australia provided $33 million in emergency funds to Indonesia. This involved the provision of funds to NGO’s and United Nations agencies but not to the Indonesian government. Under the Australian Government’s $1 billion Australia-Indonesia Partnership for Reconstruction and Development (AIPRD) an initial allocation of $50m has been announced for Aceh’s reconstruction. This is being delivered primarily via Australian, New Zealand and Indonesian contractors.",223,Questions In Writing
217,Mr Downer,"The answer to the honourable member’s questions is as follows:Sea Cargo (Question No. 1212) writing, on 10 May 2005: (1) What is the Government’s policy on interdicting and boarding cargo vessels that fail to provide cargo reports detailing the content of their cargo 48 hours prior to arriving at an Australian port, as required under s64AB of the Customs Act 1901 and r26B of the Customs Regulations 1926. (2) What maritime capacity does the Australian Customs Service (ACS) have to interdict and board late reporting cargo vessels. (3) How are the ACS vessels armed. the honourable member’s question: (1) Customs risk assesses all commercial vessels in advance of arrival and boards those considered high risk immediately on arrival.
