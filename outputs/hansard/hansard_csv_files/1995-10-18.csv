Second Reading Secretary to the Minister for Communications and the Arts) (10.00 a.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The bill will amend the taxation laws in a number of respects. It includes four measures announced in the 1995-96 budget. Rebatable and frankable dividends The bill will give effect to the 1995-96 budget announcement that dividends paid out of share capital funds and asset revaluation reserves will not be rebatable or frankable. This is an anti-avoidance measure which will apply to dividends paid after 7.30 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on 9 May 1995, unless declared before that time or paid under certain transitional arrangements. The measure is expected to prevent a significant loss to the revenue. Infrastructure borrowings The bill will give effect to the 1995-96 budget announcement to increase the infrastructure borrowings tax rebate from 33 per cent to 36 per cent. The increase in the rebate corresponds to the change in the company tax rate and will have effect from a taxpayer's 1995-96 income year. The estimated cost to the revenue of the increase in the rebate is $2 million in 1995-96, $8 million in 1996-97 and $lO million in 1997-98. Reduction of PA YE early remitter threshold The bill amends the law to lower, from $5 million to $1 million, the threshold at which a group employer is treated as an early remitter. As a result, the twice monthly remittance arrangements will apply to group employers who have annual PA YE remittances in excess of $1 million per year. The amendment will bring forward $275 million into the 1995-96 year of income. Depreciation on trading ships In the 1995-96 budget the government announced an extension of the operation of the provision allowing for accelerated depreciation of trading ships. The concession will phase out on 30 June 2002 instead of 30 June 1997. This extension parallels the extension of the Ships (Capital Grants) Act 1987. That act provides a grant against the capital cost of purchasing an eligible Australian ship. This measure will cost the revenue $11 million in 1997-98 and $16 million in 1998-99.",135,Seafarers Grants Bill 1995

374,Mr Elliott (Parramatta,"ParIiamentary Secretary to the Treasurer and ParliamentaryMC 2398 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 18 October 1995 Superannuation guarantee charge-excess benefits Employers who do not provide the minimum level of superannuation support for their employees are liable to pay the superannuation guarantee charge. Currently, this charge applies even if an employee has already accumulated superannuation entitlements in excess of the reasonable benefits limit or RBL. Superannuation benefits which are in excess of the RBL are taxed at the highest marginal rate in the hands of the recipient. This bill will allow employees with accumulated superannuation entitlements in excess of the pension RBL to make an election not to receive superannuation support from their employers. When an employee makes the election, the employer will be exempted from thsuperannuation guarantee charge in respect of that employee. Employees who make this election will, however, be denied income tax deductions for personal superannuation contributions. The measure will have minimal impact on the revenue. Superannuation guarantee charge-notional earnings base The bill will amend the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992 to extend the use of pre 21 August 1991 employee earnings bases if employers restructure their superannuation funds. Under the existing earnings base regime, as soon as an employer transfers members to another fund or amalgamates funds, the employer loses the right to contribute under a pre 21 August 1991 earnings base. A new employer acquiring a business loses the right to contribute to the existing superannuation fund on the pre 21 August 1991 base available to the former employer. The bill proposes to extend the right to contribute under the same earnings base if members transfer to another of their employer's superannuation funds or a reorganisation of superannuation funds occurs in a business acquisition. The measure is consistent with the government's general approach to superannuation policy, which is to encourage appropriate restructuring of superannuation arrangements to ensure that benefits are provided with the lowest possible administrative costs. The amendments will take effect from 1 July 1995 for reorganisations which took place on or after the Treasurer's announcement of the measure on 28 June 1994. The amendments do not have any impact on the revenue. Bankruptcy and losses The bill will give effect to the announcement by the Treasurer ( Mr Willis) on 26 February 1995 of the government's intention to strengthen and extend the provisions of the law that deny deductions for losses where debts are released under bankruptcy law. The amendment will ensure that, where an annulment of bankruptcy occurs in connection with arrangements under which debts are or may be released, revenue losses will be denied as if the bankruptcy had not been annulled. In addition, the bill amends the capital gains tax provisions to ensure that net capital losses are also denied where a taxpayer has become a bankrupt or is released from debts under bankruptcy law. The revenue gain will be less than $1 million per year. Group certificates and other PAYE provisions The bill amends the income tax law to require group employers to provide original group certificates to the Australian Taxation Office rather than to employees. The changes will Wednesday, 18 October 1995 MAIN COMMITIEE MC 2399 facilitate the introduction of optical character recognition equipment by the Australian Taxation Office. The new equipment will be able to more efficiently and accurately capture employment income data and assist in identifying areas of potential non-compliance. The amendments have provided an opportunity to generally modernise the group tax provisions of the law. For example, a new system of tax vouchers is being introduced to partially replace the outmoded tax stamp system, and the Commissioner will be able to apply excess PAYE credits against other debts owing to the Commissioner, in line with more recently enacted collection systems. The amendments also use a clearer drafting style and structure than the provisions they replace. The amendments are expected to result in unquantifiable revenue savings through increased integrity of the income matching system and some public debt interest savings. Foreign income Australia now has a comprehensive system for taxing foreign source income. The first two parts of the system were the foreign tax credit system and the controlled foreign company measures. The foreign investment fund measures constitute the third and final part of the system. The bill contains an amendment to the controlled foreign company measures that will reduce compliance costs and racilitate corporate restructures involving foreign companies. The amendment will have the effect that only capital gains and losses which accrue after a company becomes a controlled foreign company will give rise to attributable income. T his amendment will result in an unquantifiable loss to revenue. The bill also contains three amendments that close potential tax avoidance loopholes in the foreign source income provisions. First, the rules for obtaining a foreign tax credit will be tightened to ensure that a credit is not available for tax which is effectively refunded to the payer or to another person. A credit will also be denied where a benefit is provided as a direct result of the payment of foreign tax. Secondly, the amendments will clarify that adjustments reflecting arms-length values can be made to amounts used in determining whether a controlled foreign company has passed the active income test. Thirdly, rules will be introduced to ensure that the controlled foreign company measures are not avoided by the liquidation of a controlled foreign company prior to the end of the period for which its attributable income is calculated. The closure of these loopholes will result in an unquantifiable gain to revenue. Minor amendment The bill also makes a minor technical amendment to the Taxation Laws Amendment (Drought Relief Measures) Act 1995. Full details of the amendments are contained in the explanatory memorandum circulated to honourable members. I also foreshadow that the government will be moving amendments to the bill in the House relating to the rebatable and frankable dividends, bankruptcy and superannuation guarantee charge-notional earnings base provisions. Copies of those amendments and a supplementary explanatory memorandum have been circulated to members.",139,Representatives Main Committee

BILL 1995 Consideration resumed from 28 June. Second Reading Dr THEOPHANOUS (Cal well-Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health) (10.11 a.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill gives effect to an important element in the government's package of shipping reform measures which was announced in the budget on 9 May 1995. The reform package continues the improvement in efficiency and competitiveness of Australia's major trading fleet, and assists in closing the competitive gap between Australian shipping and its major international competitors. This bill introduces from 1 July 1995 an annual taxable grant payable in arrears to Australia's international shipping industry employers, based on the PA YE tax liabilities of seafarers on Australia's international trading ships. In addition to the introduction of the grant under this bill, the reform package includes two other key elements: Firstly, the extension from 1 July 1997 until 30 June 2002 of the existing capital assistance measures available under the Ships (Capital Grants) Act 1987 and the associated accelerated depreciation regime under section 57AM of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. These measures, which at least equate to the capital incentives provided by other shipping nations, will encourage the continued investment in modem ships. The necessary amendments to the two acts will be introduced in due course. Secondly, the implementation of the complementary industry efficiency reform measures developed by the shipowners and maritime unions in the Maritime Industry Restructuring Agreement, known as MIRA. These include a greater flexibility in the operation of the seafarers engagement system (the pooled labour scheme for ratings) and other measures which provide ship operators with the kind of cost savings and other benefits more generally associated with company employment. The Australian Shipowners Association has estimated that, across the current major trading fleet (which includes both coastal and international trading ships), savings of some $15 million per year can be achieved under MIRA. The reform measures introduced by MIRA will also deliver cost savings and efficiencies to the offshore industry supply fleet which services Australia's offshore petroleum and gas industry. The structure of the government's reform package is based upon the recommendations of the August 1994 report by the then Chairman of the Shipping Industry Reform Authority, Mr Rae Taylor AO. This report recognised the achievement of the reform programs implemented",141,Representatives Main Commitiee
376,Mr Elliott,I will take on notice the matter that has been raised and I will address it.,142,Representatnes Main Committee
377,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr Jenkins},"As the question is unresolved, in accordance withWednesday, 18 October 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 2401 by government and the shipping industry since the early 1980s. These reforms had focused on reductions in crewing levels, a radical restructure of seafarer training and the introduction of modem, technologically advanced, fuel efficient ships into the Australian fleet. Over the past decade Australian shipowners have invested some $1.6 billion in new tonnage. The average age of ships in the Australian fleet is 11 years, compared with 18 years in the world fleet. In 1983, a typical Australian trading ship had a crew of 33; today, that figure is 18. While in 1983 the Australian average crew size was well in excess of OECD levels, our crew levels are now lower. These are remarkable achievements. Over recent years there has been a trend by OECD national flag operators towards registering their vessels under open or international registers. These registers typically offer attractive taxation regimes and the ability to replace wholly national crews with lower-cost mixed nationality crews, predominantly from the developing countries. The Taylor report found that, as a result of this changed overseas situation, the competitive gap between Australian ships and comparable overseas ships operating under international registers was about $2 million per ship per year. The report, having examined the main areas of cost disabilities affecting Australian shipping, concluded that the PAYE taxation regime had a major impact on Australia's competitive position. Accordingly, the report recommended removal of the PAYE taxation cost element from Australia's international trading ships in order to match the position of overseas ship operators, where crews are exempt from PAYE taxation or where the taxation impact on crew costs is offset by other concessions. The government accepted the thrust of the Taylor report findings. After examining a range of options in the crew taxation area, the government has decided that a grant based on the notional tax liabilities of seafarers serving on ships trading internationally would be the most effective and practicable means of achieving the objective. The bill now before the House introduces from 1 July 1995 an annual taxable grant payable in arrears to Australian shipping industry employers, based on the notional PAYE taxation liabilities on the earnings of Australian-resident crew members on ships in Australia's international trading fleet. Seafarers will, of course, have their PAYE tax deducted in the normal way and, like every other taxpayer, will be able to claim the rebates and deductions to which they are entitled in respect of their total earnings for the year. I now tum to the details of the International Shipping (Australian-resident Seafarers) Grants Bill. Part 2, which takes in clauses 3 to 7, explains the expressions and definitions used in the bill. Clause3 defines an 'eligible ship' to mean 'an Australian-operated commercial trading ship with a deadweight tonnage of 2,000 tonnes or more'. Clause4 defines an 'Australianoperated' ship to include ships on demise charter to Australian entities, as well as ships owned by Australians. Clause5 defines the meaning of 'international voyage'. This is an important definition, as time spent on international voyages is one of the key criteria for qualifying for the grant. Calls at intermediate Australian ports as part of an overall international voyage are permitted, provided that any coastal cargo carried between Australian ports does not exceed the international cargo on board. In clause 7 are to be found general definitions, such as 'seafarer', 'Australian-resident seafarer' and 'seafarer berth'. These again are important definitions as the grant is only payable in respect of bona fide, duly qualified seafarers who are ordinarily resident in Australia. MC 2402 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 18 October 1995 I would mention at this point that the term 'seafarer berth' is used throughout the bill in the sense of a crew position or job on a ship, rather than simply a cabin or a bed. By adopting the concept of the seafarer berth and using the notional tax on the award wages or enterprise agreement wages, as applicable for that berth, the computation of the grant amount is reduced to a relatively straightforward calculation. Part3 of the bill, which covers clauses 8 to 12, contains the elements for establishing the entitlement to the grant and calculating the grant amount. Clause8 sets the basic parameters for entitlement to the grant. Essentially, the grant is payable to the employer of the crew of an eligible ship which has spent the requisite number of days in international trade. Clause9 sets out the method of calculating the amount of grant unit for each seafarer berth. FactorlCd into the grant calculation is the number of days in the year that each berth is actually occupied by an Australian-resident seafarer. Therefore, if any berths are occupied by nonresidents, or if any berths are unoccupied during a repair or lay-up period or because the ship is sailing short-handed, then the grant units calculated for those berths will be reduced proportionately. The grant amount is simply the sum of the grant units for the seafarer berths on the ship. Clause 10 establishes the eligible employment period, which is the period in respect of which the grant is paid. This clause also determines that the grant is to be paid to the actual employer of the crew and that the employer must be an Australian entity. A number of ship operators in Australia appoint a management company to look after the day-to-day running of the ship, including crew related matters such as paying salaries and making the PAYE tax deductions. In such circumstances, it would be the management company that is the actual employer, not the operator. Because of the notional linkage between the grant and crew PA YE income tax, it follows that the employer of the crew is the appropriate recipient of the grant. Clearly, if the employer and the ship operator are not the same entity, they will need to reach a commercial agreement on the allocation of the grant moneys once paid. If the employer employs the crew on a ship for the whole year, the 'eligible employment period' is the whole year. If the employer only employs the crew for a part year, then the 'eligible employment period' would only apply to the part year. These eligible employment periods are not transferable. For example, if during the period covered by the first employer the ship is wholly engaged in international trading and during the period covered by the second employer the ship is mainly engaged in coastal trading, the international trading days accrued by the first employer could not be transferred to the second employer. Clause 11 sets out the formula for calculating the minimum number of days in international trading to qualify for the grant. Mr Deputy Speaker, you will note that the formula excludes non-operational days of repair, maintenance or lay-up from the minimum days calculation. There will thus be no advantage for an operator to obtain repairs, or lay-up the ship, overseas simply in order to accumulate more international trading days. However, once a ship has crossed the minimum days international trading threshold, the grant is payable in respect of the berth occupancy over the full eligible employment period, which would include any days of repairs, maintenance or lay-up. The grant will be paid annually in arrears after receipt of appropriate documentation from the employer. The amount of grant is determined by clause 12 of the bill. The grant payable is the sum of the notional tax liabilities calculated on the award or enterprise agreement wages relating to the various seafarer berths on the ship. The method of determining eligibility and calculating Wednesday, 18 October 1995 MAIN COMMITIEE MC 2403 the amount of grant is very straightforward and will not impose a significant administrative workload on the employer in substantiating a claim for a grant. The arrangements will be administered by the Department of Transport, with the departmental secretary being the nominated decision-maker in respect of applications for grants. There are appropriate safeguards in the bill to enable authorised persons appointed by the secretary to make any necessary investigations to verify the substance of claim applications and to prevent fraud. In common with other legislation involving administrative decisions, clause 22 'of the bill provides for an Administrative Appeals Tribunal review, if there is dissatisfaction with a decision made in relation to a claim for a grant. The bilI also facilitates parliamentary scrutiny of the scheme. Clause 25 requires the secretary to submit to the minister of the day a return of the grants paid in the previous year, and for the minister to table the return before both Houses of Parliament within 15 sitting days. Mr Deputy Speaker, through this bill, the crew taxation disadvantages for Australian operators will be eliminated. Furthermore, by providing the benefit direct to employers, the whole amount will be directed to narrowing the competitive gap. This bill, together with the industry reforms implemented through the maritime industry restructuring agreement, will promote a more competitive international fleet. It must be remembered that, as recently as 25 years ago, Australian shipping had minimal involvement in international trades. Now there are some 30 ships regularly trading overseas. These ships are competing directly with overseas operated vessels at prevailing international freight rates, largely by exploiting market niches. This government's previous shipping reform measures have played a major role in this achievement. The grant to be implemented by this bill is an integral part of a new shipping reform package which raises the benchmark for Australian shipping and provides the wherewithal to take the industry into the next century. It continues the cooperative reform process begun in the early 1980s and provides new initiatives to allow Australian shipping to improve its competitiveness in the international shipping market. I commend the bill to the House. today by stating that we are opposed to the International Shipping (Australian-resident Seafarers) Grants Bill 1995 and that we will be dividing on it. How we handle that in the management of affairs in this chamber I do not know. As I understand it, Mr Deputy Speaker, this chamber is for non-controversial legislation. However, we will be opposing it and dividing on it, so if you want me to proceed I shall. The reason we will be opposing this legislation is that this is simply yet another rort for the Maritime Union of Australia, the great friends of the Labor Party here in Canberra and around Australia. As the ACTU secretary, Mr Bill Kelty, will tell you, the Maritime Union of Australia is the heart and soul of the Labor movement in Australia, and it is for this reason that the taxpayers of Australia are dipping into their pockets to the tune of $19 million, in this specific instance, as they have been dipping into their pockets, or the government on their behalf has been dipping very deeply into their pockets, over the last many years to fund the rorts of the Maritime Union of Australia in various activities this government has embarked upon for them.",142,Representatnes Main Committee
378,Mr Sharp (Hume) (10.25 A.m.),"I will commence my remarks on behalf of the oppositionMC 2404 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 18 October 1995 In this particular case we are spending $19 million of taxpayers' funds as the consequence of a deal that was struck to try and resolve a dispute that I think basically revolves around the privatisation of ANL. We can all recall a strike that took place last year as a consequence of the decision by the government to sell the share of Australian Stevedores, now known as Patricks, that was owned by ANL. You will recall a dispute that took place at that time, a national waterfront strike that cost this country probably in the order of $60 million in direct costs and many millions of dollars more in terms of indirect costs because of the enhanced reputation for unreliability this country has for its waterfront. As a result of that dispute, the government decided to do yet another taxpayer funded deal for its mates in the Maritime Union of Australia, and here we are today with living evidence of the cost of that deal. There are many other examples of the way in which this government has reached deep into the pockets of the Australian taxpayers to fund the rorts of its mates. Today in the press, in relation to the sale of ANL, which is a central feature of the Australian shipping industry and indeed is seen as an icon by the Maritime Union of Australia, we see the farce, and the very expensive farce, of the incompetence of the government's management of the sale of ANL. It reflects also the incompetence of the government's management of our shipping and maritime industries here in Australia. We now find out that we are not likely to have the sale of ANL to P&O proceed, as we had been told would be the case by the government since early this year. The Maritime Union of Australia has in effect vetoed the sale of ANL to P&O on the grounds that it basically does not like P&O. There has been a historic fight between the Maritime Union of Australia and P&O, and as a consequence of it this government has handed over to the Maritime Union of Australia the veto rights on the privatisation of ANL. We see that the Maritime Union of Australia has done exactly what people predicted would be done, and that is use that veto to stop the sale and to leave the ANL shipping company in the hands of the Australian government. The cost of that is enormous. We are seeing in this legislation today $19 million worth of taxpayer funded rorts for the Maritime Union of Australia. But, if you look at the way in which this government has bowed to the whims and fancies of the Maritime Union of Australia over the sale of ANL, the cost of that to the Australian taxpayer is over $100 million dollars. Indeed, somewhere in the order of $145 million is the cost of the fiasco of ANL. That is the cost of this government's bowing down to the influence and pressures the MUA has imposed on the government over the management of and ultimate attempt to privatise ANL. It is some $145 million, plus $19 million per annum, plus the $816,000 that has been paid to Neville Wran, Malcolm Turnbull.and one other member of the ANL board. for part-time work over the last 12 months. Two days a week for one year and people like Neville Wran and Malcolm Turnbull are picking up something in the order of $300,000 for themselves. As a consequence of that, a total $816,000 has been shared amongst the three mates of the government. So we start to see the bill adding up: $19 million for the shipping legislation; $145 million for the fiasco of ANL; and $816,000 for the three mates of the Minister for Transport led by Neville Wran. We also see the cost of the redundancies within the Shipping Industry Reform Authority process which amounted to something like $17.39 million and was yet another",145,Representatives Main Committee

That is $816,000Wednesday, 18 October 1995 MAIN COMMITIEE MC 2405 taxpayer funded rearrangement of the affairs of the Australian shipping industry. That makes a total cost of $71.29 million, of which $53.9 million was paid by employers, as well as the part paid for by the government of Australia. Then if we look at the waterfront operations of Australia, which are an integral part of the Maritime Union of Australia, we come up with an additional bill of $450 million which was paid to some 4,000-odd retiring wharfies who were made redundant as a consequence of the government's so-called Waterfront Industry Reform Authority program. That $450 million was on top of the normal superannuation, accumulative sick leave and long service leave payments that those 4,000-odd retiring wharfies received as part of the government's reform process. We start to draw together a very expensive picture of the way in which the government does business with the Maritime Union of Australia: $450 million for the MUA wharfies; $53.9 million for the Shipping Industry Reform Authority; $816,000 for the three mates; then another $145 million for the losses of ANL; and now $19 million for the legislation that is being debated here today. In anybody's book, that is an enormous amount of money for very little gain. We question a number of points made in the speech given by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Dr Theophanous). He was simply reading a speech prepared by the minister's office, which he did with some degree of competence. For example, the government likes to use the great line which says that crew numbers of Australian ships are equal to those of international shipping trading nations. It is true, crew numbers are equal, but the fact of the matter is that crew to berth ratios in Australia for Australian flag vessels are much higher than those of most other shipping nations around the world. It takes 2.3 crew to fill every berth on an Australian ship. A comparable nation with a much more efficient shipping industry would require about 1.7 crew per berth to fill each position on its ships. So here in Australia, because of the work practices in our maritime industry-six weeks on, six weeks off, somebody on sick leave, somebody on long service leave and somebody doing some training-it requires more crew to keep an Australian flag vessel operating than it does vessels from other countries. We can draw other comparisons in terms of wages. Many people would point out that, even with comparable nations, Australian crews are paid more money than those in other nations. No doubt the government members would try to draw a comparison by saying, 'You're comparing us with Burmese workers or Filipino workers.' No, we are not. We are comparing our sailors with sailors from countries which are like-minded countries to Australia. Despite all of the costs that the Australian taxpayers have had to fork out, despite all of the talk, all of the time and all of the effort involved in trying to generate shipping reform in Australia, we still do not have a shipping industry that is competitive on all of the important points with other shipping nations. . The reason is that the MUA will not allow these things to occur. The MUA, for some reason, is so important that this government will not stand up to it, and will not do anything but dip into the taxpayer's pocket to try to solve the problem. Here today we have an example of precisely that: the taxpayers having another $19 million ripped out of their pockets by this government, to try to solve a little domestic problem for the labour movement in Australia. If we really wanted to have an efficient shipping industry, be it international or domestic, we could move towards company employment. I know that the government says, 'Yes, but we are going down the path that achieves similar results as company employment.' But you MC 2406 MAIN COMMITfEE Wednesday, 18 October 1995 will not achieve the same results unless you have company employment, as is the case in so many other countries around the world. We will not have an efficient and competitive shipping industry until all of the recommendations of the Rae Taylor report are implemented. It is interesting to note that the parliamentary secretary, reading his speech prepared by the minister's office, said that the government has picked up the main parts of the Taylor report. That is true. But they left out some other key aspects of the Taylor report, and the reason they left those key aspects out was simply that the MUA did not agree with them. If we want to start to go down the path of having an efficient world competitive shipping industry that this country can be proud of, earning real dollars that do not cost the taxpayers money, there are many good recommendations in the Taylor report which, if they were picked up in total, would benefit the Australian economy. In the same way, if the recommendations of the Inter-State Commission report of 1987-89, which flowed from the Webber report of 1984-86, were picked up in their entirety and implemented as a package-instead of some of the points from that report being selectively taken up, and some others dropped-we would have an efficient and internationally competitive waterfront in Australia. We do not have an efficient Australian waterfront because this government did not pick the hard bits of the Inter-State Commission's recommendations of April 1989, just as they have not picked up the hard bits of the Rae Taylor report of last year, in relation to the shipping industry in Australia. There are a number of factors that have to be considered in this debate. One factor is the cost of the grant. When the government first announced the provision of a tax-free status for international seafarers, it was supposed to be a tax arrangement. It was not intended, as far as we could understand, to be given in the fonn of a direct grant. It is interesting to note that this grant is valued at about $19 million a year. You watch over the next few years, as coastal traders start to rearrange their schedules to ensure that they are eligible for the grant as well. I will bet my bottom dollar on the fact that those people in the coastal trades will see an opportunity to get some money for themselves out of this scheme; they will make rearrangements to their schedules, and they will have their snouts in the trough by getting into this grant system as well. Instead of this grant costing us $19 million a year, as the government is boldly predicting, we can expect the cost to blowout several times over. We are going to see more and more money being poured down the throats of the Maritime Union of Australia and the government's mates. People on this side of the House have real concerns about this legislation. We oppose it, and we oppose it strongly. Our principal motivation is that the people of Australia have had an absolute gutful of this government bending over backwards to satisfy the concerns of the Maritime Union of Australia and its members. You do not see this government bending over in the same fashion to satisfy the concerns of many other Australians. Take, for example, the drought-stricken fanners that this country has had over the last couple of years. Have you seen the government acting with equal gen-rosity-",146,Representatives Main Committee
381,Mr Adams,Yes.,148,Representatives Main Commitfee
382,Mr Gibson,"Overwhelmingly yes.Wednesday, 18 October 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 2407 compare the cost of your drought assistance package with the cost of the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority. Compare the numbers of people who benefited from each--4,OOO-odd wharfies, $450 million, as against the numbers of farmers in Australia who benefited from the drought reform package. I think that package was worth $260 million, among many tens of thousands of farmers. These peoplehave got it. of the benefits provided by this government for a few thousand wharfies--4,OOO. That is $100,000 payment on average, for the average wharfie who was made redundant. You should look at the numbers of people being employed in the shipping industry in Australia and just compare what that works out to in terms of cost per employee, just out of the grant that you are seeking to pass in legislation here today. I tell you there is no sector in Australian society today which has benefited financially from this government-per employee, per person-as much as the maritime industry of Australia. No other sector in Australian society has received more generous treatment than the way this government has treated maritime industry employees. That is what people have had a gutful about, because you are treating people in a way that is not equitable. It is here in this legislation and, over the past few years, in the way you have handled shipping industry reform, waterfront reform, and indeed the way in which you have handled the privatisation of ANL. There in your management of ANL you have allowed losses of that company to run up to $145 million-losses that we as taxpayers will have to take up. This is not going to be covered by a payment if you can ever sell ANL to P&O-which is not going to happen now. If you look at the losses that we are going to have to pick up you will see that it is $145 million that you have clocked up for the poor old Australian taxpayer. do not wish to sound too sensitive-to refer his remarks through the chair and be a bit more judicious with his use of 'you'. follow the forms of the House. On looking at all of those things the House will see an enormous amount of money that has been spent by this government in one way or another, either through the losses in such shipping companies as ANL or through direct grants such as the ones that are being discussed here in the legislation before the House. The House will see an enormous amount of money going down the drain. Look at the way the government has handled the privatisation of ANL. When it announced that you could not give ANL away-remember that the Minister for Transport said in that famous press conference, 'You could not give it away'-ANL, according to the analysis of most people, indeed several consulting firms, accounting firms and even the Auditor-General's assessment of ANL at the time, giving a positive valuation, was roughly valued at $28 million. That was on the day the Minister for Transport declared, 'You could not give it away.' Because of his actions, his decisions, his incompetence, his preparedness to bend over backwards to the MUA, ANL-if you can sell it today after all this fooling about-will be worth nothing. The taxpayers, as we have seen in this House, will have going through the House a grant of $15 million being made available to assist in the sale of ANL.

So add $15 million to all the other handouts that we have had for the shipping and waterfront industries and you can see for yourself that this government has poured an enonnous amount of money down the drain when it comes to the waterfront and our shipping industries. It might be justifiable to do that if, at the end of the day, we were going to have a world competitive shipping industry or a world competitive waterfront industry. But the fact of the matter is we do not now and we will not. as a consequence of this legislation or other actions undertaken by the government. So all this money is being wasted. All this money is being wasted and achieving nothing, in tenns of helping to make Australia a more competitive and efficient nation and helping Australian businesses to export more products so that we can create more jobs. At the end of the day, all of this is designed to create more jobs. If we have a world efficient waterfront and a world efficient shipping industry, we will create more jobs for Australians. Is it any wonder that we have 8.5 per cent official unemployment and probably 14 or 15 per cent unofficial unemployment? Is it any wonder, when we have a waterfront that is inefficient and is not cost competitive, as is the case in Australia, and we have a shipping industry which is not cost competitive? If we are to take the broader interests of the Australian community to heart, as should be the job of a government, we should be trying to develop as efficient and cost-effective an Australian maritime industry as possible, because the consequence of that will be that we create more jobs for Australians in downstream industries. But this government is not interested in doing that. That is why we have an 8.5 per cent official unemployment level and a great deal higher unofficial unemployment level in Australia. The reason for that is the government's inability to tackle hard areas of refonn, such as the waterfront, the shipping industry, the privatisation of companies such as ANL and industrial relations refonn in Australia. It has refonned many other facets of Australian life but, when it comes to industrial relations refonn, it has been a softly, softly, pour out the money approach that this government has taken. For all of those reasons, the opposition will be opposing this. We believe that the Australian taxpayer has had an absolute gutful of having to fork out more and more money to the maritime industries of Australia to get a second best service out of the maritime industries of Australia. I think it is time the people of Australia stood up to this sort of rort, and we are going to do it on their behalf. the member for Hume( Mr Sharp), mentioned. He was talking about other countries in the world; he did not touch on the fact that other countries in the world have very similar taxation arrangements in relation to their shipping industries to those in the International Shipping (Australian-resident Seafarers) Grants Bill 1995. Most of the bill and the agreements that fonnulated the bill came from other countries' arrangements.

Most countries are well aware of the importance of their coastal shipping and their international shipping. interjections by replying to them. Of course, this was not acknowledged by the previous speaker at all. He implied that this bill had come out of somebody's head and had no relationship whatsoever to international shipping. Well, this bill does. Of course, the coalition mentions selling. The coalition has always had a history of selling anything which is Australian, never protecting, never exploiting and never getting into encouraging Australia. Mr Sharp mentioned wharfies, and he was great at building up what a wharfie got to retire on. I do not think wharfies retire on a lot of money; I am sure that most of us in this House will retire on a lot more than the wharfies retire on. It is a very poor comparison to make. Getting stuck into people who work on the waterfront and who have been made redundant or retired from their job, and somehow giving them a free kick-because kicking wharfies goes down great at a farmers' meeting-is pretty old hat. In today's world, we should be a bit broader in our views. We often hear that we should be looking at industrial relations in a different light and treating things in a different way . We still do not get that from the other side of the House. As I said, it is still looked at in terms of getting a free kick and kicking wharfies at a farmers' meeting. The opposition thinks this gains it some electoral advantage, but the country does not gain at all. The previous speaker also said that other countries, when compared with Australia, had much cheaper shipping. He said that we cannot use crews from the Philippines or Burma which the other countries use. He did not name the other countries because he knows that it is practically impossible to do so. He knows that the reforms that have already taken place in Australia make our shipping rates comparable with the rest of the world. Some other countries have incredibly bad histories in regard to treatment of their seafarers. The honourable member would be well aware of the Ships of shame report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure. He would be aware of this bad treatment in other countries and of the ships that other countries allow to sail the seas of the world. Australia should not be ashamed of its high standard of income and its conditions for seafarers. It should not be ashamed that it sets standards for the rest of the world to come up to. We should not back down. We should not be the lowest common denominator when paying wages: people should not get paid after three months; they should not have dreadful conditions and food. The previous speaker was trying to get us sucked into that and we should not be sucked in. He also said that farmers received a lot less than wharfies or seafarers. I thought that was a very poor analysis of the government's assistance. Farmers, in my electorate, have received very good assistance. I am very proud to say that we were able to assist those who needed assistance due to the droughts in Tasmania. RAS has put millions and millions of dollars into rural Australia. Farmers make great gains from reforms that have already occurred on the waterfront through technologies. I went to the terminal at Botany Bay where 50 per cent reform has occurred in the container area. A lot of that has to do with technology and electronic transfers.

The wharfie driving the forklift gets the information and is better able to stack the yards. When the ship comes in, it is much easier. Those sorts of reforms have taken place and the whole economy of Australia gains from that, including our rural sector. The purpose of the bill is to provide a system of grants to Australian shipowners who undertake international voyages. The grants will place Australian ship operators on a more equitable footing with their overseas competitors in respect of crew costs and provide an incentive for the Australian shipping industry to develop new international trading opportunities. The bill came about because of the restructuring in the shipping industry and the fact that the Australian government's principal objective is to ensure that Australian shippers have continuing access to competitive and efficient liner shipping services which are crucial to expanding trade interests. In September 1994, the Prime Minister( Mr Keating), cabinet ministers, the ACTU and maritime unions met to negotiate an industry reform package. As a result of negotiations, the Treasurer, Mr Ralph Willis, announced that the government had agreed to an introduction of a taxable outlays grant to be paid to owners and operators of Australian registered ships predominantly engaged in international trade. It would offset the impact on owners and operators of personal income tax on the earnings of seafarers on Australia's eligible international trading ships. It should be noted that international shipping is important to Australia because it carries $35 billion worth of goods into Australia and $43 billion worth of exports from Australia. Currently, around 30 Australian operated ships are engaged in international trade. On this basis, the value of grants payable in respect of the first year, 1995-96, will be $19 million payable in arrears in 1996-97. It is a pity that the other part of the arrangement, whereby the unions were looking at developing a consortium to acquire a majority interest in ANL with the government returning a minority shareholding, could not be shaken up and shaken out and made to happen. The unions have come a long way down the track in their reform package, including looking at the reduction in crew sizes, the crewing factors and changes to their employment arrangements. But it seems that it will still be a long time before Australians know whether we will still have a shipping line which we can call Australian or whether we will be at the whim of other nations. The terms of agreement under which this bill was formulated were that the government was planning not to liquidate ANL but to restructure it, which, of course, may make it an economically viable enterprise. It was recognised that the competitiveness of ANL and otJer Australian international shipping operators depends on a range of factors, and they include taxation and industrial arrangements. Although this bill might go part of the way to ensuring that Australians still crew ships working in and out of Australia, it does little to ensure the integrity of the Australian shipping industry with an Australian owned shipping line. The idea for this bill came forward as there was general knowledge among shipowners of other developed nations that they had access to their countries' special fiscal arrangements that were not available to Australian s-ipowners. There is a seven per cent taxable capital grant available but not all ships qualify for this as there are many ships which are chartered by Australians from foreign owners, and the grant does not apply to ships which are chartered or leased from non-Australians. Wednesday, 18 October 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 2411 Most shipowners knew with precision the details of a wide variety of assistance measures made available in a number of OECD countries which were not available in Australia. Japan, the United States of America, France, Germany, Denmark and the United Kingdom were used as examples of differing approaches to international shipping industries. This intelligence was used to demonstrate the impact of different measures on the cost regime of Australian ships. The measures tested had to be commercially, politically and industrially sensitive and had to have equal application to vessels being operated by owners in a variety of commercial circumstances. The common factor was reduction in labour costs, but it was thought this should not be done at the expense of employees on the ships. So it was decided to look at the Danish idea of removing the PAYE element from the employer's gross payroll and that was adopted. It was industrially neutral as it did not encourage the employment of foreign nationals; it was of equal benefit to all operators as it reduced labour costs; and it was politically sustainable as it would apply to Australian taxpayers who were absent from the country for a very substantial period during the year. Thus there was no change to the employees' net pay. So this bill should assist in the growth of Australian shipping. In 1993-94 foreign shipping carrying Australia's external trade accounted for about $2.5 billion of our deficit on net services in the current account. This represented, by itself, 15 per cent of the current account deficit in 1993-94. Any growth of Australian participation in the carriage of Australian external trade will directly contribute to a reduction in the deficit on services in the current account analysis. It seems that operators of coastal shipping are already rearranging their shipping schedules to ensure the eligibility of their ships for a grant under the terms of this bill. The effect of this will be to reduce the operating costs of those ships and the resultant savings will directly benefit the users of coastal shipping services. So although I believe this bill will be useful to help Australian owned and crewed ships, I would still like the whole arrangement to be considered so that ANL still remains part of our culture and our industry, and is owned by Australia. I have great pleasure in supporting the bill. Lyons( Mr Adams) trying to defend the government's position on the International Shipping (Australian-resident Seafarers) Grants Bill 1995 and I am in some difficulty in understanding the line of reasoning. The bottom line is that the government is subsidising ANL to the extent of $20 million in an attempt to buy off the Maritime Union of Australia. They have put pressure on the government by way of strike action and the government has caved in and tried to do a deal with the union in an endeavour to keep Australian ports open. The member for Lyons struggled valiantly to defend that position with some facts and some figures that are not really relevant to the main argument. The situation is that this ANL saga is hopefully coming to a conclusion. We see in this morning's press that it still remains to be finally concluded with a sale to P&O. Again, the MUA are instrumental in preventing that final sale, but I will deal with that in a moment. This particular bill is the legislative conclusion of a deal brokered between the government and the ACTU and the Maritime Union on 13 September 1994 after the MUA had instigated a five-day national strike to gain their point of view. They were worried, as we all know, about the future sale of ANL and what might turn up. The government has been trying to sell ANL since 1991. In September last year the Minister for Transport ( Mr Brereton) relied on one valuation and said, in his classic quote, that ANL 'could not be given away'.",151,Representatives Main Commitfee
393,Mr Mcarthur (Corangamite) (11.01 A.m.),"I have listened carefully to the member forMC 2412 MAIN COMMITIEE Wednesday, 18 October 1995 In the House of Representatives only 10 days ago most of us on our side of politics clearly set out the arguments of the strange and wide range of valuations of ANL that took place, and yet that shipping line has yet to be sold. Minister Brereton sacked the board, put the ANL back for sale and, as of today, we have P&O making the offer of $19.5 million, less the losses that have been accrued from 1 April to 31 October. It is estimated that ANL is losing $2 million a month. So not only has the sale not gone through, but the government is certainly accumulating losses at a rapid rate. The situation we have today is very relevant to this bill. It is worth quoting from an article in the Financial Review today, under the heading 'ANL deal heads for the rocks', which says: The Federal Government's strategy to manage the sale of ANL is in tatters after the refusal of the ACTU secretary, Mr Bill Kelty, to push the powerful maritime union into a deal with the British shipping group P&O. The Government had expected Mr Kelty to salvage the continuing fiasco of the shipping line's proposed sale by getting the unions to agree to terms. So here we have the situation where this very bill was part of the agreement that the government would do a deal with the Maritime Union on the basis that they would avert a strike and that, hopefully, the sale would go through. The article says: ... it now turns out that the only likely exit route Mr Kelty foresees is the same as that pushed by the Maritime Union of Australia: restructuring under continuing government ownership. And it further goes on to say: Bill Kelty has a long history of strong and emotional support for the Maritime Union of Australia, calling it the heart and soul of the labour movement. We have it quite clearly where the ACTU stand and where the Maritime Union stand in the whole argument. The maritime waterfront strike was used for blackmailing purposes, closing the ports for five days in order to get their point of view across. I draw the attention of the parliament to the political blockade that took place in Western Australia only yesterday. It had similar connotations and similar points of view, that is, the Western Australian government, legitimately, were threatening the privileged position of the trade union bosses in that state. They put forward some quite sensible reforms such as secret ballots. could anyone argue with asking the members of any particular work force to have a secret ballot, as they do in shearing sheds to decide whether the sheds will be wet or dry? That has been a secret ballot for the last 50 years. How could the honourable member complain about that? Other reforms included no more political donations from membership subscriptions to a particular party unless people decided to make that particular donation to a political party, a choice of a superannuation fund and not being coerced into a superannuation fund because the union hierarchy told people they had to do it, and ensuring that the unions chose between a state and federal award. They are all quite sensible suggestions and no basis for the major strike which held up the whole of Western Australia yesterday. That strike was purely political, as most Australians would understand, with Perth airport held up and the state transport instrumentalities at a standstill. It was all done for political reasons. Similarly, we have the situation with the MUA using their considerable clout to hold up the ports around Australia just to get their own way. As Greg Bondar, the executive director of",153,Representatives Main Committee

395,Mr Mcarthur,"How could anyone argue with secret ballots before strike action? HowWednesday, 18 October 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 2413 the Australian Chamber of Shipping, estimated, the national waterfront strike cost shipping $55 million. The Australian Chamber of Shipping further estimated that 200 ships had been stuck in Australian ports during the five-day stoppage. To end the strike, which is the key argument, Minister Brereton offered an exemption of PA YE tax for all Australian seafarers engaged in international shipping. That was the deal after all this argument. As usual Minister Brereton said, 'Here's a bit of a deal,' through Mr Kelty, his friend in the ACTU, 'This is the way we will solve it.' Whilst the workers did not receive any additional take home pay, the exemption would make Australian seafarers up to $20,000 cheaper to employ, if you do some of the figures. It is interesting to look at the figures. According to the Australian Shipowners Association, the base rate of pay for crew members is $40,000 per annum. That is not a bad rate of pay by anyone's standards. They have six months on and six months off. Again, that is not a bad set of conditions. They are on board 24 hours a day seven days a week and it is obviously fairly difficult and arduous work-I concede that. They work eight hours a day plus overtime. That is the nature of seafaring activities. The Ships of shame report, which I have been associated with, looked at the problem of crews from overseas. They work from nine to 10 months for considerably less remuneration but it is hard to work out exactly what that is and what the conditions are. Through the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure the parliament has been trying to bring about a better set of conditions at the international level. However, it does not give the government the right, in an industrial dispute, to use taxpayers' money to overcome the problem of the Maritime Union of Australia trying to get the ships and break the strike. The Shipping Industry Reform Authority estimates the savings to this particular taxpayer subsidy would be in the range of $700,000 per annum. Obviously, shipowners are quite happy about receiving, yet again, a taxpayer subsidy to keep their operation going. The key element is the tax break which has been suggested. Mr David Russell of the Taxation Institute of Australia said that the decision to provide PAYE tax breaks would produce a greater complexity in the tax system. We had the remarkable situation where the minister said, 'We'll give a tax break to the maritime seafarers on Australian ships,' and we had a conflict with Treasury and the tax office. Both Treasury and the tax office felt that the concession would be better provided through direct grant payments rather than through tax exemptions. However, as usual, Minister Laurie Brereton was not convinced, and the Australian on 28 December 1994 reported that Mr Brereton believed that the PAYE exemption was 'the least complicated option' and that he was 'confident of winning Treasury support' for his proposal. Needless to say, on this occasion, Treasury won and Minister Brereton lost. It is really an outrageous proposal to suggest that particular workers in the Australian context would have their tax paid by way of a direct government grant. What a remarkable proposition: that Australian seafarers would have Australian taxpayers paying their tax just to win a political deal! The grants that the government is proposing total $19 million per year, just to win a shortterm political impasse between the union movement and the government. The argument was between the government's proposal to sell the ANL-quite legitimately; it has been up-front about that since 1991-and the Maritime Union being unhappy about that. These grants, on MC 2414 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 18 October 1995 the basis on which they were originally proposed, were a blatant breach of the principles of original PAYE tax exemption, and they still remain a pay-off to the union, as I say. The explanatory memorandum of the bill states that the grants are being paid in order to place Australian operators in a better position, 'on a more equal footing with their overseas competitors in respect of crew costs' and will 'provide an incentive for the Australian shipping industry to develop new international trading opportunities'. What a remarkable thing, when ANL has been losing money for most of its existence! The Australian taxpayers-and the government, might I say-are now sick of that and are going to sell the operation. The government is claiming that the grants are being made following a recommendation by Mr Rae Taylor of the Shipping Industry Reform Authority. The Taylor report, issued in August 1994, stated that Australia's international shipping industry faced competitive disadvantages due to high government taxes and charges-I stress that they were high government taxes-as well as inefficient wages and conditions for crew. Some of us, including the member for Shortland ( Mr Peter Morris), have been very close to these arguments over the past few years in terms of improvements, but we note in the Taylor report that government charges were one of the key factors in our shipping arrangements being internationally non-competitive. The Taylor recommendations included a clawing back of the cabotage protection, smaller crew sizes, and tax exemptions for the industry. Following the five-day national waterfront strike, the only recommendation which the government followed up was the PA YE tax exemption, along with a guarantee to the MUA that Australian crewing and award conditions would remain on the ANL. That is the key to the whole argument that P&O is concerned about. If it purchases this particular operation, P&O wants to have its own terms and conditions as it sees fit in a commercial operation; and, of course, the MUA just will not agree with that. The Taylor report was in fact all but ignored, except for the PAYE tax sweetener, and I have indicated to the parliament exactly why that was the situation. It really shows the hypocrisy of the minister claiming that the grants are part of a drive for greater competitiveness. They are simply a sweetheart deal to buy industrial peace from the MUA. Any citizen of Australia who has any understanding of the waterfront and of those arguments would clearly understand this position. It is interesting to look at the arguments of how much ANL carries of our trade. Australian ships, in fact, carry only three per cent of all Australian international trade-a very small percentage-yet we get this major debate and argument about the role of ANL and the conditions of Australian seafarers. As I understand it, there are 21 Australian shipowners and 78 Australian owned and registered flag ships, and 30 of these are involved in international shipping. The grants that have been forward by the parliament will be in respect of 1,000 to 1,200 Australian seafarers. Let us draw a comparison with what the government might do for other sections of the community. On 13 September 1994, at a time when 40,000 Australian farmers were affected by the worse drought on record, the government found only $14 million to assist them. On the one hand, we have 1,200 seafarers who are close to the government and close to Mr Kelty. The seafarers are receiving $20 million and yet the government could find only $14 million to assist farmers who are providing valuable and important export income and there are very carefully regulated conditions about the way in which the assistance could be given. With the farmers, there was not an open cheque as is the situation with the shipowners. The poor old Wednesday, 18 October 1995 MAIN COMMITIEE MC 2415 Australian farmers struggled through that drought as best they could and with very little government assistance because they did not have the entree to the ACTU that the Maritime Union of Australia obviously does. Mr Jack Waterford of the Canberra Times put it very clearly when he wrote an article in 1994 called 'Me too please, Minister, me too!' drawing these comparisons. Mr Waterford said that the political lobbying industry would be thrilled by the deal struck between the government and the MUA. Anyone who wants to get an understanding of how to do a good job just has to have a look at the form guide here. Mr Waterford said: After all, if the shipping industry can get this sort of assistance, why should other sectors not hold their hand out for similar concessions? Mr Waterford, an independent commentator on the situation, drew this comparison. Mr Waterford went on to say: Are not international airline crews in the same position? Could not the wheat industry claim that its international competitiveness is cruelled by domestic taxation arrangements? Why should they not seek $20 million by way of government handout if they decide to hold up international airlines for three days? Why not hold them up for five days and see what the government would do in this situation and what Minister Brereton might offer by way of peace to get the airlines back in the air. Mr Waterford went on to say: The government might find itself not only continuing to send good money after bad, but coping with hordes descending on Canberra claiming that the sailors' treatment is the appropriate precedent for their own situations. Some will seem to have convincing cases-even if they can't blackmail the Government with a $10 million a day strike. But that's the problem with failing to run a consistent tax policy and making little deals for short-term solutions to continuing problems. Mr Charles Armstrong, representing the New South Wales Farmers Federation, said: Do farmers have to take some form of illegal action to get government to help them at this time of drought? Farmers have not engaged in what was an illegal strike. They played by the rules and are yet to gain satisfaction, while militant maritime union members have gained their demands after a six-day strike that threatened Australia's vital export markets. Here we have a very stark comparison between the government's attitude to drought stricken farmers and its attitude to some of its own mates within the trade union movement with the help of Bill Kelty. Bill Kelty is on the record as being very close to the Maritime Union and as saying that they are the heart and soul of the trade union movement. Mr Alan Wood, writing in the Australian, wrote this very interesting piece: Behind this situation is what amounts to a national extortion racket. Mr Wood is a respected commentator. He went on to say: The MUA runs a closed union shop in the maritime industry, protected by the Government and the industrial legislation. As a result of its monopoly position as a seller of maritime labour, the MUA is able to extract wages and employment conditions well above their true market value. Employers have had no choice but to pay up, although since they could pass the cost on in higher port and shipping charges, they have not complained much until recent years, when there has been more pressure from customers as a result of micro-economic reform elsewhere in the economy. This information sums up the situation that the Maritime Union is able to exert considerable pressure on the government. We have the International Shipping (Australian-resident Seafarers) Grants Bill 1995 before the parliament in order to pay $20 million to enhance the conditions of Australian ship-owners as a result of political activity. The situation is not as a result of MC 2416 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 18 October 1995 a sensible, well thought out position of making Australian ships more competitive; it is just more tax payers' dollars in an attempt to keep afloat a small proportion of the international fleet which helps in the export of Australian goods and services and an attempt to keep Australian ports open. It is these blackmail tactics by the MUA which forced the Minister for Transport to provide this assistance to the 1,200 seafarers and we have this amazing situation before the parliament where $20 million is being used to pay for peace on the Australian waterfront. I hope some of the reforms that some of us have seen on the waterfront, in terms of moving containers and better industrial relations, will flow through and continue to improve. I am not one to criticise the waterside workers. I think there are a number of other elements on the waterfront-the stevedores, the shipowners and some of the historical pressures-that need improving. But this particular decision by the government does not encourage anyone on the waterfront to expect that better, more stable and more sensible conditions could prevail. It sets the clock back to a situation where the government, in times of crisis, will always ask the poor old taxpayer to pay up yet again to solve an internal, domestic, political, union problem. regard for him and his contribution to this place than to have expected much of the falsity I have just heard from him. His statement that the Australian taxpayers are paying Australian seafarers' tax by this legislation is completely baseless. It illustrates very clearly how little the opposition understands the legislation. Seafarers do not get one cent from this legislation. They pay their tax, and will continue to pay their tax, like any other Australian taxpayer, worker, manager or executive. For the member for Corangamite to say what he did utterly astounds me. They do not get one cent from it. It is a blatant and a false statement and, really, what it does is confirm the opposition's animosity towards Australian seafarers. It is burnt into the opposition and they cannot help but hammer away at demeaning Australian seafarers. But those seafarers are constituents, they have families, they are part of Australian industry and they are out there in the tough international market. We are looking to all sorts of schemes, programs and forms of assistance to encourage other Australians to go into the export industry, and that is all this is. It is an export measure to try to put Australian shipping on a more equal footing in the international market for the trades. So not one dollar, not one cent, of the measures in this legislation goes to Australian seafarers. The honourable member for Corangamite also makes reference to drought assistance. I do not recall hearing him complain that farmers were not being generously treated and there was consultation and involvement of the farmer organisations. The farmer organisations had some difficulty with the National Party, and with the opposition, but not so much with the government. So that the record shows what we are dealing with, here are some of the ships that are operating in the international trades. In the carriage of natural gas there is the Northwest Sanderling, Sandpiper, Northwest Snipe and the Northwest Storm Petrel, and Ampol's Ampol Sarel. The first ones are all LNG tankers and the Ampol one is a crude tanker. ANL has the Tranztas Trader, the Australian Trader, the Australian Venture and 'the Australian Endeavour, which are cellular container vessels, the Australian Advance and the Anro Australia. The Anro Australia is a RO-RO container vessel and the Australian Advance",154,Representatives Main Commitiee

For BHP, we can go through the Iron Spencer, the Iron Shortland, the Iron Flinders, the Iron Dampier and the Iron Gippsland. There is BP's Australian Achiever, which is a crude oil tanker. Caltex has the Australia Star-another crude oil tanker. Holymans' CHL Innovator is a bulk carrier that carries, internationally, bulk refined sugar. What that is doing is helping Australian sugar get to international markets more competitively in Australian owned and Australian operated vessels. We can add to that CSR's Kowulka. That is also in the bulk sugar trade. Holymans' Alltrans is in bulk trade, Howard Smith's Express is in dry bulk trade and there is Mobil's tanker Mobil Flinders. These are not Australian seafarers. These are names of shipping companies and the vessels they operate in the international trades. There is also Perkins' vessel Frances Bay, which is a RO-RO trader, the Coringle Bay, which is a general trader, and Shell's Nivosa, which is a crude oil tanker. None of those vessels are owned by ANL or by Australian seafarers but they do employ Australian seafarers. The benefit of the International Shipping (Australian-resident Seafarers) Grants Bill 1995 goes to those ship operators to help them to become more competitive in international trade, so offsetting similar measures from our competitors in those international markets. Shipping is an important industry to this country. In 1992-93, our exports totalled more than $60 billion and those commodities included meat, minerals, fuels, manufactures, coal and processed foods. Approximately 70 per cent of our agricultural products and the vast majority of our mineral resources are exported and traded in overseas markets. In this context shipping is a vital component of the nation's economy and of Australia's ability to meet international trade demands. When we turn to Australian shipping, the Australian Shipowners Association, in partnership with the maritime trade unions, has over the last few years embarked on a restructuring of the industry. It is a restructuring that has produced cost savings in the vicinity of $7 million per annum. Australian shipping is now amongst the most labour efficient in the world and crewing levels have been reduced from 30 on average to 18 per vessel. That is lower than OECD levels and well below the world average of 23. In contrast to the increasing age of international ships, which on average is 17 years, the average age of Australian ships is 10 years. It is a younger fleet. Under these circumstances Australia should be recognised as having the capacity to compete with other countries. But crewing costs are not the only costs. There are other advantages that our competitors have by way of tax benefits and tax concessions that are not shared, that will not be available in this country until this legislation passes. The challenge for Australia is to place our shipping on a similar footing to that which operates in the nations of our competitors. That means we need to develop and make markets. We need to be using the same strategy and we need to be using our own vessels for greater export effort. In overseas areas there is a range of assistance mechanisms. Foreign fleets are often heavily subsidised and the ships that carry Australia's trade are in receipt of numerous financial incentives from their governments. Singaporean maritime companies offer Australian seagoing deck officers or engineering officers, recognised by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, remuneration in tax-free US dollars. In other words, if you have an Australian master's ticket, or mate or engineer's certificates, those companies will employ you but they will pay you in Me 2418 MAIN COMMITIEE Wednesday, 18 October 1995 tax-free US dollars. That is the kind of comparison that we have to make with our international traders and with our international fleets here in Australia. On conclusion of employment those companies repatriate those seafarers back to their home port. Companies under the approved international shipping enterprise scheme get a tax exemption for 10 years. Canada in 1991 changed its tax laws to favour the relocation of foreign companies and seafarers so that they could remain competitive with many Asian ports. Cyprus has been attracting many European shipping companies due to the tax incentives it provides and it is now grabbing a large proportion of Russian shipping. But Cyprus also figures prominently as a flag of shame. Cyprus is increasingly a haven for operators of substandard shipping. They are out there in the international market, so not only do they operate, in many cases, with vessels that are substandard but they get considerable benefits and financial incentives that are not available in this country. Denmark has removed the pay-as-you-earn tax element from the employer's gross payroll, making it industrially neutral. Denmark did not encourage the employment of foreign nationals and it had the effect of reducing labour costs. What we are about here is Australia introducing measures to counter these imbalances from foreign countries. The Australian Shipowners Association set it out in the Australian Shipowners Journal of June 1995: If we are to create the jobs and the wealth the Australian community expects we need to do more. We need to increase our share of world trade. In particular, we need to offer our services to the rest of the world. This legislation will place Australian ship operators on a more equal footing with their international competitors in respect of crew costs and provide an incentive to the Australian shipping industry to develop new international trading opportunities. The government's principal aim is to ensure that Australian ship operators have continued access to competitive liner services and are able to expand their trade interests. The grant is, as I said earlier, payable to employers who are Australian nationals. It is not payable to Australian seafarers. They pay their taxes and are in exactly the same position as any Australian taxpayer. Under the legislation. to qualify for the benefit a vessel must be engaged in international voyages, with a minimum number of days being half of its operation days.

Before the suspension I was about to say that manyWednesday, 18 October 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 2419 For decades, as policy advisers to government, they have sold out our national shipping interests, while fostering what were often minuscule land based industries. Why are they doing that, when we can see to the north of us that the Asian nations-Malaysia, Singapore and the Philippines-are all pushing and developing their international shipping industries and their ports as international ports? With the policy advice going forth to successive governments in this country, irrespective of the political complexion of those governments, it is no wonder, on looking back, that the policies have been against Australian shipping and against Australian seafarers. Vessels are able to visit more than one port under the provisions of the bill, as long as the volume of their domestic or Australian coastal cargo does not exceed the total mass of their international cargo. Provision in the legislation enables shipping operators to broaden their trade base and engage in both domestic and international operations. The basic amount paid for each seafarer berth to the employer is essentially the amount of income tax that would have been paid by the person occupying it. The bill recognises Australia's exclusive economic zone and extends the provision to an anchorage in the zone or the fishing grounds on the high seas, and this takes account of Australia's vast maritime territory. It enables vessels operating in these areas to meet the competitive challenges that are presented to them when they seek to trade against other international companies. So the government is, in this legislation, honouring its commitment. The government is in agreement with the Australian Shipowners Association, which stated that tax concessions on the cost of employing Australian seafarers and Australian vessels which spend more than half of their time in international trades would be economically and socially sensible. That is why this provision has been introduced. It will help make Australian shipping a more competitive industry and it will help attract foreign investment. The opposition is paying lip-service to Australian shipping interests, lip-service which varies from downright opposition to the actual mouthing of words of support which the opposition has no intention of carrying forward in practice. Australian seafarers and Australian seafaring unions do not receive one cent of the payments to be made under this legislation. I made that point on several earlier occasions. The tax that would have been paid by the Australian seafarers is taken by the qualifying Australian shipping companies, and it will help place those employers on a fairer footing when compared with their international competitors. I have outlined the financial assistance that is already available to some of these international competitors. The opposition goes further in its dishonesty, and claims that tax rebates are now payments to ANL. All Australian ship operators who meet the conditions of the legislation will benefit, the major ones being BHP and the oil companies. I mentioned and listed those ships and the companies that will benefit, and that list includes Howard Smith, Shell, Caltex, Ampol, Mobil and ANI. But I want to see the list grow. I want to see more Australian companies seeking out opportunities in international shipping, and this legislation will go part of the way to creating greater opportunities for Australian based shipping operations. . Australia has a good name in international shipping circles for competence and responsibility. Australia is playing a major role internationally, particularly at the International Maritime Organisation, in ridding our seas of substandard ships and their immoral crew practices. This parliament's Ships of shame report of 1992 has received worldwide acclaim and support, and it has played a major role in much of the reform that is going on internationally. Australian MC 2420 MAIN COMMfITEE Wednesday, 18 October 1995 ship officers are in demand overseas. Why? They are in demand because Australian training and Australian skills have worldwide recognition. Australian maritime credentials are quality credentials, especially where seaboard tasks are comprehensive and complex. Yet those skills and their standing are not given recognition in Australia, especially by major companies in Australia or by senior bureaucrats at the federal level, who seem obsessed with putting down Australian seafarers and Australian shipping interests. Nations much smaller than Australia, especially the traditional shipping nations like Norway, know the benefits to be gained from an effective shipping industry. We have a solid base to work from, as the fifth largest market in the world on a cargo distance-carry basis, but our problem is that we lack the will from Australian companies to invest. Most are content to be captive customers of foreign shipping lines in the carriage of international trade. Norway, with less than one-quarter of Australia's population, knows the trade benefits to be gained from international shipping. Norway generates less than ->De per cent of the world's trade, yet Norwegian shipping companies own almost 10 per cent of the world's fleet, and they do this by working hard to carry other nation's trade in their ships. assistance from government. Shipping is at the foundation of the entire range of Norwegian maritime activities, which go far beyond shipping itself. This is one of the things that drives me with Australian shipping. Shipping is not just about shipping: it is one link in the chain. In Norway, other related activities are shipbuilding, manufacturing of ships' equipment, financing, ship-broking, insurance, legal services, classification, and education and research. It is estimated that in a population of 4% million people, between 60,000 and 70,000 people are involved in activities related to the shipping industry. We in this country can learn a lot from that. The World Bank has estimated that the total cost of upgrading and renewal of the world fleet will be approximately $50 billion by the year 2000. The investment in new tonnage that is required over the next decade is an investment that Australia ought to be sharing in-but we are not, because of the attitudes that develop and exist in this country. In supporting this bill, I want to make it so very clear that this is about helping the Australian shipping industry become more competitive; it is about helping the Australian shipping industry to get out there in the marketplace; it is about encouraging other Australian companies to invest in the shipping industry. It is not about a handout to Australian seafarers at all. They do not get one cent of it. It is not about a handout to ANL, as members of the opposition have tried to put to us earlier. The legislation, and the proposals that it contains, come from the shipping industry itself. It is similar to many other forms of industry assistance that we have in this country. We have an industry with a solid base from which to work. What that industry needs is recognition; it needs support, and it needs support for the people who work in the industry, so that Australia uses the income that will come from international sea freight to reduce our invisible deficit. Marine insurance is linked closely to this. Very little of our international cargo is insured with Australian companies, even those companies that are world-competitive. The simplest example is iron ore. It is corporate policy by purchasers in Japan that iron ore must be insured with Japanese insurance companies. There are 16 major insurance companies in Japan.

Whichever one you deal with, you get the same rate. But even though Australian marine insurance companies are world-competitive in the rates they can offer on that cargo, they do not get the business. That is something that has to be addressed at government level, and at the parliamentary level. It is certainly a matter that I have been proposing to put forward in discussions through APEC. Although this is a non-tariff barrier-it is corporate policy-marine insurance is another area industry, linked to shipping, in which Australia is world-competitive. Those non-tariff barriers are preventing us from getting our fair share of the market. I commend the legislation to the Committee. the International Shipping (Australian-resident Seafarers) Grants Bill 1995, although I am wondering why a bill which is clearly contested by the opposition is being debated in this place, which is supposed to be dealing with non-controversial legislation. There was a division in the main chamber a short while ago, and we had to close down the Main Committee. That fact indicates that we need to refine the operations of this Committee. Clearly, there is a glitch in the system when this Committee must close down because of a division in the other place. I realise that this problem will be one of the matters looked at by those who will review the operations of the Main Committee as part of the parliamentary process. As indicated by the honourable member for Hume( Mr Sharp), the coalition does not support the legislation and will be voting against it in a division, presumably in the main chamber, at a later time. I listened carefully to some of the contributions made by government members and in particular to that by the honourable member for Lyons( Mr Adams). It is sad that he clearly has no idea of the major problems confronting shipping around our coastline. Indeed, it is clear that the government is bereft of ideas. We are a maritime nation. We have a very long coastline with many ports and yet, because of mismanagement in the shipping industry and because of unrealistic wages and conditions, we now have a situation where we have almost no coastal shipping and almost no maritime tourist ships. The old days of the Manunda and the Manoora, when they used to go right around the Australian coastline, are gone. That is tragic. As a maritime nation, we should be encouraging the use of the sea lanes and shipping as a means of tourism, transport and trade around our country. As we become more concerned about our environment, we ought to recognise that superhighways and railways might well be very good and necessary, but one of the cleanest, most efficient and environmentally sensible ways of conveying goods around our coastline is through use of the shipping industry. It is a tragedy that most of the Australian shipping industry seems to have died this century. It is non-competitive. ANL is essentially on its last legs and the government ought to rethink the whole problem because it is an important area. It is in the national interest. The bill before the House does very little to solve the difficulties that I have outlined. When one looks at the explanatory memorandum to the bill, one is given a misleading indication of what the bill is supposed to be about. The honourable member for Hume pointed out that the bill is all about a union deal. It is all about the arrangements that were made with the maritime unions on 13 September 1994. It is a bribe on the government's part to bring to an end the national maritime strike over the privatisation of ANL. That strike went for a",162,Representatives Main Commfitee
404,Mr Slipper (Fisher) (12.04 P.m.),"I am pleased to have the opportunity of speaking onMC 2422 MAIN COMMITIEE Wednesday, 18 October 1995 number of days, tens of millions of dollars were lost, the government capitulated and the result is the bill currently before the chamber. It is instructive to look at some of the media comment relating to that sordid deal entered into by the government, which is, as we all know, a government of the deals. A couple of days ago in the House we heard about a meeting involving the Prime Minister( Mr Keating), Mr Solomon Lew and Mr Lindsay Fox. Of course, the Prime Minister did not come clean and tell us what that deal was about. We do not really know. Ultimately, we will find out. The deal entered into by the government was closed on 13 September 1994. In an article by Steve Burrell in the Financial Review of 14 September 1994 headed 'Union gun to its head, Govt sinks back under flag,' a few home truths were pointed out. I would like to quote from that article: The Keating government would like to pass off its agreement to end the maritime dispute as a wideranging package of micro-economic reforms. It has, in fact, passed up a great opportunity to achieve genuine and long overdue reforms in Australian shipping. It could have used this damaging confrontation as a catalyst to bring the long-standing problems in the industry to a head. Undoubtedly this would have meant toughing out a long and damaging strike. Instead, faced with the equivalent of a gun held to the economy's head by the maritime unions, it decided that it had no option but to compromise. For the unions (and the local shipping owners) this exercise in brinkmanship has netted a pretty sweet deal. The 'pretty sweet deal' means that there will be taxpayers' money paid in the first year of an amount of approximately $19 million and the net impact over the next five years to 30 June 2000 could be $59 million after tax. So we have a situation where the taxpayer is, yet again, funding and propping up the shipping industry which, in many respects, has only itself to blame for the difficulties in which it finds itself. Sadly, the government has rejected a number of recommendations in the Taylor report on reform of the industry. One of those rejected recommendations related to the establishment of a second register of Australian-owned vessels which will be permitted to use foreign crews. In other words, the future of shipping is not very different from its uncompetitive past, slowly sinking under an Australian flag with Australian crews and Australian award conditions. The government will effectively increase the subsidy for international shipping by providing new tax breaks on crew wages and depreciation. The International Shipping (Australian-resident Seafarers) Grants Bill 1995 is the legislative instrument through which the government's deal will be implemented. Also, on 14 September 1994 the Financial Review had another article under the headline 'Canberra goes ANL retentive,' which stated: THE Federal government has bowed to Maritime Union demands offering tax breaks for Australian shipping and ruling out full deregulation of the industry in return for an end to the five-day national waterfront strike. The Government has also guaranteed that cheaper foreign vessels and foreign crews will continue to be kept out of the coastal trade. As well, the Government acceded to union demands to give its financially troubled shipping line, ANL Ltd, another chance to prove its commercial viability. Wednesday, 18 October 1995 MAIN COMMITIEE MC 2423 We all know the sad and sorry history of the proposed sale of ANL. We all know about the infamous comments made by the Minister for Transport ( Mr Brereton). I think it was in August 1994 when he said, basically, that we could not give away ANL. Yet again this minister is indicating his total, complete and utter incompetence. The bill currently before the House commits the government to certain steps which are being implemented in the legislation, but the unions only committed themselves to consider negotiating an industrial reform package including further reducing crew size and the crewing factor, changing employment arrangements so that costs matched those under company employment and a long-term wage agreement and reduced training costs. Basically, what they said was, 'We will think about these matters' while the government said it would implement this bill. Clearly, the unions have got the better end of the bargain. There was a very interesting diagram in the Financial Review of 14 September 1994 under the heading 'Unions win in shipping deal' where it says: Government agrees to: Keep foreign vessels and foreign crews off Australian coastal services. Keep ANL commercially viable with Australian crews and award conditions. Give a union consortium a chance to buy a majority shareholding in ANI. that clearly is not going to happenConsider tax breaks worththey estimated thenabout $18 million to the shipping industry and $5 million to ANL each year. Unions agreed to consider: More reductions in ship crew sizes and crew holidays. Guarantee industrial peace. Other efficiency measures as part of a new industrial package. As we stand today, the other changes the unions agreed to consider have not been implemented. Australian shipping remains uncompetitive. More money continues to be lost and when one looks at some of the employment conditions which used to exist-two crews per ship and so on, and everyone agrees now that these were unsustainable-it is no wonder that Australian shipping has been reduced to its current sad and sorry state which is resulting in the industry putting out its hand for more taxpayer funds. The government has made a lot of air play of reduction in crewing levels. I concede that there have been some reductions in crewing levels. The honourable member for Shortland ( Mr Peter Morris) mentioned before that some Australian ships have fewer members of the crew than some overseas ships. He cited the Norwegian example. No-one could deny that Norway is a very efficient shipping nation. Part of the problem is not the number of crew members on a particular ship but rather what they do when they are there. At the present time. I am told that crew levels and costs could be tolerated if the crews would perform the same tasks as crews on rival lines. I would like to quote from the Bulletin of 6 June 1995 which stated: In particular, Australian crews do not carry out maintenance, such as overhauling engines and scraping off rust while the ship is operating. This means that an ANL ship will spend more time in dry dock than one from a rival line. MC 2424 MAIN COMMITIEE Wednesday, 18 October 1995 Of course you do not need to be a mental genius to appreciate that, when we have that kind of hiccup in the system, ANL is simply not going to be as competitive as overseas shipping lines. The article continues: The cost-both directly and in lost business---could run to an extra $1 million ... for each ANL ship, putting the line at a heavy disadvantage even without considering the customers it loses because services are curtailed. The lack of ... ongoing maintenance also means that the life of an ANL ship is about 15 years, whereas rivals can stretch theirs to 25 or 30 years. When one looks at the capital cost of shipping in Australia, it is clearly a major commercial benefit if an overseas shipping line is able to extend the life of its vessels from 15 years to 25 or 30 years. It is interesting to note the next point: The actual crew wages only amount to about 3% of ANL's total operating costs, but these other factors blowout to about 9% and really start to wound the line. The cost of the crews is less important than the fact that they don't do enough. Japan provides another instance. Some of their manning levels are actually more than the manning levels on Australian ships but those extra people are used to keep the ship shipshape, they are used for ongoing maintenance, they are used in many other ways, whereas I do not know what some of our people on ships do. I do not know whether they play volleyball or whatever. The simple fact of the matter is that we might have fewer people but they do less than overseas seafarers would do, and the result is that Australian shipping is yet again uncompetitive. It is unfortunate that the government is coming into the parliament again to seek up to $59 million of taxpayers' money to be given to the shipping industry over the next five years. It has been pointed out that the seafarers will not receive any of this money, and I concede that, but the bottom line is that the taxpayer is funding this. It is another prop-up to an industry which has allowed itself, through varying causes-partly its own and partly other factors-to be uncompetitive. The coalition is opposed for a range of reasons to what the government is seeking to do. We stress that it is wrong for the parliament to give effect to a deal which everyone concedes to be shonky. It is a deal which the government entered into with the unions as the price for the unions abandoning a very costly strike, and the government is asking us, the members of the Commonwealth parliament, in effect to rubber-stamp this deal to give benefits to the shipping industry-in effect, the government's pay-off to the unions. The government, with an election just a few months away, if that, is clearly trying to build bridges with the unions. We know what an important role the unions played in the election of the government during the 1993 election. The government will be talking to unions; the government will be seeking to trade off deals because this government is the government of the shonky deal. The government, through this legislation, is clearly seeking to get a major sector of the trade union movement on side so that the trade union movement, when advertising takes place prior to the election, will give full support to the programs of the government. The explanatory memorandum portrays the government as trying to put Australian operators on a more equal footing with their overseas competitors in respect of crew costs and providing an incentive for the Australian shipping industry to develop new international trading opportunities. Wednesday, 18 October 1995 MAIN COMMITIEE MC 2425 I want to see the Australian shipping industry compete, but really we need to go back to basics. We need to look very much more closely at the major structural problems which prevent the Australian industry from being anywhere near as competitive as it should be. These handouts which the government keeps asking the parliament to approve are no long-term answer to the major difficulties confronting the Australian shipping industry. The incentive which the government is seeking to have implemented through this legislation is a taxable grant payable to the employers of Australian seafarers on Australian operated ships engaged in international trade. The amount of the grant would be equal to the notional tax payable on the earnings of seafarers serving on that ship. To qualify, a ship must be Australian operated, its crews must be employed by an Australian employer and the ship must spend not less than half its operational service during the year on international voyages. It is interesting to note that some shipping lines are already changing their schedules to try to take advantage of the particular benefits for them included in this legislation. At present, we have about 30 Australian operated ships engaged in international trade and the grant in the first year will be approximately $19 million. The grants are taxable, so that about one-third can be expected to be recouped in 1997-98 because corporation tax payments are lagged by a year. The after-tax impact for each additional ship entering the international trade would be about $400,000 per year. If one ship enters the trade each year, the net impact after tax would be $59 million over the five years to 30 June 2000. I mentioned that if it was possible-and I believe it is possible-to have crews on Australian ships doing the variety of work that crews do on ships operating in other countries, we would achieve a benefit of $1 million per ship. Clearly, if that could be attained, it would not be necessary to bring in this legislation which hands a benefit of about $400,000 with respect to each ship involved in international trade. The coalition is totally opposed to this legislation. We will be voting strongly in the main chamber when this bill is voted on after its return there. We simply will not be a party to this union deal. We will not go along with what the government has sought to do. We do not believe that this is an appropriate response to the very major problems confronting the Australian shipping industry, and the minister stands condemned. In fact, it is a wonder that the government allows this minister to remain as the minister for transport because he has a sad and sorry history of mistakes and being quite inept in so many areas of his portfolio. We do not even see him here in the Main Committee; it is, perhaps, beneath him to come here. But the government has come in here and asked us to approve the allocation of up to $59 million over five years. What the government should be doing is looking at the major and ongoing problems which have reduced our shipping industry to the sad and sorry chaos that it is-a sad and sorry chaos that saw the government knuckle down and saw it run up the white flag when we had the strike last year. We will not accept what the government is seeking to do. We hope that the government reconsiders this matter, because an Australian shipping industry is important. Shipping around this continent is absolutely vital and what we need are policies which will encourage and foster the growth of shipping, whether it be Australian or overseas shipping. We need to encourage shipping as a means of tourism, to bring tourists here and bring them around the Australian coastline. We need to encourage it as a means of transport, and as a means of communication. MC 2426 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 18 October 1995 But, unfortunately, there is absolutely nothing in this bill before the Main Committee which is going to improve the long-term future of the industry. There is absolutely nothing that is going to make it viable. I think this bill speaks for itself. It is a bill to implement a shonky deal and the coalition will have absolutely no part of it. for Fisher( Mr Slipper). It is interesting that this bill, the International Shipping (Australianresident Seafarers) Grants Bill, is being dealt with in the Main Committee. As has been outlined today, the coalition proposes to vote against this bill, so at the conclusion of the debate it will end up back in the main chamber. If nothing else, the way that the government, and particularly the Minister for Transport ( Mr Brereton), has dealt with the whole issue of ANL has been an interesting saga-and a sad and sorry one. The government is in the grips of a massive asset sale program and has been in that position for a number of years. It has not achieved a great deal of success as far as asset reduction is concerned. This bill we are dealing with has a very clear and definite impact on the government's asset sale campaign, particularly with regard to the sale of ANL. It was announced by the Treasurer ( Mr Willis) on 9 May 1995 when the government was in the process of attempting to negotiate the sale of ANL after the Minister for Transport had made his infamous announcement that 'you couldn't give it away'. Subsequently, the government flogged off the most profitable part of the ANL group, which was the stevedoring section. The whole sorry saga, interestingly enough, caused Laura Tingle to write an article in the Australian earlier this year. In that article she refers to exactly what we are debating here today in relation to this bill. In that article, headed 'Labor's behaviour in flogging our shipping line has been disgraceful', Laura Tingle stated: And a small technicality of the ""sale"" for ""$19.5 million"" is that, whatever P&O is buying in terms of assets, taxpayers get to keep $183 million in liabilities which the British-owned shipping line doesn't want. She went on to say: Last year, facing a likely rebuff on the sale, already delayed for four years, by the ALP national conference, Brereton selectively released details of a valuation of ANL which showed it had a negative value-and which he used to justify his decision to withdraw it from sale. Of course, we all know that behind the scenes of withdrawing it from sale was the Maritime Union of Australia, which was exerting a bit of pressure, as it always does, on the Labor Party. One of the Labor members. I think it was the member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell)-stated here a few weeks ago, in the main chamber of the House of Representatives of this parliament, that she was 'proud' to be a member of the political wing of the ACTU. That is on the Hansard record. She is a member of the government of Australia-<iisgraceful. I go back to Laura Tingle's article. She went on to say: Soon after this, he rammed through the sale of the shipping line's only decent asset, a 25 per cent interest in Australian Stevedores ... As I said before, they sold off the most profitable part of ANL. Interestingly enough, at the end of the article, Ms Tingle noted: Brereton was in such a hurry to do this that he agreed via mobile phone from a funeral to a deal letting the supposedly financially wrecked ANL lend the money to the buyer without firm security. In terms of this debate, the important part of this article that Laura Tingle wrote was at the end of article. It said:",163,Representatives Main Committee
405,Mr Vaile (Lyne) (12.24 P.m.),"I agree with the previous speaker, the honourable memberWednesday, 18 October 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 2427 The deal had another price: an ongoing $20 million a year support bill for local mariners. That is what this bill that we are debating today is all about: an ongoing $20 million a year support bill for mariners. Who foots that bill? Who covers the cost that the government is asking us all to commit to today? It is the taxpayers of Australia. The taxpayers of Australia have absolutely been bled dry by the mismanagement of ANL. At the same time, and in the same article, we saw that the minister spent almost $1 million of taxpayers' funds on the you-beaut pair of whiz-kids-the mates-that are supposedly getting ANL out of the mire. They have achieved nothing. The value has gone down. We have not $1 million retainer. They have been paid almost $1 million of taxpayers' money to try and salvage ANL, to get it up and running so that we can sell it and get some profit for Australia for the Australian taxpayers. We have seen nothing. Now we are asked to sign off on a bill that is going to spend almost $20 million a year of taxpayers' money . We must ask the question: on what? It is interesting. What is the purpose of the bill? The purpose of the bill, according to the Bills Digest from the library, is to provide for a system of grants-'grants' is an interesting word to use-to Australian shipowners who undertake international voyages. According to the explanatory memorandum, the grants will: ... place Australian shipowners on a more equal footing with their overseas competitors in respect of crew costs and provide an incentive for the Australian shipping industry to develop new international trading opportunities. When you dig into it a little deeper, what is the money really being spent on? The money is really being spent on the arrangement that was made with the unions earlier this year. In September 1994, the Prime Minister( Mr Keating), senior cabinet ministers, the ACTO and the Maritime Union met to negotiate an industry reform package. As a result of those negotiations, Treasurer Willis announced via a press release on 9 May 1995 that the government had agreed to the introduction of a taxable outlays grant-taxable in the hands of the companies, so that there is company tax payable on it-to be paid to owners and operators of Australian-registered ships predominantly engaged in international trade, to offset the impact on owners and operators of personal income tax on the earnings of seafarers on Australia's eligible international trading ships. The grant is to be administered by the Department of Transport. Subsidising the PAYE tax that is paid by members of the Maritime Union of Australia is what it is all about. The bill goes on to talk about eligibility but, interestingly enough, Australian flag shipping carries only four per cent of Australia's foreign trade, and ANL is not the major carrier of this portion. We are supposedly providing a subsidy, and it is interesting to look at this in terms of the overall public policy direction in which the government is going, as far as subsidies and tariff protection for Australian industry are concerned. Everybody else in this country has had the barriers in front of them tom down by this government. There is no protection. 'Get out there on the world stage and become world competitive: no protection for you!' Australia, as a nation in the international marketplace, has led the way in tariff and subsidy reduction, ahead of any signing of the Uruguay Round. I noted in some of the information I researched to speak on this bill that the Uruguay Round on free trade and 'detariffication' did not get to international transport or international shipping. That was left out. That is all well and good, but this Labor government of Australia has hurtled down the path of 'detariffication', pulling down those barriers which are protective walls for",168,Representatives Main Committee
406,Seen A Sale. They,"that is, one Mr Turnbull and one Mr Wran-have been paid their almostMC 2428 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 18 October 1995 a lot of Australian industry. Australian industry has been told, 'You get out there and compete and become world competitive!' Here today, we are heading back in the other direction by providing assistance and a subsidy, in a roundabout fashion. All the commentary on the bill says that it is supposed to make our shipping lines more world competitive. But does not that beg the question of why our shipping lines are not world competitive? Everywhere else, we are expected to be world competitive without any assistance, subsidy or tariffs. Why are they not world competitive? The taxpayers of Australia need to ask that question. The bill is born out of a deal with the Maritime Union of Australia, whereby Minister Brereton wanted things to go along quietly while he was trying to sort out his unbelievable mess with the Australian National Line. As a buy-off as far as that union was concerned, the minister said he was going to provide a subsidy, supposedly to international shipping. But it is all about keeping the union happy, because that is where it is ending up. It is going to the companies, but it is ending up back with the unions. Fair enough! But let us be fair about the whole thing. We say to our primary producers and manufacturing industries, 'Get out there and compete on the world stage, without any assistance from this government.' This is one of the reasons that our primary industries cannot compete: they have had their hands tied by the lack of true micro-economic reform as far as the transport industry is concerned. We have seen the decisions that this government has made as far as tearing down those tariff barriers and subsidy mechanisms is concerned. In its haste to be one of the gang and one of the big players on the world market as far as free trade is concerned, Australia has led the way. We have pulled down our tariff levels and then we have gone off and signed up in the Uruguay Round of the GA'IT to reduce them by a percentage each year, starting from a lower base than everybody else is on. I am yet to be convinced that, in that area, we are ever going to end up on a footing level with some of our competitors around the world, because we are starting low and coming down, while they are starting up high. The most salient point is that we are telling all our other industries in Australia to go out and become more efficient, ,to become more effective, to become better producers and to compete on the world stage, yet we are not asking this industry to compete. We are not asking this industry to have a close look at itself and ask itself why it cannot compete. What are we doing? We are providing the industry with a subsidy which is going to end up back at the level that I spoke of earlier, on the premise that it is going to make this industry more world competitive. Do you know what? It will not. It will not work. It never has. And it never will work, for the same reasons that we have had to make all our primary industries, all our manufacturing industries, cut the fat, get rid of the fat, have a close look at their process and work out why they really are not competitive. It did not work there and now those industries are competing, not because of anything the government has done but because they have had a long, hard look at their process and they have found ways and means to become more world competitive. There is a long way to go in that area, where a future government might be able to help them. But this measure by this government will not go anywhere near helping the shipping lines become more world competitive. Of course some of the industry organisations are going to agree. They are getting a handout. That has never helped anybody get off their butt and go and compete and make themselves productive and efficient. It just will not work. History will prove this government wrong in putting this bill before the parliament today and asking us to sign off on it. Wednesday, 18 October 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 2429 On that basis, the opposition is not going to sign off on it. We are going to oppose this bill because it is not right. It is heading in the opposite direction from what this government is expecting of most other industries in this country. On that basis we are going to oppose it. As I say, history will record that this government is heading in the wrong direction and that this sort of measure will not achieve what it is designed to do in helping the shipping industry to be more competitive. The government knows where it has to head to to make Australian shipping more competitive and this is not that direction. I think that it is important that these comments be recorded and that the government be made aware that, as I said before, it is not fooling the people in the press gallery, it is not fooling the people that are informing the people of Australia on what is going on. I will just repeat the comments of Laura Tingle, because I think they are just a classic. I used this in a speech when we were debating the ANL Sale Bill a couple of weeks ago. I do not know that Laura Tingle is really a great fan of the coalition either, but her headline was, 'Labor's behaviour in flogging our shipping line has been disgraceful.' In part of that article she said, 'The deal had another price: an ongoing $20 million a year support bill for local mariners.' That puts it in a nutshell. It is nothing to do with making Australian shipping more competitive. It is a $20 million a year support bill for local mariners, and it is a disgrace. As she said, the behaviour of the Labor Party in flogging the Australian shipping line has been disgraceful. The coalition will oppose this bill. Employment, Education and Training) (12.39 p.m.}-It is my happy duty to sum up on this debate. I was parliamentary secretary to the minister for transport some years ago and I think the member for Hume( Mr Sharp) was then the shadow minister. He is still the shadow minister and I do not think he has learnt a great deal over that time. WhatI am astounded by is his absolute lack of regard for the reforms that have already taken place in the Australian shipping industry, which seem to be ignored totally by the opposition, and the rather gratuitous advice they seem to be giving the Australian community about the way in which the shipping industry is performing. It is worth contemplating, as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Dr Theophanous) outlined in the second reading speech, just one aspect of the reform process which has taken place. In 1983 a typical Australian trading ship had a crew of 33. The opposition would have us believe that nothing has changed since 1983. Has something changed? Has it or has it not? Have we improved the crew rates on Australian flag vessels? Simple answer, yes or no. Answer-yes. We will not hear of opposition members saying to the community that the reform measures activated by this government-not by a coalition government-have not had a dramatic impact on crew rates. When the coalition was in government before 1983 and when we came into government in that year the figure was 33. What is it today? Do you know the answer? Eighteen. Do you think that is some improvement? Do you think it might be just a marginal improvement, or do you think it is a dramatic improvement? were well in excess of OECD levels; today our crew levels are lower.",169,Representatives Main Committee

I presume that the three opposition members who are in the chamber at the moment have read the bill and the second reading speech. Of the three major components to this bilI, the one which seems to have incurred the ire of the opposition concerns the grants that are payable, based on the tax liabilities of seafarers in Australia's international trading ships. The opposition would have us believe that somehow this benefit was going to the employees, that a direct financial benefit would accrue to the employees-the seafarers. Opposition members know that is not true. If there is a benefit, it goes to the shipowners. Listening to opposition members, one would think it was going just to ANL. In fact, they know it is n(lt and that other shipping companies such as BHP Transport will also benefit. I am not going to canvass all of the issues in this debate but, to have some integrity in public life, you could surely accept that, even though you may not agree with everything the government does-and I do not expect you ever will-you might at some stage accept that there has been dramatic improvement, dramatic micro-economic reform, in the shipping industry in Australia and that this bill is part of that reform process. If you were genuinely interested in competitive shipping for Australia, you would acknowledge that. But we do not hear any acknowledgment of it; all we hear are disparaging comments about these shipping industry reforms and disparaging comments about the Minister for Industrial Relations ( Mr Brereton). Both views are out of order because the shipping industry supports these reforms. As shadow minister you do not support them but the shipping industry does, and if you were in touch with your shadow portfolioI had to remind the honourable member for Hume earlier in the debate, to be judicious and careful with his use of the word 'you'Speaker. minister-who actually lives very close to Canberra, I might say, and not very close to the sea-needs to be aware that these reforms are supported by the shipping industry. If it is not the waterfront, it is the shipping industry we continue to hear about, which amazes me. We hear opposition members saying there have not been adequate reforms on the waterfront, that we have not improved our competitiveness, that this is not a legitimate process in microeconomic reform. This Labor government-not a conservative government-has implemented reforms which are being supported and will be supported in the future by the industry. It seems to me very important that we acknowledge that, even though our opponents seem very reluctant to do so.
