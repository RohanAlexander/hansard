2,Dr. Evatt,"I desire to ask the Australian and Dnited Kingdom Governments have not appeared in official statements of those who have been present at these conferences. provision has been made for the direct representation of any particular government at the discussions which are being conducted on behalf of the United Nations. ' Steps are being taken to put the' negotiators in full possession of the views of the Australian Government which, I believe, will be the views of this House. BOYA L AUSTRALIAN AIR FORCE. acting for the Minister for Air advise the HOUK? of his views on a recent report to the effect that the security of the Royal Australian Air Force establishments in New South Wales, particularly at Eastern Area Head-quarters, near Penrith, are unsatisfactory ? individuals gained entry to the grounds of Eastern Area Head-quarters of the Royal Australian Air Force and that photographs of the establishment were taken. It was claimed that this was evidence of the lack of the existence of adequate security precautions. The grounds of this head-quarters establishment are quite extensive and the requirements of security do not make it essential that individuals should be entirely excluded from them. There are secret papers in the operations' room and signals establishment, but these are guarded twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week by armed guards of the Royal Australian Air Force. I understand that the individuals in question gained entry to the grounds, which contain gardens, trees, a few dogs, lamp posts, and other fittings which are not of a secret nature. I do not believe that this report is evidence of the lack of the existence of security measures, or of any neglect on the part of the Royal Australian Air Force. attempted to gain access to the secret papers in. this head-quarters they would find themselves confronted by a very tough proposition. I do not think it practicable to direct the Royal Australian Air Force to put a ring of guards around the head-quarters which would stop any meddlesome individual from getting into the grounds. That would be a waste of trained personnel. From my knowledge of the circumstances, I am' still unconvinced that there is any lack of security precautions at this or any other Royal Australian Air Force head-quarters. representing the Minister for National Development approximately how many part-time students under the Commonwealth reconstruction training schemeare attending the University of Melbourne? Further, is the Minister aware that university fees have been increased, so that now part-time students under the Commonwealth reconstruction training scheme can do only a fraction of the required subjects that they were able to do during the term of office of the previous Administration? Will tbe Minister consider a revision of the grant in connection with the Commonwealth reconstruction training scheme to give such part-time students tbe advantages that were originally intended? in relation to that matter in my head, but I shall obtain them and see that they are supplied to the honourable gentleman. I shall submit the honourable gentleman's suggestion regarding an increased grant to the Minister for National Development, who is in another place, and I am sure that he will give consideration to it.

Was the speech, as rebroadcast over Radio Moscow, a correct report of the speech that was made by the senator? If it was a correct report, does the right honourable member and his party share the sentiments that were expressed by Senator Morrow which reflected on the United Nations and Australian forces in tbe field? If the right honourable member and.his party do not share those sentiments, will they make a public repudiation of them? Speaker. Under what standing order can an honourable member ask a question of an honourable member who is not a Minister, the Chairman of Committees, or the Speaker? Order 143 statesQuestions may bo put to a member, not being a Minister, relating to any bill, motion, or other public matter connected with the business appear in all capital cities. Nor is it oi the House, of which the member has charge. So far as my knowledge goes, the Leader of the Opposition is in complete charge of the Labour party as its leader in this House and therefore I think that the question is in order. I may add that it is n matter for the right honourable gentleman to decide whether he will answer the question or not. the question is in order, Mr Speaker, I am happy to answer it. Senator Morrow is a member of the Labour party. I know nothing of the speech to which the honourable member for Henty has referred. I should like to ask the honourable member from what source he obtained the information on which his question was based. The attitude of the Labour party is one of undeviating support for the United Nations as has been stated and exemplified on many occasions. The Labour party believes in freedom of expression for all its members, although other political parties may not do so. plaints from citizens of Hobart and made about his business? Will you conLaunceston that many famous overseas sider applying proper measures during visitors who have been invited by the Australian Government as jubilee guests of the Commonwealth have been monopolized by certain societies or organizations which have sponsored their invitations. While admitting that such organizations have a responsibility to these guests of the Commonwealth, and in most cases meet their travelling expenses, I ask whether the Prime Minister would use his influence to ensure that such guests, as, for example, Sir Hartley Shawcross and Lord Jowett, will have an opportunity to address at least one public meeting in each State that they visit? share in the seeing ancl hearing of all distinguished visitors to Australia. time will be available either to the Lord Chancellor or to Sir Hartley Shawcross. As the honourable member will realize, some visitors come here only for a few days and it is not possible for them to always the desire of a visitor to occupy his time in making speeches. I say that with some feeling, having suffered myself in my time from too much speech-making. If the honourable member has in mind Tasmania in particular, I assure him that that State is very seldom out of my thoughts. to you, Mr Speaker. Prom your own wide experience of Parliament Houses all over the world, you will no doubt have a knowledge of the security measures that are taken to prevent unauthorized people from entering them. In view of the highly confidential and secret documents, ancl other matters, handled by the Australian Government at Parliament House, will you consider putting into practice proper security measures to prevent unauthorized people from having free access to practically any part of Parliament House at any time of the day or night?

BOURKE -I s the Minister for Defence Production able to say whether any progress has been made in the manufacture of Sabre jet fighter aircraft in Australia? Does the Government attach any credence to reports from Korea that the 'Sabre has been proved to be inferior to the Russian M.I.G. jet fighter in manoeuvrability, gunpower and genera] efficiency ? If so, is it proposed rate for a brick house, which is Is. per to proceed with the manufacture in this country of the Sabre aircraft, which may well be obsolete by the time we are in a position to mass produce it? honourable member to place his question upon the notice-paper. If he does so, I shall supply him with a full report upon this matter. Apparently some confusion exists with regard to the type of Sabre aircraft that we have decided to manufacture. addressed to the Minister for Social Services, relates to the fund into which participants in the war service homes scheme pay an insurance premium. The War Service Homes Division discovered that, having met all commitments and having retained a sum of money that it considered to be adequate as a reserve, there was a considerable residue. That has now been transferred to a special trust account. In order to avoid increasing further the amount standing to the credit of the fund, the department has implemented a scheme under which rebates will be made to purchasers of war service homes. Will the Minister say why the money that is surplus to the requirements of the fund has not been utilized, as was recommended by returned Certain recommendations servicemen's organizations, to enable a war service home to be transferred, in the event of the death of an ex-serviceman, to the ex-serviceman's widow, free of further obligation. I believe that such a scheme would be actuarially sound. ments that have been made by the honourable member are not entirely accurate. He has said that a scheme of the kind that he has mentioned would be actuarially sound. That would have been so a few years ago, when, according to the Commonwealth Actuary, there was Â£300,000 ir. the fund and only 26,000 war service homes were covered by it. To-day, there is Â£490,000 in the fund, but the number of war service homes has increased to 50,000. The honourable gentleman said that the rate of contribution was 1 per cent., but I believe that he was thinking of the basic cent. That is quite different from 1 per cent. The scheme that he has suggested would be, in effect, a scheme for insuring the lives of ex-servicemen who are buying war service homes. I do not think that that would be an equitable arrangement. Neither the widow of a man who was killed on active service, nor the widow of a man who died before he obtained a war service home would be covered by it . In any event, the whole of the fund would be absorbed if 500 deaths occurred. I do not believe that the amount now standing to the credit of the trust fund is excessive, but I shall be pleased to examine the matter and supply the honourable gentleman with a more detailed reply to his question. instruct the Commonwealth Bank to reduce interest rates on advances to the purchasers of war service homes, the buyers' of homes which are erected under co-operative building schemes, and any working man who is trying to purchase a home in any other way, so that the maximum rate shall be not more than 2 per cent.

I understand that it takes 48 hours to contact this division by telephone. I also ask the Minister whether there are any war service homes for sale in the metropolitan area of Melbourne. Does the Government contemplate increasing the amount of loan money available for the construction or purchase of war service homes in view of the fact that the amount of money that the division now makes available to applicants is considerably less than that which can be obtained fro m co-operative building societies? How many homes were built by the War Service Homes Division between 1946 and 1951? the Postmaster-General the subject of the telephone service at the War Service Homes Divisioni n Melbourne. The Wa r Service Homes Division has had greater success in the group construction of homes in Victoria than it has had in any other State, but I am not able to say whether any homes are available now.

It discbarges also mortgages or buys homes that have just been built, or purchases properties that have been built for some time, but. now I do not know what homes it has available. .

If he is favourably disposed towards this suggestion, will he advise the trade unions concerned immediately? made a statement upon this matter about a week ago in which he intimated that certain aspects arising out of the Government's decision relating to the Glen Davis project were, at the moment, under examination by a committee of departmental experts and that Cabinet was a waiting the report and recommendations of that committee upon certain phases of the subject. It was intimated at that time that when the Government was in a position to announce complete details of its proposal it would be prepared to do so at a conference which the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions wishes to arrange to consider the matter. I do not know that anything has since occurred that would enable us to meet a deputation from the council before the House rises at the end of the week.

The facts, as I understand them, are that the draft of the proposed treaty in its present form is now being circulated to interested governments and I believe that the draft will be made public possibly within a matter of days.

As a result of discussions on the possibility of an acute shortage of tinplate, representations have been made to me on behalf of the freezing and the meat canning industries. It has been pointed out that a shortage of tinplate could result in the closing down of such industries during the canning season, with a consequent breaking up of the teams that arcso necessary for the export and freezing season. adversely effect the availability of essenand widows pensions, and all ex-servicutial supplies to the United Kingdom. Can the Minister indicate whether there are prospects of the maintenance of an adequate supply of tinplate for such vital industries? is causing the Government a good deal of concern, due partly to the rising demand for it and partly to the recent actions of the American authorities in curtailing our quota for the remainder of this year. At the end of this week, members of the executive of the Tinplate Advisory Committee, who include a representative of the meat-packing industry, will meet in Canberra, and I propose to discuss the position with them in an endeavour to work out ways and means of rationalizing the available supplies during this period of shortage.

It makes a big hole in our finances. It amounts to almost as much as the amount of the dollar loan we got from the United States. We have had, at times, upwards of 10,000 troops in Japan. Our famous air Mustangs of Iwakuni-were the first effective air cover in Korea. General MacArthur himself told our Commanderin-Chief, General Robertson, that it was the best striking force in Japan. The British Commonwealth Occupation Force will be the only entirely British force to see the occupation out to the bitter end, and it is officered and manned entirely by Australians. Do not those considerations establish the right for us to have our say? Our Ministers and plenipotentiaries have been far too humble in the face of the American drive for a settlement in Japan. There is nothing that the Americans detest more than a stooge, and our recent ambassadorial work under Mr Spender come3 under that category. His crass statements have alarmed and humiliated Australians. "" Sweep to Manchuria and use the A-bomb "" was one of the gems from his peace anthology. The present Minister is more experienced than Mr Spender was in the same office, but I consider that his projected trip to the East, to quote his own words, "" in order to fill up the gap.* in my knowledge of the East"", should have been undertaken long since. The Government is falling over itself to sign this treaty, of which the public does not approve, because it does not understand it. It is impossible for America or Europe we are now expected to accept this docuto view the resurgence of Japan with, the ment and what it implies in the manner same degree of horror as we view it in that the House might vote on a new footAustralia. We are all forced to the conbridge over the Molonglo! clusion that, despite all that we have done by feats of arms and loyalty to the United Nations, Australia's special problems in visited by Mr John Foster Dulles, special the Pacific are ignored in this treaty. envoy of President Truman, to ""sell We are just another spot on the map at the the plan "" to Australia and New Zealand, mercy of international planners. TheI cannot escape the feeling that Australia plan is almost a fait accompli, and the is being treated likea Balkan satellite Australian public is completely in the in this matter and not as a full participatdark about it. But this debate, appaing partner in the war with Japan. We rently, is the only opportunity to be given must take it or leave it, and if we take to this Parliament to discuss the broad terms of this treaty before it is signed in September at San Francisco. More alarming still is the fact that not many members of this House know very much about the treaty. The reasons why they know so little about it are, first, the. secrecy of the Government on the matter, because this treaty involves the highly arm, the 77th Squadron-the contentious and unpopular issue of a rearmed Japan; and, secondly, there is no foreign affairs committee in this House whereby honourable members can be informed of the complex and complicated situation. During the time the present Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) was Minister for External Affairs, there was in existence a very broad and successful committee informing itself of the position in Japan. A representative cross section of the people of Australia sat on that committee. When Mr Spender took over the portfolio the Labour party asked for the appointment of a foreign affairs committee to deal particularly with the matter of Japan. Negotiations got to the point of naming the members on both sides of the House. At this stage the Minister dropped the idea. He said that if the committee were formed the Opposition would know as much about foreign affairs as did the Government. This might become the most important issue ever debated in this House but Labour has been locked out. This treaty, when concluded, may resolve many tremendous issues. It may well indicate the trend of the third world war and Australia's chance of survival as a white democracy in the Pacific. Yet, the Minister said that speed is of the essence of the contract. After five years of waiting and wrangling Despite the fact that we have been it there is the reassurance of a Pacific are making a bad guess. That article pact as compensation for acquiescence. I statedhope to deal with this matter later on and to show how many holes there are peace treaty ever given defeated warmakers, in this defence pact. It gives us nothing the that we have not already got. We shall still he dependent on our own strong right reforms introduced by General MacArthur .to arm.

It will be the mercenary of the Allies in any war of Jap workers and use of child labour are in which they are engaged-particularl y being assailed. in a war against communism. If this reasoning proves anything, it proves the utter imbecility of war. We, the free democracies, went to war against the nations of the anti-comintern-Germany, Italy and Japan, the declared opponents of communism. Now, one by one, we are arming these very nations against the communism which they set out to destroy. authorities reactionary and extreme nationalist This is a pretty grim jest against the organizations have to be listed. The Jap living and the dead. If the rearming of Japan were an absolute defence measure and if , beyond doubt, it would be the answer to any proposed aggression from Russia, it could be accepted. Even the oddity, if not the positive danger, of arming an enemy but recently defeated, could be condoned if there were positive indications of that nation's future loyalty. But at best this is a guess. What -will happen if that is a horrible and grotesquely bad gues3? This rearmament could be a very bad guess indeed. And if' it so turns out it is goodbye to white Australia as we know it. We might at this very hour be cancelling ourselves out as a free nation by our own hand and signature. In an article in the Sunday Sun of the 8th July, the opinion is expressed that we Mr Haylen. Before the ink is wet on the most generous Japanese are openly throwing off both the trappings and realities of democracy. They are quickly modifying or denouncing This is being done under the indulgent, One of the first things to go is MacArthur's to separate the Japanese polic; Politicians in the Diet have signed the deathof the plan. The Re-Screening Committee which recently This is for clearance from the purge of all of the notorious Dangerous Thoughts Occupation labor laws to prevent sweating Tokio Chamber of Commerce and Industry has called for : Reintroduction of longer working hours, beginning with a 10-hour day instead of eight hours; Easing of 'extravagant' working conditions for female and young workers, including .abolition of the rest system and shortening of annual leave. Under control ordinance by Occupation Attorney-General's office admits that 600 such organizations are now listed. All bear a dangerous resemblance to pre-war terrorist and militarist groups. Let us consider some of the obvious questions which arise in view of this statement. Will a resurgent Japan, in the long run, be an ally or an enemy of Australia? Suppose a re-armed Japan is successful in resisting any Asian adventure of arms. Suppose that it stems the tide of communism, in concert with the free nations. What then? Will the Japanese legions return to the rice paddies, the fishing hamlets, the benches and the lathes, or will some new leader dream again the dream of the Samurai and the conquest of Asia? And who will win the second battle of the Coral Sea? Those are matters to be pondered before the House passes judgment on the ministerial statement of policy now before us. We have to ask ourselves also whether military strength is the complete answer to communism. Has not the history of recent events in China shown us to the contrary? It surely was something more than force of arms that won success for a hundred thousand half-starved Communists in the caves of Yenan in North China against the organized millions and armed superiority of Chiang Kai-shek. It surely must have been more than the sword which made the Generalissimo virtually a prisoner in Formosa while one of his former generals, Mao Tse-tung, the peasant boy, sits triumphant on the peacock throne in Peiping. Isi t not a fact that our backing of the wrong horse in Asia so often has driven us back on this miserable deal with the Japanese? If military defeat is not enough to ensure the permanent defeat of communism, then this peace treaty is not worth the paper that it is written on. I should like to see something more psychological in the peace treaty than the clashing of arms on arms. Democracy must possess more than the atom bomb in the war of ideas in Asia. It is always dangerous to tear up one treaty to make another. The Japanese will have to renounce their own democratic Constitution to permit of the rearmament of Japan. Article7 of that Constitution states that they shall not rearm' in any way in the air, on the land, or on the sea, and that they shall renounce war for all timenot only during the operation of the surrender terms. In order to rearm, Japan will need to have a referendum, or, perhaps, it will be arranged in some other way, but it will not be the legal democratic way. What will the Japanese think of the whole sorry business? Will they not be bewildered by the curious actions of democracy? What will the East think of it? It is important to maintain our prestige in the East. Under the Potsdam Agreement, we gave the Japanese conditional terms of surrender. We said that they must disarm entirely and foreswear the bearing of arms for all time; disavow Sbintoism as a State religion; cut up the land and give fair shares to the tenant farmers; break up the Zaibatsu, the interlocking monopolies of goods, shipping, banking, industry and communications that built the war effort in Japan; and disavow militarism, the feudal system, and the way of the warrior. We said that the war lords must be hanged, militarists purged, the Kempai-tai broken up, Emperor worship abolished, and the way of peace marked out for the penitent Japanese nation for ever. With the aid of 400,000,000 dollars a year, the Americans built up the Japanese economy. Democracy was outlined in broad principle, and it was up to Japan to see that it was established. There is evidence that many Japanese genuinely accepted the new order. They were not the militarists, whom the treaty will shrive of their sins and bring about their return. At least 8,000,000 Japanese workers in the unions and organizations of the socialist party under Mosabura Suzuki have 'expressed their hatred of rearmament. One-tenth of the Japanese people whose politics are roughly equivalent to those of members of the Australian Labour party, and who are definitely not communists, say that starvation and despair will result if Japan be heavily rearmed. Poverty and despair are fertile seed beds for the Communists, whom the peace treaty sets out to destroy. What will be the reaction of these people when the hated militarists return? Generals, admirals, colonels, captains an<? personnel heads are not made in a day. Concurrent with the lopping off of war criminals, 10,000 Japanese have been released from the purge and 109,000 others are to be released this year. What is going to happen to all these democrats ? In the rearming of Japan, the skulking militarists will return one by one. [Extension of time granted.'] Japan is to make no repayment whatever for its bloody guilt. That is old-fashioned now. Japan is forgiven and may j'oin the United Nations. It is to pay no reparations, because it is too poor to do so. Not a penny is to be paid for our prisoners of war, not a cent for war damage in New Guinea, not a yen for the destruction of Darwin and not a cent for sunken ships or broken lives. Japan owes the United States of America 1,000,000,000 dollars for the occupation. Its trade has gone and its empire has perished. Yet Japan is to rearm because some one has coined the cynical and rather absurd phrase that Japan is a power vacuum in Asia Turning from the very obvious problems of satisfying the anxieties of Australia in regard to rearming Japan, I cannot escape the feeling that Great Britain is not happy about this pact, although finally it has agreed to it in principle. What is going to become of Britain's textile industry in the face of competition from the coolie labour of Japan? With no prohibitions on a shipbuilding programme, Japan will be a very active competitor of Britain. Poverty in Manchester and unemployment on the Tyneside are the fears that oppress the British Government to-day in relation to Japan. I think it is here that the reparations programme in Japan went wrong. When I led the parliamentary delegation to JapanI saw spindles in Japanese textile factories labelled "" R "" for reparabriefly now. It can fairly be said that tions. The honourable member for Flinders( Mr Ryan) who was a member of the delegation to Japan knows that 3,000,000 of the 11,000,000 spindles in Japan were to be used for reparations, but to-day they are all whirring at top speed and the raw product, American cotton, is not in short supply. Those things were done long before a peace treaty was thought of. In fact, half of the things that were done then were piecemeal moves in favour of Japan. One of the Japanese virtues is indirection-not to let the honourable right arm know what the equally honourable left arm is doing. That worked perfectly in relation to Japanese shipping. I do not think the limitation of ships to 6,000 tons was ever fully observed. Big ships sunk off the coast were salvaged, and others were completed or repaired. Japan must have a strong merchant marine, and I have no doubt that the loyal subjects of the Son of Heaven attended to that matter under the benevolent eyes of the occupation. Many things that were done in order to smooth the path of occupation were really done for the eventual resurgence of J apan. It will not be long before those ships will be nosing into every seaport of Australia, carrying cotton goods, cameras and cheap tin trays and, with them, a threat to our secondary Mr Haylen. industries, our policy of full employment and our standard of living. In view of these facts, there is a strong case for deferring the peace treaty with Japan. At best, it will be a patchwork arrangement. I note with respect the American report that 49 nations, including Venezuela and Terra Del Fuego, will sign the treaty. But more relevant is the fact that Formosan China, Communist China and Russia will not do so. They will be excluded because of obvious difficulties. But they are Japan's nearest neighbours, and we must face the hard fact that history shows that usually nations go to war with their nearest neighbours and competitors. The Pacific pact, which will bind the treaty with Japan into a more or less acceptable form for the British Dominions in the Pacific, is a subject for special discussion and can be touched upon it gives form and substance to something -that we already have-willy-nill y support of the democracies for each other in case of attack. Any war that breaks out will be to the north of Australia. Apparently we can expect to live in peace with Antarctica for the time being. Since the war scene would be in the north, our allies would be heavily engaged before the attack came to Australia. In that event, this country would have the same strategic role as previously. The cockpit of Asia is Indo-China, Siam, Burma, Malaya, Indonesia and the other islands and countries in the soft belly of Asia. I am convinced that those countries require and deserve rearmament and stable government more urgently than does Japan. One must return again and again to the problem of Japan-the brooding ""bad boy "" of the Pacific, locked in the barren islands of the Japanese mainland, teeming with 85,000,000 of people, armed to the teeth for somebody else's war, bereft of trade in China, stripped of empire and expansion, and living in an economy that must have overseas trade to enable it to survive. Japan has all the tensions that lead to war rather than those that lead to peace. The population problem that confronts Japan is alone sufficient to cause Australia to throw this treaty under the table. The Japanese are increasing at the rate of 1,000,000 a year. The average Japanese farm is under one acre in size and the average small Japanese home houses at least ten people. Japan cannot feed itself and, for its existence, must make huge imports. Its population must tumble out of Japan and drop south through the populous islands, searching for the empty lands that remain. ""Will not the next logical step after accepting this treaty be the demand of Japan for living space? Docs that not immediately involve Dutch New Guinea and our own territories of Now Guinea, Papua ancl north Australia? The cables have been strangely silent on this problem lately, but there is evidence that the matter has not been forgotten. Alarming statements in the past from the S.G.A.P. indicate that many people arc not thinking as we are in this matter. White Australia could become grievously involved. So few people in Australia understand the situation -purposes a free and re-armed Japan The rearmament of Japan at this stage is a real barrier in Australia to the wholehearted acceptance of the peace treaty. The idea of Japan as an ally in any over-all security plan is repugnant to Australia. We should be.allowed time to test the genuineness, or otherwise, of tbe Japanese aspirations. I think that Australia believes this, and I imagined that the Government believed it also. There is nothing in its declared policy to indicate that it believed otherwise. Indeed, the Prime Minister, when he was Leadei of the Opposition, stated the position clearly during the war. In 1943, the Melbourne Sun News-Pictorial reported him as sayingDid any one really believe that in twenty years' time even if w'e beat Japan to her knees, we were going to he a safe country on the borders of the Pacific with a vengeful Japan north of us. The truth was that the struggle would begin when the war was over. "" A vengeful Japan, north of us ""-the Prime Minister's words in 1943; these "" plucky little fellows "" will help us fight communism-the new idea of 1951 Honourable members may make their choice. Por the Labour party the decision is firm. It is inflexible in its continuing opposition to the rearmament of Japan in any form or under any disguise. listened with great interest but also with considerable concern to the statement that the Minister for External Affairs( Mr Casey) presented to the House. I believe honourable members will applaud the information that he gave to us concerning .Korea and the Colombo plan which promises to be a real essay in statesmanship. But I must admit as one who can claim, unfortunately, a fairly wide knowledge of the Japanese, that the greater part of his speech, concerned as it was with the proposed Japanese peace treaty, filled me with profound uneasiness. There is a danger, in the present unbalance of power in East Asia of the democracies being stampeded into making false moves. In making a settlement such as is now .contemplated we must look not merely to the present emergency but also to possible developments within the next 25 or 30 years. It is true, of course, that for immediate might form a counterpoise to Russian influence in the Far East and to Communist China. Buti f we accept that view we extinguish at one fell blow all hope of ever arriving at any understanding witb the present Peking Government. China will be driven more firmly than ever into the arms of Moscow. No Chinese citizen, whether a supporter of Mao Tse-tung or of Chiang Kai-shek, could possibly view with equanimity the recrudescence of Japanese might. When we consider the horrors that the Japanese invaders have inflicted upon the unhappy Chinese people during the last twenty years, the millions of lives lost and japan's record of spoliation in that longsuffering country, it is safe to say that no act could be more calculated to unite the diversities of Chinese opinion behind the present Communist regime than the re-arming of Japan. British, American and Australian policy should be designed not to consolidate but to dissolve, by careful diplomacy, the MoscowPeking axis. We should always bear in mind that it is possible that Mao! Tse-tung's motives and aims are not identical with those of the Kremlin. Perhaps one may be optimistic in cherishing that hope. Nevertheless, we must recognize that possibility. At this",22,Casey
75,Mr Downer (Angas) [3.48],"Ihour, before Mao Tse-tung has finally disclosed his hand, the democratic powers would be wiser to try to understand the multiplicity of social, economic and nationalist problems peculiar to the Chinese sub-continent and endeavour thereby to make more progress towards assuring Australia's security rather than to contemplating the act which we are informed through the press is to be done in September next. That treaty will probably alienate every section of the markets, and for other concessions. It Chinese people. Furthermore, there is no certainty that Japan, after it has been given full sovereignty and independence and has been permitted to re-arm, will ally itself with the democracies.

I believe that if Japan is allowed unlimited rearmament and full sovereignty, the next phase will be demandsI emphasize demands-for the return of its lost territories and lost will be the story of post-1929 Germany all over again. ""We shall come to the position, in a few years, that the Japanese militarists, industrialists and politicians will find themselves at an eminence that the most sanguine of them in 1945 could hardly have dreamed of; strong enough to be courted by the democNor is there any real racies and by Russia alike, and they may play off one bloc against the other in order to further their nationalist aspirations. Never let any Australian man, woman or child forget What confidence can we repose in Its accomplishment will have been right, if he was correctly The Japanese regard Russia as their juncture to American persuasions for rearming our recent enemy is simply placing a noose around our necks, and hand the rope to the hangman. In considering this problem, let us be realists. The war, let us frankly admit, has answered none of the economic urges that set Japan upon a career of eonquest. In truth, the war has accentuated the basic difficulties of that country. Before 1941, its population was considerably lower than it is at present; it drew raw materials and foodstuffs from Manchuria, China and Korea; and its mercantile marine traded to every part of the globe. Contrast that prosperous and affluent situation with the position of Japan to-day. Its population is increasing at the rate of 1,000,000 a year; all of its overseas possessions are gone; its ships are few; and its exports are limited. Here we have formidable elements for an explosion. I submit that the task of America, Britain and Australia is to find a solution to those dangerous potentialities. The peace proposals that the Minister for External Affairs has outlined are statesmanlike insofar as they provide, or indicate that they will provide, Japan with reasonable means of acquiring food to sustain its population, of providing markets for its manufacturers and of obtaining freedom for its shipping. But. I suggest, that its manufacturing industries must be re-established not upon what in our eyes is virtually slave labour, but acsuch as I have tried to adumbrate have cording to an industrial code similar to that in our own country and in the Western democracies. The peace treaty moreover should indicate some sympathy for the profound problem of Japan's chronic over population; and I emphasize, above all else, that it should make some provision for the education of the Japanese people in the Christian faith. For unless, in process of time, Japan's ancient superstitions give way to a nobler morality, the world cannot hope for any fundamental alteration of the Japanese character. The peace proposals which have been outlined have gone too far, in some directions, and have not gone far enough in others. The democratic task, as T: see it, is to provide the Japanese with a rising standard of living, and simultaneously Christ's teaching. Once those things have been done, it may be possible to persuade the Japanese seriously to embrace the virtue of democratic institutions. But a full stomach comes before forms of government, whether people be Asians or Europeans. Once those things have been accomplished, it may be proper to talk about the rearmament of Japan. It is not sensible to do so now when none of the prerequisities of a peaceful, reformed Japan have even been attempted. We hear much in these days about the necessity for filling a power vacuum in Japan. If that is true, and I believe that it is true in a sense, I submit that Australia's safety demands that the vacuum be filled by the democracies. This is not palatable, perhaps, to many people in this country because it will involve a continued contribution by the Americans, and also a continued effort on our part in the way of supplying, equipping and paying for an occupation force. Nevertheless, I feel that it is the only sure and safe way of approaching this problem. I quite agree that it is impossible to keep down a nation in occupation indefinitely. Accordingly, one must concede the merit of the argument for allowing Japan some armaments for police purposes only; but even limited rearmament implies a certain degree of supervision, and there should be no thought of evacuating Japan until terms been fulfilled. An attempt is now being made to assuage Australian objections to the proposed rearmament of Japan and to the restoration of its sovereignty, by the American offer of a Pacific pact. I do not wish to disparage the efforts of the Minister for External Affairs or those of his predecessor, Mr Spender, towards that goal. After all, we must recognize the unpalatable fact that, if the United States of America is bent upon unlimited rearmament for Japan, no Australian Government can prevent it. I think that it is only fair, having made a careful study of the Minister's statement, to say that a fairly effective protest has been made by the Australian Government during the last few months against the preinculcate in their hearts sent proposals. But if the United States of America is bent upon that course, there is very little that we can do to divert it. military Accordingly, a guarantee is the second best thing. However, I believe, with all respect to our American friends, that we should not overstrcss the pact once we have obtained it. We live, unhappily, in a century which is notorious for contractual infidelity. Wbo can predict the international' scene ten, fifteen or twenty East. I believe that, if the Government years from now? A change of government in Washington may bring about an entire recasting of present American foreign policy. that internal strains and stresses ten or , fifteen years hence may make it virtually impossible for the United States Government to join with Australia or New Zealand in police action against the Japanese. We have the'awful'warning of President Wilson's broken promise to France in 1919. relinquishment of France's claim to the Rhineland with a pledge which, a few months later, was disavowed by Congress and tbe American people. No Frenchman of that generation will ever forget what, for him, was a great calamity. Let no Australian of our generation place too unflinching a faith in guarantees of assistance given by a foreign country. A Pacific pact is a poor substitute for a Japan disarmed and under enlightened tutelage. Surely it would be wiser to try to prevent the circumstance of Japanese aggression from again arising than to sign a treaty which makes aggression probable and, simultaneously, conclude a defensive pact against a contingency of our own creation! From the unenviable predicament in which we find ourselves to-day there is a clear moral to be drawn. If Australia is to exert that influence' in notorious on that committee that, world councils which its security demands, We must concentrate our efforts on quickly accomplishing the following things:-We and increase our birth-rate. We must strengthen our defences and build permanent establishments on a scale that has never before been visualized in Australia. We must outstrip all previous records for the development of our natural resources. We must expand our industrial capacity. We must assume, frankly and boldly, a share of the responsibility for maintaining peace in the Mr Downer. Pacific, even though this may involve commitments to friendly countries. We must acquire a profound knowledge of Asian peoples and make ourselves the best informed nation in tbe world on Far Eastern 'affairs. That entails, amongst other tasks, the establishment of additional legations and a bigger consular service throughout the Far initiates such a policy now-and there are signs that it is doing so-the n in ten years' time Australia will be in a better It is conceivable position to command acceptance of its point of view.' As it is to-day, this Government is compelled to acquiesce in action which will be gravely detrimental to our security as a Pacific power. The honourable member's time has He secured the expired. am sorry that limitation of time has prevented the honourable member for Angas( Mr Downer) from finishing the argument that he was developing. The Opposition wishes that his point of view would be adopted by tbe Government. Those honourable members who had tbe honour to serve on the foreign affairs committee that was established to consider the Japanese peace settlement by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt), when he was Minister for External Affairs in the Chifley Government, will recall the presence on that committee of two honourable gentlemen who are now Ministers. One is the Vice-President of the Executive Council( Mr Eric J. Harrison) and the other is the Minister for Commerce immediately there was a breath of a suggestion that the foreign policy of the United States of America was going to must attract more people change in favour of Japanese rearmament, those two gentlemen were swift to click their heels and press upon the committee the point of view that it would be unreal to try to continue to hold Japan down.

78,And Agriculture ( Mr Mcewen). I T Was,"foreign policy of the United States. I say bluntly to begin with that in my humble opinion-and I am aware that it will make no difference to the United Statesthe foreign policy of that country is unreliable and immature. An examination of United States foreign policy over the last seven years discloses evidence of a disposition to develop an irrational sort of crush on a nation and to adopt towards it a policy that is opposed to the permanent interests of the United States and the ""West generally. American propaganda during World ""War II . , as expressed in its literadefending itself by allowing it to rearm ture on foreign affairs and in its ambassadorial memoirs, was strongly pro-Russian. This crush on Russia continued until the signing of the Yalta Agreement, which was a completely unwise agreement promulgated largely by the Government of the United States. The vacillations of United States foreign policy on Palestine, when it was poised between the Jewish internal influence in the United States of America and the desire for friendly relations with the Arabs in relation to oil, was the despair of the late Ernest Bevin, who was then the United Kingdom Foreign Secretary. Now we have transported into American foreign policy the MacArthur crush-the new crush on Japan. All these unstable policies are likely to be changed in a moment because of the fact that United States foreign policy generally is framed as a sort of pully-hauly between the President, the State Department and the Congress, the three factors in American government which frequently are at variance. We might also add a fourth factor, which operated at any rate during the MacArthur shogunate, that of the generals at variance with the other three factors. I shall now summarize the main points that I wish to emphasize in relation to the proposed Japanese peace settlement and will endeavour to discuss them within the time that is available to me. First, T consider that Japanese foreign policy will be conducted solely in the interests of Japan. Any belief that Japan will act as a subordinate satellite for our convenience is wholly in error. Secondly, I believe that if Japan has to choose hetwpen continental expansion, which would bring it up against the Chinese and Russian bloc, and southern expansion by sea into regions of weakness, such as the Philippines and the former Netherlands East Indies, it will choose the latter course. It will not engage, in our interest, in a suicidal charge against a formidable continental bloc that is capable of damaging it. Thirdly, I believe that the concept of a limited rearmament of Japan is wholly unreal. Once the occupation is withdrawn, we shall not be able to determine what Japan shall do about aerial, naval, or land rearmament. The story that we can give Japan the means of on the land but not to put itself in a position to attack us by naval or aerial rearmament is based on an illusion. Fourthly, Japan has no permanent enemies and no permanent friends; it has only permanent interests. To rely upon any traditional hostility that we may allege that it entertains towards Russia would be to lean upon a rotten reed. What is the history of Japanese foreign policy? It is, surely, a history of attachment to power groups that have been able to advance its territorial interests at the expense of other groups. If we recall the original Anglo-Japanese alliance of the late nineteenth century -a n achievement of the Marquis Ito-w e remember that it. freed Japan for expansion in Korea and for the elimination of Russian influence in Manchuria. The alliance was renewed in 1911. Japan attached itself again to the British bloc. Russia at that stage was a British ally and was no longer a target for Japanese enmity. The purpose of this arrangement was fulfilled when Japan gained the former German possessions of Kiao-chow, the Marshalls, the Carolines and the Ladrones. For the second time, Japan had attached itself to a bloc in order to gain territory from another bloc. Its third attachment had a purpose which failed, but it was clear. It attached itself to the anti-Comintern pact with Germany and Italy with the clear intention of gaining the Philippines, the Netherlands East Indies and Indo-China. In pursuance of its alliance with the anti-Comintern powers it sought to seize those territories. When Japan attains its independence Japan's point of view than would be oppoand the occupation forces have been withsition to the continental powers, which drawn it will be confronted with two could inflict so much damage upon it. blocs-the western bloc and the Russian Japan was defeated in the last war, when bloc.

[4.22] -The Minister for External Affairs( Mr Casey) mentioned two matters on which I should like to speak. They were Korea and Japan. Since the Minister made his statement to the House a profound change has taken place in the position in Korea. Cease-fire negotiations are now in progress, as a result of which certain considerations arise. For a year before the cease-fire negotiations commenced a large-scale war had been waged. Evidence of the extent of that war was best provided by the huge casualties that occurred. "" casualties "" to include those who became sick as well as those who were wounded in battle. American casualties in that year exceeded 74,000. Australian casualties approximated 1,000. The North Korean and Chinese casualties have been estimated addition, enormous casualties were inflicted on the civilian population and' there was a general devastation of the country. So, by all standards, the war has been fought on a large scale. The United Nations became involved in that war 'because it determined that a series of events similar to those that preceded the second world war should not occur again. In other words, it decided to discard the policy of appeasement. It was confronted with an act of aggression, but on this occasion was prepared to meet force with force. On the 6th July, 1950, when the House was summoned to a special session at the outbreak of hostilities in Korea, the present Leader of the Opposition, then the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, saidI believe our duty, in the circumstances, is clear. No one can tell positively what the consequences of our action will be. W ill it tend to prevent, or hasten, a third world war? We are in the midst of speculation when we consider those questions. We cannot possibly tell. We only know that the duty is cast on all members of the United Nations to take this very kind of action, and if we do our duty, then I believe that the consequences to the world will be more favorable than they would' be if we were to t u r n oux back on the United Nations. Those were s i g n if i c a n t words. A t the end of a year, a l t h o u g h the p o s it i o n had been transformed some months previously by the intrusion of Communist China into the war, the United Nations was faced with three alternatives. After it has first appeared that the forces of the United Nations might be driven out of Korea and then that they would speedily end the war by their invasion of North Korea the picture was transformed by the entry into the war of the huge forces of Communist China. At the end of a year the conflict had become a war of attrition. It had become a war on a large scale, an end to which was difficult to foresee. Three alternatives then were presented to the United Nations. TheI use the word first was that the struggle should be abandoned; that we should acknowledge our ""mistake"" as it was called, and withdraw from Korea. That rather remarkable point of view was freely expressed in this country by people of considerable prestige and authority. The at about 500,000. In second alternative was that the war should be extended to a full scale attack on Communist China, the risk being taken of a third world war being precipitated in the process. The third alternative was that the United Nations should persist with a limited war while making every effort to obtain a negotiated peace on satisfactory terms. There was a dramatic ttirn of events when Russia suggested that negotiations should be initiated for a cease firei This was a most remarkable state of affairs because Russia had provided the sinews of war for both North Korea and China. But for Russia the Korean question could have been settled long ago without resort to war. But for the enormous armaments of Russia, its propaganda, and its intrusion into the affairs of other nations, there would to-day be no international tension in the world and all nations would be able to rebuild in peace the devastation of two world wars. So it appears remarkable that the only country that was responsible for this state of affairs should suddenly suggest that the war should cease. What should be the attitude of the United Nations to this trend of events ? It is not known why Russia has taken this course. There may be internal stresses or internicine feuds in the Russion state of which we do not know. Perhaps China made it",30,Casey

In my feelings of friendliness and have proopinion the keynote of the Minister's moted a moral force. In the long run, statement on the matter was the passage those considerations would be far more Dr. Donald Cameron. of the attempt to the long run far more important than is the strict limitation of Japanese armaof what has been called "" the dignity of equality"" eventually as a nation then",33,Casey
80,Mr Casey,"Hear, hear!",34,Casey
81,Dr. Donald Cameron,"It ispowerful in their effects than preventions of rearmament will be. Japan could not develop such an attitude unless it were given power, under the peace treaty, to develop its economic life. Without such development Japan cannot have a peaceful and contented people. None of us know whether it can have them at all. But Japan cannot have a peaceful and contented people unless 'it can develop its economic life, which includes its heavy industries and its great ship-building industry. The peace treaty is concerned not only with the subject of armaments; territorial limitations also are to be imposed under, it. I put it to the House that no peace treaty can be a permanent document. As tlie years pass conditions will alter and the results of the alterations will have to be met by fresh agreements. To my way of thinking it would be a greater and more realistic ambition to restore Japan to the comity of nations than to keep it forever smarting in a position of inferiority. That will be a wiser course to pursue if we wish to gain goodwill, co-operation and peace in the Pacific. Japan cannot be dragged forever at the chariot wheels of the victors. There are practical measures of the utmost value and importance to our own security in the Pacific, which are embodied in the proposed Pacific pact. Whatever views we may hold about the Japanese and the possibility of theii resurgence, we are, ourselves, a small nation. The only power which can enforce the terms of the peace treaty upon the Japanese is America. Whilst we, as a. free and independent people, feel that dignity of equality as a nation about which I have spoken, we can put our views to our great allies, but we cannot override theirs. If we impose a stringent treaty upon Japan how are we to enforce its terms? What is the use of stating that we shall impose stringent, far-reaching conditions upon a country if we have not the ability to enforce them and if, which is more important, our allies have made it perfectly clear that they have no intention of enforcing such stringent conditions? In my opinion it is not only wise but also a matter of necessity that we adjust our views to the views of our allies, which are more calculated to bring about peace in the Pacific than would be any stringent, repressive measures that can be devised. The best guarantee of lasting peace in the Pacific is the contentment and happiness of the various countries in the Pacific area. No document designed to hold one of them, whether it be an ex-enemy country or not, in permanent subjection, could possibly achieve lasting peace. It appears to me to be not only unwise but also impossible for us to implement such a course of action. We should do well to heed the words of our great war-time leader, "" In victory, magnanimity; in peace, goodwill"". Not only are those word? consistent with British policy in the past but they are also, I submit, a counsel of wisdom for us if we wish to have security in the future. The speech of the Minister for External Affairs( Mr Casey), as he himself pointed out during it, did not deal with the whole range of international problems that faces us in common with the rest of the world, but was confined to a few outstanding international problems. I compliment the Minister upon having confined his speech to a few problems, because I believe that to be the correct procedure, rather than that we should be presented with a mass of statements, covering a whole range of problems, to which we should not be able to do justice in one short debate. But the intention of the Minister will not be fulfilled unless we have, at frequent intervals, statements on particular current problems. I believe that this House should be given statements by the Government, through the Minister for External Affairs, prior to the holding of discussions with other nations. I have repeatedly expressed, over a period of years, the view that we should have a statement of the ideas of the Government in relation to any forthcoming international conference so that we may debate it in this chamber before the conference is held. Too frequently have we had merely a report from the Governmeni after a conference has taken place, and after the Government and the governments of other nations concerned have made final decisions. I was interested in",34,Casey
82,Mr Tom Burke (Perth) [4.41],"the Minister's concluding remarks in which he said: I scarcely need to remind the House that there is no easy road to the solutionof interVictory would have been achieved at far national problems. First, we must ascertain the relevant facts. The issues must then be clarified and means of solving the problems found. I remind the House that that statement is identical with the dictum laid downby the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) when he was Minister for External Affairs. That policy was criticized at times"", but I believe it to be the only sure foundation upon which to build our international affairs policy and upon which we 6an conduct discussions with other nations. The Minister dealt first with the Korean situation. There was no disagreement in the Parliament when the Unfortunate Korean war broke out. The Opposition supported then, as it supports now, the participation of this country, as a member of the United Nations, in that conflict. We believe, as the honourable member for Oxley (Dr. Donald Cameron) has said, that the fate of the United Nations hung in the balance when the Korean war started. It seemed to me then that the start of that war was the "" Manchurian adventure "" over again, and that it would have becojme another "" Abyssinian affair "" if the United Nations had not intervened. We have asked from time to time, since that war began, that Australia's views be heard in the high councils responsible for its conduct; We did not ask that some committee should be sot up to direct the course of the warfare. We did ask of the Minister and of the Government through the Leader of the Opposition that Australia's voice should be heard and that Australia's point of view should be put plainly to those in the United Nations responsible for the direction of the -war. But we said that Australia's view should have been put forward on what should perhaps have been a stopping place for the United Nations' armies. If the present conflict ends within the next few weeks it will have completely justified the United Nations' intervention. If , however, when our forces first surged through Korea, they had not igbne so far Mr Tom Burke. that they brought in the forces of Communist China, the triumph of the United Nations would have been much greater. less cost, and the peace issues would have been more clear Cut than they will be now that Communist China has intervened. I believe that in this matter the Government is to some degree culpable. A speech made by the previous Minister for. External Affairs, Mr Spender^ on one occasion seemed to indicate that he favoured an advance to the Manchurian border, with all the implications that that advance would have had for the Chinese or Manchurian forces. We must realize that neither the United Nations as a whole nor Australia individually had any intention of denying to the Korean forces and peoples the power that resided inside Korea. We must also realize that the Chinese are perhaps not -> so well-informed as are some of the Western peoples. They might easily have misunderstood the expressed intentions of the United Nations forces. If a clearer statement of aims had been made, and Australia's voice had been loud and cleai'j the war might have been over sooner, the victory more clear cut, and the deplorable consequences which inevitably follow war lessened. I shall now deal with the Japanese peace treaty. Although the Korean war and the losses, sufferings and complexities of that conflict are nearest to us to-day, the peace treaty with Japan is certainly the most important item to be mentioned in the present debate. The Minister for External Affairs said that it is desirable that we should have an early peace with Japan. I suggest to the House, and to the Country, that it is far better that we shall have a satisfactory peace with Japan. If an early peace conference Can be held, and the desired result can be achieved through it, then an early peace treaty will be completely justified. Buti f delay of any sort 'coulfl bring 'about 'a -more satisfactory and permanent p'ea'ee settlement, there is no reason why those benefits should be sacrinorthwards ficed in order to. secure an early peace. The right honourable gentleman. sa'M that we must look to the eecurity of Japan as well as the security of this country. I assume that he meant that to apply in the event of a war in Asia. He said that Japan had been disarmed, its war factories dismantled and its war criminals tried and punished. All those things have been done; but the intention now appears to be to rearm Japan and to rebuild its factories or reconvert them to the production of arms. from anything that I said. is implied in the right honourable gentleman's statement that the doing of such things is necessary for the security of Japan. Japanese rearmament shall be limited. with that matter later. However, we have gone through the process of disarming Japan and destroying its war industries. Now we propose to retrace our steps, rearm Japan to a limited degree and rebuild its factories also to a limited degree. Now the question may be posed, what about the war criminals? Shall we start from the present to train those who may become war criminals in another conflict? This conflict between the policy of Australia and of other democratic powers is rather humorous. Either Japan should be allowed to retain some sort of protection through armies, navies, air forces and factories, or we should not later slowly, laboriously and at enormous cost attempt to rebuild the things that we have destroyed. I believe that Japan is a great nation and must have a place in the comity of nations. The honourable member for Oxley (Dr. Donald Cameron) said that the most important thing for us to do is to help to return J apan to the comity of nations. I completely agree with that. But will the rearming of Japan mean that we shall bring it into friendship with the other nations and closer to the world comity of nations? The Minister said in bis statement, and also indicated by way of interjection, that limitations are to be imposed upon Japan's capacity to rearm. If we are to rearm Japan for its own protection, against Whom are we to protect it? Clearlyi t must be against the .Communist nations of the East or against all the nations of the East. If we are to rearm Japan so as to ensure its own protection and survival, in the hope that it will be our ally in the future, why place limitations, on its armaments? There is no limitation upon the Russian or the Chinese armament industry, but as a concession to our conscience when we are rearming Japan we propose to say,."" We shall give you pop guns whereas the enemy has cannons and tiny armies whereas the Russians have vast forces. We shall give you merchant fleets whereas Russia has the greatest submarine fleet in the world "". Those matters show clearly the conflict in Australian foreign policy which must be resolved. Honourable members on this side do not believe that Japan will ever be Australia's ally. If the Government believes that Japan can be our ally, it should say so and act on its belief. If it does not believe that, and allows some rearmament, it cannot impose any restrictions on the size of forces, volume of equipment or strength of striking power. The implications in the speech of the Minister for External Affairs are that Japan unarmed is a menace because it might be occupied by a power hostile to Australia. Therefore, he said, we must assess whether Japan is more dangerous to us impotent and occupied or armed and unoccupied. According to the Minister's speech, his conclusion is that Japan unarmed is a greater menace to our security and the security of western peoples, than an armed Japan. A little analysis will disprove the truth of that. Japan armed to the teeth, as the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley) said, would still be in a completely vulnerable position in relation to Russia, China and any of their possible allies. Therefore, whether Japan was armed to the teeth or not it still would be in a most vulnerable position. But the Opposition believes than an armed Japan would not be a possible ally of Australia and the Western powers, but an almost certain ally of Russia, China and the rest of the Eastern nations. It is pertinent to ask what was Japan's attitude towards Australia before the last war, and what is its present attitude. It",35,Casey

86,Mr Tom Burke,"Yes; I shall dealis well known that the Japanese felt a contempt for Australia as a country of great and empty spaces. That was made plain when they came to Australia on friendly visits. Japanese superiority was clearly perceptible. Now that the conflict is over it is still clear that the Japanese are a proud people. They harbour resentment against the nations that defeated them, and a deep and lasting hatred of the dropping of the atom bomb on their homeland. In those circumstances, if the test be the security of Australia, then Japan unarmed, even though occupied by Russia and China, would be far less of a threat to Australia's security than would be a J apan armed'to the teeth'or armed in the limited way suggested by the Minister. Therefore, it may be said that according to any .test the rearming of Japan is not the answer to either Japan's security, the security of Australia or the security of the United States of America. The Opposition suggests that the Government should put that view forward once again as the view of Australia. In the Japanese peace negotiations the Government should put forward quite strongly Australia's view, as it should have done in the Korean conflict. It should say that in the future the Japanese, because of their history, associations and culture, are not likely ever to be allies of Australia or of the Western peoples in a third great war. It should be made plain that even if there is a risk of an unarmed Japan being occupied by Russia or some Russian satellite, that would not be so great a threat to Australia as an armed Japan would be. The rearming of Japan would not give back to the Japanese a feeling of equality with the rest of the world. The Japanese do not regard the right to rearm as a means of bringing them into the comity of nations. It must be remembered that their territories have been taken from them, and that other things have been done to them which they will remember. If they are allowed to rearm, then they are certain to look forward to getting back the territories that they formerly controlled. We must use all our strength and skill to secure a lasting friendship with the Japanese people. We must seek to do that for the sake of the security of the Mr Tom Burke. world and of the human race. It is of no use to ask Japan to renounce territorial claims, because it will do that gladly to-day while the forces of the Their attitude of world are arrayed against it, but having been rearmed and been placed in a position of power it is almost certain, especially if some other part of the world is involved in war, that Japan will forget the renunciations of 1951 and seize by force the territories that it covets for its economic well-being and protection. The Minister also said that the peace treaty would impose limitations upon Japan's naval strength and, presumably, upon its air and ground strength; but he pointed out that the American Government and also, I assume, the Australian Government, did not believe that those provisions could be policed. The Australian Government should press for an extension of the Colombo plan. Although that plan was hailed throughout Australia as a result of the work of Mr Spender, tlie Minister's predecessor, it is, in fact, a continuation of the policy that was followed by the Labour party during the years when it formed the Government of this country. An extension of the Colombo plan might provide a means by which the Japanese nation could again-be brought back into the comity of nations -The rearmament of Japan would entail substantial aid from America as well as from Australia and other democracies. I suggest that the friendship of Japan be sought by an extension of the Colombo plan. glad to be able to take part in this debate and to place upon record the profound misgivings that I entertain about certain aspects of the proposed peace treaty with Japan. I have not had the long and painful personal experience of the Japanese that many honourable members have had, nor can I claim to have a profound knowledge of Japan or its history, but I believe that I am speaking for thousands of Australians when 1 express the fear that the rearmament of Japan will adversely affect the future security of this country. It seems to me that the determination of the Americans to allow Japan to rearm is based upon two assumptions,",37,Casey
87,Mr Osborne (Evans) [5.1],"I amneither of which is necessarily accurate: first, that the Japanese people have abandoned their 'former militarism and have adopted the institutions and the practices of democracy; and secondly, *that a rearmed Japan will necessarily be an ally of the western democracies in the future struggle with communism. In my opinion, the assumption that the Japanese have accepted the institutions and the practices of democracy is based upon a false hope engendered by the MacArthur administration. Even a cursory examination of learned journals reveals that both in America and in the United Kingdom, there is profound doubt about Japan's alleged democracy. I entertain little hope that the democratic institutions adopted by Japan will survive for many years. Even the popular journals express the same doubts. It appears that, towards the end of the constitute to another island country. last war, the American State Department had a policy for the occupation of Japan terms of the proposed peace treaty.

Although plainly, for the benefit of the record, that I have criticized the MacArthur administhe Australian Government dislikes and tration, I do not fail to recognize the very fears those provisions and that it has great services that General MacArthur stated its opinion clearly, but without rendered to Australia. But I fear that effect. wh.afc.he did subsequently may have a very different result. What assurance is there that a rearmed .Japan will be an ally of the Western democracies? In the not unlikely event of America and the British Empire becoming engaged in a death struggle with communism, is it not possible that Japanese opportunism may re-assert itself and that, as the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley) suggested, Japan may turn again towards southward expansion and Australia may again find itself directly in the path of Japanese ambition? I see a special danger in the removal of restrictions upon the building of merchant ships by Japan, even though Japanese naval expansion be limited. Before and during the last war, we had ample evidence of the danger that a vigorous Japanese merchant marine canI do not blame the Government for the arms placed General( Mr Casey) that the Australian GovernNow we did not intend to do so, Japan had to be We must ask ourselves what Australia 3an do in the present circumstances. First, we can try to make the Pacific Pact a reality and a source of strength and safety for us. In view of the plain' determination of America to allow Japan to rearm, the Government did well to obtain that pact; but, having obtained it, we must do everything possible to ensure that it shall be a real and living force. At the same time, we must keep our powder dry. I agree entirely with the honourable member for Angas( Mr honourable members on both sides of the Downer) that Australia must establish its defences and be prepared to stand on its own feet. I understand that the Americans intend to maintain bases in Japan. This Government should, as fully and as often as possible, state its view that those bases should be maintained for as long as possible as a safeguard against future Japanese imperialism. I should like our view on that matter to be placed upon record clearly and plainly. The Minister's statement concluded with an expression of hope that we conduct of Japanese troops. I say shall develop a real Australian foreign great majority of the Australian people policy, without regard for party politics. believe that anything that would tend The course this debate has followed to restore Japanese militarism would be this afternoon leads me to believe that entirely out of place, particularly in that hope may be realized. Honourable view of the outrages that the Japanese members on both sides of the House have systematically practised during the expressed more or less the same view. recent war. That is clearly the viewWe cannot do better than try to preserve that is held by the Australian Labour that attitude of mind. We must l if t party and, judging by the speeches of above the petty issues of party politics the honourable member for Angas( Mr the matter of Australia's security in a Downer), and the honourable member for hostile world. realize, as do other honourable members, porters. Indeed, it would appear to be that at the negotiations for a peace treaty the unanimous view of the House that with Japan Australia's viewpoint will be the popular feeling of the Australian of comparatively little importance. We. people, must face the reality of the position, mence, control of it will not be possible. which is that America's foreign policy It is all very well for some people to is that there shall be a soft peace with advocate that the Japanese should be Japan. But, admitting that, all honorallowed to rearm but only to a limited able members would be recreant to the degree; but once one mounts a tiger it is trust that has been reposed in them by very difficult to get off it. I have not the Australian people if they did not raise the slightest doubt that if Japan is their voices in protest against the terms of allowed to rearm under any conditions the proposed treaty. The probable effect whatever its military, naval and air of the treaty upon Japanese rearmament strength will be used by future Japanese is already causing grave concern to all secGovernments not as an ally of the western tions of the Australian people. The view democracies, against China, or Russia, in of most Australians is that, under the treaty, Japan will be allowed to escape retribution for an aggressive war of unsurpassed treachery, waged with shocking brutality and barbarity. The nation that was responsible for that outrage is to be allowed to go scot free. By a strange paradox, the lot of the vanquished will be far easier than will be that of the victorE. That is the remarkable position with which we are faced. It is pleasing to note that in this debate House have strongly denounced the terms of the proposed treaty. My observations have led me to the conclusion that the vast majority of the Australian people are overwhelmingly opposed to the rearmament of the .Japanese nation. In a gallup poll that was conducted recently, a great majority of the people who were questioned declared themselves as being opposed to Japanese rearmament. I believe their view is based largely upon the treacherous nature of Japan's entry into the war in 1941, and the subsequent without fear of contradiction that the Evans( Mr Osborne), it is also the view (Batman) [5.12] I of the majority of Government supbased on sound instinct, is that if Japanese rearmament is allowed to com-",38,Casey
88,Mr Bird,"the Far East, as wishful thinking on the part of American diplomats would suggest, but solely in the interests of Japan itself. Those forces would be utilized to restore Japanese sovereignty and power to the degree that that country enjoyed from 1914 to 1945. A perusal of the writings and reports of expert observers of the Japanese psychology and Japanese imperialism reveals that all democratic movements that have taken place in Japan have achieved only very limited success and have never really succeeded in becoming a dominant force in Japanese political life. That has been due very largely to the antagonism of the Zaibatsu, the group of financial interests that wields enormous power and like the Krupps group in Germany specializes in the manufacture of armaments. In the past that financial oligarchy practically determined Japanese foreign policy. On this matter I can speak only from what I have read and from what I have learned from persons who have visited Japan and have studied conditions in that country. observed Japanese methods are convinced that the real aim of those in control in Japan is to regain Japan's former domination in international affairs, that a deep-seated hatred of the Western Powers still exists in Japan and that the militarists in Japan are only awaiting an opportunity to. prepare for a war of revenge. I trust that they will not be permitted to do so as the result of folly or excessive trust on the part of the western democracies. I admit that the Japanese as a nation are energetic and industrious and that they possess great ability. that many Japanese profoundly wish to live at peace with the rest of the world and that their country will not again enter upon militaristic aggression. However, the fact remains that the Japanese who hold those views have very little influence in the political life of their 1945. When World War II . ended the country. I should have the greatest difficulty in believing that the majority of the Japanese have been converted to the democratic way of life in the few years that have elapsed since the end of the recent war. The trimmings of democracy mav be visible to the outside world, but if the Japanese have acquired even the veneer of democracy since the end of the recent war, they have accomplished something that is beyond my comprehension. As the honourable member for Angas has pointed out, democracy is a growth of many centuries. Consequently, seriousminded people cannot be expected to believe that within a period of five, or six, years the Japanese have become imbued with democratic ideals. The Minister for External Affairs( Mr Casey) informed the House to-day that the draft peace treaty is now being circulated among interested governments and, apparently, a decision is to be made on this matter in the near future. As one of the countries that played a part in the defeat of Japan in the recent war, Australia has every right to be represented at the conference at which the treaty will be considered. I repeat that I do not believe that any observation that our representatives might make will carry much weight because it would appear that the United States of America will have the deciding voice. However, Experts who have closely despite those misgivings, I urge that Australia's spokesmen at the forthcoming -conference present Australia's viewpoint in the clearest terms to the world. In respect of any military settlement that may be discussed we should insist upon guarantees of security for not only our country but also other countries in the Pacific that were victims of Japanese aggression in the recent war. We should also insist that the treaty shall provide for economic aid to East Asian countries along the lines of the Colombo agreement. We must envisage rising standards of living for the EastI have no doubt Asian peoples if we are to do our utmost to ensure that another war shall not occur in the Pacific. Recent press reports of statements by American diplomats indicate that the proposed Japanese treaty will not be framed on the basis of the ideas that prevailed on this subiect in Australian people, together with those of the Western democracies, believed that the Japanese should be completely demilitarized and that the form of government that had prevailed in Jana.n for centuries should be replaced by the democratic system of eovemme-nt. Members of all political parties in this country were unanimous that the Japanese people should be given civil and political rights similar to those enjoyed hy the peoples of the Western democracies and that the feudal system of Japan should be replaced by a modern economy that would benefit the Japanese people as a whole. L regret to have to admit that since the end of the recent war not very much has been done in that direction. I refuse to believe that the life of the Japanese people has been basically altered as a result of the occupation of that country by Allied forces. Proposals for a peace treaty have been discussed since 1947 when General MacArthur made a plea that the treaty be concluded as soon as possible. Those proposals were discussed in Canberra in August, 1947. However, very little headway has been made up to date because of the difficulty of procedure. It would appear that steps have now been taken to surmount that obstacle. The original idea was that tbe peace treaty should be determined, on the basis of a two-thirds majority, by the thirteen nations that are represented on the Par Eastern Commission and that no right of veto should operate. That proposal has been consistently opposed by Russia, which has insisted upon the right of veto by any of the great powers. We are now informed on reliable authority that only nations whose representation is approved by the United States of America will take part in the discussions on the treaty. compensation to our service personnel Consequently several countries that are represented on tbe Far Eastern Commission and which played a part in tbe defeat of Japan will be excluded. The peace treaty conference should decide whether the Japanese should be allowed to have military bases; whether they should be allowed to rearm and, if so, to what degree; and whether any territorial changes should be made. In recent months Mr John Foster Dulles has been engaged in placing the view of the United States of America with respect to the proposed treaty before the governments of the Western democracies. I understand that when Mr Dulles recently visited Australia he placed before the then Minister for External Affairs the draft of the proposed treaty. In the Mr Bird. meantime, he has amplified those terms and has made public pronouncements which would indicate that the draft treaty does not prohibit the rearmament of Japan, that it does not impose any restrictions on the Japanese economy and does not involve any obligation on the part of Japan to pay reparations. I take this opportunity to protest most vigorously against the proposal that Japan shall not be obliged to make reparations. When one remembers Pearl Harbour, the Manila horror, the death inarches in Malaya, the agonies of Changi and the Burma-road, and the massacres that the Japanese perpetrated on subject peoples, it would appear to one that the Western democracies have gone haywire if they do not intend to exact reparations from the Japanese in justice to the people who suffered so mercilessly at their hands. If ever an unanswerable case could be made for the payment of reparations by one nation to other nations that suffered because of its wanton aggression, such a case can now be made against Japan. My blood boils when I think of the change of outlook that has taken place on this subject during the last few years and when I think that the Western democracies are now prepared to forget about Japanese atrocities in the recent war. On several occasions in this House we have discussed a proposal that the Government shall make provision out of reparation payments by Japan for who suffered as prisoners of the Japanese. It should be the first duty of Australia's representative at the peace treaty conference to make the strongest possible representation for the payment of reparations even on a limited scale in order thatsuch compensation may be made available to those who have a just claim to it. Considerable* mystery exists concerning the terms of the draft treaty, but, apparently, we can expect to be informed of them in the near future. If the Japanese are to be allowed to rearm, Australia's representative should offer the strongest objection to the restoration of heavy industries in Japan because such industries will provide the basis for rearmament in the fullest sense and enable the Japanese to undertake a programme -of shipbuilding, aircraft manufacture and the manufacture of armoured vehicles of all kinds. Such a development would be a definite threat to Australia's safety. We recall, as the honourable member for Evans pointed out, how rapid were the advances which the Japanese were able to make in the recent war because it had at its disposal a large merchant marine. In no circumstances should the Empire of Hirohito be allowed to establish a merchant marine which could be turned to similar use in the future. We should never forget our bitter experience in that respect. It is difficult to believe that if tbe Japanese were allowed to rearm they would .hesitate, to seek living-room in 1 other countries and that they would not impose their authority on other countries in order to obtain sources of food and raw materials as well as to ensure markets for the disposal of Japanese products. We have been told on several occasions in this House that the population of Japan has increased by 11,000,000 since 1945 and that it is estimated that it will will enable Japan to emerge as a possible double itself within 50 years. Japan will be confronted with the problem of milking provision for its surplus population and, in those circumstances, regardless of anyagreemeut that it might make with the Western democracies, it would take every opportunity to conserve its own interests. It is not difficult to imagine that should Great Britain, or the United States of America, become involved in hostilities in Europe, Japan would decide to make another drive southward with dire consequences for Australia. Despite all that has been said about the new strategic needs that have arisen as a result of the changing world situation, Australians will not be readily convinced that they have banished the danger of a resurgent Japan. We should take care to ensure that, within a decade, we shall not be confronted by a powerful militaristic Japan that is eager to recover its lost empire. Whether or not Japan should have industries beyond the category of those that are required to sustain its population is a matter that must be considered carefully before a decision is made. The Government must take a realistic view of its obligations in respect of the proposed peace treaty, and must not allow itself to be weaned from them by specious promises that may be given to us by America or by any other country. From what I have heard, I am afraid that, when the draft terms of the peace treaty emerge, it will be found that the proposals will be such as will set Japan on the way to becoming a country with a strong war potential. Such a situation, in itself, will constitute a grave menace to our sovereignty. Any restraints that may be included in the peace treaty will have little effect if the militarists again get into the saddle, and, from what I know of Japan, it may not be long before they will, be seated firmly in it. Our primary concern must be to protect and promote the best interests of the British Ooramonwoalth, and particularly those of our own country. Our primary interest in Japan, by reason of our experiences in World War II . , must be. of necessity, a negative one. We must not support any positive proposals that war-ma.ker. We must ensure that, whatever may happen in the future, Japan shall not be so powerful as it was in 1941. Such an attitude is perfectly understandable, because it merely follows the instinct of self-preservation. From what I have been able to ascertain, I believe that the people who rule Japan to-day belong to the same class and have the same outlook as those who were responsible for tbe participation of that country in World War II . If this Parliament is given an opportunity to determine the industries that Japan shall be allowed to maintain, our decisions should be dictated, not by the requirements of commercial vested interests, but by considerations that involve our own security. able member's time has expired. mencing with the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen), every honourable gentleman who has expressed his views on the terms of the proposed peace treaty with 0 Japan has voiced his fears about them.

Therefore much as we if r . Ryan. the demilitarization of the Rhineland, his Precisely nothing! The second question that I ask is : Are we prepared to enforce a treaty that imdisarmed for in that respect also applies to Great may wish to disarm Japan permanently, I doubt whether, psychologically or practically, such is Teally possible. Honourable members, when they place their views on record regarding this matter, should examine the realties of the situation, based upon experience, and not wish hopefully for conditions that we ourselves may never be able to bring about. So much for the matter of disarmament. What does the immediate future hold for us, assuming that Japan is disarmed ? Again, I shall make a brief comparison between Germany and Japan. Germany, after World WarI . , was disarmed to some degree. Its guns were destroyed, it was deprived of its tanks, and its arms and munitions factories were dismantled to a large degree, but manpower, bureaucracy and institutions were left untouched. All that was done by the allies in those days was to cut off the head of the Kaiser's government, and impose upon Germany a so-called democratic government, at the time of the Weimar Republic. But the whole structure of Germany and of its institutions remained untouched and unchanged, with the result that when the militant Hitler came into power, he found all those weapons lying ready to his hand. All that he had to do was to issue orders, which were carried out in a short space of time. He found the old officers, the old governors, the old military instructors, and large numbers of military personnel -who had received training in the volunteer forces in Germany. Within four or five years, he rebuilt the German army and air force, and Germany quickly became a strong military power. I ask honourable members to direct their minds now to the situation in Japan. What has happened in that country? The armaments industry has been completely destroyed. Those honourable members who visited Japan a few years ago, and saw the remains of such factories, know that it will take years to rebuild them. The civil service has been changed, and the education system has been altered to some degree. As the result of such destruction and changes, I can see no possibility of a resurgence ' of Japanese strength in the immediate future. There is another matter that should also be observed. All of us who have a knowledge of Japan are well aware that oil, and all the raw materials for its heavy industries, including iron, nickel and tie rare metals such as tungsten, must be obtained from other countries. Japan would .be obliged to import all the sinews of war. position if Russia provided Japan with its requirements? ments could be obtained from Russia, but so long as we have some control, such as we have to-day, over Japan's imports, we can ensure that its supplies of those various metals shall not be increased to a dangerous degree. I agree that Japan may purchase some of its requirements from various sources, such as China, but such transactions would be made,, not in the immediate present but in the future. I cannot see, in the next four or five years, any great danger of Japanese resurgence in that way. I wholeheartedly support in principle the complete disarmament of Japan. If I could disarm Japan permanently, I would do so. However, such a plan would not be practicable and, because of the mutability of the minds of men, it might not even seem desirable. Our views to-day are firm. What they will be five, ten or fifteen years hence who can say? If Australia believes firmly in complete disarmament, of Japan, it is up to us to say to the United States of America, "" If you think that we are wrong and will not undertake the task of enforcing disarmament, we shall send Australian troops to do the job"". The United States might accept that offer, but I am certain that Australia would have neither the strength nor the will to send large bodies of men out of the country for such a purpose. I should like my views to be clearly understood by honourable members. 'I do not trust the Japanese, and I do not want to like them. I do not believe that their character has changed. Nevertheless, I disagree with the honourable member for Perth( Mr Tom Burke) and other members of the Opposition who have said that Japan is more likely to be an enemy than a friend of the British democracies. My mind goes back over a period of about twenty years to the",43,Casey
91,Mr Haylen,What would be the,45,Casey

It has engaged in a long series of wars with China, as well as with Russia. If T were to make a bet on the issue, I should prefer to have my money on the prospect of Japan being friendly with the democracies, provided that it was reasonably well treated. I admit that ii. would be a doubtful gamble, but that alinement is much more probable than is an association between Russia and J apan. I do not believe that it would be possible to impose a policy of complete and permanent disarmament on Japan. At the same time, I am entirely opposed to the granting to Japan of complete freedom to rearm. I favour the giving of permission for a modest degree of rearmament, excluding the acquisition of long range bombers and warships. Honourable members should keep in mind the fact that Japan is a long way from Australia and that, in order to approach this country, it would need not only large numbers of merchant ships and transport vessels but also strong protecting forces. My mind, and the minds of many others in Australia, would be at ease if Japan were permitted to rearm subject to the restrictions that I have mentioned. [5.49] -The tenor of this debate has given point to the great difficulties that beset nations after they have defeated their enemies in arriving at satisfactory peace terms. Like other honourable members, I am greatly concerned about the future of Japan. Events move swiftly in the realm of international affairs and, even since the Minister for External Affairs( Mr Casey) made the statement which the House is now considering, there has been a big change in relation to the war in Korea. We are faced to-day with the old problem of power politics, with combinations of armed nations facing each other across the world. The difficulty of framing a peace treaty with Japan that would satisfy Australia and the rest of the democracies is complicated by the fact that there are two great opposing armed blocs in the world. One iscomposed of Russia and its satellites and democracies. I try to be realistic in my attitude to the proposed Japanese peacesettlement. We, as a people, are opposed to the rearming of Japan and the rehabilitation of that nation to such a degree as would enable it to develop itsheavy industries. If Japan's heavy industries were reconstructed, it would be in a position to rearm once more. Nevertheless, however much we may be opposed to the regrowth of Japan, we must acknowledge the fact that its Government has a right to do the best that it can for its people. We may forbid Japan to restore its heavy industries and to build or purchase ships above a limited tonnage, but Ave must realize that it will have to engage in world trade in order to support itself and, therefore, that it must be allowed to import raw materials,, for which it will need to produce goods for export. This raises the old bogy of Japanese competition in foreign markets. In order that the Japanese people may maintain a reasonable standard of living, they will have to manufacture goods and merchandise with which to finance their purchases of raw materials. I was pleased to hear the honourable member for Flinders( Mr Ryan) discuss the long standing difference between Japan and China. Many persons fear that Japan will turn to Chinai f its trade with other countries is restricted. They believe that China is the logical source of raw materials for Japanese industry. At present, China is dominated by Russia. If the United States of America, the United Kingdom and the other democracies enforce a harsh peace settlement on Japan, will Japan turn to Russia and China? The honourable member for Flinders considers that such a rapprochement is unlikely. The honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley) discussed the same subject and expressed the view that Japan would seek to extend its influence in the direction of the Pacific area rather than into China. I abhor the conduct of the Japanese during World War II . and am not prepared to trust them in the future. What they did in the past they will be prepared to do again",45,Casey
93,Mr Thompson (Port Adelaide),"in the future. But who will gain control -of Japani f we refuse to allow it to rearm? Who will protect it should it be attacked in its defenceless state? What would Australia do if , after it had insisted with the United States of America that Japan should not rearm, the forces of Russian-dominated China launched an assault on Japanese territory? Would we stand aside and watch the forces of aggression prosper? If Japan were denuded of American troops and had no armed forces of its own, would the events of Korea be repeated there? Would Australia be called upon to fight, not enly for the United Nations, but also for the Japanese, whom we abhor for what they have done in the past? These questions pose a very difficult problem, and we must consider every aspect of it carefully. The United States of America has borne most of tbe responsibility so far, and therefore it will want to have a big say in the final decision. I ask for leave to continue my remarks. Leave granted; debate adjourned. Sitting suspended from 5.58 to 8 p.m. (POWERS TO DEAL WITH BILL 1951. Debate resumed from 5th July (vide That the bill he now read a second time. of the Opposition. Speaker. I draw your attention to the ruling which you gave in this House on the 13th March, which is' recorded at page 329 of Ha.nsa.rd of that date. In that ruling, you upheld the principle that honourable members who had appeared in the courts in certain matters were not entitled subsequently to speak in this House on those matters. I think it is incontestible that that ruling applies to the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) in view of the terms of the bill that is at present before the House. This involves the validity of legislation in relation to which the right honourable member ap peared in the High Court. On the 26th October, 1950, the right honourable member himself brought before the notice of this House his part in those proceedings. My intention in bringing this subject forward is to uphold the forms and integrity of this House, and not to prevent the right honourable member from speaking. If you uphold my point of order, Mr Speaker, I intend to move forthwith tbe suspension of Standing Orders in ordei to allow him to proceed. remember the ruling that I gave. It was given after investigation and it was very clear and to the effect that if an honourable member appeared in court in connection with a case then he could not speak or vote on that matter in this House. That was my ruling, and ii stands. Of course, like all rulings of the Speaker, it is subject to the superioi decision of the House. move That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended Speaker? was that if an honourable member has appeared in the courts in a case and then attempts to speak or vote in this House on that matter he cannot be allowed to do so under a decision of the House of Commons of 1858.

The decision of the House of Commons to which I have referred was in force when federation was effected, and, according to section 49 of the Constitution, this House took over the rules, standing orders, usages and procedure of the Commons as at that time. That is still one of the rules of the Commons and, so far as I know, it has never been superseded by this House.

117,Mr Speaker,"The honourable memOpposition) [8.11] -It is not about anything that the House has done that I complain, Mr Speaker. This is a bill of very great significance and importance. If honourable members analyse it fairly they will find that it represents a direct frontal attack on all the established principles of British justice. It goes much further than the legislation which was recently held by the High Court of Australia to be unconstitutional. I think I can establish that this is one of the most dangerous measures that has ever been submitted to the legislature of an English-speaking people. I do not think that a bill of this character would receive a moment's consideration from the mother of parliaments, the British Parliament for in that Parliament traditions of political liberty and established justice are always recognized and are, indeed, all powerful. It is not only Britain of which that is true. It applies equally to the United States of America. In that country, proposals such as this, despite the deep hostility of Americans to communism, have never been brought forforward. The American Constitution would probably prevent the acceptance of a bill of this character. The American Constitution tally on a belief in justice. In America and in the United Kingdom they do not talk as democrats and act as fascists. They do not attempt to outlaw their fellow citizens as a group, irrespective of whether they have broken the law of the land. On the contrary, they enforce the law of the land against all who break it whether they be Communists or other offenders who are not Communists. I shall sum up the attitude of the Australian Labour party on this subject. In the first place it is stated excellently in two basic declarations of the Labour conferences of 194S and 1951. The first of those two declarations reads as follows:Conference reaffirms its repudiation of the methods and principles of the Communist party and the decisions of previous conferences Crimes Act. The scope of those provithat between the Communist party ancl the Labor party there is such basic hostility and differences that no Communist can be a member of the Labor party. No Communist auxiliary or subsidiary can be associated with the Labor party in any activity and no Labor party Branch or member can co-operate with the Communist party. Conference further declares that the policj and the actions of tlie Communist party demonstrates that that party's methods and objects aim at the destruction of the democratic way of life of -the Australian people and the establishment in its place of a totalitarian form of government which would destroy our existing democratic institutions and the personal liberty of the Australian people. Then the conference made the following declaration:The Australian Labor party expresses its adherence to the basic freedoms of the right of association and the right of expression, which are fundamental principles associated with the Australian democratic way of life. We therefore declare that any proposal for the banning of a political party because of hostility and objection to its platform and beliefs, no matter how repugnant such may be, is a negation of democratic principles and should be rejected. Conference stresses that freedom of expression enables the community to determine the soundness or otherwise of political philosophies and reject such views as are inimical to the people's interests. SecondlyI point out that from the point of view of the Australian Labour movement, it is a fundamental proposition that any person who attempts to endanger in any way the internal security or defence of the country can be, and should be, dealt with under the criminal laws that are in force. Those is based fundamenlaws are contained in the Crimes Act, many sections of which deal with this very problem in various aspects. The law is already in existence to be enforced, and it should be enforced in relation to any person, whether a Communist or not, who endangers the security or defence of Australia. Thirdly, I ' think that it is clear from a careful examination of the High Court's judgment that the judges declared that this Parliament, and all governments, have full powers under the Constitution, without any. amendment of it being necessary, to deal with offences of every kind of a treasonable, seditious or subversive character. As I pointed out a moment ago, many of the relevant legislative provisions are contained in the sions is wide. The courts have upheld them in a number of cases that they dealt with during the Labour Government's period of office. I repeat that the necessary laws are already there to be enforced.",48,Second Reading
118,Dr. Evatt (Barton,"Leade r of theFourthly, if the existing criminal law needs strengthening in these respects the Labour party will support amendments to it. Fifthly, no justification exists for abandonment of the recognized principles of British justice, through the introduction of alien measures that are characteristic, not of a democracy, but of a police state. Finally, the present proposal, which is designed to effect a permanent amendment of the Constitution, will introduce into the Constitution wide powers, indeed blanket powers, that will lead inevitably to the partial overthrow of the basis of the Constitution and will injure the safeguards of justice contained in that document. There is not the slightest doubt that this amendment could be used at some future date to divide, weaken or even destroy the political and industrial Labour movements of Australia. I now direct the attention of the House to the terms of the proposal. Honourable members will see that it proposes two legislative powers. There is a tendency to say that it proposes to bestow only one power but if honourable member's examine clause 2 they will see that under the proposed new section 51A the bill deals with two separate ancl distinct legislative powers. The first will permit the Parliament to make such laws for the peace order and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to Communists and communism-both of which terms are undefined-as it considers to be necessary or expedient for the defence or security of the Commonwealth. Honourable members will see at once that the final judgment about the expediency or necessity of the legislation that may be enacted under the power to be granted by the proposed alteration of the Constitution is expressly made the business of the Parliament itself, and not of the tribunal which is the protector of the Constitution. That is to say, the Parliament and not the High Court will make the final judgment. That is a unique and unprecedented proposal. I point out also, and I shall refer to it again that there is no defiproblems that this country and other nition of the terms "" communism"" and "" Communists "". On this branch of the proposal the Parliament is now to be asked to give certain legislative authority which the people are to be asked to endorse. Dr. Evatt. That legislative authority did not exist in relation to defence even during the most crucial years of World War II . The second power which is asked for-and it is quite distinct from the first power that I have mentioned, and which I shall discuss later-is contained in proposed new section 51A (2.) which seeks to give the Parliament power to make a law in the terms of the Communist Party Dissolution Act, a measure which has been declared unconstitutional and invalid by the High Court. Under the proposed power the Parliament will be able to make a law in the precise terms of that act. although, I repeat, it is at present void and of no force; or it could vary the provisions of that act by empowering itself to deal with any of the matters that that act was designed to cover. What is the substance of the Communist Party Dissolution Act, against which the High Court has ruled? The Prime Minister, in his speech last Thursday, said practically nothing about it. I can understand his reluctance to discuss the High Court case in detail, because if it were examined in detail it would destroy a great part of his argument for the adoption, by the Parliament and the people, of the present proposal. The provisions of the Communist Party Dissolution Act should be forgotten, because the present proposal of the Government is, in substance, to force the High Court to recognize the validity of an attempt to exercise the defence powers in circumstances which the court had previously ruled to be highly unconstitutional. The act contained provisions of such a nature that, despite the hatred of communism that is so widespread, the court regarded the means that the Government proposed to adopt under that act to deal with communism, as quite outside the scope of the defence power. It is quite fallacious to suppose that the High Court held that the Parliament could not deal with the Communist problem, or with the related countries may have to meet. What it held was that the provisions of the act showed that it was not connected, in truth, with the defence of Australia. Why was that conclusion reached? The act contained provisions for the confiscation of property without compensation, not only in the case of the Communist party but also in the case of anybody who might be associated with it in one of a large number of ways, perhaps even in the case of an organization which might have a member who had been a Communist or was a member of the Communist party. There was an exemption provision that related to registered trade unions, but that provision certainly did not cover some of the trades and labour councils in the States, which are not registered. The present proposal would authorize the Parliament to widen the attack on trade unions and organizations, and would enable the passage of legislation that would cover many organizations and trade unions that have no belief in the concept of communism that was expounded by Lenin and adopted by Stalin. The Parliament is asked, through this measure, to place before the people a proposal that would allow it to make selections from the Communist Party Dissolution Act, which, I repeat, the High Court has ruled to be unconstitutional, certain subject-matter contained in that act. It could, for instance, vary the definition of "" Communist"" in that act. was wide enough, as was pointed out in the House at the time that the bill was debated. It might easily have covered advocates of certain aspects of socialization. If this proposal is accepted by the people even that definition can be widened, because that is one of the two matters dealt with under clause 2 which are to go before the people, and because it is suggested that the Parliament should be given that express power. So the bill is not only asking power for the Parliament to pass a certain act in precise terms but it is also asking for power to widen the previously. existing terms of that measure. If the people approve theproposed constitutional alteration the Parliament could remove the exemption that applies to many registered organizations, and make provisions relating to exemptions more rigorous, although the High Court considered such powers in the Communist Party Dissolution Act as being in many respects too rigorous. I say that it is quite unheard of in the constitutional history of this country at anj rate, and, I think in the constitutional history of every other federal nation, that a precise act of Parliament which an appropriate court has declared to be ullra vires is to be validated through the adoption of a constitutional process by its submission to a vote of the people taken in a referendum. The second part of the proposal goes further, because, as I have tried to point out, and as the wording of the clause makes quite clear, all the limitations and qualifications contained in the act, some of which I have mentioned, such as the exemption of registered trade unions, could be removed and any or all trade unions could be brought under the provisions of the measure. Indeed, some of the trades and labour councils which are not registered would already come under the provisions of the Communist Party Dissolution Act had it not been declared invalid. If the exemption provisions were removed from the act then every trade union in Australia would be brought within its reach. If a trade union had Communists or ex-Communists among its membership it would run the risk, under amended legislation, of being Heaven knows, the definition declared illegal, of having its property confiscated without compensation and of being, in effect, wound up under the procedure set out in the Communist Party Dissolution Act. If this bill is passed and accepted by the people the provisions of that act could be modified and the methods of procedure would make such a revision as the people are now asked to adopt, really a complete excrescence on the Constitution. Honourable members have only to read the Constitution with its list of Commonwealth powers contained in section 51 and the subsequent additions in relation to social services, to see that that would be so. Section 52 of the Constitution deals with the exclusive powers of the Parliament to make laws for the peace, order and good government of the Commonwealth. Those powers deal with matters of a permanent nature, and they will be necessary for an undefined number of years. The Parliament and the people are now asked to add to that constitutional structure something that is really an excrescence and that is contradictory to the whole nature and purpose of the Constitution, simply to counter the fact that the Government met defeat in a case in which its power to make laws under the defence power was challenged, and to allow it to force its views on the people by having a special amendment of the Constitution to deal with that position. I say that in 50 years' time or less, historians looking back on this matter will be amazed that the Parliament, instead of dealing with the subject of seditious activities by permentally to the defence of the country sons and organizations which could be dealt with by the Government by the use of provisions already in existence in the Crimes Act, passed a law to deal with Communists and communism only. Is communism the only evil under the sun? It leaps to the eye that the doctrines of the enemies of this country and of the British Commonwealth during the last war also deserve inclusion in any provision to restrain influences that are evil or that may become evil. It would be reasonable to expect that any measure designed to deal with extremism would contain the words "" fascists"" and "" fascism "". But this measure is designed merely to meet the position that arose when the Government's previous measure was declared to be unconstitutional. It is quite contrary to any recognized constitutional principle. What was the essence of the High Court finding from the point of view of the defence power? The High Court has given a number of interpretations of the defence power. During World War I. it held that the power covered such matters as the fixation of prices of necessary commodities. In World War II. it carried that doctrine even further and to wider purpose. The defence power is really the great reserve power of the Constitution to deal with matters that are not purely defence matters, but are of economic or social import in relation to defence. In the case which involved the Communist Party Dissolution Act the court did not take a narrow view of the defence power. It took the very broadest view of it. It realized that the act stated that when property was to be confiscated there was to be no hearing at all, but Dr. Evatt. merely a declaration of guilt by the Parliament and by the Executive. There was no right to be heard, no charge, no hearing, and no particulars. In fact there was nothing except an Executive declaration in the case of individuals who were to be excluded from trade union office or public service employment. In the case of affiliated bodies there was again a completely arbitrary declaration by the Executive. The court held that if it was said that a person or body, in the opinion of the Executive, was acting detrithat did not link up with defence, it merely linked up with Executive opinion. In this measure there is an attempt, being made to bypass the judicial organs of the Commonwealth and to allow the Executive in place of the judiciary to decide the facts of any particular case without any of the procedures which are recognized as basic to the administration of justice. It is one thing to put forward a measure such as the Communist Party Dissolution Act in a time of national emergency or fear, but it is quite another thing to embody such a measure in an amendment to the Constitution which may ultimately become less just than the original act would have been. That is a very wrong thing. Once this matter is fully explained to the people of Australia. I believe that they will not support such a proposal. The tragedy is that this measure is being put forward by a Government part of which at least calls itself liberal. But the bill authorizes action which is the very antithesis of liberalism. None of the great Liberals of Britain would consider such a measure for one moment. Even to-day no party in the House of Commons, and I do not believe a single member, would endorse such a proposal. Liberalism stands for the proceedings of justice and the due processes of law. The great framers of the American Constitution had in mind the struggles of the British people towards freedom, and their various constitutional victories, when they framed their own Constitution. They therefore included safeguards in the American Constitution against such attacks upon the freedom of the people. It is a sad and tragic thing that a Liberal Government should sponsor such a measure in this century. It is .being done despite tbe fact that tbe existing laws of Australia provide fully for the prosecution and punishment of every form of sedition including seditious activities, enterprises and conspiracies. If the Government believes that it should proceed .against the Communist party and have it declared unlawful, mere is a providefence of the country. sion in the Crimes Act to deal with the matter. The Government could take proceedings to-morrow in a Supreme Court or in the High Court of Australia for a declaration that tbe Communist party or any of its auxiliaries is an 'unlawful association because it advocates the overthrow of the Constitution by force or violence. It may well be asked why the Government has not used that power. Why does it want the Parliament and the Executive to do what a court is already empowered to do? One reason maybe that when pro1 ceedings are taken under the Crimes Act the facts must be brought before the court. Lt must be proved by evidence that the people in question advocate the overthrow of the Constitution by force or violence. Action similar to that was taken in the American case mentioned recently by the Prime Minister, -known as the Dennis case. That case was brought before the American Supreme Court. Leading Communists were charged with advocating the overthrow of the Constitution of the United States by fior.ce or violence. That had been made a criminal offence by an act called the Smith Act, and these men were indicted and prosecuted under that act. The case came 'before a judge, a jury was empanelled, and evidence was called for and against. After the judge had told the jury that they must be satisfied that the charge was proved beyond reasonable doubt before they convicted, the jury convicted the people charged. What the Prime Minister read about the Denmis 'case -when he introduced this measure, simply related to the question whether in spite of the fact that the defendants conspired to overthrow the Constitution by force the constitutional guarantee ;of freedom of speech in the American .constitution .entitled them to an acquittal. The greater part of the repent of the Dennis case could be quoted more against the Prime Minister than for him. The Smith Act of America gives to [40] -an 'accused -person an opportunity of putting his case before a jury. He is heard on the facts, and the case is decided according to justice. That is the difference between the Smith Act and -the act which the High Court ruled to be unconstitutional because in was not really connected with the I turn now to paragraph (a) of subsection (2.) of proposed new section 51A, which is completely new. The Government wishes to go further than the act which Avas declared unconstitutional. Subparagraph (i) seeks a violent departure from the recognized principles of the Constitution, for it provides that the Parliament is to be the final judge of Avhat is necessary or expedient for the defence of Australia. This first provision amounts to a -transparent attempt to -circumvent the jurisdiction of .the High Court of Australia as the interpreter of the -Constitution, and it is a direct attack on the court. The provision would not apply to any other branch of the defence power except this one -matter. On that .the Parliament is to -have the last word, but on every other question connected Avith the defence power the matter has to come before the High -Court. I draw particular attention to the use of the Avords in this .provision as coaitr.asted Avith the definitions sections of the Communist Party Dissolution Act 1950, which Avas ruled unconstitutional. Sub-section -(1.) of proposed new section 51A includes the terms "" Communist"" and "" communism "", but no definition is provided as was the case in the Communist Party Dissolution Act. The Oxford English Dictionary defines communism asA theory which advocates a state of society in which there ^should he no private ownership, all property being vested in the community and labour organized for .the common benefit of all members; the professed principle being ithat each should work according to his capacity and receive according to his wants. "" Communist"" would have a similar meaning. Therefore, it is possible that members of many political and economic groups might be caught up in the definition of "" Communist"". It would be a matter for the court to interpret, and the court Avould not he bound by any definition given by the Parliament on another occasion. whether there is not a far more sinister purpose lying hehind these proposals of the Government. Why does the Government need these powers now that the act has heen rejected by the court? I say that any person who believes in socialism could be-brought within the scope of this definition. The Prime Minister, in his 1949 policy speech, referred to the Labour party, and said that he was going to make war on socialism. By that he meant that he would make war on tbe Labour party. hear! the "" Hear, hears!"" which have come from Government supporters. Apparently they Australian Labour party from socialism. Therefore, this definition would be broad enough to cover the activities or membership of the Australian Labour party. If these powers are granted to the Parliament there will be no barrier in the way of those who wish to extend the reach of measures such as the Germany. He acted withou't having done one that the court rejected, to ensure that organizations like trade unions, labour groups and the like, will be caught up by them. As a matter of fact no reference has been made by the Prime Minister to the necessity for this measure, against the Labour movement and against and not a single argument has been adduced in support of it. When one turns to the objectives of the Australian Labour party one sees that it proposes socialization or social control to the extent necessary to eliminate exploitation. There is enough in that to justify the Parliament or the Government, if it were so minded, to attack trade union activities and the political activities of the Labour party. Government or the Parliament will be the judge of what is necessary or expedient. That would be an extraordinary provision to find in a constitution. Usually an act of parliament contains principles and sometimes a regulation-making power. Here there is a provision that the power to make laws shall be determined by what the Parliament considers to be necessary or expedient for the defence or security of the Commonwealth. That is completely That raises the question opposed to, and overrides, the High Court. Therefore, it overrides the Constitution, because the basis of the federal constitution is an independent court which may determine whether the acts of the Australian Parliament fall within its power under the Constitution. Now, it is proposed that instead of the High Court being the arbiter, the Parliament should place itself in the position of the court. The High Court will not make the decision on the matter dealt with in this measure; the decision will be made by the Parliament. Moreover, there is no provision for appeal, and no constitutional challenge to the dragnet powers of the Government. Without using any legal process, the Government could take action against any do not dissociate the persons who belonged to the group mentioned Or who subscribed to the theory mentioned. It would be subject to no restraint whatever. trouble of amending the Constitution of so. This would permit the establishment of concentration camps. It would permit executive action to be taken against certain persons who had no legal safeguards. The power could be used a trade union that subscribed to an objective that could be regarded as socialistic. The Government has not given a single reason why it wants, in addition to power to re-enact the 1950 legislation, with amendments, the other power that it seeks under the bill. What is the purpose of the Government in seeking that extra power ? What does it wish to do in The addition to re-enacting the measure that the High Court decided was unconstitutional? This bill bears no semblance of liberalism. It is extreme reactionary conservatism. Indeed, it is more than that. It is totalitarianism. It is fascist in spirit and a definite step towards the police State. It will cut a link between this country and the basic features of British law and jurisprudence. When we are considering amending the Constitution, we must remember that any alteration that may be agreed to will not",49,Second Reading

121,Dr. Evatt,"Hitle r did not go to thedie with the life of one parliament but will become a permanent alteration, unless a further change be made after a referendum. It is most important to consider a proposed alteration of the Constitution as something enduring, and intended not to deal with a momentary problem of a government, but to be enshrined permanently in the Constitution. This alteration, if made, will be regarded as a blot upon our Constitution and upon the records of all who sponsored it. We believe that if a Communist commits acts of sabotage or engages in seditious enterprises, he should be dealt with under the ordinary criminal law. That is the principle upon which Labour governments have acted. When Communist threats were made to hold up work on the guided missiles testing range, a Labour government secured the passage of the Approved Defence Projects Protection Act, which prescribed criminal penalpolitical ally of the present Government, ties for any boycott of defence projects. No attempt was made to give the Executive special powers to deal with those threats, and the matter was left to the courts of justice. The Approved Defence Projects Protection Act was 100 per cent, effective, and no further similar threats were made When some Communists attempted to sabotage production in this country by fomenting a general coal strike in 1949, a Labour government secured the passage of the National Emergency (Coal Strike) Act. Offenders against that measure were convicted according to the ordinary processes of law, not for being Communists but for disobeying court orders. Offending trade unions were also dealt with on the same principle. When a Communist leader in Australia talked about welcoming a foreign army that might land on these shores, a Labour government invoked the existing Crimes Act against him, and he was tried before a jury. In other similar cases, some men were convicted and others were acquitted. Labour proceeded on the basis that any individual who committed an overt act against the defence or security of this country should be dealt with under the ordinary criminal code. If Communists engage in a criminal conspiracy, there are laws on the statute-book under which they can be dealt with, and those laws should be enforced. If seditious words are uttered, those who utter them are liable to heavy penalties under the existing law. That law could, and should, be invoked to deal with cases of that kind. Existing constitutional powers covering the defence of the Commonwealth are wide enough to enable the Government to proceed against persons who engage in treasonable or seditious activities, but apparently the Government does not like the existing laws. It has used the Crimes Act to deal with offences by trade unions and, therefore, it would appear that it has no fundamental objection to that measure, but apparently it is not satisfied with the existing law or with the Constitution. Having been defeated in the High Court upon the Communist Party Dissolution Act, it now wants to alter the Constitution and win its case in that way. In a sense, communism is really the which has used communism as its principal propaganda front for some years. The Prime Minister has not always held the view that the Communist party should be banned, because not long ago he opposed very vigorously the idea of banning it. Without the Communist bogy, the Government would have no disguise. able gentleman believe that communism is a bogy ? Minister is using communism as a bogy to delude the people. The Government has all the law of this country at its disposal. What it is doing now, it is doing for political purposes in an attempt to deceive the people, but it will not be able to do so for much longer because many groups that have been deceived are now becoming aware of its insincere attitude. The inflationary and economic crisis is deepening, but the Government has no plan to meet it. The policy speech that was delivered on behalf of the Government parties in 1949 by the Prime Minister has been repudiated. The right honourable gentleman said thenThe laws with respect to sedition or other subversive activities will be reviewed and strengthened.",54,Government Supporters Hear

123,Dr. Evatt,"I say that the PrimeThere has Deem no; review of or proposal toi there must, be given a presumption of. iiiuo strengthen, those l'as,. although such a. proposal would' be considered by the Opposition. The fundamental blunder, of the. Government has been that all itsi efforts have been confined to dealing withaccused' of war crimes, as was done also communism as a political) theory or with Communists as a political group,, and. never to dealing with Communists' whobreak the criminal laws of this country.. The Prime Minister has practically admitted that that was so^ for in the policy speech that he delivered in April, of this year, hesaidWhen, therefore. 1 soy to you. that the Government is pledgedto make-war upon comreferendum-. All that the High Court has munism, I am not talking about an attack upon, individuals as such . . . hut upon a set of evil ideas which are quite foreign to ideologies of a political group. It has our civilization, our traditions; our faith. never refused to allow the Parliament to While the Government has been talking about declaring war on a set of evil ideas, little or no action has been taken against Communists or others, who have been violating the criminal code of Australia. The Prime Minister is obsessed with theidea that he can wage war upon a set of political ideas and upon a hopelessly weak political party-the Communist party. That is why the Government, has encountered serious legal trouble. That is why the 1950 legislation was drafted, in a form which, in normal times, would have been denounced as being tyrannical and contrary to justice. The Government even tried todescribe what it was fighting-by inserting in that measure a preamble which contained a number of recitals. This measure represents an attempt to get those recitals allowed to. justify the commission of some embodied in the Constitution by a back' door method and to by-pass the High Court of Australia. So, too, with the onus of proof. Even in the very limited court review that would have been possible under the Communist Party Dissolution Act, the onus of proof was placed* not on the Commonwealth but on thedeclared person or body: The Government wants; by a constitutional alteration, to re-enact a measure which contains' theprovisions that relate to theonus of proof. [Extension of time granted.] Mr Justice Jackson, who prosecuted! the German, war criminals at Nuremburg, speaking of those persons, said'Despite the fact that' public opinion already condemns their acts, we agree that Dr. Evatt. cence,, and we accept the burden of proving criminal' acts and the responsibilityof thesedefendants for their commission .1 In that case, the prosecution accepted the onus of proving the guilt of Germans in the case of Japanese war criminals, but this Government wants openly to* der part from that principle in. dealing with persons in this; country, who may, as* a result, lose their civil rights. In order topreserve the rule of law in Australia, we must ensure that the peoplewill reject this proposal at the done* in effect, has been to refuse to allow this Government to legislate against the legislate against crime. If an individual be guilty of a crime against his country, including the crime of conspiracy, we say that he should be prosecuted. The Government has in its hands, in the shape of the Crimes Act, a weapon that it can. use against such a person, but it appears not to be worried whether crimes have been committed. It wants to. proceed against certain individuals because they hold particular political ideas, either alone or in common with others. We' say that mer.e ideas or beliefs do not enter into the picture, and that what matters is what a man does or attempts to do. We say that. no. man should be convicted, or deprived of civil rights, merely because he holds certain beliefs, any more than, that he should be crime on the ground that he held such beliefs. It is-not the beliefs-but the crime that matters. The Government has convulsed the politicsoÂ£ the country and engaged in a witch-hunt to track down* and ban a party or disqualify themembers of a party irrespective of any overt acts of proved criminality. Labour governments concent-rated on crimes that were being committed, but this Government concentrateson tracking down beliefs, and on banning, groups and forcing them underground. When the Chifley Government was in office the law was enforcedagainst any man who' acted in. defiance of positive law. Ther Labour party has always maintainedthat this problem can be reduced to very simple terms. It can be solved by tbe unde.viating application of the penal or criminal code of the country, with any amendments that are deemed to be necessary. Because Labour knows that these proposed powers are contrary to all just procedures and because it prefers to follow the great tradition of British justice,, it will call upon the Australian people to reject this submission when the referendum is held. If the proposal were to give the Commonwealth power to pass laws in respect of "" seditious activities by persons or organizations"", we should support it, because the High Court would, then; decide judicially what constituted "" seditious activities"". Every person who was proved to be guilty of having engaged in seditious activities should be punished, irrespective of whether his political beliefs were of the left, right or centre. But I thinkI do not believe, that the High Court's judgment leaves room for doubt on the point-that those matters are, in fact, already within the constitutional power. Many provisions of this kind are already contained in the Crimes Act. I wish to refer to two important court decisions. The first is the majority judgment of the High Court which made it clear that it was largely because of the absence of any legal process that the act was regarded as not being linked to. defence. PerhapsI can best state the matter simply by saying, that if a person acted detrimentally to the security of the country, that would be one thing and dealing with that problem is within the defence power; but if the Executive Government merely express its opinion as a fact that is an entirely different matter. The High Court insisted that in the first instance legal processes according to law were required; whilst in the second instance the Government merely gave a security determination without notice of the charge and without a hearing. That is clear from the judgment of Mr Justice Dixon, who, in dealing particularly with section 9, saidThe matters of which the Governor General is to he satisfied are described most indefinitely-activitie s prejudicial to security valid Commonwealth laws, could, one would and defence, activities prejudicial to the execution or maintenance of the Constitution or of the laws of tlie Commonwealth . . As they are used here they (i.e. the words) express no specific connection with any definite course of subversive conduct'or design. The sub-sections commit to the Governor General in Council complete: authority over the application of these vague expressions; and how they are 1 applied is lef t to depend upon the conceptions, of the Executive Government. . Under those conceptions conduct to which specific legislation could not be validly directed in purported exercise of tlie power to make laws w i th respect to defence might be treated as prejudicial to the security and defence of the Commonwealth. Mr Justice Dixon, said, in effect, "" Hand that topic over to the Executive Government and it may transcend constitutional limits "". Here is a sharp reminder that under a Constitution by which judicial power is committed to courts, the authority of the courts can seldom be circumvented by the Parliament attempting, to do as the Government attempted to do in the act of 1950, which was to act as judge and prosecutor and give, in effect, a verdict of guilty without effective charge or hearing. Mr Justice Williams, in summing up the act, saidThe outstanding character of the Act is that, in the woi-ds of Knox C.J. iri. Ex parte Walsh and Johnson, 37 C.L.K. 36 at p. 69, the enactment in its main provisions ""prohibits no act, enjoins no duty, creates no offence, imposes no sanction for conduct"". lit operates to dissolve the. Australian Communist Party and to forfei t its property to the Commonwealth, and to make other bodies of persons who were in the prescribed period or are likely to be tainted with communism, corporate or unincorporate, liable to be dissolved and their property forfeited to the Commonwealth, and to make persons who were in the prescribed period or are Communists liable to be deprived of important contractual rights without creating any offence the commission of which w ill entail such consequences, and indeed without proof that they have committed any offence against any law of tlie Commonwealth, without a t r i a l in any Court, and without such bodies or persons having any right to prove that they have not done anything prejudicial to tlie security and defence of the Commonwealth or to the execution or maintenance of the Constitution or of the laws of the Commonwealth. That is one of the essential points of the case and it shows that the legislation is not truly linked to defence. Mr Justice Full agar, in dealing with the activities mentioned in the act, saidThat such activities could be the subject of think, not be doubted. Some of them are indeed dealt with in Part HA of the Crimes Act 1914-1946. His Honour was pointing out that, although those imputations and charges were contained in the act, there was no proceeding for determining whether the persons concerned were guilty. The second case to which I wish to refer is the Dennis case in the United States of America which the Prime Minister mentioned. I think that I have already made clear the distinction between that case and the problem that is now before the House. Dennis and another members of the Communist party in the United States of America were charged with conspiracy to overthrow the constitutional system of that country by force. The case was tried by a judge and jury. Evidence was called and the jury returned a verdict of guilty. The case was taken to appeal and the one substantial point that was decided by the Supreme Court was merely whether, after conviction, the principle of free speech had any application. It is obvious from a fair reading of the judgments that Mr Justice Frankfurter and all the American judges would have held on an act such as the Communist Party Dissolution Act or the provisions that are included in the bill now before us were contrary to justice because they made no .provision for a fair hearing or trial whilst they provided for confiscation without right of compensation. agreed toThat so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) from continuing his speech without limitation of time. I stress the importance of the point to which I have just referred because the Prime Minister relied so much upon the judgment in the Dennis case. The Smith Act under which that prosecution was launched was entirely different from the Communist Party Dissolution Act. Indeed, no two acts could 3tand in greater contrast. The former act provided for punishment of crimes, conspiracy, and the advocacy of doctrines which sought the overthrow of the Constitution of the United States of America, whereas the Dr. Eoatt. Cominunist Party Dissolution Act provided that the Executive Government could, in effect, try the persons who were declared and finally make the declaration that such persons were aeting detrimentally to the defence of the Commonwealth. Mr Justice Dixon and other justices practically asked what that expression meant and pointed out that the Government might think that a man was acting prejudiciously to the defence of the Commonwealth when the matter was outside the defence power of the Commonwealth. Yet, that man would not be given any hearing and no charge would be made against him. It is certain that all the members of the Supreme Court of the United States of America, although they differed among themselves with respect to the question of constitutional guarantees, would havo rejected the Communist Party Dissolution Act as being entirely contrary to the United States of America Constitution. In fact, no Congress would attempt to pass such an act, and no British Parliament would consider such a measure. I emphasize that the act of Parliament which we are now asked to embody permanently in the Constitution by reference to the people is contrary to the general principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights signed in 1948. It is perfectly true that that declaration is not a binding covenant and that nonobservance of it does not constitute a breach of internationalobligations, but it did put before mankind new heights to be reached by the human family and it did insist that in these matters there should be proper legal processes in the various countries. Having failed once to achieve its purposes the Government is now bringing up the matter a secoud time. It wants, in effect,. to reject the Declaration of Human Rights and wants Australia to join the totalitarian States in respect of such matters. The Australian Labour party believes that the Australian people will prefer to retain those safeguards and that they would not possibly accept a measure of this kind. One could cite as authorities the greatest men in the history of Great Britain and, indeed, in that of all democratic nations",55,Government Supporters Hear
124,Motion (By Mr Holt),"by leave to show how legislation of this kind has always been regarded with abhorence. Hallam in his works deals with similar attempts to deal with minorities. But it is left to this Government to try to turn back the pages of history. It would be hard to find anything comparable to this legislation unless one went back 200, or 300, years in British history. The lesson of that period, apparently, has' not yet been learned by honourable gentlemen opposite. I should like to quote one other authority. I refer to the distinguished Governor of New York, Mr Dewey, who is ubout to visit Australia. The following opinions were attributed to Mr Dewey in the Melbourne Herald of the 3rd July last:Governor Dewey opposes outlawing the Communists on tlie grounds that the party is less dangerous in the open than underground, and that suppression of the party would endanger freedom of speech and other traditional rights . On the question of principle, Governor Dewey has gone on the record as favouring prosecution of men for crimes they commit, but never for ideas they have. That is what the Government faih to recognize. Let the proceedings be taken on overt acts and let factual evidence be put before the court. Tbe Melbourne Herald report continuesHe considers that it would be fatal if America or any other democratic country, in efforts to defeat the totalitarian system, adopted totalitarian methods. In this great democracy the people are being asked to adopt totalitarian methods in order to defeat the totalitarian doctrine of communism. For those reasons we shall urge the people of Australia to reject these proposals. We believe that they are retrograde. The Government, apparently, believes that it can establish a"" dictatorship over ideas. It is not content, as it should be, with dealing with specific criminal acts of sedition or conspiracy. To ban political groups or to disqualify their members from civil rights on mere government declaration without proof of overt acts, or of specific crimes, without a hearing or without a charge, would in all instances be tyrannical and unjust. Such action can never be justified under the conditions that exist in this country. To support an alteration of the Constitution as we are now asked. to do would be to become a party to tyranny and injustice. The Australian people should therefore be asked to reject the measure and to refuse to put a fascist and totalitarian blot on their Constitution. Labour and NationalService and Minister for Immigration) [9.12] -The House has just been listening to tlie most notable defender of communism in Australia. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) has spoken at considerable length and, at times, with some degree of fervour, in a role in which this country is becoming increasingly accustomed to see him in both the Parliament and the law courts. The right honourable gentleman has sought to-night to take his stand in this matter on the ground of high principles. He appealed to the record of history. If all public men with the responsibility of leadership in the Western democracies took the view that he took in the course of his speech, there would within a matter of a few years be no free history to record. He has sought to take his stand on high principles. If the record of history is carefully examined, as I hope that it will be, ancl if every episode in which the right honourable gentleman has been involved is carefully examined, it will be found that, so far f rom placing his stand on high principles, he has followed the course of the crudest political expediency. At one stage he was all for attacking the Communist Party Dissolution Act 1950. He then talked in the same terms of high principles. But when it became clear that his party faced the danger that it might have to go before our masters, the people, and be dealt ""with by them, he put high principles under the counter and followed the course of political expediency. What happened? The bill was passed the right honourable gentleman's support. honourable member for Barton and his party passed the bill, but then political expediency made it desirable that the Communists should not feel that they had lost all their friends. There are great political advantages for the Labour party",58,Government Supporters Hear

126,Mr Menzies,And it was passed with,59,Government Supporters Hear
127,Mr Holt,"That is so. The rightin the support it receives from the Communist party at general elections, and the right honourable gentleman, having had a personal reason to count votes carefully during the last few elections, must have been well aware of the significance of tbe Communist party to the Labour party. At one stage of the debate he read a passage.from the resolutions that were adopted by the Labour party in 1948. He claimed that it was impossible for a member of the Communist party to be a member of the Labour party. He knows perfectly well that that is clearly false, and any man who knows the constitution and make-up of the Labour party is aware that, not only is it possible for a Communist to be a member of the Labour party, but also that literally thousands of Communists are to-day full-fledged members of it . They are members of the Labour party because it is made up, not merely of individuals, but also of the affiliated unions, which pay a per capita fee for each of their members, irrespective of whether the member is a Communist or not. As we all know, many unions which are registered with the CommonAvealth Arbitration Court and affiliated with the Labour party contain literally thousands of Communists who have the right to record a vote in the pre-selection ballots that are contested by Opposition members. Opposition members House to order. The Minister is entitled to a fair and uninterrupted hearing, and I propose to see that he gets it . is very much in the .mind of the Leader of the Labour party is that the voting support of Communists at an election can make all the difference between success and defeat for Labour. .1 remind the House that, in the last general election, nine seats were won by fewer than 1,000 votes. of fact, 500 votes one way or the other would have made a difference in the result of each of those seats. Of those nine seats, eight were won by members of the Labour party and it is a fair and, I helieve, a factual statement that eight members of the. Labour party who now sit in this Parliament would not be here unless 500 Communist votes in their respective electorates had returned them. I .do not say that the honourable member for Perth( Mr Tom Burke), who is one of the eight, is not opposed to communism, and I can imagine how embarrassed he must have been by the speech of his leader this evening, but it is literally true that the honourable gentleman would not be here this evening had the preferences of the Communist candidate not ensured his return. Those matters are important to bear in mind, because it would be impossible for history or, indeed, for the public, to follow the tortuous movements of the Leader of the. Opposition unless it is realized that, at every stage, he has to watch where he is taking the Communist vote, which can mean so much to his party. The right honourable gentleman spoke of high principle, but that has enabled him bitterly to resist the Communist Party Dissolution Bill at one moment, to assist to pass it the next moment, and then to go from this Parliament, at a time when he was the Deputy Leader of the Labour party, into the courts and put up his skilful defence against that legislation. It may be argued that, in so acting, the right honourable gentleman is maintaining his own position and that he has said, "" whatever my party may do in this matter, I at least will stand by what I believe, and that is the right of interjecting, the Communists to express themselves and to carry on as a political party in this country"". But let us see where expediency takes the right honourable gentleman. He found the bitter wind of public disapproval blowing round his ankles at the recent general election, and one of the things which hold against him in his own electorate and throughout Australia was the very fact that he not only had championed the cause of the Communists in the Parliament, but also had gone into the courts to defend them. In point An almost farcical position was cooked up to save the right honourable gentleman at the recent election. We learned from no less a person than the Lord Mayor of Sydney, Alderman O'Dea, that the right honourable gentleman was to go to the aid of the Sydney City Council, and fight against the Communists who were threatening legal action because that",59,Government Supporters Hear
128,Mr Speaker,I must call the',60,Government Supporters Hear
129,Mr Holt,"The other point whichcouncil would not allow them to use the Town Hall for their meetings. Here was this champion of free speech! The Sydney City Council had decided in its wisdom, that it would not make available its hall to the Communists for their meetings. That decision did not suit the book of .the right honourable gentleman's brother, who happened to be the Chief Secretary in the Labour Government of 'New South Wales, and I understand, if he was correctly reported, that he tried to force the council to withdraw its ban. But the council decided to oppose any move by the brother of the right honourable gentleman to dictate to it who should and. who should, not use the Town Hall. So, we found, right in the middle of the election campaign, when public disapproval was making itself so keenly felt in the electorate of Barton, that a news item appeared in the Sydney Morning H.erald on the 17th April last, under the following heading:Evatt may appear against Communists. That was headline news. The article policy speech. Therefore, I remind the reads as follows:TheLord Mayor, Alderman E. C. O'Dea, said last night that Dr. H . V . Evatt had consented to represent the City Councili f the Communist Party took legal action in an effort to obtain the use of the. Town. Hall for political meetings. Alderman O'Dea said the City solicitor, Mr M. W. D. Mclntyre, was instructed yesterday to ask Dr. Evatt to represent the Council. Alderman O'Dea said: "" To-day, after grave and careful consideration, I refused an application by the general secretary of the Communist Party, Mr L% L; Sharkey, for the use of the Town Hall. "" 1 now believe tliat the Communists are going to take further action against the council. "" D r . Evatt will be asked to represent the council,, and he has intimated that he will accept the brief/' said Alderman O'Dea. That news item was pushed into the public press on the eve of the last general election, but the Communists could not rely, presumably, on more skilful counsel to put their case for them, and they let the matter drop. When the right honourable gentleman makes his claims of high principle, and, by implication, damns every member of this Parliament who supports the bill, damns his own colleagues including the honourable member for Gellibrand ( Mr Mullens) and others who have shown their support for the bill whenever they have had the opportunity at election time to do so, and damns tlie members, of the Victorian executive of the Labour party who came to Canberra a few days ago to urge the Labour party to support the proposed referendum, his own actions must be examined. Let us see where those actions have taken him. The most agile of snakes would have hesitated to follow the tortuous course which the right honourable gentleman has twisted through during the long episode of his relations with the Communist party. He made some extraordinary claims in the course of his speech. That utterance, by the way, was not easy to follow, because he jumped to and from so many positions from time to time. First, he attacked the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) on the ground that he had not carried out his. election mandate, To support his remarks, he read a passage from the right honourable gentleman's House that the present Prime Minister, in his policy speech in 1949, saidCommunism in Australia is an alien and destructive pest. If elected, we shall outlaw it. The Communist party wil l be declared subversive and unlawful, and dissolved. That statement was made in 1949, and the Prime Minister has been trying to give effect to it ever since. He was frustrated for months by members of the Labour party. Then, finally, they gave their reluctant assent to the legislation.. It was declared void by the High Court of Australia,, not, as the Prime Minister pointed out in his. second-reading speech, on political grounds, but on. purely legal grounds. We went to the people again, and, on this occasion, they had before them not only the broad mandate in the terms of the 1949 policy speech, but also the very bill that the Government had presented to the Parliament. They knew what was in our minds, they knew what we proposed to do and they overwhelmingly endorsed our policy. Does any member of the Opposition claim that we have not a mandate for this legislation % I am certain that the Leader of the Opposition is very definite in his own mind that we have such a mandate."" I remind him of what public opinion has done to him in his own electorate, because of the course that he has pursued in defence of the Communists throughout this controversy. In 1946, before he had so clearly diswealth powers. Is it not remarkable closed his hand on the Banking Bill, on the Labour party's socialization programme, and on his advocacy of communism or, at least, his support for Communists in this country, he had the most spectacular majority of his career in the electorate of Barton. He won that seat by 24,676 votes. By 1949, the electors of Barton and of Australia were beginning to see him in his true colours, and to discover precisely where he stood on this great issue. I make allowance for the fact that the numerical strengths of the electorates were reduced in the general election of 1949, and that a proportionate reduction must be made in his majority, but I find that that remarkthings that he said to-night that stuck in able majority of 1946 was reduced to a majority of 2,644. A few months ago, again with his own championing of the cause of the Communists, which was a very live issue in his own electorate, his majority was reduced to a mere 253. SoI do not think that there will be any doubt dum. The right honourable gentleman is in the right honourable gentleman's mind about what the people of Australia think on this issue, and what they think about his own course of conduct in the matter. ""What is the purpose of the Government in introducing this bill ? Is it tryshould, as a general rule, be given authority to ing to thrust something on an unwilling or reluctant people? Government is trying to do is to give the people a chance not merely to grant That is the first point which I ask the us a general mandate, but also to endorse House to note, because, quite clearly, tbe in the most precise terms the bill that was electors have given their approval to the before the Parliament last year, and the policy of this Government in relation to general power to deal with communism communism.

Yet that is their attitude, as shown by their stand on this bill. I claimed earlier that expediency in its crudest form was the real explanation of the actions of the Leader of the Opposition. I ask the House to bear with mo for a few moments while I recall some of the opinions that he has expressed on previous occasions. It was not so much the my mind as the things that he left unsaid. However, he has made forceful statements on earlier occasions. In 1944, ho indicated tbe kind of matter which he considered was a proper matter for submission to the people by way of a referenreported in Hansard, volume 177, at page 140, as having made the following statement:Subject to one condition, it should be axin matic that, in making a grant to the Commonwealth of legislative power, Parliament pass legislation on a topic so as to carry into eiFect any political policy on that topic to All that the which the electors have given their approval.

He went on to sayThe true issue is this-whether , in relation to the particular subject-matter, a national Commonwealth policy is preferable to six differing and almost certainly divergent policies operating in the several States. Is it not preferable to have a national policy on the issue of communism rather than six different, and possibly strongly Is that not precisely what this Governdivergent, policies? We have learned ment is trying to do by means of the legishow divergent the policies of the States lation which is now before the Parliawere because, as honourable members are ment? aware, the Prime Minister went to the State Premiers and asked, "" W ill you refer power to us to carry this bill into to-night that the Government did not need effect?"" How many Premiers were prethis kind of legislation because, under the pared to do so? Certainly some of the Crimes Act, it had a general power to Labour Premiers would not agree to the deal with the activities of the Communist request. The Leader of the Opposition in the cause he referred to two instances in speech from which I have been quoting, which, in order to deal with some phase proceeded to bring out a most imof Communist activity, the Labour Goportant point, which none of us should vernment of which he was the Attorneyoverlook. It is the real safeguard that General had found it necessary to enact the Australian people have against .arbispecial legislation. I shall not discuss trary or unreasonable action. The right the situation that arose when the coal honourable gentleman outlined in his strike of 1949 was in progress, because speech to-night a fantastic list of the events of that time are familiar to possibilities of what could be done honourable members. under a general power.

One can understand the rage of this minor legal luminary, the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Holt), at bis inability to answer the skilful arguments that were advanced by the Leader -of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) before the High Court, of Australia, because the .arguments that the Leader of the Opposition 'has advanced in this House to-night -are substantially the same as those which he advanced bef ore the High Court. The right honourable gentleman had been unable to convince a tory majority in this Parliament that hisTiews were (right, but he was able to convince six justices of the High 'Court of the validity of his arguments. Do Ministers and their supporters .suggest that those six judges are members of the Communist party or fellow travellers because they agreed with the arguments that were advanced by the right honourable gentleman? The truth is that the Leader of the Opposition, notwithstanding the charge of inconsistency that has been made against him, has never at any time changed his attitude to the sort of antidemocratic legislation that the Housei ^ now considering. When the right honourable gentleman said that the bill, if it became effective law, would pave the way for the establishment of the police State in Australia he was merely stating what thousands of people are now beginning to realize for the first time. Anybody would imagine that the Government honestly and sincerely wished to deal only with the Communist party as an organization and with its members. However, the Leader of the Opposition bas pointed out that there are already in existence certain statutes under which the Government could prefer charges against the Communists. He quoted sections of the Crimes Act. Is it not a fact that the present Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) actually invoked the provisions of that -act when he was the Attorney-General in another anti-Labour government in 1936, in order to have the Communist party -and die Friends of the Soviet -Union declared to be unlawful associations? For isome strange reason that course was not pursued. It would be interesting -to hear some member of the .present Government explain why that Government in 1936, after having .resolved to take action against the Communist party and the Friends 'Of the 'Soviet Union, 'decided to retrace its steps. The Leader -of the Opposition has pointed out with perfect truth that, if a government proceeds against anybody by the normal processes of .law, it must prove its case. It is not always easy, even in .courts of law, for a man to clear himself of false accusations that .are made against him. I remind the House that this is not the first attack that has been made upon the organized Labour movement. 'The Government and its supporters talk about division in the ranks of the Labour party on this issue. It is true that certain members of the Labour .movement foolishly believed at .one time that the intention of the Government was to deal only with the iCom-m.un'ist party. But they realize their mistaike now and the Labour party .to-day is a united body in oipposition to this anti-democratic -legislation and will prove that 'fact when it goes before the el'ectors : to advise them ito reject the Government's proposals. Is it not rather significant that the junior Minister who was put forward to answer the Leader of the Opposition devoted very little time to a discussion of the bill itself and the definitions. of the terms of "" Communist"" and communism ""'? The Government believes that any man who strikes, no matter for what reason, is a Communist. It believes that any one who advocates nationalization of the banking system is a Communist. I could mention numerous items of Labour party policy which honourable gentlemen opposite believe to be identical with Communist policy. During the recent general election campaign the Prime Minister and his deputy -repeatedly referred to the twin allies of communism and socialism, and also referred to the Labour party as a socialist party. The people of this country must be warned that we are rapidly approaching a stage at which fascism may be established. The real enemies of the",63,Government Supporters Hear
132,"Mr Ward (East Sydney) ,[.9.41]","democratic form of government in Australia to-day are the fascist forces which are beginning to show their hand. Honourable members opposite have on more than one occasion eulogized the Nazi form of government. ter spoke on many occasions of the advantages of a totalitarian form of government after he had paid visits overseas. The Minister for Labour and National Service has spoken about Communists as though if one went within 100 miles of them one would become contaminated. Yet he has been in their company continually, discussing problems, industrial and otherwise, with them. It is not difficult to observe the blatant hypocrisy of his statements. The Minister stated that the Labour party believed in full legislative powers for the Commonwealth Parliament. Of course it does. But there is a vast difference between the granting of full legislative powers to the Commonwealth Parliament and the granting of dictatorial powers to the Executive Government which could use them independently of the opinion of the Parliament. Everybody in Australia who has disagreed with the Government and who has refused to carry out its wishes could be branded as a Communist and could be brought within the scope of the powers that the Government is now seeking. The Labour party would not oppose the granting of full powers to the National Parliament. I have mentioned that attacks have been made in the past upon members of various organizations and that these persons have had great difficulty in clearing themselves of false charges. Such instances arose in relation to the War Precautions Act when action was taken against the Industrial Workers of the World. Those men had their case tried publicly. Evidence was placed on record and they had the opportunity of testing it. Yet, four and a half years after they had been convicted Mr Justice reviewed their cases and decided that six of the men should never have been convicted and that the penalties that had been imposed on the others were excessive. He also declared that four of the crown witnesses were liars and perjurers. If the Government is able to make this legislation effective by securing the approval of the people of Australia in order to Mr Ward. circumvent the decision of six justices of the High Courti t will be able to procure liars and perjurers to make charges against citizens with whose statements and activities it has disapproved. The The Prime Minisindividuals who may so act will not have to give evidence publicly and have it tested. The Government by laying charges which it can not substantiate will be able to damn for all time the reputation of a man with whose opinion they disagree. This legislation is similar in pattern to that which was adopted by the German Nazi regime of which the Prime Minister has spoken in such eulogistic terms on a number of occasions. During the past few days I have heard of one of my colleagues being castigated by an honourable member who supports the Government because a speech he made was allegedly rebroadcast by Mosco w Radio. At least my colleague did not earn the distinction that during the last war his statements were quoted in broadcasts from the Japanese-controlled radio stations as.,wer,e the remarks of the Prime Minister. When Hitler came to power in 1933, he seized the trade union buildings and arrested all trade union leaders regardless of whether they were members of the Social Democratic party or the Communist party. Within a month he dissolved the Socialist Democratic party and forbade the formation of any new political organization. The only remaining political party was the Nazi party. Does the Government not desire to bring about a similar state of affairs in this country? This legislation is aimed at the trade union movement. As the late esteemed Leader of the Opposition said, the Government wants tame cat"" unions which will carry out its bidding. The only time that the Minister for Labour and National Service has spoken in eulogistic terms of the trade union Ewing movement has been when a section of it has agreed with what the Government has done. Every organization that opposes this discipline is alleged to be Communist controlled. The purpose of the Government is to destroy the trade union movement as a preliminary to the complete destruction of democratic government in this country. As the Leader of the Opposition has said, the economic crisis in this country is deepening. In the months that this Government has had control of the nation's affairs it has not done anthing to deal with the economic problems of the people. The Government knows that there are thousands of people in this country who are literally starving. Is ii not a fact that many clergymen and other members of religious bodies have repeatedly directed the . attention of the Government to the fact that people are starving ? The position is growing worse. The Government knows it and knows that the only effective weapon that the organized Labour movement has for the purpose of defending the workers is an effective trade union movement and an effective political Labour party. The Government has attempted to divide the Labour movement by saying that it is not going to attack the Labour party. It has announced that it does not intend to attack the unions that are controlled by men who are not members of the Communist party and that it is only concerned with what it calls "" Communist dominated "" organizations. The Government knows that by dividing the Labour movement it can weaken and destroy it. That is what this bill 'has been designed to do. The Government has claimed that it has a mandate to introduce this measure but can any honourable member honestly say that the majority of the Australian people are aware of the provisions of tbe bill? In the hurly-burly of the election campaign the newspapers were united against the Labour party and it was given very little opportunity of broadcasting its case over the radio stations. It had to depend largely on outdoor meetings to make its policy known. Under those conditions and with only a short campaign, it is most likely that the great majority of the people voted for the Government without knowing exactly what its proposals wei'e. But the longer the people have to examine this legislation the more certain will be its rejection. This bill has some relationship to other legislation that has been introduced and passed in this Parliament as part of an attack on the trade union movement. The power that the Government now seeks is very little short of that which Hitler obtained in Germany and used from 1933 onwards. The only protection that the people of Australia have is that the Constitution provides that Parliament must be called together at least once in every year. But the Government wishes to keep the Parliament closed for as long as it is practicable to do so. I read a statement in the pre3s which was attributed to the Prime Minister to the effect that the Government was seeking certain powers because it wanted to use them for regulation-making when it might be inconvenient to call the Parliament together. ""What a statement to make! If it were merely left to the convenience of honourable members to decide whether Parliament should meet I should say that ii would be rather inconvenient for them to meet here in the depths of winter. The Government would like to keep the Parliament closed and govern completely by regulation. It would like âto have these powers in order to cripple the Labour movement, which is the only effective instrument to prevent this Government from imposing its will on the people. The Communist party is numerically weak in Australia. It has approximately 15,000 members. Yet the Minister has 'said that Labour members of Parliament depend on Communist votes for their election. If honourable members divide 15,000 votes by 122 electorates they will find that the result is 125 votes to each electorate, which shows that the Minister has exaggerated the importance and voting strength of the Communist party. Government members have made this type of statement deliberately with the idea of creating in the minds of the public the impression that communism is a great menace. Judging by the international situation, which has improved because of the prospects of peace in Korea, there is less need for legislation of this type than ever before. The bill has been introduced, allegedly, because of the gravity of the international situation. To what do honourable members opposite allude when they refer to the gravity of the international situation? If this Government is to have its way, the living standards of the people will be forced down. The Government has stated that it must prepare for war or, as it has termed it, for defence. What is to be the economic position of Australia ? Although we are at peace at the moment, all our economic resources are to be concentrated on preparations for war. I presume that if war actually occurred the position would be much more acute and the privations that would be imposed upon the people would be much greater. Evidently, the people are to be asked to live in perpetuity under the intolerable conditions that exist at present. The Government has not always adopted direct methods of dealing with what it regards as recalcitrant trade unions. The late Mr Justice Halse Rogers was appointed on one occasion to examine a charge of tbe misuse of government funds in regard to an attempt to bribe trade union official, some of whom were supposed to be members of the Communist party or fellow travellers. I am not suggesting that any trade union official did actually accept a bribe, but I do know that the bribes were offered by a government because evidence to that effect was given during the course of the investigation. This Government has always attempted to destroy the effectiveness of trade unionism and it is now regarded by them as a necessary preliminary to the introduction of a police state. Honourable members cannot believe the Prime Minister. When the National Security Bill 1939 was introduced it gave powers to the government of the day which I should not entrust to any government. Ten members of the Labour party voted against that bill. I was one of them and the nine others included some of the present members of the Opposition. We voted against that bill because we regarded it as giving the Government an almost complete power over the rights and liberties of the people. It gave the Government the right to arrest workers without warrant and keep them imprisoned for ten days without being asked to prefer charges against them If , at the end of the ten days, the arrested persons were given their liberty and felt aggrieved, they could take no action against the Government. When the bill was introduced into this Parliament,, the right honourable gentleman saidT do not seek, however long theconflict may even that definition is not wide'enough, last, a muzzled Opposition. Our institutions. Parliament, all legal thought, free speech, free i i r . Ward. ' criticism, must go on-. It would be a tragedy if we found we had fought for. freedom ami free belief and the value of every individual soul, and won the war but lost the things we' were fighting for. The right honourable gentleman is a great word-spinner and it is quite true that he has made many similar statements. But his actions have been the reverse of the statements that he has made for the purpose ' of attracting public support. The people know to-day exactly what he is capable of doing. The Vice-President of the Executive Council( Mr Eric J. Harrison) has spoken about the consideration that the Government has for the trade union movement. Was it not the right honourable gentleman who heads this Government who, not so many years ago, used the coercive provisions of the Transport Workers Act to bring into existence on the waterfront in certain Australian ports a licence system which provided that men should have licences of certain types and that certain preferences should apply in relation to employment ? Did not the government of which he was then Attorney-General, by using that means of victimization, hope to bring the workers to their knees when they were fighting, not for any economic advantage, 'but on a matter of great principle % They were using their industrial strength to prevent an anti-Labour government from sending potential military materiel to the Japanese who were fighting the Chinese Government. Those are the kind of methods that are possible under the extended powers that the bill seeks to confer. In the Communist Party Dissolution Act the definition of the word "" Communist "" was as follows:"" Communist"" means a person who supports or advocates the objectives, policies, teachings, principlesor practices of communism, as expounded, by Marx or Lenin. There is not one member of this House who has not, at some time or other, advocated something that is contained in the teachings or writings of both Marx and Lenin. That definition of ""Communist "" is sowide that under it practically anybody could be brought within the provisions of the legislation. But evidently the Government believes that so it desires that the Parliament shall be given general powers to make laws in respect of Communists and communism in addition to tbe power to make a law in tbe terms of tbe Communist Party Dis^ solution Act. Tbe Government does not say that a Communist for its purposes is a member of tbe Communist party, and that the Government must prove that membership. The bill as it stands means that the Government will have power to declarethat the persons against whom the legislation is aimed are Communists and the onus of proving otherwise will rest upon the declared person. I consider that the people will never extend toany government, let alone an anti-Labour Government, such terrific power. It is generally recognized that, although there have been imperfections in our judicial system, it is the best judicial system that has been devised up to now. Anybody who is charged with a crime should be properly charged and should have an opportunity to prove his innocence before a properly constituted judicial body. Por instance, just imagine any militant member of the Labour party or the trade union movement being at the mercy of this Government. Why, with the limitations imposed upon free speech I find it difficult enough now, as an elected member of this Parliament, to state a case as I should like to state it on the floor of the Parliament, and I can imagine how much more, difficult expression of opinion would be in this country if this Government were given dictatorial powers. However, I have great confidence in the judgment of the people, although they have at times made electoral judgments that were, in my opinion, unwise and mistaken. They made one such mistake on the occasion of the last general election. I admit that a great number of workers and people who usually vote for the Labour party must have supported Government candidates at the last general election or the Government would not have been returned, but the people who did so were misled. They fell for the misrepresentations of the anti-Labour Government. exactly what the position is I am quite certain that they will realize their error and renew their allegiance to the Labour party. I shall deal now with another method by which the Government will be able to destroy the effectiveness of trade unionism should its present proposals become law. Trade unions will not have the right to elect their own officers. When I say that, I am not referring only to the removal of a. Communist official who holds office in a trade union, although in the opinion of a number of members of the Labour movement that is all that is involved under the proposed legislation. Under this legislation trade unions couldelect only individuals who were approved by the anti-Labour Government. I shall tell the House how that could happen. The Government will have the power to declare a person a Communist. It will not have to prove its assertion, but will merely have to publish his name, in the Gazette. Soi f a Labour party follower -man y of whom we have heard charged in. this Parliament with being Communists, a charge which they have deniedsubmitted his name for election to a trade union office, all the Government would have to do would, be to have him declared a Communist and he would not be eligible for election. So under this law the Government will have the right to select the officers of every trade union in the country. What sort of trade union movement should we have then? There is one thing that the Labour party must: recognize. It must fight now to preserve its existence because it may not have an opportunity to do so later. Every member of it must get out and explain to the people exactly what is intended by this Government, and prove to them that this bill is an attack upon the whole Labour movement. Under the great powers that the Government is seeking, and with the destruction of the trade union movement, the way will be clear for the introduction of a totalitarian form of government. I hope that the Labour party will realize that and will now close its ranks. If there has been any division in the trade union movement or the political Labour When they understand party, now is the time for every one of us to be big enough to say that this issue transcends all matters that have divided Labour in the past, and that the immediate purpose of Labour must be to defeat this Government proposal. The only way in which Labour can succeed in doing so is by having a united Labour movement, so that honourable gentlemen opposite who on many occasions have used very specious methods to try to divide Labour will fail dismally on this occasion. It may be argued that the proposal in the bill is the democratic way of determining this matter, because it will let the people decide it. I have heard many honourable members on the Government side say, ""Let the people decide. This is merely a bill for a referendum of the people"". I believe this to be an undemocratic measure and for that reason the time of the people ought not to be wasted in considering it. honourable gentleman has said. I believe further that the people will not be accorded the opportunity to decide this matter on its merits, because we shall have the anti-Labour blasts on the broadcasting-systems of the country; and we shall have the newspapers misrepresenting and distorting the statements of the Labour party and refusing to publish arguments advanced by Labour leaders. I well remember during the last general election campaign the cunning method by which the newspapers distorted Labour's statements. any innocuous section of a speech or statement but refused to publish the telling points made by the Labour speakers. They gave full publicity to the statements of the members of the Government, and by publishing portions of the speeches of Labour speakers out of their context gave them a different form from that which was intended. That form of misrepresentation is indulged in by the anti-Labour press as a means of supporting their friends in the Government. Some of the Government's backbenchers seem rather despondent, because, despite all the talk of democracy, they are not to have the opportunity to express their views in Caucus on these proposals, as, I understand, the meetings of the Government parties for this week have been cancelled. Honourable members opposite talk about divisions in the ranks of Labour. There is no division in Labour to-day, but a division is beginning to become evident among those semi-fascists who sit behind the Government and are beginning to be worried because of the swing of public opinion against it. I suggest to them that if they are not prepared to vote with us to defeat this measure, they can at least absent themselves from the chamber during divisions on it. It would be a very good idea if the Government, which is always talking about the need for secret ballots in connection with trade union matters, were to submit this legislation to a secret ballot in this House. There was one defection from the Government side in relation to your own election, Mr Speaker able gentleman must keep to the bill. unity on the side of the Government forces and it would be interesting to see what a secret ballot in relation to this anti-Labour legislation would produce. It is interesting to note that the Labour party is so keen in its opposition to this measure that the first two speakers whom it has put up to oppose it are recognized in this House as the greatest defenders of They published communism whenever it is mentioned here. Let me say that I regard the familiar and numerous fulminations of the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward), and the fact that he is in opposition to the measure, as offering the -greatest guarantee that it will be carried. But the people to-night have had the painful experience of listening to the leader of a prominent political party trying to justify a course of action which, if successful, must prove inimical to the best interests of his country. SoI say that the people must ' be alerted to a greater degree than ever before to avoid falling into a cunningly prepared trap.

What the Labour party means is that under the common law or the Crimes Act we have the power to punish after the event has taken place, which means that after a man has committed a crime we can punish him if we can catch him. The Labour party apparently has no thought about preventing commission of the crime, which is surely a most important matter when the national security is involved."" If wv should neglect our duties in that respect, and some major effort of sabotage wendirected against our defence preparations, then the government responsible would be guilty of criminal negligence. The right honourable gentleman also characterized this measure as one of the most dangerous ever presented to the parliament British country. He probably meant by that statement that this power would constitute a threat to some other institution. As a matter of fact, he mentioned trackunionism and some other body. Let us analyse this danger. Prior to the introduction of this bill the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) vainly asked all the State Premiers to refer to the Commonwealth the power sought under his bill. The six States of the Commonwealth have had this power for as long as they have been in existence. Has any danger ever been seen in their possession and management of it? The Opposition's arguments in relation to this matter are nothing but sheer claptrap designed to divert the peoplp from allowing the Government to pursue the course that it wishes to follow. Mr Speaker, to the state of the House. able members on the Government side and sixteen on the Opposition side. That constitutes a quorum. If any honourable member again directs attention to the state of the House when there is a quorum present, he will be suspended. Honourable members are not to have their speeches interrupted in that way. Mr Speaker, for my own information, whether, when your attention is directed to the state of the House, consideration should not be given to what happened just now; that is, that several honourable members entered the House after the honourable member had calledfor a quorum. ment of the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) is not correct. I saw no honourable member enter the House after the honourable member for Watson( Mr Curtin) had spoken. This is merely a further interruption of the speech of the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Bowden). have kept an open mind in regard to the motives which inspired the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt), and have been fair enough to dissociate their thinking from the purely political aspects of his of a activities, will now be forced to re-orientate their ideas and consider his motives in strict relation to his immediate past history. The right honourable member is not only the servant of his party as h i may claim to be, he is also the leader of it. Our experience during the last eight years has shown us that the Leader of the Opposition has more influence than that of one man in determining the attitude of the Opposition towards any legislation submitted to this Parliament. Therefore, this matter must be approached objectively, and we must not look upon it merely as a measure to control communism for the mere sake of control. We must consider all the factors which have forced the Government to the conclusion that the Communist party as at present constituted is a menace not only to the security but also to the general well being of this country. Although Australia is not worse off than are other comparable countries of the world, no thinking person will deny that in spite of our apparent prosperity we are rapidly approaching an economic crisis, and shall reach that unfortunate stage soon unless something is done to prevent it. No one will deny that to date, because of circumstances not immediately controllable, wo have been aggravating the position by surrendering to expediency. There are certain basic causes of our trouble, tbe adjustment of which requires a series of processes of which this measure is one. The control of communism is one",70,Government Supporters Hear

Its purpose is to strike the red shackles off all the industries which are considered essential to our national defence and development. This measure will ensure greater production of .the goods that .are vital to national development and will ensure -greater production in some other fields. There are many other causes which are beyond our control, but are within the confines of our country. If all Australians play their part we can keep inflation within bounds. We have reached an absurd positioni n 'this country in that we are threatened with a shortage of basic foodstuffs. Such a thing in Australia has never before been heard of. That has been caused not because the farmers have any desire other than to follow the industry they have chosen to follow .and are best adapted to follow, but because certain goods which are vitally necessary to the production of primary products are practically unprocurable. In disgust and .despair many farmers have been forced to divert their energies '.into other channels of production. That is why we are short .of butter. If we continue to allow the Communists to control the industrial policy of this country, we .shall become short of more than butter. As this measure applies not only to defence and national security, but also to economics, it might not be irrelevant to Tefer briefly to some of the expedients that the Labour party has proposed to deal with inflation. They have been put forward merely as a red herring to draw public attention away from the menace of communism. prominent among these proposals is federal prices control. The Labour party advocates that to-day, it advocated it throughout the life of the Nineteenth Parliament, and it advocated it in its recent general election policy. honourable members opposite have had a second thought about this matter anf 1 when they believed that they might have the responsibility of carrying -it out they immediately ran for cover. At Cairns the then Leader of the Opposition said, towards the end of the lastgeneral election .campaign, that federal Mr Bowden. prices control would not of itself 'cure the inflationary spiral in Australia. He said that that was one ingredient, and that there were many others which would not be quite so popular. Thus again he was dealing-only with effects and was ignoriii""causes. The honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) followed his leader's speech with a statement which appeared in the press. 'This statement shows how sincere the Labour party is in .continually mouthing the old second-hand phrase, "" When are you going to put value back into'the Â£1? -"". 'The honourable member for Melbourne is reported to have saidThe Labour party cannot put value hack into the Â£1. We would not be .so foolish as to try. no power to do so.

Those are the clear issues in .this matter. Camourflage its attitude as it may, by meaningless motheaten platitudes, the Labour party has come down strongly on the side of Russia. But, In this measure the Labour party has declared for the "" reds "".

144,Mr Bowden,"There is an oft-resocialist attack on society, it is a case of "" hands off the reds "". I say that if the Communisits ean succeed in destroying this fine country iby hampering production or increasing the inflationary pressure, the socialists hope, by means of their superior numerical strength, to take over from them and out of the ensuing chaos to establish .their particular form of economic salvation. If they fail and we are doomed to become a second Czechoslovakia, this socialist party group and the -Communists will at least not be -among the victims of the purge of honest men and women which will inevitably follow a take over by the "" reds "". It would be completely fantastic to say that this decision of the official Labour party represents the majority view of the many hundreds of thousands of people who subscribe to Labour policies. It would be fantastic to say that a majority of the Labour members of this House are opposing in their hearts this referendum measure. If the members of the Labour party in this House were given a free vote the result would perhaps be astonishing. The latest Gallup poll indicated that 80 per -cent, of the people .of Australia are in favour of this measure, .and that in no State was there less than. 75 per cent, in favour of it. Eight out of nine Liberal and Australian Country party supporters and two out of every three Labour supporters were in favour of it. That means that 66 per cent, of Labour people are in favour of banning the Communist party. .At two recent general elections, one held in 1949 and one in 1951, there was an overwhelming decision by the electors in favour -of this -measure. It will be conceded that the conditions which exist in any country at any time are the result of -the action, or inaction, of its people. No thinking person can f a i l to agree that conditions to-day not only in Australia, but also in many other parts of the world, are not dissimilar to the conditions which preceded the fall of many countries and empires in the past. In our case, in a monetary sense, there appeared to. be no further worlds to conquer, and we proceeded to live on the fats and riches amassed for us by a series of events, but we gave.no thought to the need for maintaining our wealth in a stable condition. The enemy within our gates, the Australian Communist party inspired by Red Russia, quick to seize the opportunity, attempted to exploit our folly to our disadvantage. History records many examples of nations having been destroyed because those in power failed to interpret the signs of the times, but this Government will not be guilty of an error of that kind. None but the most foolish optimists would say that all is well in this country to-day, and none but those of evil intent would frustrate the Government in its attempts to put matters right. The people are well aware that, unless w* put an end to the fools' paradise that this cQuntry is enjoying as a result of a series of events, we shall jeopardize thrwhole future of Australia. It would b<easy to take the necessary steps to protect, the country if the Labour party assisteo' the Government to do so, but, if that assistance is to be denied to us, let us, in spite of the Labour party, take ithe harder road and give the country the protection that it needs from its enemies who .arc operating openly and brazenly before our very eyes. going to reduce the cost of living? That is what the people want to know. years that I have been a member of this Parliament, the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) has attributed all kinds of sinister motives to the Government in humorous and familiar phrases. I describe them as humorous and familiar because they mean nothing at all. The honourable gentleman and his leader are noted protectors of -communism in this Parliament. I urge the people to watch carefully the side that he and his leader take upon any matter that deals with the defence of our present system of society against sabotage by "" red "" agents. The side opposite ""to that which they take will be the right side for the people to take. I commend this bill to the people.

146,Mr Bowden,"During the eight110.34] -During tbe comparatively short rime that I have been a member of this Parliament and of a State parliament, I have always endeavoured not to indulge in personalities, but to devote my attention to the issue before me. The major portion of the contribution that has been made to the debate on this measure by honourable gentlemen opposite has been devoted to veiled attacks upon the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt). I point out that, as recently as two or three weeks ago, the right honourable gentleman was elected unanimously by members of the Opposition to that very exalted office. The Labour party still represents most of the working people in this community. It may be that from time to time, owing ^distortion or for other reasons, less than a majority of the electors favour our policy, but that does not mean that our policy is wrong. In many instances it has been because the forces of propaganda arrayed against us have been especially strong. It seems that, before I proceed to disrespect of which no parliament has a cuss the bill, I should explain that I am not a Communist, that I never have been, and that I never will be. The philosophy of the Communist party is alien to my religious views and philosophical beliefs. I hope that honourable members on this side of the House will be given credit for some sincerity in this matter. I shall deal with what I hope is still a live issue in the Australian community -the right of the individual to express any opinion that he honestly holds. In this community there are individuals who call themselves Communists and who have banded themselves together in an organization called the Communist party for the promotion of what they believe to be the correct political philosophy. I take a stand that has been taken before in history. I shall defend the right of those people to express their points of view. The danger inherent in this measure is, as the Leader of the Opposition said, that it will invert the normal processes of British justice and stigmatize people, not because they have committed an overt act of criminality but because they hold certain political beliefs. It is an attack upon the beliefs of certain people. An Act of Parliament little to justify its contention that this cannot destroy the beliefs of individuals,, if those beliefs are honestly held. Communism is a political ideology, but it is not one that can flourish or gain converts unless conditions exist that are favorable for that purpose. Those who are converted to communism are generally those who are dissatisfied with the existing economic system. The honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Bowden) said that we are now facing a period of economic crisis. I believe that that crisis has been caused by the failure of this Government to concentrate upon the task of finding asolution of our economic problems. It has devoted itself to interfering with or banning a group of persons and has failed to take steps to prevent the existence of the conditions in which those groups of persons thrive. It has been said that in this matter the Labour party is acting inconsistently because it has always advocated an extension of the powers of the Commonwealth Parliament. There are certain matters in right to legislate. The individual possesses some rights that no government should attempt to take from him. An American writer, in a book entitled The New Federalism, recently made the point that there is a federation of the State and individual citizens or groups of citizens, and that those individual citizens or groups of citizens have certain rights that no government should take from them. That is why I say that the Labour party is not acting inconsistently in relation to this measure. The Government is attempting to take from individuals their right to express certain points of view, and it is not within the province' of any government to do that. I believe that the powers of the Commonwealth Parliament should be extended because we cannot grapple effectively with the economic problems with which we are now faced when there is a division of the essential powers between the Commonwealth Parliament and the State parliaments. It is only by, as it were, bringing the two parties together that we can legislate, in the interests of both the States and the Commonwealth, to solve our economic problems. So far, the Government has done very",73,Government Supporters Hear
147,Mr Crean (Melbourne Ports),"bill is necessary. Honourable gentlemen opposite have attacked the bona fides of members of the Opposition, but they have .not attempted to explain in what way the Communists are disrupting the economy -of this country to the degree that they suggest. Clause2 of the measure contains no definition of "" Communist"" or "" communism "". In this chamber last week, a person in Tasmania was referred to by a Minister as being a member of the Communist party. A f t e r inquiries had been made, it was found that that person was a. member not of the Communist party but of the Labour party. The Minister then said that he was glad to hear that that was so, but he went on to say that if the man was not a Communist he had behaved like one. That is the kind of interpretation that some honourable gentlemen opposite are inclined to put upon the word "" Communist"". The bill is designed primarily to attack, not the very small section of the community who are Communists, but the trade union movement and the Labour party. That is why the Opposition, objects to it . We believe it to be our duty, as the elected representatives of a large section of the people, to defend the essential liberties of tbe people-libertie s that were not won easily. _ The Government has said that it has introduced this bill to attack a group of persons in the community who do not subscribe to our democratic way of life and who say in tlieir writings, that they will overthrow the State. The fact that a person quotes fro m the writings of Marx, Lenin, and other Communist writers does not prove that he subscribes to the points of view tliat thoy express. Anybody who wants to understand political philosophy in this age must have at least a nodding acqtiaintance with those writers. The essence of communism is that the Communist coup or the shift of power cannot occur until there exists in the community something that the Communists call a revolutionary situation. A situation of that kind can occur only when there is a condition of such acute economic crisis in a community that the people say that normal methods of dealing with such a situation, by parliaments and other established It is in a situation of that kind that the viewpoint of the Communist flourishes. During the two years that the Government has now been in office, it has done more to create, a situation in which communism can come to a head than was ever done during any comparable period in Australia's history. The Government has introduced the Defence Preparations B ill , by means of which it seeks to exercise the Commonwealth's defence power to deal with problems which it should have grappled with in the name of ordinary civil needs. It should have planned properly the whole economic life of the community in order to give a fair deal to all sections of the community. Only last week it was pointed out in this House that of the national income, tlie share of the workers, who represent seven out of every eight people in the country, is being gradually whittled down. In other words, the worker's grounds for economic discontent "" are increasing. That is the sort of thing that wins converts to these new ideologies. The Government may ban the Communist party under this measure; but unless, at the same time, it takes legislative, action to remedy the conditions under which communism flourishes, it w ill be merely making a mockery of government. In a community that believes in democracy and has no need to fear subversive elements in its midst, it is time the Parliament approached this matter with sanity and a greater degree of tolerance. The Government parties have made a bogy of communism and have attempted at every opportunity to make it an issue on which to fight the Australian Labour party. The Ministerf or Labour and National Service( MrH o l t ) . said that some members of the Opposition had been elected because persons who voted for Communist party candidates gave their second preferences to them. Those electors were entitled to exercise their constitutional right to vote for candidates whom they favoured and had to distribute their preferences in order to validate their vote. It is a distortion of the truth to say that any honourable member's election was due to the fact that institutions, have failed. electors who voted for the Communist party candidate gave them their second preferences. Yet that is the sort of statealso heard two similar speechesfrom the ment that was made hy the Minister for Labour and National Service who prides himself on being a democrat. It is a distortion of the truth of which any Minister should be ashamed. The honorable member for Perth( Mr Tom Burke),, like all other honourable members, was returned at the recent general election because more than 50 per cent, of the electors in his constituency favoured his return. . Any one who. makes absurd comparisons of the kind that the Minister made is simply making a mockery of the parliamentary institution. I do not propose to say much more its time in introducing new legislation about the bill because I oppose it on if adequate laws already existed to enable the ground that it threatens political it to achieve its objective.' liberty. People have a right to hold whatever views they wish to hold just as others have the right Ports said that the Communist element to disagree with them in order to proin the community was of no account and mulgate their point of view. I conclude that it was innocuous. Either he or one by reminding honourable members of the of his colleagues said that there are only tolerant attitude that was displayed approximately 15,000 Communists in nearly 2,000 years ago by a man who was Australia. If that be correct, how do a Jew. To-day, the Communist is being honourable members opposite account for -attacked; to-morrow, it maybe the Jews, the fact that Communist party candidates Freemasons, Presbyterians or Catholics. polled 100,000 votes at the last general I am reminded of the view that was exelection ? That fact tells a story different pressed by the Pharisee, Gamaliel, who from that which they would like the was president of the Sanhedrin in the people to believe Instead of dealing days of the apostle Paul. Referring to realistically with the measure, honourable Paul, he said, in effect, "" If what this man members opposite have deliberately dishas to say be of God, there is torted its provisions. The amendment nothing we can do about it ; if it be that the Government will seek to have of man, it will perish "". No honourable written into the Constitution is clearly member believes that, communism is of stated in the bill. It readsGod. We believe that it is of man. I leave it to the. sanity of. the Parliament section fiftv-one the following section:to consider the issue in the belief that the Australian people still cherish liberty and good sufficiently to reject this pernicious, with res,pect to Communists or communism aa undemocratic measure. honourable member for Melbourne Ports ance ( Mr Crean) gave rather a tiresome discourse about what he termed individual What do honourable members opposite say liberty.

148,Mr Kekwick (Bass) [10.50],"The Commonwealth or for the execution or mainten-sets out to deal with them because as an organization they deliberately seek to overthrow law and order in democratic countries. Their activities are based on -disruption and sabotage. We know that Communists who hold key positions in industry are deliberately attempting to sabotage our economy. Although the subject has been discussed on many previous occasions in this House, it is worth recalling what has happened in the coal industry. Due to Communist activities, approximately 1,100,000 tons of coal was lost during the six months ended the 30th June last. This is approximately 400,000 tons more than was lost during the corresponding period of last year. Yet honourable members opposite say that the community need not worry about the Communist element because it represents only a small and ineffective minority. The figures that I have cited give the lie to that statement. We have seen the effects of Communist activities in the shipping industry, in which they have caused an enormous increase of costs which must be borne by the whole community.. Communists have been able to do that damage because misguided persons, including, unfortunately, some genuine workers, have been misled by Communist saboteurs to go slow and hold up industry and thus add enormously to the cost of living to the detriment of the community as a whole. So long as production in the coal industry is below reasonable levels, we shall be faced with acute shortages of materials required by industry generally, including building materials. All of this is a part of a deliberate Communist plot to sabotage Australian industry, and that kind of sabotage does more to prejudice our defence potential and economic position than could be caused by direct military aggression. Those facts are evidence of the methods that are employed by communism to expand its influence throughout the world. We have known of the results of communism in various countries in Europe and Asia and, coming closer to Australia, Indonesia, which is right at our doorstep. Some honourable members opposite have been largely Gommunist-inspired. The said that the Government does not know deliberate sabotage of industry, the goanything about the Communist objective. slow policy, and the forcing up of prices Official Communist booklets set out the main points of communism's economic and political programme. Those points include the following:The community will be the sole owner of all the means of production, distribution and exchange. Those words have a familiar ring. In deed, they are practically identical with a plank of the Australian Labour party's platform. For that reason, we can well understand the fellow feeling that exists 'between the Communists and the Australian Labour party. The Communist economic and political programme also provides:The"" middle class"" family, based on the institution of private property, will disappear with the abolition of private property. This programme will be implemented by the Dictatorship of the Proletariat, established by revolution. Is there any wonder that the Government is seeking power to deal effectively with a party that expounds such objectives? The Government would be shirking its responsibilities if it did not take decisive action against such a disruptive element in the comunity. Some honourable members have implied that the Government is concentrating on trade unions. It is doing so for the obvious reason that the Communists themselves have been clever enough to concentrate their attention upon key trade unions because they know full well that they can best sabotage the nation's production by operating in that sphere. It is obvious that every Communist who holds a position in a key union is in an ideal position to act as an. agent for the red revolution. Let honourable members not be under any misapprehension about the expressed plan of the Communists to take the world by revolution. Anybody who imagines that this country will be excepted from that programme is living in a fool's paradise. The doctrine that was propounded by Lenin, namely, that revolution was impossible without a nation-wide crisis, was subsequently endorsed and propagated by Stalin. The nation-wide inflation which is now being experienced in Australia has are a part of the Communist plan to economy to the point at which Soviet disrupt this country.

We must be ready to employ trickery, deceit, lawbreaking, withholding and concealing truth. Then there is this statement by StalinCommunism is founded upon violence, which recognises no law and is restricted by no duty. Hundreds of similar quotations are to be found in Communist literature. I am amazed that Opposition members can see their way clear to ally themselves with such principles. It is apparent to every one who thinks deeply about such matters that Russia's threat is to the whole world. Russia has shown clearly that it means to dominate the world, and Australia cannot escape the onrush of communism unless it wakes up now to the dangers that confront it. The United States Secretary of State, Mr Acheson, made the following statement on the 9th February last. The real tension in the world to-day conies from the great mass of Soviet and satellite armaments and the fact that the Soviet did not demobilize its forces at the end of the war. which was not sufficiently awake to the Mr Acheson was commenting on a Soviet note in the series of exchanges between the Soviet Union and the three Western powers regarding the possibility of a meeting of the Big Four to discuss the differences that existed between the East and the West. The Russian plan is clear, and those Australians who fail to see the danger of the "" red"" peril are shirking their responsibilities. They are not true Australians in the real meaning of the word. Russia is seeking new resources with which to strengthen its power, and, in so doing, is enslaving other countries and is using their workers to bring its Mr Kekviick. 1 that was issued on the 25th August, 1950,.

The mining of uranium in East Germany isentirely controlled by a gigantic Russian organization employing 300,000 pit workers and an administrative staff of 15,000. When that kind of evidence is available,, there can be little doubt of Russia's intentions. Obviously Russia is the sole aggressor, and the only threat to peace.

That figure is alarming. able member obtain that information ? member for Wills( Mr Bryson) may check the figure in social literature that, is to be found in the Library. I regret to say that the sorry state of affairs represented by the numerical strength of the Communists has been contributed toby the policy of appeasement that has been adopted by the Government of Great Britain, and, for a period, by the Government of the United States of America, menace that threatens the free world. The geographical and political significance of certain nations that are likely to be receptive to Communist influence is of great importance to Australia. India and Red China would naturally be receptive to a policy of hatred of the white races, and such a pernicious policy has been deliberately fostered by the men of the Kremlin. They would stop at nothing in order to gain their own ends.

The Communists have tried force, economic pressure and documentary propaganda films for that purpose. Such a policy becomes an immense and immediate threat to Australia, because the acti vities of the Communists in Indo-China, Malaya and other countries to the north of us cannot be overlooked. The Communist plan provides for the incorporation of Australia in the Greater Asia co-prosperity sphere. Australia is to be the prize for the Asiatics. Perhaps Opposition members are not aware of that, hut if they will seek information about it in the Parliamentary Library, they will find that it is true. I come now to the actual conditions in Australia. members preach the pernicious doctrine of class hatred. Nothing is so calculated âo divide a nation as is class hatred. It is to the everlasting discredit of members of the Labour party that they persist with that fearful doctrine. The honourable member for Watson( Mr Curtin), who laughs at that statement, is one of the worse offenders. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) and his predecessor both were guilty of preaching the doctrine of class hatred. Such a practice plays into the hands of the Communists. It is the Communist line. Opposition members.know that if it is persisted in it will divide the nation; but, in order to serve their own selfish ends, they continue to preach it, because they cannnot see further than their noses.

I do not dispute the right of the Government to submit that issue to the people for decision. But, the House, before it decides to approve such a course must consider whether the proposal that the Government wishes to place before the people is similar in form to that which was dealt with by the High Court. Another consideration is whether the. Government is frank, honest and sincere in its approach to this matter.

I ask honourable members to trace the history of the Communist Party Dissolution Act from the time when it was introduced in this Parliament as a bill. Most of us recall only too well that it was a sort of legislative Frankenstein monster without a head or a tail. It had no beginning and no end and, in that form, it brought forth loud and prolonged protests from all sections of the community, l t was attacked in the press, from the pulpit, by university professors and by thousands of other liberty-loving citizens. Only under the pressure of public opinion and the Labour majority in the Senate did the Government agree to include certain safeguards in the bill. Even then,, the amendments were not so far-reaching as the Opposition would have liked them to be. However, the bill was given at least a beginning and an end. Provision was made for the appointment of a board to advise the executive in relation to any persons nr bodies that the Government proposed to declare.

If the security service has been doing its job properly there must be ample evidence in its possession upon which the Government could base a prosecution of the Communist party. The service has been in existence for at least ten years, and it should now have detailed munist Party Dissolution Act. In this information about the activities of Communists. The procedure that could be followed under the Crimes Act is very simple. A prefatory affirmation or averment is regarded as a prima facie allegation, and the person or body concerned is under onus to show cause why he or it should not be dealt with. Abundant activities in Australia was submitted to Mr Justice Lowe in the recent inquiry conducted by a royal commission in Victoria. The finding of the commissioner dealt at length with the nature and membership of the Communist party and its activities generally. It stated the actual but there is no definition in this bill of number of Communists who were operating throughout Australia at the time. Under the Crimes Act it would be a simple procedure to include those findings Minister. The proposed new section as evidence upon which the Communist party could be called on to show cause why it should not be prosecuted. It could be dealt with judicially in that way without resort to some secret process or to a declaration on the advice of the security service or the ex parte evidence of informers, which could not be cross examined or challenged in any way. Individuals who supplied under the terms of the Communist Party Dissolution Act would be governed by all sorts of motives. The system would be open to many abuses. We all know of injustices that have been perpetrated in countries such as Russia and Germany. Even in Australia, as the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) pointed out, individuals were convicted during World War I. on false evidence and were incarcerated for a number of years. The facts were finally brought to light by a royal commission. abuses have occurred in the ordinary processes of law, one can readily imagine what could happen under a secret police regime without trial or the right of appeal. The High Court has defended Mr Morgan. the fundamental rights of citizens and the Government should heed its advice and adhere only to democratic methods of procedure. Instead of heeding that advice the Government has provided a wider definition of a Communist or Communistic body than it did in the Combill it has proposed not only that it should have power to reintroduce that act in its actual or amended form but also that it should be given power to deal with Communists or communism in general. Clause2 of the bill provides that the Constitution shall be altered by inserting after section 51 the following section:evidence of Communist 5 1 A (1) The Parliament should have power to make such laws for the peace, order and good Government of the Commonwealth with respect to Communists or communism the Parliament considers to he necessary. That is the only definition given in the bill. The Communist Party Dissolution Act set out a definition of communism communism or a Communist. That is very significant and calls for some explanation on the part of the Prime 51A continues. . . as the Parliament considers to Im necessary or expedient for the defence or security of the Commonwealth or for the execution or maintenance of this Constitution or of the laws of the Commonwealth. The interpretation of who is a Communist or of what is communism and the nature of the activity to be dealt with is information taken right out of the hands of the court. That is a slap in the face of the High Court. By inserting the words "" as the Parliament considers to be necessary or expedient"" the Government proposes to take the determination of this question out of judicial hands. It will be for the Government to determine what is necessary and expedient. The Leader of thn Opposition quoted a definition of communism from the Oxford English dictionary. That dictionary gives two definitions of communism. The first When such definition is as follows:A theory of society according to which all property should he vested in the community and the labour re-organized for the common benefit. The second definition readsAny practice which carries out this theory. Tlie Communist is described as an adherent of the theory. There is no mention in this bill of revolutionary communism. The Prime Minister could render his proposal unambiguous by placing the word "" revolutionary "" before the word "" communism "" in the bill. There is no preamble to this measure such as ""that which prefaced the Communist Party Dissolution Act and which made it appear that only Marxian and Leninist principles of communism were to be dealt with. In the second edition of Webster's New International Dictionary there are five definitions of communism. They are as follows:System of social organization in which goods are held in common; the opposite of the system of private property. Communalism: A system in which communes or other small political units have large powers as compared with both the individual and the central Government. Any theory or system of social organization involving common ownership of the agents of production and some approach to equal distribution of the products of industry. The/popular use of the word "" communism "" conforms to the third of these definitions. The scientific usage sometimes conforms to the first alone and sometimes alternates between the first and second. Host modern writers use the term indiscriminately in these two meanings. Communalism: Practice of eating together ""it the same table. The principles and theories of the Communist party, especially in Soviet Russia. There are five definitions of communism or Communists.

Fundamentally, communism is the system of society in which property (especially real property and the means of production) is held in common, i.e., by members of the society and not by individuals. Thus the Egido of the Mexican Indians and the property and work system of the Inca were both Communist though the one was a matter of more or less independent communities cultivating their own lands in common and the other a type of community organization within a highly organized empire headed by an Emperor (The Inca) and nobles. Usually the term is defined to include such types of community living as that of the Jesuit Reductions in Paraguay and occasionally is extended to mean even the communal life instituted in monasticism. There is evidence that the life of the early Germans at least had a communal aspect and in the lilt h century and early 20th century there was fierce argument as to whether or not "" p r i m it i v e "" society in Europe was essentially Communist. This dispute, when the academic dust had settled, was left unresolved; its effect, however, was far-reaching. There is some question as.to whether it is possible to speak of any concept of property (except immediate personal property) among nomadic tribes and a proper distinction between rival organization and communal property-holding' is not easy to draw. The idea of the Golden Age which appeared very early among the Greeks is a concept of a pristine and .paradisiacal world of communal bliss and harmony without the institution of private' property. Communism as a theory of Government and social reform may be said, in a limited sense, to have begun with this Greek vision of a Golden Age and particularly with Plato who in. The Republic, outlined a society with communal holding of property but also with a hierarchic social system including slavery; this has by some, been called aristrocratic communism. Perhaps that is the type of communism in which honourable members opposite believe. The encyclopaedia continuesThe neoplatonists revived the idea of common property which also was strong in some religious groups such as the Jewish Essenes and certain early Christian communities. These religious opponents of private property held that property-holding is evil as being worldly and that God had created the world for the use of all mankind.

There are to-day m a n y C h r is t i a n sects such as the M i l it a n t Methodists in America who believe in many of tbe principles of socialism .and sharing in common and who are opposed to the possession of private property. In Israel there are community settlements in which the people have abolished the principle of private ownership and have ceased to use money as a currency. When the Jews can do that the world is progressing. The Government should make clear at whom it is aiming. As the Leader of the Opposition said, the definition of a Communist is all-embracing. It could include socialists who believe in common ownership. Socialism is stated to be the aim and objective of the Australian Labour party. The Prime Minister, as a man who has had great experience in the courts and in the preparation of bills for presentation to the Parliament, knows that it is usual for a definition clause to be inserted in nearly every bill. do not thank that he is so naive as to have overlooked the inclusion of such a clause in this bill. A definition clause has not been omitted unwittingly. It has been omitted deliberately in order to leave the bill in a state of ambiguity. As the Leader of the Opposition has pointed out, the bill, if passed, must lead to the establishment of a totalitarian regime. Having dealt with one section of its opponents, the Government must deal with the socialists. According to Government members who have spoken in this House and during election campaigns, and according to advertisements which the Government parties had printed, there is no difference between a Communist, a socialist, and a Labour man. with the Communist it will deal with the socialist, then with the Labour man and then with other people. That .is what happened in Germany and in Russia. able member's time has expir&d. defining the word "" Communist"" the honourable member for Reid( Mr deal with the Communists. I point out Morgan) Methodists and the socialists. When this bill becomes law it will not be the militant Methodists and socialists who will be running for their safety. This bill has been directed at the Communists and honourable members can be assured that the Government is worrying about the working system aiot of the Incas but of the Kremlin. Several honourable members of .the Opposition have used a tremendous -number of words in opposing ihe bill, but have proposed .nothing concrete in its place. The bogy of communism that was mentioned by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Crean) is not a bogy, but a stark reality. That is a .fact which honourable members of the Opposition will not face. They have said that the Government should continue to control the country in a democratic way. The purpose of this bill is to enable the Government to do that. The honourable member for Reid said that we should win the Communists over to our side. I point out that it has been the endeavour of the Western democracies to I win over the Communists since the termination of World War II . They have tried by every diplomatic and peaceful means to bring under the notice of the Communists their desire for peace above everything else. I cannot see that Australia could succeed in winning over the Communists when greater and strougc! powers have not been able to come to terms with them. 'One of the most important factors in connection with this bill is that on 'two occasions the public has given this Government its sanction to take action against what we consider to be the most dangerous and deadly menace that has ever '.been allowed to threaten our democratic system of government. During the Once the Government has dealt debate on the Communist Party Dissolution Bill the Opposition staunchly maintained, as it now obstinately maintains, that the electors of Australia regard the Government's methods as being too drastic and extreme. The honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) implied in his impassioned speech to-night that the last general election was held too hurriedly to give the electors any opportunity of knowing what we were trying to do in order to mentioned the militant that what we -wanted to do was quite evident during the life of the Nineteenth Parliament. The Opposition said that our proposals for dealing with communism",80,Government Supporters Hear
161,Mr Speaker,Order! The honor,84,Government Supporters Hear
162,Mr Opperman (Corio) [11.43],"I nwere extreme, yet at the last general election our policy was again accepted by the people as being reasonable and logical. Whilst in this House members of the Labour party may endeavour, with a variety of arguments, to minimize the fantastic grip that communism has ou the trade, industry and living standards of this country, we on this side of the House will not be lulled into a false sense of security. If we allowed ourselves to lie so lulled we should be entirely false to our responsibilities as a government that was returned to office to implement a policy dedicated to the eradication of a treacherous enemy in our midst. I again that the Opposition has said nothing about, and has given no indication of, how we can deal with that enemy effectively other than by the methods that are specified in this measure. Communism has existed in this country for many years, and many of the Australian people realized the danger of it before the last war. A Liberal and Australian realized it when it banned the Communist party on a previous occasion. A Labour government removed that ban, and I think that we are right in believing that had it not been removed the outlook of this country to-day might have been different. We know that during the time the Communist party was banned the Communists were allowed to grow in influence because of Russian participation in the war. They were shrewd and cunning, ancl they knew that they could enhance their prestige in Australia by ostensibly inking the side of this country in the war, because Russia and this country were allies. However, we can recall the hypocrisy that the Communists evidenced when, at the outbreak of the war, they termed it an "" imperialist war "". When Russia was attacked by Germany in June, 1941, they changed that cry overnight, and said that the war was being fought for peace and freedom. That was a complete somersault such as only th? Communists can perform. After Russia found itself in the fight, and up to the end of the war, it was obviously to the benefit of the Communists to increase output in this as well [41] as in other allied countries. They wanted to keep the workers at their jobs. They were able to secure in war-time improvements of the conditions of work and were able to assume the role of people who were working for the best interests of the employer and employee. They were thus able to increase their influence in the trade union movement. Those were the tactics by which they secured a hold on the trade unions. The view that communism flourishes only in conditions of degression has often been expressed in this House by honourable members opposite. I hold the con-ay trary view, and support it by pointing out that it was in conditions of comparative prosperity during the war that communism made its greatest advances in this country. The Labour party well knows that the main task of the Communist party is to absorb the trade union movement and, by that means, to absorb the Labour party later. The Labour party, therefore, should support this measure, because communism is the Country party government greatest menace it has ever faced, just as it is the greatest menace that the country has ever faced. The Labour party knows that the Communist 'party has infiltrated the trade union movement through the Federated Iron workers Association of Australia, the Seamen's Union of Australia, tbe Amalgamated Engineering Union, and the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia. Those key unions, which have about 500,000 members under their control, are dominated by Communists. Because of that dominance, the Communists have a stranglehold of Australian industry, and so, instead of going forward after the Avar to a period of increasing' prosperity which would have been of benefit to the workers as well as to the employers, we have had industrial stoppages and retardation of production. Some people have the ridiculous idea that inherent in the fact that businesses are flourishing is something detrimental to the workers. That is not so. Since 1946, the Communists, instead of acting in the best interests of ""the workers, have caused chaos in Australian industry. They have been ab'e. to do so because during-the war year -; they infiltrated key trade unions. We know how that Avas done and I shall not repeal the details of the sad story of how this country, of all countries, has suffered such a state of affairs and has had to put up with the strikes, stoppages and one-day shut-downs that we have had in recent years. The Communists want to see disruption and discontent, and will use every possible means to produce them. Their activities are in no small part responsible for rising prices. A brickveneer house cost in 1939 a total of ahmi Â£1,300, tbe cost of labour being about Â£455 and the cost of material beiug about Â£850. To-day we find that the material for the same kind of housn. despite the fact that the 40-hour week, slow 'production and stoppages have entered into its cost, has risen from Â£850 to only Â£1,450, whereas the cost of labour has gone up from Â£455 to Â£2,350. That is an illustration of the effect that ComLabour party and members of the Labour munist activity can have on the essential factors of our living standards. If the Communist infiltration of the trade unions continues Communists will infiltrate the Labour party through the unions and will eventually, by constitutional or other means, gain control of this country as they gained control of Czechoslovakia. When they have done so there will no longer be free elections whereby we can change our governments every three years if we so wish. The honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) at one stage of his speech to-night, said that the people who voted for Liberal party and Australian Country party candidates at the last general election would return to their allegiance to Labour when they became aware of the facts. But those people will never return to Labour while it shows evidence of supporting and protecting, to its own detriment, the Communists in this country. Communist infiltration of the trade unions has become so deeply rooted that there is only one thing that will plough it out-a powerful alliance of resolute government action with the activities of moderate industrial groups. The dishevelled state of the Labour party's ranks at the present time and the complete inability of Labour to agree on a policy were again paraded before a critical public last week when, as a result of the introduction of this bill, Mr Opperman. the Victorian State executive of the Labour party voted to support the measure and four out of twelve delegates to the Labour party's federal executive also voted in support of it. To-night we bad an appeal by the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) for a closing of Labour's ranks. Honourable members opposite know that they have a weak case, and that the public will not support them. I believe that an attempt to close their ranks on this bill could easily mean disaster to them. The Government is far closer to the thoughts and desires of trade unionists than are most of the people who have raised their own little thrones and have lost contact with the trade union movement, the membership of which has risen from some 950,000 in 1939 to 1.600,000 to-day. The leaders of the parliamentary party executives have become far removed from those to whom they should be giving their guidance and inspiration ancl these leaders are opposing this bill because they fear that its acceptance by the people will show that their guidance of the trade unions has been lacking in inspiration. That is why, to a great degree, we have witnessed the desperate efforts of honourable members opposite, like the honourable member for East Sydney, to raise a smokescreen to obscure the lack of political ancl moral fibre which they have displayed in having failed to deal with the enemy in their own midst. I shall quote from the writings o'""(>nc. Max Bladek, who for 24 years was a militant member of the Communist party. He wrote as follows:Then a word about the actual tasks of the different parties within the countries themselves. No mutter what country Communists may be in their job is to pursue a nationalist policy in order to gain as many followers as possible. They must gain influence in Parliumentary institutions and especially in the Trade Unions, in order to organize strikes which may culminate in a general strike, aimed at overthrowing the country. They must learn to gain influence in every public body, even sports or social clubs. We know that the Communists have gained control of many sporting and social clubs here. The quotation continues^Communist, intellectuals are trained to take part in middle class and cultural societies. Xlioy must influence the public through the press, pamphlets ' and whispering campaigns. The Communists do not want at the moment to create open war. but to undermine the people in munists. the Western democracies. Because when people have no ideology you can bring them into such confusion that finally you can do what you like with them. The Communists do not want to have open war at the moment, but wish only to undermine the Western democracies because they believe that they can reduce them to such confusion that they can do what they like with them. from the writings of Max Bladek, who was a militant Communist for 24 years :nid turned against the Communist party. What he had to say amply illustrates why we. consider that extreme measures must be taken against the Communists. America and Great Britain have had to take measures against communism. We know that the disappearances of scientists who were working on atom projects has been the cause of terrific concern to America and Britain. We know also that aircraft from Russia, striking without warning, could cripple the industrial potential of America, and greatly reduce any war effort that America might make. America has to wait, because it is u democracy, and take the risk of Russia starting an undeclared war. We also know that Russia is able to put to sea a tremendous could stand off the American coast and throw missiles with powerful warheads at American seaports and cause havoc in them. We know that the Communists have internal saboteurs who arc ready to go into action immediately the Kremlin gives the signal. To-day the world is in the grip of a cold war, but that can be transformed into a hot war with startling suddenness when Russia gives the signal. That makes it essential that we shall be in a position to deal with this traitorous party before it. can do any damace in Australia. A war with Russia would be world wide, and would commence in .many parts of the world simultaneously. There is already evidence that sabotage is being practised in Australia, and in this connection the damage done recently to HMAS. Sydney can be instances. That sabotage can be traced back to the ComThe Communist party in Australia is obviously under the direction of the Kremlin. If I had and doubts about the attitude of Russia and what would happen if communism gained control of this country, they were dissipated by a new Australian with whom I spoke only yesterday. He is a Pole, who had spent some time in Russia's concentration camps. His statements about the actions and outlook of the Russians were sufficient to make me realize that anything that can be done to prevent establishment of a system like that in this country should be done. They also reassured me that by this measure we are not doing anything extreme, but are doing something that will be as effective in this present time of uneasy peace as would be the use of bombs and rifles in war-time. This new Australian told me that he had been in a Russian labour camp where the prisoners had to do 100 'per cent, of the established amount of work each day. for which they received 1,000 grammes of bread. If they were ill and could do only 90 per cent, of the amount of work that they were supposed to do, they received only 90 per cent, of the 1,000 grammes of bread, or 900 grammes. It can be well understood why fifteen or twenty labourers were dying each day under those submarine fleet which conditions. Honourable members should remember that we are up against people who see nothing wrong in such conditions. The people who believe that a system such as that should be introduced into Australia are directed and controlled by the Australian Communist party. The Government is now asking for power to cleanse Australia of this blight and to prevent the possibility of such conditions being established here. There is only one way to do it, and that is by the action that can be taken through this measure. It is my considered opinion that the public will accept the Government's proposal in this matter, and I also suggest that the Opposition, when it supported the Communist Party Dissolution Bill in the Nineteenth Parliament, gave its assent to the Government's projected method",84,Government Supporters Hear

164,Mr Opperman,"I was quotingof dealing with the Communist party. Therefore, I support this bill. Sitting suspended from 12.4 to 12.84 a.m. (Wednesday). Wednesday, 11 July, 1951. Mr J. R. ERASER (Australian Capital Territory) [12.34 a.m.] -The people of the Australian Capital Territory will not vote at the proposed referendum. They were not a party to the contract between the States that ied to the framing of the Constitution and, therefore, they have no voice in proposals to alter the Constituan article that appeared on page 8 of tion. But they will be affected by any decisions taken on this measure just as much as will be people in any other part of Australia. I deplore the fact that the people of the Territory have no vote on a matter that vitally affects civil rights and individual liberties. I suggest that, when a referendum is being held at some future date, means should be found to provide that the people of the interior territories shall be given an effective vote on the matter at issue. I realize that it would be difficult to devise means by which their vote could be recorded in the votes of the States, but I believe that means could be found by which it could be. recorded in the over-all total. As the member for the Australian Capital Territory, I shall have no vote on the motion that is now before the House. I may speak on that motion and express my opposition to it, but, no matter how vehemently I may call "" No"" when the vote comes to be taken, my name will not be recorded in the tally. I make it quite clear that, in my opinion, this bill is a bad one. The Government is seeking to achieve, by sleight of hand as it were, more than the High Court decided only a few months ago that it had no power to do. This is not a measure designed to clothe the National Parliament with the full powers that many honourable members on both sides of the House believe that it should have. The Government is taking no step to widen the Constitution generally in order to make the work of this Parliament more effective. It has ignored the proposals that have been put forward by the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Bland) and other honourable members for the establishment of a convention to review and widen the Constitution of the Commonwealth. Instead, it is seeking to capitalize on the hysteria that it has itself created and to enact sectional legislation that will, I suggest, defile the spirit of the Constitution. for the Australian Capital Territory ( Mr J. R. Fraser) is going to be as difficult as his brother is. Mr J. R, FRASER,I acknowledge that tribute. I shall read to the House the Sydney Sunday Sun on the Sth July. It is headed ""Red Ban Favoured. Eighty-five per cent, may vote Yes "", and reads as follows:The referendum on banning the Communist party is likely to be carried by big majorities in all States. A Gallup poll taken in the past fortnight shows this. In the six States, 1,500 people were personally interviewed and asked "" If a referendum is held to give the Federal Government power to ban the Communist party, are you likely to vote Yes for banning or No against the banning? "" Eighty in 100 plan to vote yes, 12 in 100 plan to vote No, 8 in 100 are undecided. In no State does the Yes majority fall below 75 per cent. The usual reason for wanting to ban the Communist party is, ""They are the cause of all our troubles''. I direct the attention of the House especially to that last sentence. Do the members of the Government believe that the Communists are the cause of all our troubles? Do they realize that that article is an indictment of the Government for the mischief that it has caused in the community? I suggest that the Government, by its campaigning during the last two general elections and by its pronouncements since December, 1949, has created a superficial neurosis in the Australian community to a degree tliat has yet to be measured. On the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) and the leaders of the Government parties I lay the blame for the existence in many people in this community of a state of mind that accepts the spurious belief that the Communists are the cause of all the troubles with which we are faced to-day. The Prime Minister knows that that belief is a false one, but he countenances and encourages the spirit of the belief, which has led to an unhealthy disbalance of the collective mind of the community. It is common-to hear young people who are barely out of their 'teens, and",87,Government Supporters Hear
165,Mr Gullett,"The honourable memberLave no real knowledge of the issues involved, repeating without thought the parrot-cry that the wretched Communists are the cause of all our troubles, and that if the Commonwealth could legislate to ban the Communist party a great transformation would occur in the industrial and political life of this country. 1 remind the Prime Minister and the other members of the Government that that is a most dangerous belief. It is one that is likely to rebound on the heads of those who have fostered it. Throughout Australia, there are many people who appear to believe, as does the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth), that there is a Communist lurking behind every tree and in every doorway in this country. Unfortunately, those people also believe, mistakenly, that if the present Government were given the power that it seeks it would destroy the Communist menace and root out the Communist wreckers, as they are so prone to call them. The Prime Minister, in his second reading speech on this bill, quoted a passage from a judgment that was delivered by Mr Justice Jackson in the Supreme Court of the United States of America in the case of Dennis v. the United States of America. In that judgment, Mr Justice Jackson referred to events preceding and subsequent to the coup d'etat in Czechoslovakia. The right honourable gentleman recalled Mr Army, and Air Force and militia? Does Justice Jackson's description of how, in a period of confusion, Communist underground organizations came to the surface throughout Czechoslovakia, Communist trade union officials took over transportation, Communist printers took over newspapers and radios, Communists took possession of telegraph and telephone installations, Communist unions took over factories, Communist organizations made a partisan distribution of food, and, finally, Communists instituted a reign of oppression and terror throughout Czechoslovakia. The right honourable gentleman, having quoted that history of events in Czechoslovakia, saidIt is mere purblindness not to recognize that Communist political strikes and organized go-slow policies in Australia are just as much a part of the cold war going on in the world as the historical examples to which I have referred. He addedThe danger is not distant, it exists here and now. I suggest that by the quotation that Inmade and by the warning that he gave, the Prime Minister seeks to create in this country an unjustified fear that the pattern that the Communists'followed in Czechoslovakia can be followed in this country. Such a fear actually exists, and the Government is exploiting it. I shall reveal the dishonesty of the Government': methods by drawing attention to the fact that Czechoslovakia was a country in which the social conditions we enjoy in Australia were undreamed of. It was a country in which grave social unrest provided a ready field for the spread of communism. Furthermore, Czechoslovakia is a small country surrounded completely by land boundaries and, therefore, was easily influenced and infiltrated. It had a highly organized and concentrated army and police force. The conditions that existed in the country at the time to which I refer provided an ideal opportunity for the coup d'etat that subsequently took place. Conditions of that kind simply do not exist in Australia. Does the Prime Minister seriously suggest to the Parliament and to the people that there is imminent danger in this country of an uprising by Communists who would seize control of our police force,Navy, he suggest that the Communists are organized to take over the whole of our transportation and communication systems? Does he fear, and does he counsel the people to fear, that there is a real and present danger that Communists will seize control of newspapers and radio stations throughout the country? Let us have some truth and realism about this matter. I heard little of either from honourable members opposite in the course of this debate. Let them put an end to the creation of this fear and their exploitation of it for party political purposes. Admittedly, Communists cause disruption in some of our industries. The use of their power in that sphere has been to the detriment of the Australian economy. There have been instances in which Communists have achieved executive power in trade unions as the result of rigged ballots. Nevertheless, the menace is not so grave as Government supporters would like the people to believe, and the steps that the Government proposes to take under this measure exceed those that would be adequate to remedy our industrial ills. In the past the people of Austhe referendum proposals be put before tralia have shown that they will not have a "" bar "" of a Communist when he comes before them seeking election to the Parliament. Inevitably, in the political sphere, every Communist party candidate is rejected by the people and forfeits his deposit. Communism, is not a force in the political life of this country and to liament honourable members witnessed the degree that it is a force in our indusmany extraordinary actions on the part trial and economic life the remedy lies ready to the Government's hand. The provisions of the Crimes Act, in which the Government professes to believe, are sufficient to enable it to take action against any persons who engage in seditious and subversive activities. The Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1949 provides adequate means to remedy the malpractices that occur from time to time in ballots for the election of officials of the trade unions. The Government has adequate power under existing legislation to enable it to destroy the Communist menace, but it has not taken such action. On the contrary, it invariably exhibits a preference for totalitarian methods. The people of this country look to it for action. It cannot hope to be known as a government ofaction if it merely indulges in outpourings of words and the enactment of measures of this kind. Now that it has a majority in both this chamber and in the Senate, it can ensure that any measure that it introduces will be passed. But legislation merely opens the door to action. The Government will be judged not only on the legislation that it passes during its term of office, but also on the action that it takes under such legislation. Finally, I appeal to the Government when it prepares the case for its proposals Minister( Mr Menzies) clearly indito be submitted by way of referendum to the people to present them with reality, returned to office would ban the calmness and restraint. I trust that it will not seek by inflammatory statements and advertisements in the press and over the air to aggravate the neurotic fear that it has already caused in the community. As it has a majority in this Mr J. R. Fraser. House and in the Senate, it can ensure that this measure shall be passed. However, an alteration of the Constitution involves joint action by both Houses of the Parliament and the people. I ask that the case for and the case against the people with clarity logic and a proper sense of the responsibility of the Parliament to advise the people wisely and well. During the life of the Nineteenth Parof members of the Opposition, but I doubt whether the Parliament has previously seen the once great Labour party so confused in its outlook with respect to a particular measure as it has shown itself to be on this occasion. The honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory ( Mr J. R. Fraser) and the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Crean) virtually criticized their colleagues. Honourable members opposite endeavoured to lead the people to believe on the one hand that communism is merely a philosophy and on the other hand that the 'Government is endeavouring to exaggerate the danger and importance of communism. However, when these proposals were previously before the Parliament, the Labour Opposition voted in favour of them and accepted every principle that they embody. Therefore, they must be regarded as being of vital importance. Previously, honourable members opposite committed themselves to the responsibility of seeing through this task. Their only alternative is to go on the hustings and indulge in the acrobatics for which they have become well known. Honourable members should consider this measure in its true perspective. At the general election in 1949 the Prime cated that the Government parties if Communist party and would deal with Communists to the fullest possible degree. The people endorsed the policy by an overwhelming majority. Subequently, the Government introduced the Communist Party Dissolution Bill. At",88,Government Supporters Hear
166,Mr Eggins (Lyne) [12.52 A.m.],"tbe .last general election, the people, after they had had every opportunity to familiarize themselves with these proposals as the result of the debate that took place upon them during the life of the Nineteenth Parliament, again returned tbe Government parties with a clear mandate to the Government to implement its policy to deal quickly and effectively with the Communist menace. As the result, of the High Court judgment with respect to the validity of the Communist Party Dissolution Act, the Government has now introduced this measure under which it proposes to ask the people to give to the National Parliament the power that it requires to deal with communism along the lines that they previously approved. If the people do so, they will give such power not only to the government but also to the Parliament. Honourable members should comprehend fully the principles that are contained in the bill. Members of the Opposition have made only too obvious their reluctance to recognize these simple principles. Never before has any democratic country been faced with the threat that communism now presents to Australia. When we remember that Russia, which is the home of communism, maintains an iron curtain and refuses to allow its people access to the free world or to allow persons of other nationalities to enter its own boundaries, our suspicions are naturally aroused about what is going on behind that curtain. We can only conclude that it has been erected to hide sinister activities that are designed to throw the world into chaos. Not so long ago the late Mr Ernest Bevin, when he was British Foreign Minister and was charged with the responsibility of conferring on his country's behalf with representatives of other nations and, consequently, -had first-hand knowledge of what was going on throughout the world, declared in the British House of tion Act, the Government will be able Commons that Russian imperialist comto remove Communists from key offices munism was world-wide and that it conin the unions. Do members of the stituted the greatest threat that had yet. Labour party object to that proposal? confronted the world because of its effecThey have not said_ so. They make all tive underground work in democratic kinds of apologies in their speeches, but countries. He warned the British Parthey are silent about the fundamental liament and the world in general of that principles of that act, for which they danger. Unfortunately, his warning has voted last year. been confirmed by events that .have occurred in the meantime. Recently, General MacArthur declared that the United Nations forces in Korea were engaged in a fight against world communism. We should realize that fact. Australia must bear its share of the responsibility for the. conduct of that fight. The principal purposes of the Communist Party Dissolution Act are three in number. The first is to dissolve the Communist party. Does any honourable member of the Opposition object to that? 1 doubt it, because the Opposition voted for that legislation last year. The second purpose of the act is to prevent Communists from being employed in the Commonwealth Public Service. AgainI ask whether any member of the Labour party is opposed to that provision. Mr E. James Harrison interjecting, State parliaments have not introduced complementary legislation for the purpose of dealing with the threat of communism in the public services of the States. Tbe third purpose of the act is to remove Communists from key positions in the trade unions. The honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory has stated that Communist candidates for political honours in Australia receive only a small percentage of the votes. I agree that, when the Communists come out into the open, a large majority of the people unhesitatingly express their disapproval of the Communist policy. The Government desires to give trade unionists an opportunity to express their disapproval of the Communists who seek election to positions in industrial organizations. I have every confidence that when trade unionists are able to vote by secret ballot, they will reject the Communist candidates. Under the Communist Party Dissolu-",90,Government Supporters Hear
167,Mr Eggins,"We regret that tlieWhileI was turning through the pages of Eansard this afternoon, I happened to glance at a speech that was delivered by the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) in 1938. I listened with some astonishment to his speech this evening, because it was an almost complete repetition of the earlier one. In describing the Communist Party Dissolution Act as an attack upon the trade union movement, he repeated the same old story that he tells us week after week. As Opposition members are perfectly well aware, the act clearly provides of that kind would soon be made aware that trade unions may not be declared. They unsuccessfully endeavoured to cloud the issue, and many of their statements were merely stupid. I am sure that the people will reject the views of those honourable gentlemen when they have an opportunity to do so. I was astonished to hear the honourable member for Reid( Mr Morgan), who is a member of the legal profession, state that the Crimes Act and other legislation could be used to meet the present situation, and that, therefore, the powers that legislation. the Government is seeking are unnecessary. I agree that the Crimes Act may be used against a person who has committed an offence in respect of which a charge can'be sustained in the courts. However, the Government must act promptly in dealing with the Communists who live and work in a subtle way, and are known to be enemy agents. Is the Government to sit idly by while members of the Communist party, who occupy key positions in the trade unions, cleverly avoid committing offences that would expose them to ordinary legal proceedings? The act merely provides that Communists who occupy key positions in the trade unions shall be declared. Once they are deprived of'their power they will cease to be a danger in the trade union movement. If they cause trouble elsewhere and become a danger in another way, so that they expose themselves to ordinary legal proceedings, the Government will take swift action against them. The Communist Party Dissolution Act also contains safeguards in respect of the and possibly in other States have placed power to search. Opposition members have dealt at length about the danger of the misuse of that right, but I believe that such fears are without foundation. Mr Eggins. Provision is also made in the act for an appeal to the Supreme Court of a State, and the High Court of Australia., The act is fair and, at the same time, effective. Before a person is declared to be a Communist, his name must be submitted to a special committe for invesigation, and its recommendation that he be declared must be submitted to Cabinet for action. The Parliament may be described as the sounding board of public opinion. Any government, regardless of its political views, that behaved unfairly in a matter of the disapproval of the people. The provisions of the act make its perfectly clear that all those matters will be dealt with in the fairest possible manner. The act also provides that if a declared person gives evidence in a court, the burden of proof shall rest upon the Crown. Opposition members have spoken at length about placing upon a person the onus of proving his innocence, but I remind them that Labour governments have incorporated the same principle in It is contained in the National Emergency (Coal Strike) Act that was placed on the statute-book by the Chifley Government in June, 1949. During the debate on that legislation, the Attorney-General of the day, Dr. Evatt, said'Clause 11 lays down a principle that is well lecognized in legislation of this character. After all, an organization cannot be prosecuted or suffer any personal loss. Under this clause where an organization has committed an offence against the measure the officers are deemed to be guilty of the offence unless proof is given, in the case of an offence alleged against an individual, that he did not know it, that is to say that it was committed without his knowledge, or. if he did know of it, that he used due diligence to prevent the commission of the offence. The Communist Party Dissolution Act incorporates many safeguards so that the provisions in relation to the onus of proof shall not operate unjustly. Opposition members are endeavouring to "" cover up "" as best they can, because they find themselves in a difficult situation. Labour governments in New South Wales upon the statute-book legislation in which the onus is placed upon an accused person to prove his innocence. New South Wales legislation that embodies that principle includes the Textile Products Liability Act 1945, the Irrigation and Water (Amendment) Act 1943, the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Act 1948, the Parm Produce Agents Act 1932, the Prices Regulation Act 1948, the Land Sales Control Act 1948, the Pastures Protection (Amendment) Act 1949 and the Economic Stability Act 1946. Yet Opposition members criticize the inclusion of a similar provision in the Communist Party Dissolution Act, regardless of the fact that the Government must act promptly against the Communists. The attitude of the Opposition, when it is examined, is ridiculous. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports dismissed the Communist threat to Australia, and described communism, as a philosophy that is changing our economic and social conditions. I do not know whether the honourable gentleman expects the House to believe him, but I am afraid that, before long, he will gain a new outlook on it. World communism is so effective, thorough and dangerous that even the most simple-minded person should realize that it constitutes a threat to this country. The British scientist, Dr. Fuchs, revealed atomic bomb secrets to Russia, and Harry Rose, a member of the Canadian Parliament, engaged in espionage for the Soviet. Those happenings in other parts of the world should cause the most simple-minded persons in Australia to be on their guard. The Leader of the Oppposition, in an vities, we must enact a measure along extraordinary speech this evening, tried the lines that the Government has indito extricate the Labour party and. himself cated. I am sure that the people will from a difficult position. The right honorappreciate the situation and give to the able gentleman said that legislation such Government any power that it needs tc as the Communist Party Dissolution Act deal with Communists. had never been introduced in the United Kingdom. comparable with the growth of comfrom every point of view in various munism have not been experienced in the debates in this chamber. The Governhistory of the United Kingdom before the ment and its supporters are now looking present time. Men of liberal, or advanced forward to the time when, from the thought, have had, above all other conhustings, we can submit this proposal siderations, feelings of affection for their to the people for their decision. It will own country. But the Communists place be extremely interesting to observe the their allegiance to a foreign power above conduct of members of the Opposition their responsibilities to their country. then because the honourable member for They are trying to convince us that East Sydney( Mr Ward) clearly disthey are liberal in outlook, and that their closed to-night the existence of a diviactivities in the industrial sphere should sion of opinion amongst them. How not be hindered in any way. They have tried our patience for too long. Opposition members do not appear to realize that the High Court dad not question the principle of the Communist Party Dissolution Act. Their Honours merely declared that it was invalid because they considered that the defence powers of the Commonwealth under the Constitution could not be used to support, it. The Australian people are to have the responsibility, by way of referendum,, of signifying their approval for the incorporation of those powers in the Constitution. I do not seek to criticize a decision of the High Court, but I am convinced that the people realize that their Government, which has the responsibility of safeguarding the country, is in possession of vital secret information from various parts of the world that is; not available to the justices of the court. The court has only a legal responsibility. The Government is charged with the preservation of national security and, for that purpose, it obtains special information from other democratic governments. The United Kingdom Government is speeding up its defence preparations. Not long ago it purged Communists from the public service, although, unfortunately, its overhaul was nol thorough enough. We have read of events in the United States of America and Canada, and we know that this Government plans to increase the tempo of defence preparations. Obviously, in the light of the nature of Communist actiObviously, circumstances This subject has been thrashed out 1258 Constitution Alteration many of them will take the platform during the referendum campaign to oppose ,the Government's proposal as enthusiastically as they pretend to oppose it -now? No more important issue has c<>me to the forefront in recent years. Notwithstanding what the honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory may say, the people of Australia know that the world-wide organization of communism is working against their interests through its agents within this country and, when the opportunity <:omes to them, they will ensure that the Constitution shall be altered so as to .enable the Government to act promptly .and effectively in defence of the nation's -security. In rising to oppose the bill, I first pay a tribute to the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) for the magnificent case that he stated to-night in opposition to the b ill. So sound was his case that not one supporter of the Government has yet been able to refute his statements. In fact, Government supporters have carefully endeavoured to divert attention from the arguments that the right honourable gentleman employed. The honourable member for Lyne( Mr Eggins) said that he would be interested to observe the attitude that would be adopted by members of the Opposition during the referendum campaign. He may rest assured that every honourable member on this side of the House will be out fighting in the cause of justice to defeat the Government's proposal. As for the suggestion that there may be some somersaults, there could be no greater somersault than that which was performed by members of the Government who, before the death of the late Ben Chifley, had accused him of almost every possible political sin, includmunists are acting seditiously, the Going sympathy for communism. He had to die before they would somersault and concede the credit that was due to him. Government supporters, therefore, should be the last to talk about somersaults. The Opposition has not changed its attitude to the Government's proposals for dealing with the Communist party. The present Leader of the Opposition warned the Government that the Communist Party Dissolution Act would not survive n'Jegal challenge and, in due course, the [REPRESE FTATIVES.] (Powers to Deal High Court of Australia threw it out holus-bolus. That decision proved the incompetence of the legal men in the ranks of the Government parties. Had they been as efficient as they professed, surely they would not have presented to the Parliament legislation that was doomed to be rejected by six of seven High Court justices. Either the legislation was submitted to the Parliament iji the knowledge that it would be declared invalid or it was drafted by men who were not capable of preparing a measure that would not contravene the Constitution. . Most members of the Government and their supporters have a habit of declaring that members of the Australian Labour party are Communists or nearCommunists. I shall make my position clear upon that issue. I have fought and defeated the Communists in the industrial field in South Australia, and I should like honourable members on the Government side to do a littlo real fighting along the same lines instead of merely engaging in sham fights in this House and during election campaigns. They have been indulging in the practice of sham fighting for so long that I believe they have even become afraid of their own hysterical propaganda. This bill has been introduced merely for the purpose of enabling the Government to present some excuse for its failure to stem the rising tide of inflation, as it promised to do. Ever-increasing prices are gradually crippling our economy, and the Government has demonstrated that it cannot cope with the situation. Therefore, it has dragged out the old hobby-horse of communism in order to distract attention from its weakness. If , as the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) has said, Comvernment stands condemned because it should have taken action against them under the Crimes Act long ago. The findings of the High Court justices against the Communist Party Dissolution Act stated clearly that there was ample power under the Crimes Act to deal with Communists and other subversive elements in the community. The bill is nothing but. a sham, and it proves the insincerity of the Government, which must be aware that the people, much as they may",91,Government Supporters Hear
168,Mr Galvtn (Kingston) [1.19 A.m.].,"detest communism, will not endorse legislation that will infringe the liberty of ordinary citizens and endanger the trade union movement. Had the Government been sincere, it would have introduced a measure in clear terms to deal with the Communists. As I have said, the High Court has clearly indicated that the Constitution gives to this Parliament full power to deal with every kind of traitorous and subversive activity by persons and organizations. The Government should use the power immediately instead of wasting time and money in conducting a referendum. If it does not take action at once, we shall know that it is merelv engaging in a sham fight with the object of stirring up hysteria and misleading the people as it misled them in 1949 and at the more recent general election. Government supporters should not talk too boastfully about the mandate that they have received from the people. Certainly they were returned to power, but, their majority was reduced and the overall result of the election did not show that they had the support of all the people. Tbe Government proposes that, in dealing with Communists, the Cabinet shall decide whonl to declare, and that it shall also be the judge, as well as the accuser. It proposes to act on advice given by officers of the security service and unknown persons. I have not such simple confidence in human nature as to believe that such opportunities as would be made available for laying anonymous charges against individuals would not be used in evil ways. I have visited the guided weapons testing range at Wbomera, and also RadiumH ill and Leigh Creek in South Australia. I was the first trade union official to obtain a permit to go to Wbomera. The security officers there are prepared to take advice from almost anybody. They fairly race to a person when he arrives at these places in order to find out if he can make an accusation against somebody. HadI wanted to do so, I could have placed placed somebody in an awkward position. If who wished to do so would only have to suggest to these people that a certain person was a Communist or a fellow traveller or had been talking to a fellow traveller or wore a red tie and before that individual knew where he was, he would be declared. The first he would know of it would be that some one would tell him that his name was in the Gazette. No group of politicians, Liberal or Labour, should have the power that this bill would give to a government. The Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Holt) said that there were Communists in the Labour party and that there were Communists also in the trade unions which paid sustentation fees to the Australian Labour party. That shows how members of the Government try to mislead .the people through the' medium of the broadcasting service. Thetrade union movement in my State pays affiliation fees for all members of their unions who have signified that they' are members of the Australian Labour party. No sustentation fee is paid in respect of members who are Communistsf know of one union in which there are two Liberal party supporters and .nofee is paid to the Labour party in respect of them. Honourable members opposite have stated that Communists are members of the Australian Labour party only in order to mislead ""the people. Members on the Government side of the House are quick to say that the Labour party is full of Communists. When they disagree with a member of the Opposition they allege that he is a fellow traveller. They would be quick to see that such a person was declared at the first opportunity if the provisions of this bill became law. How quickly would they declare a militant trade union secretary whether he was a member of the Communist party, the Labour party or any other political party if they had the opportunity to do so? Mi-. WILSON -The bill does not apply to trade unionists. to trade union secretaries. The Government has deliberately set out to control the officers who have been elected to trade union positions.

There will be no doubt of the result of the referendum because just as Government members have failed to refute the arguments that have been put forward by the Leader of the Opposition to-night, so they will fail to convince tbe people in their arguments in tbe referendum campaign. The Crimes Act contains the power to deal with Communists. As the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Victorian branch of the Australian Ward) mentioned, in the famous case which involved the organization, Industrial Workers of the World, during the first war, spies, informers and perjurers gave evidence and brought about the conviction of men on a charge of which they were innocent. This bill will enable an open invitation to be issued to men of a similar calibre to perjure themselves. I believe that the people of Australia will defeat this referendum proposal. I know that the people of South Australia will do so. Just as the electors of South Australia reduced the majority of this Government at the last election so they will vote against the proposals of the Government at a referendum. They will do that not only because of the case that will be presented against this proposal but also because of the failure of the Government to grapple with the problems that are strangling the Australian economy. The people are sic!: and tired of the action of this Government in continually blaming the Communists and the trade unions for everything that is wrong. They are waiting for the Government to do something to stop the rise in prices and to halt inflation. The people will see that this bill is a sham. They will see that it has been introduced as an alibi for the Government on account of its failure to do the job that it promised to do. The people will see that the Government has again attempted to mislead them on the subject of communism. [1.40 a.m.] I can sympathize with the honourable member for Kingston( Mr Galvin), who has tried to conceal from the House and the people the very deep split which exists in the Australian Labour party on this issue. Of course, because lie is a new member he has been spared the embarrassing experience of what happened in the previous Parliament when his present colleagues turned so many somersaults on this issue. I was interested to know the depths of his ignorance about his own party. He is probably an expert upon its affairs in South Australia but he does not know very much about the conditions of membership of his own party in other States. The last edition of the official rules of the Labour party states, in clause 1, that membership shall consist of affiliated unions and "" other persons enrolled "". In New South Wales there are different qualifications. The statement in regard to the Australian Labour party which the honourable member made is doubtless correct as far a3 the South Australian branch is concerned but so far as branches in the other States are concerned his knowledge is not so accurate. It is a peculiar fact that members-of the Labour party have invariably found themselves on the side of the Communists. They have found themselves advocating those objectives which the Communists support. They have denounced those principles which the Communists dislike. The honourable member for Kingston, who no doubt did not realize the full import of what he was saying directed a good deal of abuse at the security service whose crime in his eyes seems to be",95,Government Supporters Hear

However, I shall leave those remarks of the honourable member ancl pass on to more important matters. The changes which have occurred in the policy of the Labour party from time to time have been quite remarkable. In the last few days the federal executive of the Labour party has ruled that members are bound by a resolution that was passed in .1948 which forbade the banning of any political party. For that reason, they have to vote against this bill, wbich provides for the banning of the Communist party. Honourable members opposite have said that they are obliged to take orders from that outside body. At page 8S of Hansard of 28th September, 1950, the present Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) is reported to have said that the Communist Party Dissolution Bill, as passed by the Senate, contained the desired provision for the dissolution of the Communist party of Australia. He said that the Senate accepted that provision. The right honourable member continuedI t contained provision for tlie future sup1932-33, from a judgment of Evatt J. I pression of all activities of the Communist party. Tlie Senate accepted that. All property of the Communist party, its newspapers and other assets were to be forfeited to the Commonwealth without compensation. That piovision was accepted by the Senate and by the Opposition in this House. Only a little earlierI am paraphrasing now from Hansard of the 22nd June, 1950, at page 480.1-the same right honourable gentleman twitted the Government with having refused to avail itself of the opportunity to ban the Communist party which had been so generously given To it by the Labour party. That was no passing reference, because when one looks back to the beginning of the debate -and here I refer to Hansard at page 2272 of the 9th May, 1950-w e find that the late Leader of the Opposition, Mr Rex versus Hush ex parte Devanwy. Chifley, said that he agreed with clause 4 of the bill which provided for the banning of the Communist party. A few hours later the right honourable member for Barton said in this chamber that he agreed with his Leader on that point. If the Labour party's resolution of 1948 is binding now on honourable members opposite then it should have been binding on them on that occasion last year. Honourable members opposite are just shuttlecocks who say whatever is expedient. They are trying to protect the Communist party, ana they are employing every shift, including the abolition of their own platform and the twisting of their own constitution, in order to do so. An examination of the records from which I have quoted shows that that shifty twistiness runs through all their arguments. -NowI come to a far more serious mattera statement that was made by the Leader of the Opposition in this chamber to-night. The burden of his speech was, "" You do not need these new powers. Why don't you use the powers you have under the Crimes Act?"" I say that when .he made such statements the right honourable gentleman was not being honest with this House because speaking as a jurist he expressed the opinion that the relevant sections of the Crimes Act were invalid or, at any rate, of very doubtful validity. I shall support that statement with quotations, from Commonwealth Law Reports, volume 4S of think that this utterance should be placarded all over the country, and I hope that it will be reproduced and compared with the words that the right honourable gentleman used here to-night, because when his judgment, expressed by him in his capacity of a judge-and we must respect that-is compared with his words as a politician, one sees that the politician is-well , ""deliberately lying"" is an unparliamentary term, so I shall say, deliberately misleading the House and the country. When two passages are put side by side, the falseness of the right honourable gentleman will be quickly apparent. The judgment from which 1 shall quote was given in the case The Communist party w.as concerned in that case, because the government of the day had endeavoured to use the Crimes Act in order to prosecute it. For various reasons, the Government failed. I shall read a section from the judgment of Evatt/ . in that case, which concerned precisely the kind of prosecution against the Communist party that this measure provides for. The learned judge saidI protest against the growing tendency to assume, without argument or proof, the existence of '""' inherent"" power in tlie Commonwealth Parliament. In this case the very name-the "" Crimes"" Act-challenge s inquiry, because unlike the Dominion of Canada, the Commonwealth does not possess general jurisdiction nver the domain of criminal law. The States of the Commonwealth have power over that subject-matter, and have exercised it very fully and extensively f quote from page 51S of Commonwealth Law Heporls, V o l . 48, 1932-33. I shall now direct the attention of the House to another passage from the same judgment which appears on page 510. The very foamed and honourable judge went on to sayPartI ! A of the Crimes Act contains a number i>f sections dealing w.itli the ""Protection of the Constitution has been challenged in these proceedings. Tlieir general aim is the suppression of associations which advocate or encourage doctrines considered as dangerous to "" constitutional "" government, including the form and frame of government which is expressed in the Commonwealth Constitution. All i>f the sections were inserted in 1020 by Act Ko. 9 (March Kith, l!)2(i), following upon the very important decision of this Court in v.c parte Walsh and -lohmsnn : in rc Yates (1) which was given on Decern l:e'r 18th, 1020. In that case the Commonwealth Government contended that the validity of section SAA of tlig Immigration Act could be supported upon (he footing that there was existing, at the relovunl: time, a serious industrial disturbance which threatened the peace, order and good govern irciit of tin: Commonwealth in relation to all the. matters over which the Commonwealth and its various governmental organs had lawful jurisdiction; and that either section 51 (xxxix) or section (il or some inherent legislative power authorized laws to "" p r o t e c t "" the Commonwealth and its Constitution from the "" subversive activities"" of certain trade union leaders. As much in 1032 as in 1025, the words "" protect"" and "" subversive"" are "" ambiguous and general words"" and are, for that reason, still of value in concealing vague and loose generalizations. The argument did not succeed in 1925, and the judgments of Knox G.J., Higgins and Starke JJ. are quite opposed to the theory that, apart from .sections 51 and 52 Â»f the Constitution, there is any inherent legislative power in the Commonwealth to "" protect the Constitution "" in the way it chooses. ""Vou will recall, Mr Speaker, how .the Loader of the Opposition asked us to put the word ""subversive"" in the bill. But the very honourable EvattJ . thought rather differently, did he not? Although ifr. Wrntirnrth. I have quoted only a small section of the judgment, I think that rather more extensive passages from that illuminating judgment will be made available to the public. They illustrate very clearly the kind of mind which the Leader of the Opposition possesses. I shall leave that matter because I am quite certain that during the coming referendum campaign those facts w ill be used to demonstrate the falsity and bad faith which underlies the whole case advanced to-night by the Leader of the Opposition. The right honourable gentleman says in his place here, "" M a k e use of the CrimesA c t "" , but lie said from his place on the Bench, "" Tbe Crimes Act is no good and the Commonwealth has no powers"". This man is endeavouring to lead the eople again into another constitutional The validity of sonic of them trap that will have the effect of delaying once more effective action against the Communist party. I make that statement because there seems to be only one explanation of the various twists and turns that have characterized the handling of this matter by tbe right honourable gentleman. There can be one. -eason only for his attitude, and that is to try to protect the Communist party from effective Government action against if. The first bill that the Government -submitted at the beginning of last-year produced a statement from the right honourable gentleman to tbe effect that, "" Well, I do not mind some parts of this bill. It is just the form that, J. object to."" Then lie went to the H i g h Court and, again acting on behalf of Communist interest*, he said that the whole bill was bad. Later on he came here and said that according to a Labour party ruling of 1948 he had to oppose the bill in to to. There is no possible explanation of such conduct except that he is trying to protect the Communist party. Those shifts and changes of policy cannot be explained by any other hypothesis. Having said that, let me turn to some of the other arguments that have boon advanced by honourable members opposite against this measure. I think that their falsity can best be seen by having an understanding of a certain basic fact about the Communist party, which, to my mind, is the real thing that differentiates they are designed to deal w it h the kind of it fro m other political parties. The Comresponse which a democracy can make. munist party recognizes this fact as imThe Communists declare themselves free portant, because it has drawn its name of of all democratic and decent ties, but Bolshevik from it . The word "" Bolshethey demand that other people in dealing vik "" means "" m a j o r it y "" and the word with them should put themselves at the "" Menshevik "" means "" minority "". The disadvantage occasioned by those ties. use of those terms arose from the fundaBecause they have this evil self-consciousmental split in the Communist party ness ancl because they have adapted themwhich occurred at the beginning of 1901 selves to the democratic climate and are or 1902. Lenin said that to be a member exploiting it , they are ""successful, and w ill of a Communist party a person had not continue to he successful unless we realist only to subscribe to its doctrines but, also what they are doing and counter it by had to engage in its illegal work and proper and effective measures. belong to one of its organizations. The Mensheviks on the other hand said that peace. Peace is beautiful, but if you are people could be members of tbe Commupeaceful and your neighbour is warlike nist party on the same terms as those voir come off second best. You may hate on which they could be members of any war, but the only way of protecting yourorlier party. On that question tbe Social self from what you hate may be by becomDemocratic party of the day, which ing temporarily adapted to some degree later became the Communist party, split. to your neighbour's warlike practices. It was a vital split and the Communists Otherwise you do not survive. That is the recognize it as such because they drew kind of situation in which we find ourfrom it their distinguishing name of selves to-day. If we must fight always Bolsheviks. Ever since then the Comwith our hands tied by the democratic munist party has partaken of the nature decencies while the Communists have of a conspiracy because its members, the their hands free, we shall give the Bolsheviks, stand in quite a different Communists an advantage of the same relationship on their part, from which kind that has been seized by them in exists among the members of any other other democratic countries and w ill be party and their organization. The Bolshevik is a criminal because he ter it in time. belongs to the Communist party, ancl because the Communist party is organized general objective of the Communist party. as a criminal conspiracy. Being a member I do not agree with some honourable memof the Communist party is itself an overt, bers of this House, both on this and the act of a kind which should be punishable opposite side, who have advanced the proat law. That fact entirely cuts across position that the Communist party is the arguments brought forward by honworking fundamentally for revolution. It orable members opposite to-night. not think that they have realized what fundamental purpose is to disarm us and the matter is all ahout. It is important make us weak for the Russian aggression for them to remember that the Commuwhich is planned.

The Communist party has realized against us, and which w ill come as with great cleverness, that as a criminal soon as Stalin thinks that he has -organization it must learn to adapt itself to and thing that can keep us from war is take -democracy. Its tactics are not in vacuo; in war. That is strength. ""Weakness not The whole matter can be compared with seized here ancl elsewhere unless we counMy other point has relation to the I do is working incidentally for revolution. It s event that gave maturity a revolution in Australia, which was B r it a in or America. It is using the Its main incipient revolution in order to weaken existing in a democracy a chance of winning. The only advantage of , the forms of the same thing which w ill give us victory only makes war certain but it makes defeat certain also. Tbat is tbe borse that local Communist parties in Australia and in all other democracies are riding at this moment. They want to confuse our preparations and take our minds off strength. They want to raise up local problems ancl disturbances so that we in the free world will f a l l victims to the planned Russian aggression. Therefore the measures tliat we have to take must be adapted to the Communist plans. I do not believe that we can afford to leave even a small fraction of 1 per cent, of enemies in our midst. Earlier to-dav the honourable member for East Sydney gave a very low estimate of the strength of the local Communist vote at genera' elections. His estimate is not the s>n>'as the estimate given by tbe late Mr Chifley on the 9th May, 1950. at page 226S of Hansard of that date. ' The, lato Mr Chifley's estimate as shown there was over 80,000, and I suggest that, his figures wore, more accurate than those of the honourable member for East Sydney. However, whether there are 80,000 or 10,000 Communists in Australia, they are still a. small fraction of the people. But if war is the Soviet objective, and not revolution then even a small fraction can be fatal to Australia, find we must get rid of them. A f t e r having listened to the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr ""Wentworth), I rise w i th some pleasure to oppose this bill. A f t e r hearing his speech, I realize the dangers that the power latent in this bill would be in the hands of a government . which numbered tbe honourable gentleman among its members. His speech was a clear indication of the dangers that Australia is, likely to face if the Constitution is altered in the way contemplated by this bill. I have listened to the venom that has boon poured for t h by the honourable member ever since he came to this Hou e. He has indulged in a ? smear campaign, apparently acquiesced in by the Government, against the most honoured members of the Opposition. I do not believe that the honourable member who has carried out this campaign for a number of years bas a reputation of the highest character able member's reputation is not under discussion. ruling on that matter, Mr Speaker, because I.believe that, later on the subject can be dealt with by the honourable members who fro m time to time have been attacked by the honourable member for Mackellar. I oppose this bill, which envisages the destruction of every vestige of British justice, f t has been said that t in passing of this bill will help to rid Australia of the menace of communism which is supposed to be the reason for all our economic ills. Since this Government has been in office we have heard nothing but talk and excuses from it. It is about time that the Government accepted the responsibility for inflation, shortages ancl the black market, ancl tried to do something about them. If these problems were tackled, discontent ancl unrest in industry might cease. This Government has done nothing but throw the responsibility on the Communist party. For eighteen months now the Communist party has been blamed for all our economic troubles. Moreover, the Government has attacked many leaders of the Labour party. It is not my purpose to defend the Leader of the Opposition ( D r . E v a t t ) , but it is fitting for me to say that this great world figure who has been president of the United Nations and who has shown throughout his life that he is a. fighter against all forms of injustice, will be revered in this country when his attackers have long been forgotten. The honourable member for Bass (Mr. Kekwick) made an attack upon Mr Nehru and called him a Communist. That shows to what, lengths honourable members on the Government side will go in 'this debate in attacking any person who is not a member of the Liberal party. I suggest that the great menace facing Australia, at present is intolerance on the part of the Government. When the people are asked to alter the Constitution in the near future all the statements of the Government in its smear campaign will be taken into consideration and I have no doubt that they w ill bring about the defeat of the projected referendum.

179,Mr Fitzgerald,"I accept yourcommunism has been stated frequently in this debate. Labour regards communism as evil and anti-Australian. It has always regarded it in that light and has always fought it. Labour is the only political body that has fought communism in and out of season. Labour recognizes (hat it has more to lose by Communist progress than has any other organization in Australia because the history of communism has shown that where the Communists take charge the first to be sought out for massacre arc members of the Labour or social democratic parties. Unlike tbe Government parties we have no political self-seekers. Among honourable members on the Government side there are self-seekers in the political field, and as such, they AVOUICI line themselves up with the 'Communists if that party should ever gain power. I have no illusions about the young men on the Government side who have recently come into this Parliament. They would have no scruples about going over to the Communists if that party were to take charge in Australia. They would not worry about what political tag was attached to them so long as they had the power. The Labour movement is not concerned with what the Government does in regard to communism, because we have fought it for a. long time. The platform, of the Labour party prevents -Communists from being members of it. That provision has been in the platform for decades. Honourable members should consider the battles that are now being waged by industrial groups of the Labour party against the infiltration of communism into the unions. T challenge the Government to show that it bas taken any action to combat Communist leadership in the trade union movement. In fact the record shows that the Government has allied itself with a Communist who was fighting against Australian. Labour party industrial groups. The Liberal party soles-ted a. candidate, for a State electorate which lies within my federal electorate, and owing to statements made by the Labour party it withdrew his candidature before election clay. The Labour party charged this man with being lined up with the Communists against whom the Australian Labour party groups were fighting. the Painters Union in Sydney. He was selected for candidature at the last State general election. If any honourable member d.esires to check my statement in that regard he will find that it is quite correct. The Sydney Morning Herald of the 6th July contained a report of gains made by Australian Labour party candidates in elections for officers of the Waterside Workers' Federation. The report stated that in the Brisbane branch of the federation, ten Australian Labour party candidates had been successful, and that in the Wollongong Branch, Australian Labour party candidates had been elected as president, secretary and assistant secretary. In all branches of the Waterside Workers' Federation and other trade unions the Australian Labour party is waging a relentless fight against Communist infiltration. Attacks have been made upon the Attorney-General of New South Wales in this Parliament, but not much publicity was given to the fight that he waged recently against the leaders of the Federated Iron workers' Association of Australia on behalf of Mr Short, Labour's foremost exponent in that union. It is to be hoped that in the near future Mr Short will assume -the leadership of that organization. Much has been said in the course of this debate about the alleged inconsistency of the Labour party in relation to this bill. According to a newspaper report of the 24th May, 1950, the. honourable member for Henty( Mr Gullett) said, on the previous day, that one provision of the Communist Party Dissolution Bill was, in a sense, a negation of fundamental British justice, and that the Opposition's objection to clause 9 of that measure was by no means weak. I am certain that, if the honourable gentleman takes part in this debate, he will repeat those remarks. Communism has been the subject of almost unprecendented hysteria and hypocrisy. For the last eighteen months, the Government has been talking of its inability effectively to deal with Communists in this country, but it has had, and still has, ample power to proceed against them. Section 24 of the Crimes Act provides that any person who assists by any means whatever any public enemy shall be guilty of an That man belonged to indictable offence and liable to the punishment of death.

When the Communist Party Dissoluthis measure. tion Bill was before the Parliament some time ago, our esteemed late leader, MrI t seems to have escaped the notice of Chifley, made a statement upon it which honourable gentlemen opposite that this is is worthy of repetition. I endorse it a bill for a referendum to give additional fully. It was as follows:I am tlie descendant of a race that fought heard members of the Opposition suggest a long and bitter fight against murderers., in the past that the Commonwealth should pimps and liars and I would he ashamed to not be given additional powers.

This bill could affect ordinary people who may be scatterbrains or foolish or reckless in their words but who have no association with communism. or militants. of the Ministers in the present Government the nower to judge any unionists about There are four or five members in this Government whose utterances show that they not only hate trades unionists rFsocinted with trade unions.

I turn now to the arguments that were advanced against .this measure by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) . The words "" contrary to the principles of British justice"" have fallen frequently from the lips of members of the Opposition who have gone as far as to suggest that any action taken against Communists and communism w ill be a denial of fundamental human rights. Tbe Leader of the Opposition, quite rightly, directed the attention of the House to the fact that in British countries we do not preach fundamental human rights to the same degree as do other countries. For example, we have not written into our Constitution anything like the AmericanB ill of Eights. That is a very important matter. One source of the strength of a democracy is its ability to distinguish between times of national crisis and times when ordinary democratic freedom may be allowed to operate. The preservation of our fundamental human rights depends upon our ability to take strong action to defend them .at certain times. That elasticity has preserved in Great Britain the idea that in times of crisis the country will take very strong action which would he regarded in normal times as being tyrannical and that when normal times return the country will revert to . the ordinary rule of law. There can be no doubt that at present we are confronted with a world crisis and that the times are insecure. The ""Government is not endeavouring to stampede the people into hysteria. The ordinary citizen in Great Britain and the United States of Not one argument -has been -in the present world situation is that The Australian Government has against us must be removed. In other words, we are confronted with a. crisis and action must be taken to defend the democratic system of government in which we believe. In times of crisis it has been the habit of British countries and countries that have adopted the principles of British justice and democracy to suspend the ordinary rights of the individual in order to ensure that in the long run those rights shall be preserved. That has happened on many occasions in British history. For instance, from .1.794 to I SOI the Habeas Corpus Act was suspended annually in England. It. was suspended in 1817 and again in 1S66. 1 remind honourable members of the classic examples of the Defence of Realm Act that, was passed in Englandi n 1914 and the Emergency Powers Act that was passed in that country in 1939. passed in times of peace. Mi-. FREETH T h a t is not correct. England was at peace in 1S17 and in 1S66. Under the stress of national emergency a parliament will permit the executive to assume powers which abrogate the strongest protection that can be afforded to the subject against arbitrary .'iction on the part, of the executive. I shall now turn to conditions in the United States of America. The case for the individual in that country is much stronger than it is in other countries because a declaration of certain fundamental rights is written",102,Government Supporters Hear
181,,Mr WABD -What does the honourable,103,Government Supporters Hear
182,Mr Freeth,Does it matter very America would be the first to recognize,103,Government Supporters Hear
183,Mr Wakd,"Such measures were not-into the American Constitution. Yet, without any express abrogation of those rights, which could not be done without an alteration of the Constitution, American courts have held that in a time of clear and present danger to the country those rights must be superseded by na'tional necessity. If honourable members are reasonable and honest they will admit that in the world to-day communism as such presents a clear and present danger. Strangely enough action that has been taken against Communists in the United States of America has been along lines almost parallel with that which the Australian Government now proposes to take. In. the United States of America action has been taken against Communists in the civil service and m trade unions. It is well known that very strong steps have been taken to remove all Communists from the civil service in Great Britain without the passing of any act of parliament. It is only logical that the least step that can be taken in the interests of national security, if we admit that there is a crisis to-day, is to remove Communists from the Public Service and from positions in which they are likely to do harm to national security before they actually do it. The Leader of the Opposition had recourse to history when he was defending fundamental principles of British justice. Let us look at countries which have fallen victims to communism, such as Hungary and Czechoslovakia. Czechoslovakia, had one of the most democratic regimes in Western Europe. Yet it fell a victim to communism largely because of its tolerance of those ideas which the Leader of the Opposition wishes to uphold at all costs, even at the cost of national destruction. The right honourable gentleman referred also to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that was made by the United Nations in 1948. Article 19 of that declaration readsEvery one has the right to freedom of expression and opinion. That sounds fair enough. Article 20 readsEvery one has the right to freedom of peaceof those facts. Yet, strangely enough, ful assembly and association. We can have no objection to that. But Article 30 of that declaration imposes a Ifr. Frcetli. very strong limitation in respect of all the human rights for which it makes provision. That Article readsNothing in this Declaration may be interpreted as implying for any state or group or person any right to engage in any activity or perform any act aimed at the destruction of any of the rights and freedoms set forth herein. That means that, if Communists by their activities, whether those activities be legal or otherwise, aim at the destruction of the State, they cannot claim for themselves under that declaration the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association or the right to freedom of expression and opinion. The question remains whether the Communists aim at the destruction of these human rights. It is significant that of the nations that compose the United Nations organization, only eight abstained, from approving of that declaration. Those eight countries were Soviet Russia and its satellites, whose' agents are now planning the destruction of such rights in this country. Unfortunately, this debate has disclosed a wide divergence of opinion between the Government parties and the Opposition with respect to the urgency of the situation that confronts us. I do not imagine that if we were in the days of 1939-40, and active Nazis were known to occupy positions in the Public Service, honourable members opposite would protest against their removal from such jobs or from official positions in trade unions, because at that time we were actually at war with Nazi Germany. The only point of difference between the Government parties and the Opposition in this matter relates to the degree of our present peril. It would appear, therefore, that we must concentrate upon impressing upon honourable members opposite that there is a crisis in the world, that there is a danger to Australia from communism and that Communists inside Australia are working for the destruction of this country in obedience to orders from Communist Russia. I doubt whether honourable members opposite would dispute any they still refuse to believe that there is danger to this country from communism. Under the Communist Party Dissolution Act; which will become law if the people approve of the Government's proposals at tlie forthcoming referendum, no question really arises with respect to the guilt, the innocence, or the punishment of any person. The only question involved is, what minimum steps should be taken for the security of the Government of the -country in its public service and essential services through tbe trade unions? Those minimum steps the Government proposes to take. All the talk that we have lieard from honourable members opposite -about persons being condemned without a trial is so much nonsense because no. -question of the guilt, or innocence, of any person is involved. Tbe only matter that has to be considered is the security of the -country. The Leader of the Opposition made a wonderful claim on behalf of the Australian Labour party when he said that that party permits freedom of expression to all its members. I should be very interested to hear from the honourable ""member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell), who is on record as having said that if he had his way he would put all 'Communists into a. concentration camp. I should also be interested to hear what the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Keon) -and the honourable member for Perth( Mr hostile threat. If Opposition members Tom Burke) really think on this matter. Does the freedom of expression that the 'Leader of the Opposition claims to be the right of all members of the Australian labour party permit such honourable members to give to the House their views on this measure? It is well known that the ""honourable member for Perth is anxious that the Government's proposals shall be approved at the forthcoming referendum. Mr ""WARD -That is not true. 'but the honourable member for Perth has nt least adopted a very peculiar attitude towards the federal executive of the Australian Labour party with respect to this -subject. His course of action during the last twelve months has been that of one -who wishes the referendum to be carried. Of course, although the Labour party allows its members freedom of expression, -they may not vote according to their consciences. This British justice and these --lemocratic principles about which the Leader of the Opposition has spoken' do not apply to the Labour party because its constitution provides thatOn all questions affecting the members of the Federal Parliamentary Labour party the decision of the Federal conference shall be final. Pending consideration by the Federal conference, the ruling of the Federal executive shall be binding. How are the honourable member for Perth( Mr Tom Burke) and the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Keon) to oppose the referendum? Are they to tell the people in their electorates, "" We personally are allowed perfect freedom of expression in the Labour party, and we believe that the referendum should be carried; but the Labour executive tells us that it should not be carried. We do not like to do so but we have to tell you to vote ' No ' "" . Is that the kind of fight that they will be required to make? It would certainly be the truthful one, as Opposition members cannot deny. That the Government -should have power to deal with Communists and communism is clear and indisputable. Regardless of the present crisis, all honourable members would think that, as a necessary part of the defence of the country, this Parliament should have power to deal with any can pretend to the people that communism does not present a hostile threat to world peace to-day, I shall be astonished to hear their speeches in justification of their attitude. Yet they propose to advise the people to refuse to grant to this Parliament the right to deal with that threat. I do not believe that the people will give them much of a hearing on that issue. They will not listen to that kind of argument. gentleman's definition of "" Communist "" ? give a definition of "" Communist"" at the moment.
