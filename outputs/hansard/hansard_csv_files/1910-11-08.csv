If so, why are new poles being erected in Little Collins and William streets? 7. If the reason is that they are to take the place of condemned posts, how is it that the condemned poles still carry the wires, although the new poles have been in position since February and March last? 8. If these ""condemned"" poles have stood the strain for eight months, could they not remain in position until the wires have been undergrounded and all poles have been removed ? 9. When will the undergrounding in the Little Collins-street-William-street section be completed, and when will the Lonsdale-street Exchange be opened ? tion has been furnished by the Deputy Postmaster-General, Melbourne, and the Chief Electrical Engineer:1 and 2. No ; but second questions be answered in that way? of the Postmaster-General the answers supplied to the honourable member's questions. As the honourable member is aware, the Postmaster-General is not well, and asked me to read the replies to the questions put by him. If the honourable member is not satisfied I cannot help it. The answers are as follow:1 and 2. No, but about 2,000 spindles to fit a new pattern of telephone insulator were ordered and used with some of the new insulators. The cost of these spindles was ^29 3s. 4a., but they were all used with the new insulators, and there was no extra cost. 3. The local manufacturer would have to alter his die to the new thread, but it was a small matter and did not affect the cost. 4. The threads on some of the spindles in use in Victoria and New South Wales had to be reduced to fit insulators recently received. These insulators were ordered in pursuance of the policy which has been followed for some time past of endeavouring .to standardize material in use throughout the Commonwealth, many different types of insulators and spindles having previously been in use in the various States. 5. It is a fact that telephone wires are being placed underground in Little Collins-street, Flinders-lane, and William-street. 6. The new poles are being erected in Little Collins and William streets to maintain existing services until the underground services are available. 7. The wires will be removed to the new poles as soon as men can be spared to make the transfers, which takes some time. 8. It would not be safe for the condemned poles to remain in position until the wires have been placed underground. 9. The tunnels and conduits in Little Collins and William streets section are finished. The cable is being drawn in and jointed, distribution being made to the blocks as rapidly as possible, but this is a laborious and intricate business. It is hoped to transfer the City Exchange to the Lonsdale-street building about July or August, 1911. ternal Affairs read the following paragraph, which appeared in the London letter of a recent issue of the Melbourne HeraldLondon, 7th October -There seems to be scant hope of making up for the failure to secure sufficient accommodation on outgoing liners for settlers under the Mead scheme. Matters in that respect remain much as they were last week. The suggestion has been put forward that if British liners cannot accommodate even one-half the intending settlers who are desirous of leaving here in the course of the next five months, recourse should be had to some other means of getting away the overflow. So far as I can find out, no attempt has been made to arrange with either the Messageries Maritimes or the Norddeutscher Lloyd Companies to take some of the people out on a basis similar to that existing with the Orient and otheT companies. Can the Minister say whether it is true that the British liners cannot accommodateeven half of those who wish to leave the United Kingdom to settle in Australia, and, if so, will he, before spending more money on advertising in Great Britain with a view to attracting immigrants, see that adequate accommodation is provided for those who have already made up their, minds to come here? paragraph referred to, and am surprised that official representations have not been made by the States on the subject of passenger accommodation. If the services of the High Commissioner and our officers in London can be used to improve matters, they will be at the disposal of the States, as I think it desirable that every opportunity should be given to enable those who desire to come here to get here with the least trouble. asked the Acting Prime Minister if his attention had been drawn to the following paragraph, published in that morning'sArgusThe Premier( Mr Verran) intimated in the House of Assembly to-day that on Tuesday he would ask for leave to introduce a B i ll to authorize the construction of weirs, dams, and locks, and other works on the Murray River for navigation and irrigation, and for other purposes.

Will he, in the interests of freedom of trade between the States, take steps to bring about uniformity of wharfage dues throughout the Commonwealth? mitted to me, I shall be delighted to see that whatever the Commonwealth can do to make the fees uniform is done.

A little while ago he told us that he would make the big business man sit up. representing the honourable member, though those are not his exact words. He said that he would make him pay up. Now he is ranging himself on the side of the individualist. I hope that he will remember these statements when he is next inclined to preach Socialism. He will have to tell the people that his Socialistic practice was promotion according to merit and individual fitness, and administration upon a purely individualistic system, the public -services being required to pay. I congratulate the honourable member for Eden Monaro on seeing the Bill introduced, and I acknowledge the work which he did for years in endeavouring to have this reform put on the statute-book. In my judgment, the estimate of loss is greatly exaggerated. see that all the States are put on exactly no loss; we shall merely refuse to take so -much money out of the pockets of the -people. estimates of this kind are, perhaps wisely, conservative, and, like many others, will probably be falsified in practice.

I propose to go into a little piece of ancient history regarding the introduction of penny postage in Victoria. When the Victorian Parliament .realized that Federation was coming, it deliberately reduced the rates of postage within the borders of that State to one penny, thinking that the people of Australia would have to bear the cost involved thereby. Having done that, however, they woke up, after Federation, to the fact that whatever departmental revenue Victoria lost as a State through carrying its own letters cheaper than those of the rest of Australia were carried, it would have to make up itself. the same basis after the ist January, because after that date whatever loss is made by the Department through carrying only Victorian letters for one penny will be",21,Chapman On E Of Its States According To The Present Chair

In ciated with this proposition;, but these have already been dealt with by my friend and late colleague, the honourable member for Bendigo, and I certainly should not dream of repeating them. The financial considerations have to be weighed, and I think they have been well weighed; but on the whole it is sufficient to point out the world's experience in relation to changes of this character. Although the initiation of penny postage on ist January next Will necessarily involve an increase of the preState Governments were opposed to a resent deficit in the working of the postal service, after all, that is but one, and by no means a major, consideration. With the progress we are making, and particularly with the progress of settlement r to which we are anxiously looking forward, we must remember that there are few greater agencies in encouraging the enterprising to venture out back than the possibilities of communication now afforded by the postal and telegraph services. that the post and telegraph system is not to be crippled in any respect in consequence of this change. the assurance of the Minister to the contrary; and I hope that the greater tide of business which must inevitably accrue will improve existing channels, and that a proportion of the cost of the new system will not be extra cost, so largely will it be covered by our capacity to do more business over a greater area of Australia. hard-worked pioneer of the back blocks, whose position, under all circumstances, is arduous, and, under some circumstances, almost unbearable, the fact that the post and telegraph, and, if possible, the telephone, systems are brought within reasonable reach of his holding at cheap rates, is one of the greatest encouragements to him to hold on. also keeps him in touch with market operations, which' are often extremely material. But I do not propose to repeat a series of reflections which are familiar to us all. I have only to congratulate the Postmaster-General on having paired in favour of the original proposition in 1006, and on now being in the fortunate position of submitting it to a more willing House -no t only to a more willing House, but in proposing it at a period in which, as he himself has said, our national circumI do not stances have entirely altered. There is no 1906-7, in view of the financial burdens then imposed on us, and the limited outlook in the way of receipts, honourable members hesitated to commit themselves.

So far from having I , for one, am glad to know weakened in our faith, each year's experience has strengthened our confidence in the response which the public will We have make to proposals for the extension of postal facilities.

While telephone and telegraph communication cannot be extended as quickly as postal services, every decade, ancl, indeed, every quinquennium, should witness their development and the closer bringing together of the peoples scattered over this vast continent. listening to the honourable member for Ballarat coining nice-sounding phrases, with a charm of manner which seems to insure their reception, I almost regret that there is not a penalty attached to the practice .similar to that attached to the coining of counterfeit money. We are informed that the proposed change in the postal rates is necessary to effect the "" unity of Australia,"" which will be a name only until we have uniform penny' postage. I have heard the phrase employed before in other connexions; but when the proposal before us has been adopted, the "" unity of Australia "" will have been finally achieved. It is alleged that our finances permit of. what is proposed being done. I would remind the honourable member for Ballarat that the ""unity of Australia,"" by means of the reduction of postal rates was not made an important part of the programme of the last Ministry, whose proposals were chiefly for disuniting Australia, and making the Commonwealth Parliament subservient to those of the States. When the unfortunate employees of the Postmaster-General, who are to-day wretchedly underpaid and shockingly overworked, call attention to their condition, they will be fold that the "" unity of Australia "" requires that no change shall be made. When the employee at £ 2 2s. a week, who is struggling hard to keep a -wife and family, is called upon to work two or three hours a day overtime, and his wife asks him, "" Why have you to do this without extra pay?"" he will have as his answer, ' ' The unity of Australia requires it .

When a mail service costing '£100 is asked for, and the departmental estimate of revenue is only £ 8 0 , the invariable reply is that the service cannot be established. But we are going to give to those in the city and the large towns benefits which we deny to those in the country. We cannot find the money for postal, telegraphic, and telephonic services, for the benefit of the cream of our population, the men whom we should assist almost at any cost, because it is they who are opening up the country; but we are able to make a costly present to a few merchants in the cities. When country districts ask for telemeasure. phone connexions, they are told that they must give a guarantee of 5 per cent, on the outlay. not given after the guarantee has been provided for. subscribed, and is in the hands of the postal authorities for months before anything is done. The city merchants are not asked to guarantee the loss consequent upon the proposed reduction of postage rates. The Minister proposes a step which will cost the Department £400.000 a year. below the mark. No guarantee is asked for. I place on record my opinion that this proposal is equivalent to the increasing of dividends at the expense of employees. If a private company proposed anything of the kind, the Postmaster-General and others would be up in arms denouncing it as a wrong, and I have never understood why the Public Service should be less well conducted than private employment. If we have some thousands of pounds to spare, we should use the money, not to gild the apex of the commercial and social pyramid, but to strengthen its foundations. The structure is more likely to stand if the foundation is good. It is the men, women, boys, and girls employed in the Department who constitute the foundation on which this superstructure rests; it is on their efforts that success largely depends. Parliament will not do its duty if it does not treat them as reasonably as the finances will permit. I submit to honourable members opposite, who are almost unanimous in support of the proposal are not supporting it. I submit to them that, apart from the minimum wage provision, the employees in our postal service have been unfairly treated ever since Federation. Over £6,000,000, which should have been expended in putting the Department on a proper footing, was handed back .to the States. member should try to convert those of his own side. supporter of the Bill on this side other than a Minister. Labour party will come in and vote for the that is so. The honourable member suggests that they vote in accordance with conclusions arrived at outside, not listening to the opinions expressed here. But I protested against the measure directly it was placed on the table, speaking against the proposal on a. grievance motion, and I again take exception to it in the peculiar circumstances in which we are placed. Until those circumstances are altered, and justice is done to the whole of the Postal Service, it seems to me that we are not doing right in proposing the reduction of the postal rates. A duty devolves upon the House of seeing that the employees, who owe their allegiance to Parliament, and, through Parliament, to the people, are not unfairly treated. For years back they have been told that ""the finances will not permit."" That has been the stock argument. They have been told in some cases that the Public Service Commissioner would not permit certain unjust conditions to be altered. They have been met with all manner of excuses from Deputy Postmasters-General, Public Service Inspectors, and the hundred and one other persons who, unfortunately, come between the individual who is doing the work and.the last responsible official. Now, apparently, thefinancesdo permit of proper wages being paid, but the very first proposal of the Government is, not to do justice to those who have justifiably complained for many years, but to make a present to a small section of the community who are really not asking for it, because they know in their hearts that it is not. in Ihe circumstances, a fair or honourable thing lo ask for.

I do not wish to go into the details of the Commission's report, for I understand the honourable member for Gwydir, who is thoroughly conversant with all the facts relating to the inquiry, intends to speak to the motion. When we examine the recommendations of the Commission, we find that, in regard to items 1 that ought to be attended to immediately, ""there is a distressing silence. The Commission recommended "" That leave in lieu It points out innumerable of overtime be abolished, and that overtime be paid for.""

236,Mr Roberts,"Thes e are abuses,life is the fact that we are apt to find a Parliament unanimously of opinion that a particular system ought to be abolished, or some work carried out, yet that system is not abolished, and that work is not carried out. We who talk about "" the unity of Australia "" are prepared to throw thousands of pounds into the laps of a few merchants who have already been surfeited with benefits under the Federal Postal Service-benefits far in excess of those which they received when the service was under State control-and yet another sop is to be thrown at them. The majority of the people do not care two straws whether they have to use a penny or a two-penny stamp. What cares the ordinary individual about a penny or a two-penny stamp? What benefit will this reduction be to the average man so far as it will represent an increase of his wages during the next twelve months? It will not mean to him a saving of 6d. per annum, and, in dealing with his correspondence, he thinks no more of a two-penny stamp than he would of a penny stamp. The honourable member for Gwydir suggests to me the question, "" Of what advantage is penny postage to individuals in country districts, who have no postal service-who can -obtain neither a post-office nor a mail?"" question be asked. Others, as theresult of this reduction, will be able to read the charming speeches of the honourable member for Ballarat, the eulogies of the Postmaster-General, and the addresses of the ex-Postmaster-General, who, when referring to the welfare of the farming community a few days ago, strained himself to such an extent that I had fears about his physical condition. The farming community are deeply interested in this matter; for, although the average farmer has not a voluminous correspondence, he has an interest in securing some sort of postal service. He desires occasionally to write and post a letter, if only to check the city agent who is overcharging him for his agricultural implements, or to deal with other, matters. postage to him if his mail service is limited, man in the postal service happens to and what after all is penny postage to the average citizen? The average man cares little or nothing for it. It will mean, however, an additional benefit to a small section of the community who, as I have said, have already been surfeited with benefits under the Federal postal system. the telegraphic rates to the benefit of the Mr Roberts. commercial element of the community, but the average citizen has not gained by the reduction to the extent of a snap of the fingers. We have facilitated the transmission of newspapers through the post, which has been an advantage to newspaper proprietors, although of little benefit to the people generally. It has certainly assisted some people to disseminate views which might as well have been kept in the background, and has helped a certain section of the community, but the bulk of the people have received no material benefit from it. The commercial classes have enjoyed the use of the telephone services for a number of years at an enormous loss to the country. It has been a case of "" Dividends, dividends, dividends "" to a small section of the community, and now we have a proposal to add still further dividends to their lists-and dividends which, from my point of view, will be paid at the expense of individuals doing the work of the Postmaster-General's Department. It seems to me that under these circumstances honourable members, on this side of the House in particular, will be only doing a fair thing if they object to this Bill until we have pertaining to the service a more just system than we have at present. I shall Well may the not go into further detail in regard to the recommendations of the Postal Commission, but there are one or two more to which 1 should like to refer. For instance, the Commission recommend that "" overtime be abolished except in special circumstances, and that overtime now due be paid for."" There we have proof positive that this Parliament, as the manager responsible to the people, owes money to the underpaid employees of the postal service. I know of no proposal to carry out that recommendation; but we are going to give the merchants of one or two cities a reduction amounting to a few hundred pounds per annum per firm in respect of the cost of their postal service. Here is a recommendation to which I must draw attention"" That tea money be abolished and But of what use is penny extra services be paid for."" If a be receiving about £400 a year, he receives something like 3s. for tea money when he has to work overtime; but if he is getting about £110 per'annum he is given is. for tea money. If you are a £400 per annum man you can have a first-rate dinner, and possibly a small bottle of wine; but if you We have reduced happen to be one of the rank and file receiving only £110 per annum, you must battle somewhere with your ninepence or shilling and get the best you can for the money. I have complaints at the present time to put before the Postmaster-General to the effect that, although the regulations provide that if a man is called back to work two hours' overtime tea money shall be paid to him, there are persons in authority who deliberately refuse in certain cases to carry out that provision; but who never fail to observe it in the case of those higher in authority. There are other recommendations by the Postal Commission to which attention might well be given. The Commission recommends, for instance, that linemen's travelling allowances be increased, and that officers performing work of higher grades be paid the salary attached to higher grades if so employed for three months or more. There is also a recommendation relating to the provision of telephone and postal services in country districts. It seems to me that if we are to be just before we are generous we must first of all meet these demands ; but there is. no indication of the intentions of the Government with respect to these recommendations. We are to put the system of penny postage into operation for the sake of the "" unity of Australia !"" I hope that it is clearly on record that I shall vote deliberately against this Bill. <i'i opinion that the Ministry have not done right in bringing it forward in the present -circumstances. if they had had regard to many of the recommendations of the Postal Commission 'before seeking to give effect to this scheme. We shall not necessarily secure progress by giving a little more to those who have already been surfeited; but we shall secure progress-and progress of a more just and honourable character-if we consider the wants of those who have been wilfullyoverlooked in some instances to-day when the finances of the country permit of justice being done to them. -This is an unfortunate time at which to introduce the Bill now before us, and it seems to me that this and other measures with which we are now asked to deal should not be considered until the Budget has been dealt with.

The present Postmaster-General and an ex-Postmaster-General both admit that there must be a loss of revenue to start with, though they contend that it will be recovered in three or four years.

Honourable members will agree that great ability has been displayed by the Commission in the preparation of its report; and I hope we shall soon have an opportunity of dealing with it. The report is concise and clear, and contains a great number of recommendations which must commend themselves to honourable members. It indicates that much remains to be done to place the Department on an effective working basis. An outstanding feature of the report is the fact that the expenditure of the Department must be very materially increased. Complaint is made that owing to lack of funds overtime cannot be paid. I recognise, however, that there has been a big advance in the provision made for the wants of the Department, and I am not complaining of the present Postmaster-General. grievances in my electorate have been redressed, but there is so much yet to be done in connection with the Department that a lot more money will have to be expended upon it. We can never have efficiency unless we have justice to the workers in the Department. Sir have £3,500,000 more in respect of the present financial year than we had last year. required to provide for the Western Australian transcontinental railway. we are confronted by the fact that a large additional expenditure is required to place the Post and Telegraph Department on a better footing. The loss incidental to the introduction of penny postage will be insignificant in comparison with that larger sum, shown some courage, if not audacity, in introducing this measure at the presentstage. certain degree of sentiment as well as of practicability associated with this proposal. Penny postage prevails within certain areas in some of the States, and thousands of people in sending letters to Inter-State addresses overlook the fact that a twopenny stamp is necessary, with the result that the addresses are surcharged. It is time that we had uniformity of postage rates. Parliament is responsible for the gard to the postage on magazines. otherwise. My only desire is that the back country people who have suffered so much shall receive a better service. .Residents of sparsely populated districts, in my electorate, have obtained some relief from the present Postmaster-General, who knows the circumstances in which they are placed, but a great deal more remains to be done. I wish now to refer to the contract and allowance offices which constitute one of the most difficult sections of the Department to handle. In places where there are only a few residents, some one is usually willing to act as a postmaster or postmistress on receiving a small allowance, and in that way an allowance office is created. Gradually the business of the office is increased, and, in the past, the Department has been somewhat slow in recognising that increase. The present Postmaster-General, however, Many has recently issued a scale of allowances which must prove very useful. Prior to the issue of that statement many persons in charge of allowance offices did not know exactly what they were entitled to receive, and non-complaining people worked, in some cases, for half the remuneration to which they were entitled. Where cases of JOHN FORREST -The Government tbe kind have been brought under my notice 1 have taken care to have the grievance redressed, but with the issue of the scale of allowances every one will know exactly how he stands. These allowance, offices, as I heir business increases, gradually become semi-official, or contract offices. I have been, and am still, opposed to the contract I am pointing out that post-office system, for it certainly is a system of sweating. In some cases the man in charge of a contract office receives £ 1 5 0 per annum, in return for which he has to provide a suitable building for postal business and pay a telegraph messenger, whilst possibly he must also be a telegraphist. and the Postmaster-General has The mntract offices stand in a different position altogether from the official post offices in large towns, for, unless a special One must admit that there is a report is obtained in regard to them, Parliament does not know the true posftlon.

The rule of the Department is to make a contract office an official post-office when its income reaches £400 I am glad that the Postmaster-General recognises that something should be done in this connection. We have no right to ask outside people to give their services unless we pay them a fair and reasonable wage, and such a wage would be better if given to our own trained officers, who have some guarantee of permanence and may look forward to promotion. Many of the outside officials have their own businesses to attend to, and, though some of them are glad of the position at first, they afterwards find the remuneration too small. Indeed, one woman, I understand,"" wrote to the Department declaring that she would close the office on the Monday if she did nof get an increase; and I give her-credit for her courage, under a sense of injustice, in declaring a strike against the whole Federation. In this case the postmistress's house was originally about master-General puts that forward as a the only one in the place, but with a railway in view the population has increased, and there is a probability of officials in such a position being overlooked. by the inspectors, even under the present regulations. I have no doubt, however, that the Department has come to some arrangement with the lady, because she had good grounds for complaint. These matters present a bis problem which will have to be dealt with, I suppose, next session; and I hope the Postmaster-General will give every consideration to the grievances I have brought under his notice. Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 8 p.m. There is no service which enters so closely, into the daily life of the nation and the people as that of the Post Office, and there is no service which we could less dispense with. As a consequence, any proposal to increase postal facilities will, I am sure, all other things being equal, commend itself to honourable members on both' sides. But when the honourable member for Iroduced his Bill in 1906, one of the great pleas he made was the necessity for uniformity ; he considered that, in a country like this, there should not be those anomalous conditions which we know to exist in different parts of Australia. If the case for uniformity was good in 1906, I believe there are much more weighty reasons now in its favour. Up to the end of this year the Braddon section and the bookkeeping sections continue to operate in such per aimum. a way that each State pays for the peculiar facilities it enjoys in its postal service. Victoria, under those sections, simply pays for the advantage she enjoys j and in the same way New South Wales, which has penny postage in the principal centres of population, pays in her return of Customs and Excise revenue. At the end of this year those sections cease to operate; indeed, to all intents and purposes they are non-existent to-day, though they nominally operate up to the end of December. It will be seen, therefore, that the conditions which are now anomalous will then become doubly so; and New South Wales, South Australia, Queensland, Tasmania, and Western Australia, will immediately begin to pay for the facilities which Victoria enjoys in the way of penny postage. It becomes absolutely necessary that there should be uniformity; and if the Postreason for the introduction of this measure at the present time, he must see that the measure ought to operate from the ist January. i=; practically finished to-day. finished, but it nominally runs to the end of December. If there be any force in that aigument at all, it is only an argument that the Bill should have been introduced earlier, and that there should not be the delay of a single day in its coming into operation.

That, however, does not refute my contention that, inasmuch as the bookkeeping provisions nominally run to the 31st December, from lhat date onwards there should be uniform postal rates throughout Australia. The question now arises whether the rate should be i d . or 2d.; and to-day three objections have been urged very strongly against the former. The first objection is that a penny rate will afford additional facilities to large business men, and practically put money into their pockets. To a very great extent, however, that has already happened under the present system. In the large centres there is penny postage now; and I should say that the bulk of the correspondence of business men is in the cities. As'a consequence, business men are already reaping tliose benefits which some honourable members opposite, notably the honourable member for Adelaide, have said they will reap from the introduction of this Bill. is not so in Soutli Australia, though I do not know as to other States. Australia there is penny postage in the large cities. objection, I would point out that the country people, to whom the facility of penny postage has not been extended in the past, have simply been paying more than their fair share towards the postal rates. lities. pect the same facilities, being thoroughly reasonable in the requests which they make, and I have not met a case in which there were not reasonable grounds for the request made. Another objection urged against the measure is that the officers of the Department are underpaid. I do not think that there can be the slightest doubt that the service is underpaid, overworked, and undermanned. In nearly every large office men are working overtime, and unable to get payment for it. This overtime amounts in some cases to hundreds of hours. It is necessary that the staff should be thoroughly re-organized, and the salaries subjected to the closest review, so that the administration may be placed on a better footing. But the case of the permanent officers is not so bad as the position of those in charge of semi-official and allowance post-offices'.. I received to-day a letter from the postmistress at Cudgen, on the Tweed River, in which she says that she is in charge of an allowance office, containing a branch of the Government Savings Bank. She attends to ordinary postal business, issues money orders, pays old-age pensions, and looks after the public telephone and subscribers' telephones. According to the latest official figures obtainable, the departmental report for 1908, the articles posted and received in that yeai -letters , newspapers, packets, and parcels -numbere d 33,651, while 2,432 mails were received, and the same number despatched. The telegrams received and despatched numbered 1,222 ; the value of the money order and postal notes issued and paid was £1,280; and the paynients into and from Savings Bank accounts amounted to £2,092. Thus over £3,400 was handled, in addition to the money received on account of' stamps and telegrams, and the payments made in respect of old-age pensions. I know from personal acquaintance with the district that there has been an immense advance during the past two years, so that the business of the office must now be much greater than it was in 1.908; yet the postmistress receives only 13s. 8d. a week. She handles over 100 postal articles every day, despatches eight mails, receives and sends four telegrams, attends to the Savings Bank business and the issue of money orders, and gets only 13s. 8d. a week. been in existence? 2s. a day; which is about what would be given in Java.

What possible help is it to settlers who go, in the first instance, back into the bush as those men have done, and who are all poor struggling men, to tell them that they may have the privilege of putting Up 30 miles of telephone line? It simply means that there is not the slightest hope of their getting telephone facilities. It is absolutely necessary that we should get rid of the anomalous condition of affairs existing at present in regard, to postal rates, and bring about uniformity. I believe that can be done without interfering with the facilities which the country people have enjoyed up to the present, or preventing them from getting increased facilities in the future. The responsibility of financing the proposal rests with the .Govermnent. I only hope they will recognise the absolute necessity of meeting the evils in connection with their staff, not only permanent employees, but more particularly the allowance and semi official officers, who are paid, at present, on a basis that calls for the most drastic remedy. It is a great pity that this measure has not been introduced side by side with a scheme of reform of the post and telegraph service from beginning to end. I believe penny postage would have come in any circumstances sooner or later. It is apparent to all members that it has become necessary to have a uniform rate, and I think that should be a penny rate, but it would have been far better if the Postmaster-General had taken the bull by the horns, and set to work to re-organize the whole of the Department, simply making this reform one of many. Postmaster-General, in introducing this measure, referred to it as one of the greatest achievements that any man could possibly aspire to. with him. I realize that there is a great deal in the argument that to cheapen the means of communication in any country is to assist in educating the people of that country. I also recognise, as the Postmaster-General said, that we are in a peculiar constitutional position on this questered upon his 7A regulation, the Commistion. There are conditions which we in this House had nothing to do with framing, but which must govern our actions ancl those of the Government. The Constitution makes it necessary that, at the termination of the operation of the "" Braddon blot,"" we should seek to bring about uniformity in the charges made for the services rendered by the Commonwealth to the various States. I recognise that as being almost a mandate to this House; but I feel that it is necessary, before entering upon any drastic measure of reform, to at least investigate the position and see how far it is necessary to go constitutionally, or how far it is practical to go from a financial stand-point. The Postal Commission, of which I had the honour to be a member, and to the work of which I have given almost the whole of my time for the last two or three years, went very closely into the matter. We took evidence from every possible and conceivable source with regard to, firstly, the practicability of securing .this reform; secondly, the financial responsibility that would be involved in granting it ; and, thirdly, the possible financial results that would accrue to the Department by its adoption. Having reviewed all these phases of the question, we were forced to the conclusion that we could not recommend the Government, or this Parliament, to grant penny postage in the Commonwealth as a whole until we had set in order the finances of the telegraphic ancl telephonic branches of the Depart-' ment. It is all very well to try to place oneself before the public as a man of great ideas seeking to bring about beneficent changes; but the man who deserves the best gratitude of the public is the man who has the courage to attempt to remove the obstacles that stand in the path before he does something which may put additional obstacles in the way of the administration of his Department. VVe, therefore, said that only when the telephonic and telegraphic branches of the Department were placed upon a paying basis could we recommend the House to venture upon penny postage within each State. Some members may ask what 1 mean by In a sense I agree securing true financial equilibrium in the telephonic and telegraphic branches. The Postmaster-General has wisely recognised the necessity of adjusting the rates in the Telephone Department, and has taken time by the forelock to bring about a re-adjustment. Before the Postmaster-General ension had taken evidence which must have convinced everybody of the necessity of a change. At any rate, any Postmaster General would have been blind if he did not see the operation of the conditions that prevailed in his own Department.",42,Chapman Ho W Would That Salaries In Tasmania Generally Are

The honourable gentleman said tliat the honourable member for Eden-Monaro introduced a Bill to provide for penny postage in 1907, and that it was then opposed by many honourable members on the ground that we ought to provide for old-age pensions before reducing the postal rates. He is now happy in the knowledge that a Federal system of old-age pensions has been established, but he has yet to consider the ramifications of his great Departstill more difficult position in the final apment. Although he has before him the report of the Commission-a report preMr Webster. pared after the most searching inquiryto adjust the wrongs of the service, and to bring about the structural reforms that are recommendations. He has not deigned to recognise the great responsibility cast upon his Department as a result of our inquiry. The honourable gentleman told us that, as the result of penny postage, there will be practically no reduction in the salaries of postal omcers. He may be right, but I tliink that there will be a very serious Nothing difference in the demands made upon officers of the service in the matter of overtime and work generally. The Postmaster-General would have the.House believe that the cost of this reform will be nominal, and that no one will suffer. He says, "" The change is one which threatens The Postmaster-General has no interest, and must benefit the whole of the people."" I deny the accuracy of that statement. The change threatens very severely the interests of the pioneers who are trying to clear the road for the multitudes who must ultimately follow them, ancl settle on the lancl. Their interests, we are told, are to be safeguarded by a readjustment of the method of estimating revenue from country mail services. At present, when application is made for a That experiment has cost the country mail service-and the man in the back-blocks has nothing but the mail to keep him in touch with the world's affairsthe Department estimates the probable revenue on a basis of 2d. per letter, inwards and outwards, and, by dividing the total, dited to the new service. The Postmasterwith all the revenue derived from them after the new system has been introduced. In other words, they will be credited with the revenue received from postal matter both inwards and outwards. That means either that country districts have hitherto teen wrongly treated, ov that some other part of the general service is going to be crippled by an unjust proportion of the postal revenue being credited to a particular maiJ route. If that system is adopted, what is to become of the proportion of revenue credited to trunk lines along which the postal matter for small services must travel ? I think that in trying to overcome his trouble in this regard with the representatives of country districts, the Postmaster-General will find himself in a plication of his theory. Undoubtedly, residents of country districts will suffer. The honourable gentleman says that for the first twelve months after the introduction of this system he is not going to reduce the status of certain offices or to reduce the emoluments attaching to allowance and semi-official post-offices. If penny postage is going to increase the volume of business to anything like the extent predicted by the honourable gentleman, he will have to increase the allowances. The increased cost has not been estimated by the Postmaster-General. with the introduction of penny postage in Victoria an additional number of sorters had to be engaged, but no account has been taken of the fact that from the time a letter is posted until it is delivered either General exemplifies the characteristic of at a city or country address, its every movement must be paid for. On the establishment of penny postage increased expenditure must necessarily ensue by reason of the additional weight of the postal matter carried, and if the revenue of country services be'estimated on the basis now proposed by the Postmaster-General, it will be found that the revenue derived from services to large centres of population will not balance the cost of collection and distribution of mail matter. other point which the Postmaster-General seems to have overlooked. He does not seem to have observed that, as the result of telephones being brought into general use, the conditions which prevailed in Victoria prior to the introduction of penny postage have considerably altered. increased business resulting from the application of this system to the whole continent will not be in proportion to the increase which followed the introduction of the system in Victoria. business formerly transacted through the medium of the post-office is now conducted over the telephone, which is found to be both cheaper and more expeditious. This practically undermines the value of the examples drawn from time to time from the experience of the penny postage system in New Zealand, Canada, and other countries. Another point to be remembered is that Victoria is the most closely settled State of Australia. Mails have to be carried over comparatively short distances, and the shorter the distance the larger the profit on the business done. map is a very small State. bage garden. Britain. opinion of its representatives, Victoria is greater than the rest of Australia, but compared with the other States it is but a compact little village.

If we consider the difference between the cost of He has been told that carrying mail matter in large States with scattered population, and in the more closely populated States, we see that the basis of calculation is misleading and deceptive to a large degree. The Postmasterthe Department in that he seems prepared to take any suggestions without acknowledgment, and to disregard the figures obtained in the long-continued examination of witnesses by the Postal Commission in regard to the financial aspect of the question. The admitted loss of £400,000 may not appear to be much to honourable members to-day, but we must not forget that the estimated increase in revenue is not likely to be realized, and that years There is anmust pass before the loss is diminished to any appreciable extent. The proposal does seem hard on the country districts, ivhich have hitherto been treated most scandalously under all Federal Governments. Prior to the inquiry by the Postal Commission, the finances of the postal, teleThe graph, and telephone branches were all jumbled together so that it could not be said which was paying and whicli was not. The Commission, however, managed to unravel the matter up to a certain point. It Much of the was tbe rule of the Department to refuse country mail services unless it could be shown that they would pay, or the people concerned were prepared to guarantee 50 per cent., or 60 per cent, of the cost; and that rule has remained in force for four or five years simply because it was not known whether the postal branch of the service paid or did not pay. The Postal Commission, however, discovered that the only branch of the service which is paying is the postal branch. The telegraph branch has been a losing concern to a very large extent, and the position of the telephonic branch in this connection is selfservice alone has been providing the revenue necessary to practically keep the De-",43,Chapman Ho W Would That Salaries In Tasmania Generally Are

We are heaping up liabilities without regard to the possibilities of the future, basing our estimates on the continuance of prosperity which cannot endure for ever. Some day we may find the revenue depleted, and our liabilities more than we can meet. Of course,' the motto of some honourable members is "" Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof."" Before reducing our revenue, we should consider our liavided by the Constitution to propose a rebilities. It is a great blot on the Department that a large number of men, who have given faithful service to the Commonwealth, have had to work overtime, amounting to days, and even to weeks, and that their claims for compensation for it are unpaid and unrecognised. Their position should have been considered before this proposal was made. The Constitution requires us to make our rates uniform, but that should have been done by providing for penny postage within each State, instead of making it universal throughout Australia. Our officials have borne their burden with an endurance which is highly creditable to them.

The Minister realizes that he is in power, that there is now plenty of revenue, that penny postage is popular, and that the requirements of the Constitution have created an opportune time for making a change. Like that predecessor who cut down the telephone rates to a degree 40 or 50 per cent, below what was profitable, he desires to gain popularity. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro reduced the telephone rates against the advice of his officers. He knew that it would gain him applause, and it was done without that consideration for the Department and the service which should have been given. member think that the proposal before us has been brought forward under similar circumstances ? but every politician when he gets into office wishes to leave his footprints on the sands of time. The honourable member himself would not be above that weakness. As the honourable member for Ballarat very suavely said, the Postmaster-General is a lucky man to have this opportunity production in postal rates. But attempts to gain notoriety are more or less harmful to a reputation for wise administration. able member, in his report, recommend that a number of steps should be taken before this reform was brought about? that penny postage, even within the separate States, should not be inaugurated until the telephone and telegraph services had been placed on a sound, financial basis. member think that that has been done ? Apparently, the telephone, service will come out fairly well, but much remains to be needed to put the departmental services on a proper footing. Of that amount,. £500,000 has already been spent or provided for, but £2,000,000 must be spent within the next.three or four years, which means £500,000 a year. Honourable members opposite would have gone to "" Uncle"" for the money, but we on this side do not wish to follow the bad example of the so called financial giants of the past. We must, therefore, see that the Government does not outrun the constable. It must be pointed out, too, that as we improve our telegraph service its revenue will increase. At fhe beginning, "" urgent "" telegrams, at double rates, were provided for, to enablespecial messages regarding sickness and death to get precedence; but the public has been forced by the slow despatch to send a large number of messages as "" urgent.""

But, even though getting double rates for a large proportion of its business, the Department is working at a loss. If we give the public an effective service, it will send its wires at the ordinary rate, and the extra revenue obtained from "" urgent "" telegrams will be -greatly diminished, We cannot, therefore, look for an improvement in the revenue of the telegraphic branch which will be proportionate to the money expended in improving it. It is merely to get rid of a congested system, and make it possible for the business to be done more expeditiously, and not to increase the business largely.

After going through the inquiry, however, I had to change my opinion. is a dangerous thing."" who know how little they possess, and are anxious to improve 'hemselves, but others do not know how small their knowledge is. The Commission holds it to be essential that the Department should be placed under a board of management. another reason why I should have liked to see the consideration of this question deferred until we could have put the whole scheme into operation. We recognise that the Department can no longer, in a Commonwealth of this kind, be effectively administered by a central head. I want to deal particularly with the demands that should be made upon the Postmaster-General, because he has not given us any idea of how he is going to meet them. There are many cases of injustice throughout the service. The Postmaster-General, in his speech, quoted some figures furnished to him by the Public Sendee Commissioner, who, whenever he wants to improve his case, resorts to the deceptive law of averages. The Postmaster-General, when referring to the wages paid to men in the Department, gave, on the authority of the Public Service Commissioner, what he called the averages paid in 1901 and 1909 respectively. If I had time to dissect those, figures to-night, I could show how fallaciously the average works out when applied to the individual officer. Apart from that, during the last eight or ten years, the whole of the industrial army have marched on with regard to wages. While the cost of living has, I admit, gone up materially, the wages paid to the workers in all branches of industry have risen also. No thought has been given to that, however, in an equitable, way, by those responsible for the administration of the Department. Commission 111 all its phases, and they have reported what, in their opinion, would be necessary. VVe find that, throughout the Department, large sums of money will be needed to re-adjust the position of the officers upon whom the Department depends. We recommend' that the maximum salary of the fifth class, clerical division, be raised to £200 per annum, and that sorters' grades be abolished. That means additional expenditure, because '' grading '' in regard to sorters has been nothing more nor less than "" evading.'' The Department has kept grading and regrading men only to keep down the rewards to which they were entitled for services rendered. We recommend, also, that the salaries of sorters be from £150 to £190, despatching officers £200, and mail officers £210 to £240 per annum. Those are increases of expenditure into which the Postmaster-General does not seem to have looked at all. They represent a considerable item, although they mean but simple That is justice to the men in the Department.

357,Mr Webster,"There are some menthe recommendations is this: While there have been grades in the Department, promotion has been so long delayed that often a man became almost entitled to an old-age pension before he could reach the top grade. When he was least fit to earn his money was the time when he would be entitled to get the most, but at the age when he was most vigorous and able to earn more he received only a medium rale of salary. The Commission recommend, and think it is imperative as a matter of justice, that these men shall all reach die high-water mark of their grade when their biggest responsibility is upon them, when they can give the most energy to the Department, and when their judgment is the most effective-that is, at the age of thirty-one years. If we are going to standardize the service, it is only equitable, just, and fair that that should be done. The Postmaster-General should look into that recommendation if this party is going to be worthy of its name as the protector of those who are placed under its control. We recommend that officers in charge of mail vans be raised to the rank of despatching officer, and that the maximum salary of letter-carriers£150 per annum-be attainable in nine years after reaching the minimum wage. At present, many of them do not reach it in twenty years after reaching the minimum wage, and some take longer than that. That reform will involve further expenditure. We recommend that letter-carriers' hours be forty-four per week, and this will mean further expenditure; that the salaries of mail-drivers and grooms-incharge be increased; that country linemen be afforded opportunities of transfer to city parties; and that linemen be provided with waterproof clothing. One wonders why that has not been done already. We recommend alsoThat linemen's grades be abolished, and their salaries increased as follows :-Linemen, £120 to £ 1 5 6 ; line foremen, ^168 to £ 1 9 2 ; line inspectors, £200 to £350 per annum. That means another item of expenditure which has not been reviewed by the Postmaster-General. We further recommendThat the maximum salary of instrument fitters be increased to £160 \ that the salaries of senior instrument fitters be from £ i y o to ,£190; and foreman fitters, ^200 to £250 per annum. That would involve further expenditure. Every one of the proposals attached to this report demands the close attention of the Postmaster-General. should be met, and justice meted out to the employees of this great Department before any concessions, other than those we are compelled to give, are given to any particular section of the community. We have it in evidence that the late Secretary of the Post and Telegraph Department was always strongly opposed to penny postage under existing conditions. He recognised that it is not a fair proposition, and that it is not reasonable to compare Australia in this connection with the countries in which the system has been adopted. He admits that a penny is a fair charge for services rendered in metropolitan areas where letters are delivered from the post office in which they are posted, but he contends it is a sound financial proposition to charge a higher rate for letters which have to be delivered at a distance. This gentleman, whose advice the Postmaster-General of the Commonwealth has been prepared to accept in the past, expresses himself in unmistakable terms as opposed to the adoption of penny postage in the Commonwealth. I ask Ministers to make a special note of what 1 am now about to say. We have no permanent Secretary of the Post ancl Telegraph Department to-day. . The late Secretary has retired, and there is an officer acting in his place, and, in my judgment, it will not be in the interests of the Department or of the Government if during the recess they decide to fill the position without having first considered the whole of the proposals made by the Postal Commission fot the future management of the service. To fill this important position with any officer now available in the Commonwealth would be to take but another of the disastrous steps which have been taken in the past. In my judgment it would be an unpardonable thing to do. member say that we have not a man in the Commonwealth fit to fill that position ? say that, unless the service is to be run on the lines hitherto adopted. The honourable member for Parramatta ought to know that himself. member import a man for the position? vernment to decide. I am giving honourable members my opinion.

368,Mr Webster,"I have no hesitationfuture occasion what I have to say on the broader issue of postal management. agree with some of the remarks made by the honourable member for Gwydir, and more particularly with his view that simultaneously with the introduction of penny postage throughout Australia the Department should be placed on a sound, business basis. That should not be difficult. I do not think that the placing of thc Department on a business basis requires a change of management in the direction recommendedby the Postal Commission, and probably it would not require any alteration such as would involve a complete change of officers or the creation of new offices. The appointment of a departmental actuary-a n appointment which has been confirmed by the present Ministrywas a very proper step to take. It should be possible for the people of Australia to ascertain from a departmental balance-sheet the paying and non-paying services of the Department. That is only a reasonable business proposition, which the people have a right to expect us to adopt. We shall never get the Post Office on a proper basis of management until we wholly separate the construction of new works from general administration. We shall never secure those services which are necessary in country districts unless we follow the course adopted in the past under State administration of paying for reproductive works out of loan money. It is a suicidal policy to call upon the Department to provide out of its own revenue for its many services throughout the whole of Australia as well as for new works and buildings. Such a policy must cripple the development of our commerce, and make it impossible for residents of country districts delivery therein was 61,813,218. In 1901 to secure those services which are essential to the development of a new country, and ought reasonably to be expected from a Government which has made a monopoly of the service. talking of borrowing money in these times of prosperity? money for reproductive purposes is not to talk of borrowing in the broad sense of tht, term. I am in favour of this Bill, and think that even the experience of Victoria shows that it is amply justified. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro, when introducing the first Bill providing for penny postage in this House, on 26th September, 1906, gave some very telling illustrations of the effect of penny postage in this State. The honourable member for Wentworth said, this afternoon, that Victoria had introduced penny postage shortly prior to the establishment of Federation, with a view of securing a cheaper postal service at the expense of the whole Commonwealth. According to the figures quoted by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, in the very excellent speech to which I have referred, the business of the Department in Victoria increased very rapidly as the result of the adoption of the penny-postage system. He gave an illustration of the increased business transacted. wages ? General, in introducing this Bill, dealt with that matter. The question of whether the whole of the officers of the service have been properly dealt with should be considered in connection with the Public Service Act, and quite apart from this measure. It seems to me that the revenue of the Department is sufficient to enable justice to be done to every one of its officers and still to leave a substantial profit, provided that new works and buildings be constructed out of loan money. If the policy of constructing new works out of revenue had been adopted in connection with our railways and water conservation schemes, we should probably have been to-day in the same primitive condition that Australia occupied in the early days of its history. Only by the extension of public works have we been able to' bring the country to its present stage of development. In 1900, before the introduction of penny postage in Victoria, the number of letters posted for --whe n the reduced rate had been in operation for only nine months-70,255,39 6 letters were posted; in 1902, during which the reduced rate was in full play, 83,748,327 letters were posted; in 1903, 84,871,415; in 1904, 86,802,756; and in i9°5, 9 >34o,7042 mation is already in Hansard. reply to criticism which has been made without, in my opinion, sufficient consideration of the experience of Victoria in respect of penny postage.

The figures 1 have quoted show an average increase equal to 35^ per cent, per annum, as compared with the number of letters posted in Victoria for inland delivery in 1900. In Victoria, during the first year after the introduction of penny postage, the Department made a profit of, approximately, £17,000. , In 1909-10, the receipts of the Postal Department totalled £3,757,000, whilst £3,232,000a profit of £524,000, after deducting the cost of new works and buildings. According to the figures presented by the Postmaster-General, the only reason why fhe Department will show a deficit during the current year is that the cost of new works and buildings is to be deducted from its ordinary revenue. of the Department in Victoria last year? profit was made In this State. merely cited the case of Victoria to show that a profit of £17,000 was made by the Department during the first year afteT the introduction of penny postage. ber aware that upon the whole of the service there was a loss last year ? by deducting the cost of new works and buildings from revenue. In my opinion, these new works and buildings should be constructed out of borrowed money. I see no objection to the establishment of penny postage, if works which immediately earn interest upon their cost are constructed out of borrowed money. I am now in a position to supply the information for which the honourable member for Illawarra asked a moment or two ago. In 1902, immediately after thc introduction of penny postage in Victoria, the revenue of the Department in this State was £591,000, and its expenditure £574,000. In other words, it made a profit of £17,000. Department in Victoria was £937,000, and its expenditure £809,000. There was thus a profit under ""the penny postage system of £128,000. fit. _ It is made by overworking and underpaying the employees. which should be considered by the Public Service Commissioner. If the wages being paid to our postal employees are net suflicient, it is the duty of this Parliament to recast the whole of the conditions of the service If a proper business plan were devised by this Parliament, and the cost of new works and buildings were defrayed out of borrowed money, instead of out of revenue, it would render valuable service to the country. I believe that the Bill constitutes a step in the right direction. In the adoption of a system of penny postage, there is nothing inconsistent with the idea of granting to country districts the facilithe expenditure aggregated ties to which they are entitled. We know that, during the first seven years of Federation-that is, until we appropriated the whole of the three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue to which we were entitled-the Postal Department, notwithstanding that £3,300,000 was expended upon new works and buildings, was very largely starved. £2,300,000 is required to make the Department efficient. ber has stated that an expenditure of £2,300,000 is required to bring the Postal, Telegraphic, and Telephonic Departments up to a state of efficiency. If that be so. has he devised a scheme of taxation by means of which that enormous revenue mayc be raised? We know that the policy of the Government is that we shall pay the whole cost of our defence out of revenue. Does he suggest 'that a further sum of £2,300.000 shall be raised by means of fresh taxation? the Government to determine. of the Postal Commission have traversed the whole gamut of the present and future management of the Department and it seems to me that that body might have laid down a business policy upon which the Government could base some new system of control. why that has not been done. right to make such a recommendation. lay down a business policy. the scope of the Commission itself. the duty of the Commission to recommend the adoption of a business policy.

I am glad lhat honourable members on the Ministerial side, and also, perhaps, some on this side, have repented of their former error in preventing penny postage being established in 1906. I have much pleasure in supporting the Bill. I had intended to oppose this measure until such time as the Department was reorganized, and the employees received fair and just treatment. However, the Postmaster-General has assured us that fair conditions for the employees do not depend on the rate of postage; and on the promise to readjust the present conditions given ? ister on Friday gave us a promise, so far as the lower-paid employees were concerned.

The Postmaster-General, in introducing the measure, informed us that contract offices, semi-official offices, and staff offices will be no worse off in consequence of its passing. It may be that that information is pleasant; but if the Department are not going to treat their employees better, it will be no advance, because they are in a disgraceful state at the present time. . There are, I suppose, sufficient exPostmasters-General in the House to carry a measure of this kind, because, at some time or other, each one has issued a memorandum or introduced a measure in favour of penny postage. When the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, as Postmaster-General, introduced his measure, the interjections, I notice, by a number of honourable members well informed in postal matters did not predict the happy state of affairs anticipated by that honourable gentleman. Our present High Commissioner declared that the introduction of perny postage would mean that a favoured few in the city would' participate in the benefit to the exclusion of those in the country, and the I hen honourable member informed man, was of the same opinion. 1 have read the report of the Postal Commission, and I have received information from various sources in regard to'the service ; and I do not feel at all disposed to support the measure as introduced by the Government.

There are many other reforms which ought to be carried out as speedily as possible. The report of the Postal Commission is voluminous, and contains many admirable suggestions, made after a prolonged inquiry by some of the most intelligent members of this House; and I think it is somewhat of a slight upon the members of that Commission that that report should be pigeonholed, even only for a session. In view of the fact that there is much discontent, not only on the part of officers, but on the part of sections of ihe public, it is time that the report was taken into consideration, and the necessary reforms carried into effect. In the Melbourne and metropolitan area, and, I believe, in the metropolitan areas of the other States, there are far too few letter-carriers, wilh the result that the men have to work from early morning to late at night in order to deliver the letters should be going into recess without carrying 011 their extended rounds. letter-carriers are loaded like mules, and at Christmas .they have to employ, out of their own "" screws,"" boys to carry their loads. tolerated for one day. In my own district the letter-carriers are sweated, working for long hours for a mere pittance on which to support their wives and families. There are too many grievances to be enumerated just at the present time; and pages of the report of the Postal Commission suggest necessary reforms. I am in sympathy with country members who"" wonder, if we give nearly £500,000 back to people who can best afford to pay postage, where the money is to come from to carry out telephone extensions. able member that the first few words I spoke in this House had reference to this subject, and I said that when there .was any proposal to assist those who were fighting the battle of life in the back blocks, I should lend a helping hand. I have received a letter from a friend of mine in America, who was at one time a farmer in Gippsland, but who, after fighting the forest, found a buyer for his farm, and crossed the Pacific. He is making his tour for the purpose of an investigation, so that when he returns he may be better fitted for the work of cultivating the land, and dairying on up-to-date lines. He is at present a close student of farming and dairying operations in America and elsewhere, and writes me that he has not visited an American farm which has not its telephone. Farmers, in sending stock and produce to market, have often to depend on the integrity of their agents, aiid it is of great assistance to be able to keep in touch with their markets. Any proposals for improving our postal, telegraphic, or telephonic communications will receive my hearty support.

Unless reforms are carried out in recess, I shall be a pretty regular departmental trotter. should not put his trust in ihe recess. flection on the Postal Commission that we out the reforms which it recommends. Since Federation we have had nine or ten Postmasters-General, each of whom has wished to associate himself with the introduction of penny postage. No doubt it will be necessary to make our rates uniform at the end of the year, but in connection with this change of postal rates a number of other reforms should have been provided for. Their consideration would not have delayed the progress of the measure. Because they have not been brought forward, and for other reasons, I shall vote against the Bill. If the changes which I think are necessary are not made in recess, I shall next session very severely criticise the administration of the Department. is surprising that, after the carefully-prepared peroration of the Postmaster-General, with its references to Trafalgar, Waterloo, and other scenes of strife, members of his own party, including the honourable members for Adelaide, South Sydney, and Maribyrnong, should not be convinced. warlike perorations from a Christian Minister. ing always been in favour of penny postage for Australia so soon as our finances would permit of it, I hail its introduction with delight.

As a country representative, I have had great difficulty in getting the requirements of my constituency in regard to postal, telegraphic, and telephonic services supplied, and am very desirous that the change in postal rates shall not have the effect either of curtailing services or of reducing wages. After nearly ten years' effort, I have just succeeded in obtaining telephonic communication with Sydney for one of the most important industrial centres in. Australia, but my constituency is not adequately provided with means of communication with the metropolis, and, no doubt, other constituencies are in like position. not mean a reduction in wages, but may prevent increases. mean that.

When the honourable member for Eden-Monaro introduced his Bill in 1907, the honourable member for Wide Bay saidI am sorry that the Postmaster-General is su urgent in this matter right that this Bill should be introduced, but I must express my regret that Ministers are apparently exceedingly anxious to' be able to institute penny postage during their term of office rather than to conserve the interests of the old people of Australia. This Bill particularly concerns the commercial community. I ask my honourable friends in charge of of receiving it. The honourable member for this Bill whether they are sent into this Herbert also said, on the same occasionParliament specially to look after the interests of the commercial community?

He does not give us the advantage of his opinions in this House. The honourable member for Wide Bay, on that occasion, further saidI admit ihat the Postmaster-General has manifested his eagerness to afford facilities to the country districts in the matter of the extension of telephonic communication, but, at the same time, I must remind him that there are people living in parts of Australia who would willingly pay a shilling on a letter if they, could get mails regularly. Throughout the Commonwealth, a large number of our producers are not able to get their mails regularly. They cannot get them more than once a week, or perhaps more than once a fortnight. I desire to impress on the Ministry the statement of the Postmaster-General in introducing the Bill, that the great loss of revenue which would occur would not mean any deprivation of mails to people in outlying places; and that the privileges which they are. asking for would not be interfered with. The honourable member for Herbert, another prominent member of the Labour party, speaking on the same question in 1906, saidThe Department have been fairly liberal, but they have not been able to give me a great many facilities for which I have asked, -because there has been no money available. Every member representing a country constituency has received from the DepartI t is quite. ment letters to the same effect.

Let me tell honourable members that there are nearly 1,500 persons resident on these islands, and they are given only a triweekly service, which is conducted under conditions that can only be described as terrible. They have asked that a decent subsidy should be provided which would enable the contractors to put on a steamer of a fair size by which the residents might travel in some comfort to Tasmania or to Victoria. At present, the service is carried out by a small ketch, because a subsidy of only £ 8 0 a year is paid for it. The answer to every demand for a better service is that it would not pay, and the Department has no money. Honourable members are aware that that is the departmental answer to every request for better postal, telegraphic, and telephonic faciliship to say whether we should adopt unities. The small vessels which it is possible versal penny postage in Australia.

The people on these islands have no telegraphic communication by cable, or by wireless telegraphy, and when a request is made to supply them with a better service, we are told that the Department has no money. posal to reduce the revenue of the Department is carried into effect, what chance shall I have of securing a better service for the people of Flinders Island? The small vessels carrying on the present service are the only means of communication between the islands and Launceston, or Melbourne, and I can assure honourable members that on some occasions these small ketches have carried thirty passengers, without sanitary accommodation or conveniences of any description, and women and children have been put down into the hold without berths, and have sometimes had to stay there for from three to six days, in rough weather. Much the same thing applies to the service between Tasmania and King Island, which is represented by the present Minister of Home Affairs. been asking for a cable service with King .Island since he has been a member of this [206]2 House. There are thousands of genuine farmers settled on the island now, but, in common with the people settled on the other islands to which I have referred, they are denied a satisfactory means of communication with Tasmania and the mainland, because the Government have no money to spend in the way proposed. If that be so, how can I be asked to support a measure like this? If a proposal which must involve a reduction of the revenue'derived by the Department brings about a better service, I am a Dutchman. I am opposed to this measure. sire to offer one or two remarks upon this proposal. In my opinion, the payment of civil servants has been very unfairly intruded into the consideration of the question. It is really a question of statesmanorable members who might be expected to support the Government appear to be determined to defeat this proposal. They contend that if this statesmanlike proposition is carried out, the Public Service is bound to suffer. If I thought that public servants would suffer as the result of. the passing of this Bill, I should not be prepared to support it ; but, in view of the fact that a number of taxation proposals have been submitted to this House-proposals which are bound to become law, and are designed more particularly to take money out of the pockets of the commercial section of the communityI think it only If this proreasonable that the penny-postage system should be adopted in other States, as it has been in Victoria. It appears an anomaly that whereas residents of Victoria can have all their correspondence carried through the post at a charge of i d . per letter, those outside the city areas of New South Wales have to pay 2d. per letter, while in some of the other States every letter must be -r a twopenny stamp. Uniformity in this respect ought to be established, so as to fulfil one of the obligations of Federation, that every person in the Commonwealth shall be treated alike by the Public Departments. I am, therefore, a supporter of the Bill, and it appears to me that the Government are justly entitled to the sympathy of the House. This is the first measure that has created in my mind a feeling of sympathy for them.
