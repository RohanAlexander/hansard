The statement referred to cannot be true. honourable member for Grey asked me whetlier there was any truth in the rumour that the wages of temporary office cleaners had been reduced. I told him that I knew nothing of the matter, and the Secretary of the Department waa at the time unaware of the facts; but I have ascertained since that in the HomeA f fairs Department there are two temporary office cleaners who, in accordance with a decision of the last Minister, have been receiving 9s. per day. Public' Service Commissioner, however, has drawn attention to the fact that section 40 of the Public ServiceA c t provides that temporary employees shall be paid at the same rate as permanent employees for doing similar work, and that the permanent office cleaners are receiving 8s. 5d. per diem Service Commissioner about the matter on Saturday, and I am afraid that his decision must stand.

They could reach Liverpool only by crossing the river bridge, and at the bridge there was an insufficient guard, with the result that some of the young trainees began to play up. My own opinion is that the incident has been much exaggerated. they commenced to pull women off bicycles, I do not think that it has been. that that was done. I believe that the guard was strengthened, and that since then there has been no trouble. Exaggeration will go on until the end of the chapter. newspapers that several members of another place, as well as members of the Ministry, have been talking a lot of silly stuff ahout the Labour party and trying to beat tlie Prime Minister at the game.

44,Sir John Forrest,"I congratulate the honourable member for Hindmarsh on the exhaustive manner in which he dealt with tlie important question of where the wealth of our community resides. I must express my regret that, since Mr Coghlan lef t tbe States, our statisticians seem to be very loath to deal with this question, which he most exhaustively investigated, and one has to refer to his book, The Seven. Colonies, in order to obtain certain official information which he gave to the people from year to year. vate wealth of Australia at £908,000,000 in round figures. guessing. ber will find, if he turns up that volume, that Mr Coghlan had a very admirable way ""of reasoning out his conclusions. will admit that, in this particular case, the total is only an approximation. believe, reasoning from Coghlan's figures for 1901-2, when things were not too good so far as values were concerned, that the private wealth of Australia amounts to-day to something like £1,300,000,000. at those figures? and improvements at £627,000,000; live stock, at .£29,000,000; mining, & c , £32,000,000; merchandise, £59,000,000; coin and bullion, £26,000,000. cipal items. £130,000,000 of this private wealth was owned by absentees. I very much regret that our statisticians seem to have neglected this important branch of investigation, because I agree with the honourable member for Hindmarsh that, if we are to legislate fairly and equitably for the people of Australia, we should know as nearly as possible where the wealth of the community lies. A t page 14 of the Budget pamphlet issued by the Treasurer, he has attempted, in a table, to give the people of Australia an idea of how much the taxation of this country has increased from 1909 to 1912. I do not think the right honourable gentleman has dealt fairly with the people in the way he has presented his case. The figures may be all right, but his deductions are wrong. He states that, in Customs and Excise we received £10,000,000 in 1909, and £14,000,000 in 1912. He, therefore, puts down the increase during those few years as from £ 2 l is . 3d. to £ 3 4s. 5d., or 13s. 2d. per head. I am prepared, as far as possible, to go in for prohibitive Protection, but, while we have the present moderate Tariff, it is only natural to expect a considerable inflow of revenue from Customs and Excise during tbese prosperous times. There was no alteraI n 1901-2, he set down the prition of the Tariff during that period, so how_ could there be any increased Customs taxation ? The right honourable gentleman sets down also, "" direct taxation, Commonwealth and State."" Why include State taxation, unless he is going'to include the deductions?. We, as legislators like to know what direct taxation has been imposed by the States, and it is also I well to know what the local taxation is, but I do not understand why FederalI taxation, State taxation, and local taxation are all grouped together, and the figures presented as if the increase shown were the total increase of taxation under the rigirne of the Federal Labour Government for the past three years. The Treasurer sets down direct taxation, Commonwealth and State, at £3,500,000 in 1909, and £6,750,000 in He sets down land 1912, or an increase from 16s. 7d. to £ 1 9s. 8d., equal to about 13s. i d . £85,000,000; furniture, & c , per head. I challenge any honourable £29,000,000; machinery, &c, member on the other side to show in what way, with the exception of the land tax, any fresh taxation was imposed Those are the prinupon the people of Australia during the He estimated, also, that three years of office of the Fisher Government. The land tax was imposed only on 14,000 of the wealthiest landlords and property-owners of Australia, 2,000 of whom live outside Australia altogether. To put it mildly, it is misleading to state that the increase in taxation has been as indicated by the Treasurer. The land tax itself amounts only to about 5s. per head, if averaged over the whole of the people, and it is paid only, as I said, by a small number. The local taxation increased from £3,028,000 to £4,204,000, oi from 14s. 4d. to 18s. 5d. per head. The Treasurer gives the total taxation for 1909 at £17,384,000, and £25,700,000 in 1912, or £ 4 2s. 2d. per head in 1909, and £ 5 12s. 6d. per head in 1912, a net mcrease-of £ 1 10s. 4d.",15,Budget

49,Mr Fenton,"per head. our honourable friends on the other side are going about -the country-that under the rule of the Fisher Government, taxation was increased by £ 1 10s. 4d. per head. That is the story they wish the electors to believe, when the real t r u th is fchat the only fresh taxation imposed vvasfcheland fcax, which amounts to os. per head. Another set of figures with which I propose to deal relates to the sugar question. I take these two tables as fair samples of the statements in fche other tables, apart from the official figures, and if those others are uo more true in spirit and in fact, the Budget statemeub is misleading. The right honourable gentleman refers to the number of tons of sugar produced and the number of employees engaged in the industry in the following wordsThc number of white men employed in the industry, including in factories, on 31st December, 1907, was 41,800, while on the 31st December, 1912, it was only 27,380. On 31st December, 1907, there were employed in the industry, including factories, 4,068 coloured persons, while on 31st December, 1912, there were only 1,383. The sugar produced in 1907 was 214,244 tons, while in 1912 it was 130,059 tons, and estimated for this year 226,991 tons. On 31st December, 1912, it appears that there were 14,420 fewer white men employed in the industry than in 1907, five years previously. The number of white men employed in the industry, including in factories, were :31st December, 1906 3tst December, 1907 31st December, 1908 31st December, 1909 31st December, 1910 31st December, 1911 31st December, 1912 . ... The Treasurer wishes to convey, and the Brisbane press are fcaking up the same cry, that during the reign of fche Fisher Government the sugar industry depreciated. case i u the ordinary sense of the word. If it had been said that owing to the bad seasons there was less sugar produced, and, therefore, fewer people employed, it would have been the truth . But why should the Treasurer go so far back as 1907 ? The reason is that in 1907 there was the highest production of sugar, and naturally the greatest number of people employed, and he compares that year with 1912, which was almost a year of drought. ference in the figures is solely due to the failure, or partial failure, of the crop, Mr Fen/on. That is the cry with which and the right honourable gentleman answered himself by showing fchat with the decrease in the production of sugar there was a corresponding decrease in the number of people employed. I have picked out these two sets of figures promiscuously, and I am sadly disappointed fchat they should be so presented by the Treasurer, because they do not repressnt a true record. We ought to be able to rely on the annual financial statement as giving an accurate representation of the true state of affairs. As to rural matters, honourable members in the Government corner, and immediately behind the Goverument, profess to be much interested in the primary producer. In fchis connection, I should like to quote some figures in reference to fche claim which has been made by fche Australian Workers Union. 0 I have here a document signed by Mr. W. G. Spence, the president of the union, and by MrE . Grayndler, the general secretary of thafc body; and I think it just as well that it should find a place i u .Hansard, so as to -be available for ready reference. This document, which is headed "" The Policy for fche Rural Workers,"" is as follows: Following our usual custom of endeavouring to amicably arrange rates and conditions, an invitation to meet the Australian Workers ... ... 33,700 Union in conference was extended to each of ... ... 41,800 the farmers and settlers and rural producers as... ... 38,190 sociations in the States of New South Wales, ... . . . 36,619 v Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania, and ... ... 34,120 Queensland. We waited patiently for over two ... ... 29,776 months, and now, after quite unnecessary delay, ... 27,380 a few of the employers' associations have written declining to meet the Australian Workers Union in conference. The remainder have not replied to our invitation. We had hoped that a conference would have been agreed to by the employers, that a settlement would have been arrived at before the harvest season began, and Such, however, is not the that the present industrial trouble would have been avoided. The attitude of the employers' associations in ignoring a matter of such vital importance to the country is to be deplored. The log of rates, hours and conditions for all occupations in the rural industries was published f u l l y in an early issue of The Worker and in the conference report. We therefore now only summarize the rates that were approved of for the agricultural section. The log of rates for other rural industries w ill be published later.

I wish to show what money could be put in the pockets of the rura l producers if they would only organize. During the past twelve years I have had a good deal of experience in connection with the dairying industry. ago there was no such thing as co-operative selling companies, so far as dairy produce is concerned, in Melbourne. But to-day tliere are three such organizations. 1 will not deal with similar institutions in New South Wales. ' member for Richmond could tell us a glowing tale of what co-operation has accomplished in the Byron Bay district of that State, and also by fche Coastal Farmers Co-operative Company, and the honourable member for Moreton could render a similar service in regard to what it has accomplished in Queensland. Victoria. its existence, the Western District Cooperative £4,164,000 worth of butter and cheese; the Uippsland Co-operative Company has marketed the Victorian Co-operative Company £3,800,000 worth; or a total value of nearly £12,000,000. the profits? Houorable members know thafc before these companies came into existence the farmers used to send their butter to local agents, who charged them 5 per cent, for selling it . The profits of the Western District Co-operative Company during the eight years it has been in existence have amounted to £ 3 8 , 1 9 3 ; those of the Gippsland Cooperative Company, during the past eight years, have totalled £ 3 1 , 5 5 1 ; and those of the Victorian Co-operative Company to £ 3 0 , 0 0 0; a total of £100,464. These figures, however, do not represent the whole of the gain which has flowed to the farmers from co-operation. I may tell honourable members that a ton of butter can be marketed to-day for £ 1 0 less than ifc could be marketed ten or twelve years ago. Then the dairy farmer was charged more for the salt, machinery, The acids, & c , which he used. In some cases he was charged 100 per cent, more than he God bless the is charged to-day. What has brought about fchis reduction ? Unquestionably ifc I am has been the combination of the dairymen. They used to pay £ 7 per ton for I say that sending butter to England by the Orient Company's and the P. and O. Company's lines of steamers, whereas to-day fchey pay only £ 4 or £ 5 per ton. That reduction, I repeat, has been brought about by combination on the part of the dairymen. All the factories wrote to the shipping companies, declaring that they were Thirteen years united in making this demand for a reduction of the freight charges. A conference resulted, and, for the most part, the dairymen got their way. The honourable tion was made in respect of the mail contract. at the back of the mail contract was a combination of the butter companies of Australia. In this connection we have to recollect that butter is one of the easiest commodities to carry. Ifc is a profitable cargo to handle, and the I propose to deal only with revenue which the oversea shipping comDuring, the eight years of panies receive for the frozen produce which we export must be very considerable. Company has marketed I am safe in saying that, during the past ten years, owing to combination, the dairymen of Victoria alone have saved £3,756,000 worth; and nearly £250,000. Where did all this money go prior to the establishment of these co-operative organizations ? It What have been went into the pockets of those who supplied machinery and material, and the middlemen who sold the producers' butter in the local markets and elsewhere. I say that in co-operation lies. the solution of the problem of fche man on fche land.

I venture to say that, if Australian producers, wheat-growers, wool growers, and butter manufacturers, go in for co-operation and cut out the middlemen, they will make more than enough profits fco enabie them to pay the wages demanded by rural workers, and at the same time'to provide themselves with comforts which they cannot enjoy at the present time. 1 can vouch for the accuracy of the figures affecting the dairy industry which I have given, and should honourable members doubt them, I have fche balance-sheets of two of the largest co-operative companies before me. The honourable member for Barker and other honourable members are aware of the im mense market there is in the United Kingdom alone for various classes of produce. generally some idea of this market if I give them the money value of foodstuffs of various kinds which Great Britain requires to import to supplement her local production. tion of wheat, grain, and flour, is £48,000,000 annually; meat, £51,000,000; ""poultry, eggs, and rabbits, £10,000,000; fish, £35,000,000; f r u it , £16,000,000; vegetables, £4,000,000; and wool, £33,000,000. It is interesting to know that, of the £33,000,000 worth of wool imported into Great Britain, no less than £22,000,000 worth comes from Australia. The items I have mentioned give a grand total of £200,000,000 worth of produce which Great Britain requires to import over and above whafc she can produce for herself, Thafc, it w ill be admitted, is a very 2,000,000 dairy cows, and one can easily considerable market, and the markets of Germany and France are also gradually being opened to Australian producers. These figures should indicate the way in which local producers can find the money fco pay well the men who work the land and enhance its value. It will not be necessary fco strike a levy for the purpose. Another phase of the question deserves some consideration. I do not know whether the honourable member for Richmond will agree with me in this matter, because I am aware that, in his district, there are some very good dairy cattle. The last time. I went into the subject, I found [132]2 The producers of Denthat the average annual product of a cow in Australia was valued at only £ 6 . That figure is altogether too low. that? ago, and if the honourable member for Barker will go into the figures to-day, he will find that the average dairy cow in Australia does not yield more than £ 7 per year. In Denmark, every cow yields £ 1 3 10s. per annum. I could show honourable members some herds of dairy cattle in the Western District whose yield averages about £14 per cow per annum, so that the average of inferior herds in some other districts must be very low indeed. feed? secure the butter-fat by feeding. It . is It w ill givehonorable members possible to alter the quantity, but not the quality, of milk by feeding.' without feeding. course; but a good dairy cow w ill give a good, average of butter-fat, and only the quantity of milk she gives may be in £3,000,000; dairy produce, creased by feeding. In America many experiments have been made to feed dairy cattle w i th the object of increasing the butter-fat of the milk, but they have absosolutely failed The higher average of butter-fat is due to the quality of the cow, and not to the quality of the feed. My point is that, instead of an annual yield of £7 per cow in Australia, we should get a yield up to £12 per cow. I suppose that we have in the Commonwealth about imagine what it would mean to Australia to raise the average annual yield by £4 or £5 per cow. I believe that it is possible, also, to obtain better yields from our wheat-fields. It may be possible, also, to improve our yields of wool, but I think that we have, perhaps, made greater advance in this respect in the wool industry than in any other industry. A few figures concerning Denmark will, I am sure, be interesting to honourable members. Tlie country is only 18,000 square miles in extent, and much of it had to be reclaimed from swamps.

77,The Value Of Her Importa,". Mr Fenton T h a t is true, ofand eggs to Great Britain. This is due entirely to organization. In dairying, in Denuse of his own family, to the factory of mark, they have 1,157 co-operative dairy societies, with a membership of 157,000. In the production of bacon there are thirty-four societies, with a membership of 95,000. Eor the purchase of requisites there are fifteen societies, with a membership of 65,000. This is a matter of the very greatest importance, as it indicates the way in which the co-operative companies save money by buying requisites in bulk and distributing them to their members. In societies for the export of eggs there are 52,000 members; horsebreeding, 270 societies, with 21,500 members; cattle-breeding, 1,210 societies, with 31,300 members; pig-breeding, 253 societies, with 6,430 members; sheep-breeding, 102 societies, with 850 members. Of control societies there are 519, with a total informing him that he has been membership of 12,000. These figures represent 3,610 different societies, with 449,480 members, in a population of about 2,500,000. ""We have in Denmark nearly 500,000 members of various societies, formed for the purpose of saving money. What is the result? I find that out of 183,313 dairying holdings, carrying 1,282,254 cows, there are under cooperation 154,568 holdings, carrying 1,059,956 cows. This proves that nearly all the dairymen in Denmark are members of co-operative societies, working as brethren for their own advancement by the manufacture of a superior article and the marketing of it under the best possible conditions. Great Britain requires to import every year butter to the value of £25,000,000 over and above what she produces herself, and of this amount Denmark supplies £11,000,000 worth, or nearly one-half. Of bacon, Denmark sends to Great Britain every year £6,690,000 worth, and eggs to the value of £1,500,000. Some of the rules of these Danish societies, which are, by the way, being followed in Ireland and in Great Britain, are much more rigorous than are the rules of trade unions and employers associations. Eor instance, a pig-raiser in Denmark has to pledge himself that every pig he raises shall be sent to the factory of the co-operative society of which he is a member. Every man who milks a cow in Denmark, and is a member of a co-operative society, is pledged to send all the milk which.is the product of that cow, Mr Fenton. over and above what he requires for the the society to which he belongs. Eggproducers are pledged in the same way, and one of the regulations of the societies controlling the export of eggs from Denmark is worth quoting as a wonderful example of co-operation and organization. Every member of one of these societies has a particular number in a particular district, and that number is stamped upon every egg he sends to the control society, who export them to Great Britain. In time the numbered egg finds its way into the grocer's shop in Great Britain. If , after its purchase, it turns out to be rotten, the purchaser may return the shell with the number on it to the grocer, who, in turn, sends it back to the control society, and the control society write to the producer fined for supplying a rotten egg for export, and reminding him that a repetition of the offence may lead to his expulsion from the society. It is that strict control over producers and the markets which has given to the Danish farmer the great preference which he enjoys in Great Britain. The honourable member for Corangamite will bear me out that what the Danes have done in controlling the exports from their country is wonderful. They have made up their mind to send abroad only products of the best quality, and the consumer in Great Britain knows, when he buys a pound of Danish butter, that he is getting the best quality to be obtained on the market. Of course, we in Australia produce some of the finest butter to be found in the world. equal of the Danish cows. average product from a Danish cow is £13 10s. a year, while the average product from an Australian cow is only about £7 a year. cows better. have to be stalled, for there is no such thing as turning cows adrift. The average size of a dairy farm is 20 acres, and a cow is never let loose except on some of the big farms Some of the control societies have to import the food to feed the cows which compete with the produce of the",22,Threshing Grain

He is clean, industrious, and turns out a superior article. facts inspire confidence in the purchaser of Danish butter in Great Britain. The Danish farmers fix the price, too. Practically every day a telegram is sent from Copenhagen to Tooleystreet, and other places, more particularly to Newcastle, where Danish butter is disposed of. from Great Britain, the price of butter in Denmark is fixed, and it is sold at that price for the day. The dairy farmers can demand their price, simply because they market an article which is well worthy of contest with the produce from other countries. Trampled down, and left practically insolvent by Napoleon, what has been the result in Denmark of the wonderful education introduced by that grand patriot, D r . Grundtvig, who went round lecturing to the people ? He brought their education to such a pitch that, followed as it was by the co-operative movement, Denmark, instead of being one of the poorest countries per individual, to-day is one of the richest countries, comparing well with the best countries under the British flag. That result has been achieved mainly by organization. established in Australia, there would be very little complaint about the rural workers' wages. find their way into the pockets of the producers through the elimination of the middleman, and the savings effected by resort to co-operation and organization. Our dairy farmers would then be able to pay a decent wage and to live under good conditions. leon who divided up the estates in Denmark. much as he could from the pockets of the Danes when he practically bestrode Europe. To-day, in Denmark, there are nearly 200,000 land-holders in a population of a little over 2,000,000. The suggestion I am going to make to the Minister of Trade and Customs would, I believe, bring about better results than could be derived from the establishment of a Bureau of Agriculture. In Ireland the dairymen were in a very bad state until the IrishA g r i cultural Organization Society was formed, with Sir Horace Plunkett at its head. He organized the dairymen to such an These extent that to-day they are in a much better position than ever they were. He said to the dairymen, ' ' Dairying has reached such a pitch of perfection in Denmark that the best thing we can do is to send a committee of Irish dairymen to that country, to make investigations and submit a report."" His suggestion was A f t e r receiving advice adopted, and largely from the circulation of the report which was made, and organization, has followed the wonderful results which the Irish dairyman has been able to achieve. Are we in Australia content to be behind other countries in this respect? We have had a visit from Scottish farmers, and also a delegation of Danish farmers and experts. America, Denmark, France, Germany, and even Great Britain are awakening to the importance of sending delegations of farmers to different parts of the world. Why? In order to pick up the latest information in almost every line of rural industry. In my opinion, incalculable benefit has resulted from the sending of practical men in that way from one country to another. It has undoubtedly been of material help to Ireland. It has assisted, too, Denmark and other countries. W h y If such a system were should we, in Australia, be content to know less in regard to the production and exportation of wool, wheat, butter, Ample funds would cheese, maize, and meat? If we could get the latest information on those subjects by a policy of co-operation between the Commonwealth Government and the State Governments, the money would have been well spent. Let a sum of money be voted for the purpose of sending delegations of practical men to other countries to collect the latest information, was Napoand great results would accrue to our primary producers, I believe. The delegations would come back armed with the No ; he extracted as most useful information it is possible to glean abroad. Not only would their reports be printed, but, being capable men, the delegates could go to the rural districts and tell the farmers in meeting assembled exactly what methods are pursued in other countries. That is one of the ways in which producers elsewhere are going ahead of our producers by leaps and bounds. Of course, no harm would be done even if it were discovered, in same cases, that producers elsewhere are not so far ahead as our producers are. If ,",23,Threshing Grain

If a delegation of twelve practical men, provided with a secretary and an expert, were appointed to go abroad early next year, and visit two or three of the countries' I have named, I guarantee that they would return armed with.a stock of information which would be of immediate benefit to our producers. If the producer in this country is content to sit idly by and allow the producer in otlier countries to adopt superior methods, aud, by that means, to pass him in the race for the markets of the world, he is doomed to failure. But i i he is alive to his best interests, and wishes to farm his land on the most up-to-date lines,, he must be brought into close contact, with the methods in up-to-date countries. I commend my suggestion to the consideration of the Minister of Trade and Customs, and will proceed to say a few words in respect to the policy of the Government in departing from the day labour system to the contract system. In my judgment, they are making a great mistake. They are rushing to the contractor on every possible occasion. We may get our work done a little more cheaply, but once we have disorganized the fine body of workmen collected under some' of the Departments, and also disposed 'of the material which they have been using in building and other operations, the contractors will be in a position to obtain the last pound of flesh. Government, who fight so shy of preference to unionists, are not showing the most deliberate preference to unionists. I say thafc they are.

I submit that the Contractors and Builders Association and the Employers Federation are political bodies and subscribe to the political funds of honourable members opposite. I have a letter signed by the secretary and treasurer of the Employers Federation here, intimating fchafc, when the last QueensI land elections were on, over £3,000 was sent to the employers of Queensland to help them in the campaign. It is to individuals of this class that honourable members opposite are giving contracts. What is the difference between giving preference to contractors who contribute to your political funds, and giving preference to workmen who may or may not contribute to our funds ? member say that preference is given to certain contractors? shown to the contractors as against fche day labourers. The Government material for use in the construction of public works is being disposed of, and the fine body of workmen that has been organized are being dispersed. Later, the Government will find that ifc has to pay fche contractors their own prices. Honourable members opposite cannot deny that the Employers Federation contributes largely to fche political funds of their party. The contractors are in fche federation, and, therefore, the Government is leaning towards men who want to dip into the public purse. Ministers are giving their partypolitical friends a "" look in . "" There is more corruption in connection wifch contracting than in connection with anything else. Eveni n supplying the requirements of the War Office, when patriotism might be expected to exercise a restraining influence, contractors have repeatedly acted dishonestly towards the British Government. The Attorney-General, speaking of unionism, saidI want to know whether the If I had my own way, I would say that Parliament should wipe off the statute-book as the ugliest blot ever put upon it, a provision which enables a legal tribunal to grant a legal preference to unionists in any shape.

Some of the rules of the union are more drastic than could be found in connection with any organization, without going back some centuries of British history; and, even now, if a man does anything against the interests of the association, he is brought before a secret committee. The other day, we had a Judge actually threatening a legal luminary here to send him before that committee. I do not object to this unionism, but those who are members of unions should not object to unionism ot a kind similar to their own. There has never been, since the inauguration of Federation, a more Tory Government in power in the Commonwealth than that which we now have; and, for the information of its members and supporters, let me draw attention to some of the benefits that have accrued in this community from organization. The Carpenters and Joiners Union was established in 1860. It has 84,131 members-there being 13,000 in Australia and New Zealand. iu fifty-three years total £4,000,000, divided as follows: Unemployed £92,245; £182,063; accidents, £98,055; superannuation, £638,401; trade privileges, £379,443; benevolent grants, £66,931; grants to other trades, £37o,774The aid of the law was invoked in 97,000 cases, resulting in £2,000,000 in wages being recovered from employers. union, like many others, has conferred considerable benefits on the community: yet honourable members opposite would make it appear that these institutions are not beneficial to our society. As a matter of fact, the unions are helping to bring about better government. stand for organization and discipline, and give opportunities for the learning of business methods. incalculable benefits upon the community, and, according to Bishop Ingram, next to Christianity no other influence in the British Empire has been more beneficial to humanity. the honourable member makes to the A t torney-General. ber for Capricornia, who, like myself, is a member of the Typographical Society, knows the benefits that that society has conferred on its members and others. The Victorian branch of the society, and, I believe, its other branches, are in a position to insist on preference being given to its members. Here, if any one in the printing trade requires a man, he sends to the TradesH a l l . The same thing is done in other trades, because it is found that in that way the best workmen are obtained, and many leading employers adopt the same method. I do not know what the Minister of Trade and Customs is doing in regard to the Printers Combine, but the following letter, signed by JohnF . Bracken, and dated the 1st October, which appeared in the daily papers recently, gives interesting information concerning it . Mr Bracken is secretary of the non-Typothetae Master Printers, and wrote just after the Conference of Master Printers had been held in Brisbane. He saidThe suggestion made at the recent conference at Brisbane of the Master Printers' Association (vide the Age report) tliat the Federal Attorney General should be supplied with information reThe benefits distributed garding Tynothetse is indicative of a natural feeling of alarm that the Commonwealth Parliament might be induced to inquire into the legality of the combine. If Mr Irvine finds relief, £1,416,954; tools, that a combine does exist he is to be advised sickness, £1,011,560; funerals, that "" it would be better to let the matter alone."" Gratuitous advice, based on personal considerations, is a characteristic of Typothetse. It is to be doubted, however, if Typothetoe is really anxious to give the Attorney-General full access to its operations. At last year's conference at Adelaide, when the foundations of the institution were laid, the strictest secrecy was That observed on some points. The Australian Printer, officially recognised as the organ of Tvpothetae, reported the Adelaide conference. Some excerpts make very interesting reading :1. It was decided that, "" In view of the legal aspect, the discussion on the papers dealing wilh Typothetse be taken in camera."" 3. A Victorian master printer said (after the discussion in secret) : "".The legal aspect of Typothetoe, as They shown by opinions read and cases cited, would need very careful handling.

89,Mr Fenton,"printers who held aloof from Typothetae, the journal from which I quote, in summarising the conference, stated : "" If argument and persuasion do not have the desired result, then other steps will have to be taken. . . . The means to be adopted was to make it unprofitable for them (the recalcitrants) to stay outside."" Truly this newly-born zeal for publicity on the part of Typothetas is calculated to place it ferences. The Treasurer, more than any in an awkward iix. Honourable members opposite often complain about tbe force that is used by trade unionists, and some of them even object to moral suasion; but what do they think of the statement that I have just read? I do not say that the Minister of Trade and Customs is opposed to preference to unionists, because I understand that he was a member of the Administration that provided for it in the arbitration wise in placing it beyond Government law, but the Attorney-General, who is a powerful member of the Ministry, would destroy that provision if he could, and has called it one of the ugliest blots on our statute-book. affairs of the Typotheta? are investigated, it w ill be found to be a perfectly proper combination; but the point I wish to make is that the employers who object to trade unionism are themselves combining, and are applying to those who w ill not join them even stricter rules than are applied by ordinary trade unions. printer stands outside the Typotheta?, when he goes to a wholesale man for printing paper, that man first consults his list, and should the printer's name not be on it, charges considerably more for the paper, that is, if he consents to supply any. Consequently, printing is made unprofitable for those who are not members of the Typotheta?. A short time ago two printers were tendering for printing work to be done for the Prahran Council. The Printers Combine insisted that the prices asked should be the same in both tenders, but one man put in a tender below that of the. other, and, for doing so, he was accounted a very bad person indeed. The master printers may be right in combining, but those who use organization to benefit themselves should not object to the labourer, who has only his brain and muscle between him and starvation, from organizing to enable h i m to dispose of his labour to the best advantage. The Rev. E. C. Wood said to the rural producers recently: ganize, then, if worse things come on you, you will deserve them."" Mr Fenton. organization in every branch of industry. A well-organized community is easily governed. Both sides should be organized. Let me now refer to the Commonwealth Bank, to which the Prime Minister and the Treasurer are for ever making slighting reother man in the community, should be ready to defend the Governor of the bank, but it would seem that he cannot say anything too disrespectful of the bank's management. I hope the people w ill note this. The Treasurer has complained over and over again that he has no power over the Governor. I am thankfu l that he has not, because if he had, I am afraid that the bank would soon become of a political cliaracter. The late Government were control, and in the hands of a man who, I believe, will conduct it on right lilies. Notwithstanding that the Savings Bank branch is paying a lower rate of interest It may be that when the than is given by the State Savings Banks, it has deposits amounting to over £3,500,000. If the Governor would make up his mind to give an additional half per cent., I am confident that the deposits in the State Savings Banks would be very considerably reduced, and that a corresponding increase would take place If a in the Commonwealth Savings Bank deposits. The workers are just as keen as are other people to obtain the best in terest on their money, but I am inclined fco admire the Governor for having taken up, so far, what may be said to be, in a sense, a rather conservative stand. I hope we shall not hear so much as we have in regard to the rural workers. To my mind, they are one of the most deserving classes of men in the community. They are doing very necessary work, but are disorganized, and consequently are badly treated. I have put before the Committee a picture of the life of the English farm labourer, and I hope that we shall never see its like here. If we are to avoid such a thing, we must protect the men against the unfair employers There are to-day, both in New South Wales and Victoria, farmers who are recognising the claim made on behalf of these men by the Australian Workers Dnion. If those on the land would provide better conditions for their men-if ""If you do not orthey would provide them with small plots of land and little homes, and give them. I hope to see some encouragement-the y would have a very desirable class of men offering for employment; and the men would carry out the work devolving upon them in a much better way, and help the farmers much more than they do at present. The primary producers and the rural workers seem to be at daggers drawn. That ought not to be, but no blame attaches to the rural workers, because they have been seeking a conference for months, and the employers have declined to meet them. If such a conference took place, I am certain that many of the difficulties which some honourable members see in the way would be removed, and that there would be a satisfactory settlement of the dispute. Only by treating your workmen well can you get the very best out of them. I hope bhat w.e are not going to degenerate into the low conditions that prevail in other parts of the world. If the man on the land generally would only r id himself of the incubus upon him in the shape of the middleman-if he would only do his own marketing, as the dairy farmers are doing at present-h e would have ample funds to enable him to pay the rural worker all that he requires. In conclusion, let me express the hope that we shall hear no more of this reviling of the. Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, and that he will be allowed to carry on his work in a manner conducive to the welfare of the bank and of the people. The bank may not show very big figure records, but it has served the country well by preventing other institutions in Australia from charging still higher rates of interest. But for the National Bank, we should have had to pay far more than even the exorbitant rates of interest that have been charged of recent months. As a result of the action of the Commonwealth Bank in lending money at reasonable rates, the rates charged by other banks have been brought down. In that respect alone, it has conferred a great benefit on the people. cannot borrow what he desires from the bank itself, he has been able, by reason of its from other banks at lower rates than would otherwise have been possible. I protest once more against the way in the Minisber has probably so involved which some of the figures have been prehimself bhab ib will nob be possible forsented in the Budget, and trust that we him to alter the terms of the agreement. shall hear no more from the representaThe service, no doubt, will be an imtives of the producers in regard to their proved one; but I , in common with many inability to pay what is asked by the rural workers, or the wages that might be fixed on appeal to the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court. I hope that resort will be had to that Court. The Labour party are in favour of all these matters being adjusted in a reasonable way, and I believe that the difficulty in regard to the rural workers can be satisfactorily settled only by resorb to the Conciliation and Arbitration Court. A Wages Board award would not be satisfactory. A Wages Board sitting in New South Wales might determine upon certain rates for that State, whilst a totally different scale of wages might be fixed by a Wages Board in Victoria; whereas an award of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitratiou Court would apply equally to all parts of Australia where the work could be carried on under similar conditions. Why should a man working on one side of the Murray receive lower wages than a man on the other side ? Nothing leads to more turmoil and industrial unrest than does differentiation between men doing the same kind of work. I also trust that the Ministry will consider my suggestion that a delegation of practical men, representing all kinds of rural work, should be sent abroad, and thab, on their return, they should deliver lectures on the results of their investigations. Other countries are doing the same kind of thing, and if we do not wish bo fall behind in our rural industries, I think that we ought to adopt that course. I wish to bring under the notice of the Government a non-party question, which, is of very great importance to Tasmania. A t the outset, I must express my indebtedness to the southern press-and particularly to the Daily Post and the Hobart Mercury-for the information which I propose to put before the ComEveni f the man on the land mittee. The Government recently enbered inbo a conbract with the shipping' companies for an improved mail serviceestablishment, to obtain money between Tasmania and the mainland. 1 do not know whether the contract has yet. been signed, but, even if it has not been,,",26,Threshing Grain
90,Mr Lairdsmith (Denison) [5.42]..,"other citizens of Tasmania, and particularly the commercial section of the community, believe that we are paying too much for our whistle. The Government are about to pay an additional subsidy of £2,000 a year-o r a total of £15,000 per annum-for the purpose of securing better shipping facilities between Tasmania and the mainland. In southern TasmaniaI refer to the Derwent-w e have one of the finest harbors in the world. Commanders of ocean-going steam-ships support this statement, and also say that it is the cheapest port any vessel can enter. Mr Murdocha member of the Marine Board, and also a member of the Legislative Council of Tasmania, and no one would accuse a member of that House of having Labour sympathies-state s that the cost of entering the Derwent is about one-fourth the cost of entering any other port in the Commonwealth. wharf has just been constructed by day labour at Hobart, and I understand that there is 65 feet of water alongside, so that it is possible to accommodate there the largest ship afloat. In the circumstances, we naturally expected that this would be one of the first ports of call; and we hope that, in the near future, it will become a distributing centre for many of the ports of Australia. Afc the present time, however, freights from the United Kingdom to Hobart are higher than from the United Kingdom to any other part of the Commonwealth. reason for this I cannot give. A little information on fche subject might have been given at a recent meeting of the Hobart Marine Board had not a member deeply interested in the shipping companies stopped a discussion of fche subject by raising a point of order. strongly recommend lionorable members to read a sub-leader which appeared in fche Daily Post of 26fch ultimo, entitled, "" The Scandal of Freight,"" and another article of a similar character, which appeared on the 28th ultimo. The Hobart Mercury of the 26th ultimo also published an interesting article on the subject. Both these newspapers have taken up the question, which is a non-party one, and I would strongly recommend the honourable member for Franklin and the honourable member for Wilmot to read the articles to which I have referred. If they would co-operate with representatives of Tasmania oh this :side of the House, it might be possible Mr Laird Smith. to bring fco bear on fche Government) sufficient pressure fco cause action fco prevent the people of Tasmania being charged such high rates as they have to pay for the carriage of produce and general merchandise. It is somewhat remarkable that the only article of commerce the freight on which from the Old Country is the same to all parts of Australia is t in plate. T in plate is largely used in the making of cans required by jam manufacturers, and we have in Tasmania the largest; jam factory in Australia. I find fchafc fche freight on t in plate is 27s. 6d. per ton to Hobart, and precisely the same to Melbourne or Sydney. Bufc from Liverpool to Melbourne or Sydney the freight on other articlesis 31s. 3d., as against 43s. 9d. per ton to Hobart. The freights on nails are as follow: A new London to Melbourne or Sydney, 22s. 6d. per to n ; London to Hobart, 36s. 3d. per ton. Then, again, nails are landed at Hobart and run through to Launceston by rail. They are delivered at Launceston for only 35s. a ton, although fche railway freight from Hobart fco Launceston has to be paid. The constituents of the honourable member for Franklin, and the constituents of the honourable, member for Wilmot, are large users, of nails for orchard and other work, and those honourable members should, therefore, be keenly alive fco fchis anomaly. Ifc is about 1,200 The miles from Hobart to Auckland and Wellington, and the same class of material is carried there for 22s. 6d. per ton, or 12s. per ton less than to Hobart. In the case of fencing wire, another commodity used by farmers and others on the land, the freight from London to Melbourne or I would Sydney is 26s. 3d. per ton; while to Hobarti t is 36s. 3d., or 10s. more. . The freight on barbed wire from London to Melbourne or Sydney is 21s. 3d. per ton, and to Hobart, 36s. 3 d . ; but it can be sent right through to Auckland and Wellington for 23s. 9d. per ton. Freight on galvanized iron from London to Melbourne or Sydney, is 26s. 3d., and to Hobart, 30s.; while if sent through by rail to Launceston, it is 38s. 9d. In the case of rough-measurement cargo, the freight from London or Liverpool to Melbourne or Sydney is 45s. per to n ; to Hobart, it is from 52s. 6d. to 57s. 6 d . : while the same class of cargo can be sent fco New Zealand for 47s. 6d., and by one line of boats for 45s. are renewing the agreement. ment are renewing an agreement to bolster up a combine that exists between the shipping companies of Australia, to use the honourable member for Franklin's own words. company on the plea of getting a better mail service, so as to demonstrate to the people that they have no desire to establish a Commonwealth-owned line, because the Labour Government made a splendid suggestion to them to build their own line of steam-ships and run them between Tasmania and the mainland. They desire to be contrary in every way to the late Government, and, as usual, to build up private enterprise. bers on the other side represent private enterprise, aud desire to perpetuate a system that is really taking from the producer in the State of Tasmania money which should stay in his pocket. I cannot get a direct statement from any leg gentleman as to the powers of the InterState Commission: but I hope that that body will have power to look into such a question as this,and take steps to prevent the continuance of these'anomalies, which really give preference to certain tradespeople on the mainland. As the writer of the article' I have named puts it , under the existing system, it pays shippers to land material for Tasmania on the mainland, load it into the Interstate ships, and send it over to Tasmania in them. I remind the honourable member for Franklin, and the honourable member for Wilmot, that their power in this House is almost illimitable; because either of them can consider himself the Government's majority, and all he has to do is to hold up his finger in the House to compel the Government to do what he likes.

From the remarks of the honourable member for W i m mera. one would think that honourable members on this side of the House, and the Labour party generally, were totally opposed to immigration, or the introduction of people to settle on the land. Personally, I warmly welcome any one who comes here to settle, because every newcomer relieves the man who is already here of a certain part of the burden he The Governis bearing.

164,Mr Joseph Cook (Parramatta,"A few minutes ago a great personality, a member of thiB House, and a colleague of my own, passed away to that bourne whence no traveller returns. The Prime Minister has spoken kindly of his talents, and I agree with every word which the honourable gentleman' said in that regard. His work was, of course, more keenly appreciated by my colleagues and myself than it could be by tbose who were not so intimately associated with h i m in political matters. the Prime Ministeri n conveying to the widow and children whom the late Mr Roberts has left behind him our sympathy and our appreciation of the great services he has rendered his State and the Commonwealth in his public capacity and otherwise. He was, as you know, Mr Speaker, a man of singular intellectual ability, of a disposition strenuous and arduous. bable, as has been remarked before, that his desire to carry out his public duties faithfull y contributed to and hastened his end. The Prime Minister seemed to in dicate in his utterances that tbere is a fatality attaching to our meeting in this place. tend to suggest that. have stated on previous occasions that, in my opinion, this chamber and this building are not healthy places. occasions upon which we do riot desire to enter upon any controversial matters, but it is our bounden duty to look after those who live, seeing that .we cannot help the dead back to life. I trust that, as my late colleague is no longer with us, the widow and children will be comforted by those Powers who are unseen, but by whom many are comforted and consoled in the hour of trial and suffering. Apart from that consolation, I feel sure that the widow, children, relatives, and friends of the late MrE . A . Roberts will be consoled by the feeling that his public services have done something to add to the comfort of others, since, according to his lights, he lost no opportunity in bis public capacity to help his fellow man. I join with the Prime Minister in the statement that, while it is yet our privilege to render some public service, we should not delay in giving the best that we have. I [133] can only add, at a time like this, that if these visitations are likely to be as frequent as they have been, few of the original members of the Federal Parliament w ill be here in the course of a very few years. Tbe mortality amongst them has undoubtedly been very great, and I hope that we have seen the last of these tragic endings to the lives of representatives of the people in this Parliament.
