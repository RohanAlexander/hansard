Whaling Ms ANNETTE ELLIS (Canberra) (4.01 pm)-I rise today to speak on the government’s failure, as I see it, to protect some of nature’s most graceful and magnificent creatures: the humpback and minke whales. These wonderful gentle giants of the sea, renowned for their long oceanic treks around the world, their unique communal hunting, communications and social activities, are still unforgivably being hunted and killed. But, what is worse, they are being killed and slaughtered in Australian territorial waters. Many people today may be thinking to themselves, ‘Hang on. Surely we banned that sort of thing ages ago.’ And they would be right in thinking that. Whaling was officially banned in Australian waters in 1981 when the Whale Protection Act 1980 came into effect. This was back in time when Australia was one of the leaders in the international efforts to protect whales. Australia also played a key role in the declaration of the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary in 1994. Under Australia’s Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, it is made very clear that killing whales in the Australian Antarctic Territory is illegal. Whales in Australian waters are protected by Australian law and it is time the government enforced its own legislation. The Prime Minister’s 2001 election policy on whales stated: The government has strengthened domestic legislation protecting Australia’s whale and dolphin species. Under the EPBC Act, Australia’s entire Exclusive Economic Zone has been formally declared the Australian Whale Sanctuary. This offers unprecedented protection for all [whales and dolphins]. Since 1994, the Australian Antarctic Territory has been part of our exclusive economic zone. However, since 2000 Japanese factory ships have slaughtered over 400 whales within Australia’s waters as part of Japan’s notorious ‘scientific’ whaling program. Australia has a proud history on environmental issues such as preventing the slaughter of whales. Given this proud record, current moves by Japan to increase its killing of whales should be strongly opposed. Unfortunately, the values of those progressive and enlightened governments of the past do not seem to be reflected by the federal government today. I would like to congratulate, however, the state and territory governments who have joined with the federal opposition in condemning the Howard government for its failure to effectively oppose the proposed slaughter of humpback whales and the proposed increase in the slaughter of minke whales.

I also draw attention to the fact that I have launched a petition within my electorate which is being picked up very quickly by my community, who are going to add their voice to mine here today, calling for the stopping of this action-the slaughtering of minke and humpback whales-by Japan, and by any others for that matter. I call on government members to join us in putting all the pressure we can on Japan to ensure that this terrible slaughter is not allowed to occur. Reconciliation Dr STONE (Murray-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration (4.03 pm)-In this week, when we are thinking about reconciliation-the ongoing business of bringing our various races in Australia towards a better understanding of each other’s history-I thought it would be useful to remind ourselves of how far we have come. I want to refer to a document that is in a book that I had published in the 1970s called Aborigines in White Australia. It is a documentary history of the attitudes affecting official policy and the Australian Aborigines between 1697 and 1973. This is a quote from the Hansard of the progress report of the Royal Commission on the Aborigines, in July 1913. It comes from the South Australian parliamentary papers. The chairman, the Hon. J Jelly, asks Mr EC Stirling, an expert in Indigenous affairs at the time, stated: I would like to refer to the half-caste children. My opinion is that the more of those half-caste children you can get away from their parents and place under the care of the State the better. I think you should take them at an early age. Supposing they were taken charge of by the State Children’s Department it would be easier to deal with them if they were taken when they have the attractiveness of infancy. There is always something attractive in the infants of all races, whatever be the color. You would get people to take those children young who might be disinclined to take them when they were older. I think that it is the best way to save the half-caste children-take them away from their surroundings. When they are caught young they are far less inclined to revert to their old state. There is a strong tendency among the half-castes when they have grown up to go back to the ways of the natives. They are far less likely to do that after they have had a long contact with civilization. The Hon. J Jelly asks: What would be a suitable age to remove them? Mr Stirling answered: I think when they are about 2 or 3 years of age. The question was asked: You would not recommend that they be taken away when they are absolute infants? Answer from Mr Stirling: No; because then you would have the burden of them that all children are at such a young age. When they are a couple of years of age they do not require so much attention and they are young enough to be attractive. Question from Hon. J Jelly: Do you think that their experience of two years with the black mother would seriously interfere with them? MAIN COMMITTEE",139,Statements By Members
205,Ling What He Feels Should Be Brought To The Attention Of The Royal Commission Review. Mr Stir,"Answer from Mr Stirling: No. There would not be time for them to establish habits and customs. I am quite aware that you are depriving the mothers of their children, and the mothers are very fond of their children; but I think it must be the rising generation who have to be considered. They are people who are going to live on. We have come a long way since 1913. Thank goodness! I commend our government for the work it is doing in making better the lives of all our Indigenous fellow citizens, especially the stolen generations. I commend our Prime Minister’s recent statement to the nation giving our government’s support for all things that will help, both symbolically and materially, in our progress towards walking together in the next century. Ms Cornelia Rau Dr LAWRENCE (Fremantle) (4.07 pm)-I want to argue today in favour of a royal commission into the unarguably unlawful detention of Cornelia Rau and the treatment that she received while in detention. I have spoken to a lawyer representing Cornelia Rau and I am aware of work by the University of Newcastle Legal Centre. There are clear problems with the Palmer inquiry. It is no reflection on his integrity, simply a question of the process. Unlike a judicial proceeding, you cannot test the evidence. We do not know what evidence has been provided to Mr Palmer, so lawyers cannot ask questions about it, challenge the claims, collect relevant dissenting opinions and so on. One of the lawyers at least has had experience in dealing with DIMIA-the recent case in the South Australian Supreme Court is illustrative. Only after systematic questioning and independent psychiatric evidence did a clear picture emerge of the treatment of two detainees in Baxter. Rau’s lawyer has also been refused funding to enable independent psychiatric assessment or to pursue the questioning of witnesses-mainly detainees who are reluctant to give evidence to Mr Palmer for fear there may be retribution in their cases. The University of Newcastle Legal Centre, acting on behalf of the family, have also raised serious questions about the adequacy of the Palmer inquiry. Limited powers and narrow terms of reference might not allow the identification of systemic failures and those who are responsible for them-it is about what happened, and not why. As I mentioned, there is no protection for detainees alleging potential criminal misconduct. Two such people approached me while I was at Baxter and I have passed that information on to Mr Palmer. But, again, those people are not available for direct testimony. It appears from the terms of reference that the Palmer inquiry will not address questions of the lawfulness of Rau’s detention and may fail to look at the question of her treatment and the provision of adequate care. In my view anyone who is in the sick culture that now pervades DIMIA is unlikely to get adequate care. Palmer is already reported as recommending an open inquiry with judicial powers, after some 200 more cases have been dumped in his lap. He suggests that the Ombudsman might be an appropriate person to conduct that inquiry. I want to argue today, very briefly, against that proposition, based on my own experience with the Ombudsman’s inquiry into the December 2003 disturbances in Port Hedland. At my request the Ombudsman undertook inquiries. DIMIA appointed Keith Hamburger to conduct an internal investigation. The Ombudsman determined that it was ‘professional and independent’. He wrote to me outlining briefly 67 findings and 37 recommendations. The key ones would have prevented what has just happened in Baxter if they had ever been made public and acted upon. He reassured me that the MAIN COMMITTEE inappropriate detention of people in management support units and their inadequate care would be the subject of change by the department. I have never been able to get a copy of that report under FOI. It remains languishing somewhere on someone’s desk in DIMIA. More than a year ago this material would have been available to the department and in the public arena and I believe would have prevented what has happened to Cornelia Rau and others. We need a full, public, open inquiry, with proper testing of the evidence, and with commitments from the department to systemic change, which is clearly the problem in this case. No more pussyfooting around. (Time expired) Craigslea State High School Ms GAMBARO (Petrie-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence) (4.09 pm)-I would like to congratulate Craigslea State High School, one of the fine schools in my electorate, and to mention Kaye Gardner. Craigslea State High School has been chosen as one of 61 Australian schools to trial the federal government’s Family-School Partnerships Framework. Funding from this excellent package will enable the Craigslea State High School to implement and evaluate innovative ways of building strong partnerships between the school and the parents of the attending students. I think everyone in this place would agree that families have a major impact on the upbringing of their children and their achievements and that when schools and parents work in partnership the children perform better, stay in school longer, and enjoy their scholastic days much more. I want to congratulate all the stakeholders who have worked together to draft the structure for the Family-School Partnerships Framework. These include the Australian Council of State School Organisations, the Australian Parents Council and all the staff and students who participated in the program. I would like to take a moment to congratulate the Craigslea State High School on their very proactive approach to improving the standard and amenity of their school canteen. I understand that the P&C association and staff are working through a plan that will not only modernise the facility to the new standards that the community desires in the range of nutritional food available but also, quite innovatively, change the canteen from a place ‘where food is’ into a cafeteria that has the potential to become the social hub of the school and to have a positive impact on the whole tone of the school and school life. As well as achieving the desired result of a much more nutritious and innovative menu for students, it is envisaged that this modernisation will make the new cafeteria a far more attractive place in which parents will be delighted to volunteer to participate and, again, strengthen links between the school and parent communities. It is also pleasing to note that students are being actively encouraged to be part of this upgrade and that the P&C are strongly motivated in their support of this particular project. The two programs that I have just mentioned are the types of progressive development in education that I know members in this place strive to achieve for all of the schools in their electorates. I want to particularly thank all of the school community-the parents and all of the students at Craigslea State High School. I know that they are going to be the beneficiaries of a terrific canteen, or tuckshop, when it is finished. I thank them for their wonderful achievements to date and congratulate them once again. MAIN COMMITTEE Bambi Kindergarten issue of concern to families and an issue that impacts on workplaces. Not unsurprisingly, it is an issue that constituents of my electorate of Werriwa are also concerned about. I bring this issue to the attention of members not simply to pass comment on the government’s child-care policies but to draw the attention of members to the case of the Bambi Kindergarten in Ingleburn. Bambi Kindergarten is a not-for-profit preschool run by the community and established in 1952. It is currently facing eviction because the land on which it stands has been allocated by the Department of Defence to the new Edmondson Park development. The Bambi Kindergarten was established by the wives of soldiers serving in Korea. It acted as a support centre for families as well as an early childhood education centre. Edmondson Park development is not new and I do not stand here today objecting to it. I object to the actions taken by the Department of Defence, in being unwilling to secure some land within the development to retain this facility. I toured the facility in my by-election campaign and was informed by the kindergarten that on several occasions they had been provided with verbal assurances that the land would be secure and the lease renewed. Sadly, this facility is far from secure as the department has backed away from these assurances. Bambi Kindergarten has recently been offered a further, but final, annual lease. Needless to say, this news was received poorly. It left the management, staff and current users of the facility, as well as the community, generally questioning this government’s commitment to the provision of child care. Through the shadow minister for defence and homeland security, the Minister for Defence has been approached to consider options such as gifting the land and allowing the kindergarten to remain or assisting the kindergarten to secure alternative accommodation. To date, I have yet to receive a response from the minister. This kindergarten has a unique historical association with Australia’s defence community. I encourage the minister to intervene to make sure that it can continue to provide high-quality child-care services to the people of Prestons, Horningsea Park, Macquarie Links, Ingleburn and of course Edmondson Park. Child-care places are scarce enough. Why exacerbate the situation by closing down a facility with 200 child-care places per week, a facility that provides affordable child-care services and that has served the community for well over 50 years? Fisher Electorate grees. The sun is out and there is no breeze to speak of.

On the Sunshine Coast today some people have even managed to take a swim at one of our beaches. cludes most of Maroochy shire and the city of Caloundra, both of which will benefit from an influx of visitors when winter takes hold of the southern states and their cold well and truly sets in.

209,Mr Slipper,"It would not happen in Tasmania, my friend. My electorate of Fisher inThe weather is just one of the many reasons that so many people from interstate gravitate to the holiday mecca that is the Sunshine Coast. Winter on the coast is characterised by cool nights and warm days. However, even at 23 degrees today, the weather bureau, I am told, says winter appears to have come early to the Sunshine Coast this year: the average temperatures over recent days are lower than we would normally expect. But it does not change the daily movements of the local surfers, who are also enjoying the mild weather. The water may be a bit nippy but I imagine it is much more pleasant than conditions in the southern states. Visitors have a range of options as to what they can enjoy when they visit the coast. For some, it is a leisurely stroll along one of the beaches; for others, it is enjoying the outdoor dining at Mooloolaba. Some, of course, are content to simply enjoy time out, relaxing in the sun. It is easy to gloat when you come from such a beautiful part of the world as the Sunshine Coast. Not only are the water and weather pleasant but so are the people. Visit the coast and you will be greeted by many a happy smile. It is a good lifestyle on the Sunshine Coast, without the traffic snarls of the major cities and without the lengthy travel times to get to the places you want to go. The attributes of the coast are what help to attract a thousand new residents to Queensland each week. The population of the south-east corner of the state is 2.6 million and expected to grow to 3.7 million by 2020. On the Sunshine Coast we would expect our population to double over the next 10 to 15 years, as people move from the rustbelt areas of southern Australia to what is undoubtedly the best part of the country to live. I do not blame people for moving to the Sunshine Coast; the good things on the Sunshine Coast are hard to resist. I hear the forecast tomorrow is for yet another sunny day and 22 degrees. My friends opposite, eat your hearts out. Lyons Electorate complete support for two towns in my electorate-Zeehan and Queenstown. Some chardonnay-swilling, towny journalist from a publication by the name of Australian Traveller has had the audacity to say that Zeehan and Queenstown are ugly and are ‘must-flee holiday destinations’. This denigration of these two important Tasmanian working towns is not only stupid, even in fun, but plainly not true. All the west coast towns are mining towns, steeped in an incredible history which you have to know and touch. That history can be seen in the curious moonscape hills of Queenstown, in the architecture of the old part of Zeehan and the southern part of Queenstown, and in the opera house and the museums of both towns. This area is a photographer’s dream. Many tourists I have met who may have come for a day end up staying for three or four because there is so much to do and see, if you like your history real and still being formed. You cannot argue with the fact that Dame Nellie Melba sang in the Zeehan opera house; that our own Tasmanian princess, Mary, took her new husband, Prince Frederik, there; and that Princess Anne has also been a visitor. They thought Zeehan was well worth a visit. Neither town has masses of expensive restaurants, shopping malls or trendy coffee shops, but that is immaterial to the real traveller, the one who wants to know what a country is made of, how it became what it is today. MAIN COMMITTEE",143,Statements By Members
210,Mr Adams (Lyons) (4.17 Pm),"I want to take this opportunity to put on the record myThe west coast is a region made up of a number of small towns, all with different functions, and set among some of the finest wilderness in the world. It is sold as a whole experience. The west coast produces the wealth of Tasmania in all sorts of ways, and one of those is tourism. Others are mining, forestry and fishing. So if you want a real experience, forget those seagull critics, take a trip to Zeehan and marvel at the conditions people lived in only 100 years ago. Follow the coast down to Strahan and then hop onto our beautiful Abt railway up to Queenstown, where the local people will give you a warm west coast welcome. Western Tasmania is wild, wet, rugged and quite beautiful-all of it. There is no experience like it. Miss it at your peril! Honours and Awards: Medals Lyons and his comments, and I agree with him entirely. I would like to raise the matter of wearing of unofficial, purchased or commemorative medals on the left breast. Following the 2005 ANZAC Day ceremonies it was brought to my attention that several personnel were wearing bought, unofficial medals together with their official medals on their left breast. I know that many veterans have also approached the President of the Townsville branch of the RSL, Rod McLeod, about this concerning matter. Australia’s honours and awards system has been recognised throughout the world as being beyond reproach. Medals have never been awarded without detailed justification. Indeed, the recently amended Defence Legislation Amendment Bill increased penalties awarded for personnel wearing official medals to which they have no entitlement. However, there has been no corresponding legislation to preclude anyone-veteran or nonveteran-from buying any number of unofficial medals and wearing these on their left breast, either with or without official medals. To the general public these people appear to be veterans who have rendered invaluable service to our nation. In reality, they are denigrating the real official medals worn with justifiable pride by veterans. Many of these official medals have been awarded for active service which has involved, sadly, loss of life or which has seen personnel wounded physically or psychologically. If we do not do something to preclude the wearing of these unofficial medals on the left breast, our highly regarded honours and awards system will become a sham. I am aware that a succession of ministers has indeed examined this particular issue and, unfortunately, the gobbledegook that comes back from the department has to be seen to be believed. You get words like this: ... the Directorate of Honours and Awards has sought and received some legal advice on this complex issue. However, further detailed advice is required before options can be formulated to address this issue and determine a way forward. The Directorate of Honours and Awards has sought further legal advice and a response is awaited ... Too right-a response is awaited. New South Wales Working Women’s Centre Ms GEORGE (Throsby) (4.23 pm)-I have been contacted by the Illawarra Legal Centre over the last couple of days concerning the possible closure of the New South Wales Working Women’s Centre and I have been requested to pursue the matter here in parliament. It appears that the centre is faced with somewhat of a funding crisis. Originally the grant to establish the MAIN COMMITTEE",144,Statements By Members
211,Mr Lindsay (Herbert) (4.20 Pm),"I could not fail but be associated with the member forcentre was in the order of almost $300,000, which has reduced to $240,000 in the last budget-a decrease in real terms of up to 37 per cent. When the financial problems began to emerge, the funding from the federal government, originally instituted by a federal Labor government, was added to by a $100,000 contribution by the state government. The centre looks as if it might have to close its doors because the demand for its services is outstripping the financial capacity of the organisation to remain viable. I have a particular interest in these centres because, as I indicated, they were first established by a federal Labor government and the purpose of their creation was to provide information, advice and assistance on work related issues for women, particularly women who may not have been members of a trade union and women who were not able to access legal services through payment for those services. Originally they were established in New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania and the Northern Territory. On all accounts these working women’s centres have performed well and provided a very valuable service. The linchpin of the centre in New South Wales is its telephone advisory service, which provides confidential support, information, advice and assistance to women who ring. I am told by the centre that the issues of common concern relate to unfair dismissal, discrimination on the basis of pregnancy and caring responsibilities. The demands for the services of working women’s centres are growing the more the labour market is deregulated. It would be a great tragedy if the New South Wales centre is forced to close. It is the only specialist community legal centre in New South Wales for employment related advice and representation for women. In its 10 years of service to working women it has developed a particular expertise in the interface between employment and discrimination law. I believe the government should urgently address the funding problems that beset this centre and that extra funding should be provided to ensure that the New South Wales centre remains open, accessible and viable and continues to provide support to women at work, many of whom as we know are now part-time and casual workers who are desperately in need of such assistance. (Time expired) Western Australia: Produce Pickers House a dreadful and unworkable situation that we have in the Kimberley region, and to a lesser degree in the Gascoyne region of Western Australia-that is, the shortage of produce pickers. It is something that is being experienced right across the horticultural areas of Australia and we are not finding the solution that we need. Sure, there have been a couple of programs introduced such as the working holidaymaker program, under which we have reciprocal arrangements with a number of countries throughout the world, including the United Kingdom, Canada, the Netherlands, Japan, the Republic of Ireland, the Republic of Korea, Malta, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Hong Kong, Finland, Cyprus, France, Italy, Belgium, Taiwan and now Estonia. But with all those arrangements in place to allow students and working people between 18 and 30 to come to this country for 12 months-and, if they work in a seasonal activity in a regional area for three months, to apply for another 12 months-we still have not come anywhere near to solving the problem. My good folk in Kununurra, specifically the members of the Kimberley Primary Industries Association, have made investigations in Thailand. They have established that there is a large MAIN COMMITTEE",145,Statements By Members
212,Mr Haase (Kalgoorlie) (4.26 Pm),"I rise this afternoon to bring to the attention of thelist of ready and willing workers to come to Australia from Thailand to contribute their efforts. However, I am not for a moment advocating that we permit an unfettered avalanche of unskilled employees to come to Australia. In this regard I am pleased that the minister has told me that a work and holiday program is being negotiated with Thailand and will see 100 unskilled workers allowed to come and work and holiday in Australia. That is a maximum of only 100. The prime problem in the Gascoyne region of Western Australia and in the Ord Valley at Kununurra is that they are a long way from the bright lights of south-east Australia. Almost 100 per cent of these workers would prefer to be in that south-east Australian region where they can flit a couple of hundred kilometres, get involved in some picking work and then qualify for another 12 months stay while always being on the fringe of those bright lights. What we need to do is come up with some solution that will see these people penetrate through to some distances from south-east Australia. My growers are prepared to foot the bill for some transport, accommodation et cetera if these workers will only come to the Ord Valley. The question is: how do we effectively communicate that? Even though we have some web sites in place today, it is not enough. We need a solution for agricultural workers.

It is his 10th budget and, if my memory serves me correctly, the eight in surplus. Good economic management does not happen by chance; it has to be planned for. The measures we take now will undoubtedly have a very major impact on the Australian people and the Australian economy in years to come. As the Treasurer has said, measures taken in the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2005-2006 and cognate bills will prepare the country for the great demographic changes that are now taking place and anticipated to take place in the next decades. Those changes will undoubtedly reshape our communities over the next several decades. It is never an easy task to work through the many competing demands for funding and achieve a balanced budget in terms of both the bottom line and the competing interests. Like other developed countries, Australia has many challenges, and the added considerations of managing the finances over what is a very vast landscape with a relatively small population base are quite a challenge. The matter of clean water provision, for example, and maintaining a strong environment policy are both very big ticket items for the government, and the government is to be commended for the policies that it has worked through to date with local communities. One of the features of the government’s environment policy is that its detail is worked out with local communities, and local communities help to extend the value of the dollars spent on environmental work and remediation because of the numbers of volunteers who become involved in these projects. The government backs this commitment with a substantial injection of funding and has done so now over several budgets. On this occasion, some $200 million will go to conserve water and improve the state of local rivers and waterways. Once again, I am aware that in many electorates throughout Australia people are working voluntarily in these areas and extending the value of those dollars in their communities. Many dedicated people work in the electorate of Pearce, often on a voluntary basis, to improve the environment and conserve water. One again, the government’s commitment to working with local communities is an excellent one. I have seen evidence of that in many of my country towns. Having a large country electorate and a large geographical area to look after, I see the work that is done in country towns, and it is impressive. One of my country towns, Northam, for example, with a population of about 5,000 people, has won a number of awards for its ecohouse. The ecohouse shows and demonstrates to people how they can conserve energy and water. It is very popular. It has become quite a talking point in the town and a place where many tourists like to go. They can try first-hand and see first-hand how they can, with some simple measures, conserve energy and water in their own homes. The house that has been used as the ecohouse model in Northam, and partially funded by the federal government, is a very old house-I think these MAIN COMMITTEE",146,Statements By Members

214,Mrs Moylan (Pearce) (4.30 Pm),"Firstly, I congratulate the Treasurer on another suchouses go back to about the 1950s-so it was quite a challenge for the local council and others helping with this project to find ways in which to conserve energy in an old structure. I would also like to mention the farmers in my electorate who rely on the health of their land for their ongoing living. Farmers know the value of conservation and in my area they work very hard to ensure sustainable agriculture. One of the issues they have been very concerned about over recent times is the eradication of weeds. We have a weed in many parts of the Pearce electorate called Paterson’s curse. It is a huge problem and it has spread alarmingly throughout the electorate. These days, because of good transport routes, a lot of areas in my electorate have become closer to the city and hobby farms have been taken up by city people who are often not there all the time to manage the land as well as perhaps some of the people who have lived on the land all their lives and live on the land and work on the land 24/7. Paterson’s curse has been spreading and a number of constituents have been to see me and have contacted me about what they see as an increasing problem throughout the electorate. I know for them the $60 million that the government has set aside in this budget for weed eradication will be very welcome. The program will include research, biological control, community awareness and action. Assistance will be given to the livestock industry to introduce the National Livestock Identification Scheme for cattle, with work progressing on an identification system for sheep, although this is primarily a state government responsibility. Although there are cattle farmers in my electorate, the livestock farmers are predominantly sheep farmers and I know that these measures will be particularly welcome. In an electorate such as Pearce, which covers around 26,000 square kilometres, roads are a very big issue. We have been very pleased that our minister has committed large sums of money in the past to improve the two main arterial roads-the Great Eastern Highway, which connects my electorate and indeed, WA, to the eastern seaboard, and the Great Northern Highway, which runs through my electorate connecting the northern pastoral and mining areas to the city, the airport and the wharf at Fremantle. So they are particularly important roads. Over the years these roads have fallen into disrepair. It is also true to say that the volume and the extent of traffic traversing these roads has grown enormously, with a lot of large trucking, as you can imagine, coming down from the northern mining areas. These trucks have increasingly taken to the roads and the roads are just not adequate to deal with them. With the intersection of these two roads-one from the east one from the north-west-the works take on important dimensions for industries, businesses and tourism within the Pearce electorate. When we talk about roads we have to think about the mums and dads and the ordinary folk who have to use those roads every day to take kids to school, and we have to think about the school buses that run every day in a country electorate. It is of increasing concern to the general public that these roads are in a safe condition for all kinds of traffic. It is very pleasing now to see the work taking place to improve a very large section of the Great Eastern Highway between Sawyers Valley and The Lakes. That is a very welcome improvement to what has been a notorious stretch of road which has caused the deaths of a number of people. A further $3 million of the funding will be used to build the Clackline bypass in 2006-07. I know my constituents will be pleased with the news that black spot funding will continue, as it has been used on many occasions to deal with particularly dangerous conditions such as poor visibility, surface works and widening and alignment in particularly bad spots of the road-and there are many. Earlier in the year, $330,000 was allocated to improving a roundMAIN COMMITTEE about in the town of Northam, which I have spoken about as the town of the ecohouse, and an improvement to a section of the northern Cranbrook Road south of Beverly was allocated $250,000. I would like to put on record that I am grateful for the work of the local community groups and shires that keep me up to date with problem areas and assist me with presentations to our minister to ensure that the roads in the electorate are safe. I am often out on the road with community groups, looking at dangerous spots. They are always the eyes and ears of the electorate and I find it very useful to have these people alerting me to various difficult transport or road safety issues. Moving away from the subject of roads and the economy, can I say that it is heartening to see money being given to carers in this budget. That builds on previous budgets. I had the great pleasure of being the Minister for Family Services when the Howard government first took office. The Prime Minister took a very personal interest in the issue of carers. It was not until the Howard government came in that carers were substantially given a voice in this place. The Prime Minister recognised that many families in our communities care for chronically ill people, people with profound disabilities and the elderly, and that they were doing that with very little support from government a few years ago. In almost every budget, the government has sought to improve the situation for those many families around the nation who care for other members of the family. There is increased support for families and I know that it will be of great assistance to those who care for a family member who is chronically ill, profoundly disabled or ageing. Targeted funding to specific areas of health, including cancer care and dementia, are also welcome announcements. Cancer is a disease that touches the lives of most people at some time. Funding for screening, which allows early intervention, is a measure to save lives that is well known in the medical profession. I am also pleased to see health measures that will target young people, with a youth campaign to discourage young people from taking up smoking. In addition to that, we have had some important changes to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. I know that it requires people to make a small contribution to the cost of their medications. The Treasurer pointed out, and it is important for us all to understand, the cost of many life-extending drugs. The Treasurer used the case of Herceptin, which is used to treat breast cancer. The cost of that drug is around $50,000 to $100,000 per patient per year. Having established in this House an informal backbench group concerned about diabetes, I know that there are many advances in many areas of medicine and pharmaceuticals. These are often life-saving advances. If everyone makes a small contribution to the cost of the medications that they receive to enhance and improve the quality of their lives, it means that more drugs can become available to more people with serious illnesses and, hopefully, either sustain life or improve the quality of life. That is certainly the case with diabetes where there have been some very important advances in recent years with medications that can prevent the early onset of the worse aspects of diabetes, type 2 in particular. It is important that we ask people to make some contribution towards the cost of their medications so that we can ensure that all Australians have access to life-saving and life-enhancing medications. The Treasurer made the point, and I think it is true, that sometimes, if people get medications for nothing, there can be a tendency towards hoarding. That is quite well documented. MAIN COMMITTEE Many people-I guess we are all guilty of it-have medications in their medical cabinet that are unused and that are subsidised quite heavily by government. With an ageing population and life expectancy increasing, dementia presents a considerable challenge to us for the future. I recently had the pleasure of meeting with Professor Martins, who is an internationally respected Western Australian researcher into Alzheimer’s disease. I have to say his presentation was compelling and disturbing, so I was very pleased to see some of our budget directed towards managing Alzheimer’s disease. The Treasurer allocated $321 million to increase extended aged care at-home places, and the package makes provision for dementia specific training for carers, community and residential care workers, and people working in services such as the police and transport and emergency services. This is quite an important step forward. One of the greatest threats to world peace and stability continues to be abject poverty. We live in a region where many people lack the most basic necessities of life. Opportunity for education and improved access to health care and the ability to become self-sufficient are crucial to tackling the worse ravages of poverty and, in turn, promoting greater community and regional harmony. No countries today live in a vacuum. We are all part of the bigger world. We are part of an important region, and some parts of that region are very poor indeed-you only have to look at some of the Asia-Pacific countries to see that. On Monday, I put a motion to the House with regard to the spread of HIV-AIDS in the western part of China on the border of Laos, north Vietnam and Burma. The number of new cases of HIV-AIDS that have been registered is very disturbing. It is also disturbing to hear from local officials that the spread to mothers and their children is also alarmingly high. SoI am particularly pleased that the government does remain committed to playing its part to ease the burden of poverty on our near neighbours. It is in our national interest to assist our neighbours, and this government has been generous in its commitment to many countries in the Asia-Pacific region as well as other countries. However, the centrepiece of the budget is the tax cuts, and these have been made possible through the ability of the Howard government to manage the economy. We expect the economy to grow steadily at three per cent in 2005-06. Unemployment is now at a 28-year low, and it is anticipated that that will stay at a low level. A strong economy with low unemployment is one of the most positive ways to ensure that all Australians improve their circumstances. Having the opportunity to work is one of the best ways to avoid the poverty traps that so many families on welfare face and, along with tax cuts for all taxpayers, I am broadly supportive of the Welfare to Work measures and the money that the government has committed to assisting people to move from welfare to work. I say ‘broadly supportive’ because we must watch this support very carefully. Raising children alone is a very onerous task, and people with a disability have an added challenge in accessing the work force. These people need a lot of support. Adequate child care, decent wages, opportunities to improve education and skill levels, and access to transport and workplaces are all key issues for these people. It is my hope that we will closely monitor the implementation of this policy to ensure adequate support. In the short time. I have left, I pause to address the issue of mental health. I have spoken to our government about the concerns I have for people with mental health issues and their access to the work force. Most of these people want to work and are very capable of working, MAIN COMMITTEE but many of them have an illness which is of an episodic nature and sometimes renders them unable to work on an episodic basis. For them, finding consistent employment is sometimes quite a challenge. I think we have a deficiency in our response across the whole mental health system, particularly at the state level. It is important that we are mindful of some of the most disadvantaged and poorest in our community and that we always ensure that, in the implementation of the policies, these people are given fair access to supporting services. on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2005-2006 and related bills, about a subject that I have canvassed on many occasions. It relates to government and it relates to regulation. It relates to government’s role in regulating predatory practices by major corporations with enormous market power who exercise that power on a group of small businesses. This is an issue that I have raised over several years in the hope that the government would take some action to protect the rights of a number of small business people around the country. I am speaking about the motor vehicle insurance industry and its relationship with the smash repair industry. In particular I want to talk about the predatory behaviour of the motor vehicle insurance companies and the consequences of that predatory behaviour. I believe-and in this place I am going to cite an incident-that the practices of these major insurance companies are creating the preconditions for a potentially lethal accident. The practices that they are forcing crash repairers to indulge in are resulting in unsafe cars being put back onto the street. That is a disgrace. Government has a responsibility to ensure that predatory practices being perpetrated by the major vehicle insurance companies on the vehicle smash repairers are stopped, and it does have the capacity to actually do this. I am aware of the fact that there is a Productivity Commission report of an inquiry into the smash repair business, a report which is currently being considered by the Treasurer. I believe it was handed to the Treasurer on 18 March. My understanding is that he has 25 sitting days to form a response. I say to the Treasurer that, in contemplating his response to the Productivity Commission report, he needs to look at, potentially, a mandatory code of practice. There has been some form of discussion in the past about a voluntary code of conduct or practice. My belief, from the experience that I have in talking to smash repair businesses across the country, is that we have gone past the point where it should be just a voluntary code of practice. There are too many incidents where major vehicle insurance companies are using their market power to force unsafe working practices on smash repairers. From a personal perspective, I just do not think a voluntary code is going to be satisfactory. I think there needs to be some legislative instrument that can be used. The motor vehicle insurance industry, around the 2000-01 period, had revenues of about $5 billion in premiums. So that is $5 billion in the year 2000-01 out of a total insurance pool nationally of about $21 billion. It is interesting that more than 90 per cent of all motor vehicle insurance business is done by just four companies: IAG, Suncorp, Promina and Allianz. What that means is that there are four companies with enormous market share. They have a sort of symbiotic relationship with about 5,000 smash repairers across the country. I have raised in this place before some of my concerns about the insurance companies’ use of unqualified assessors. These are people who, in my experience and from what I have been told by the smash repair businesses, are sent by insurance companies to deduce the value of the insurance repairs required to put a car back on the road. The information that I have from MAIN COMMITTEE",148,Appropriation Bill No 2 2005 2006 Appropriation Parliamentary Departments Bill No 1 2005 2006 Appropriation Bill No 5 2004 2005 Appropriation Bill No 6 2004 2005
215,Mr Byrne (Holt) (4.49 Pm),"I rise to speak in this place this evening, during the debatesome of the documents that I have cited quite clearly indicates that these people are simply not qualified to be making that assessment. In a sense, what they are also doing is creating artificially low assessment prices and then forcing the crash repairers to accept those prices. The other thing they are doing is using incentive programs to drive down the cost of a motor vehicle quotation by an assessor. This document from a major insurance company says, in writing, what happens if you meet certain benchmark standards or go underneath benchmark standards. You quote an average price for a vehicle. If in your overall pool of insurance assessment you meet a target where the quote falls below that, you get a bonus. This is a bonus for assessors to underquote on the real cost of smash repairs. When that happens, the smash repairers are forced to repair the car at a lower cost. These issues have been raised in the past and nothing has been done. But adding to that, and giving the Treasurer something to think about when he is contemplating this report by the Productivity Commission, are two further issues. One is the issue of cash settling. What has happened in recent times is that the insurance companies have basically asked the smash repairers to sign an agreement where they become a preferred repairer. That means thatparticularly for someone who has been a preferred smash repairer for 20 or 30 years-if they sign the agreement with the insurance company and that preferred repairer is not on the list, then they have to pay in some cases an additional premium to access that preferred repairer. But what is also happening is that a lot of smash repairers are being forced into a very restrictive arrangement with these major insurance companies. If a vehicle is smashed and needs repairing, the person-under RACV, for example-is obliged to go to the preferred repairers nominated by the insurance company. That sounds really good, but I question the relationship between those preferred repairers and the RACV, particularly when these people are relying upon them for customers, given the market share they have. I want to read a particular insight from a smash repairer who had some dealings with this and was very concerned about being forced into a preferred repairer agreement with the IAG. I will just read onto the record-and he has asked me to do this-some of his concerns about this. The document is titled ‘Paying for freedom of choice’ and reads: IAG Insurance intends to include a new provision in Motor Insurance Policies from November 15th 2004. That has already been done. The document continues: The inclusion will allow the policyholder to have freedom of choice in regard to who will repair their vehicle after an accident. This freedom of choice will cost the consumer an estimated $69.30 on top of their normal Comprehensive Insurance policy. It would appear the idea behind this venture is to achieve something IAG have been working on for several years. Basically the consumer (who believes they won’t have an accident and only take out insurance to be responsible and in case of bad luck) by not taking out the freedom of choice levy will hand over complete control and the right for IAG to do as they wish with the policyholder’s vehicle. The majority of the Auto Body Repair Industry in Victoria and NSW have signed IAG’s associate smash repair contract. In doing so, they have had to invest on online imaging and claims handling systems, which was part of the requirements after signing. The repairers were promised that, after becomMAIN COMMITTEE ing an ASR repairer, the arrangement and new equipment would simplify assessments and generally make it easier to do business with IAG. The new so-called freedom of choice policy (unless the vast majority of IAG clients takes it out) will completely do away with all ASR arrangements and the investments made by repairers. As failure by the insured to pay the extra levy on a policy renewal will take anyone other than a preferred IAG repairer out of the equation and do away with the insured’s freedom of choice. This exercise by IAG is nothing more than an effort to take control of vehicles they insure by using smoke and mirrors and relying on motorists gambling on whether or not they will have an accident. Freedom of choice for the consumer is supposedly a normal and expected part of life in Australia and something the ACCC was commissioned to protect and uphold for both the consumer and business communities alike. And certainly not an issue that can be used by a large company to take control of smaller competitors and the consumer. The fact that IAG has proposed such a schemeand it has been implementedshows contempt for both the Auto Body Industry and consumers alike. Especially at a time when the Government inquiry into the Body Repairer and Insurance industry relationship is currently being held. … … … If this policy is rubber stamped by the ACCC, it will have a catastrophic effect on the Body Repair Industry and open the door for the Insurance industry to put in place other such methods of control. It is signed ‘from a cranky crash repairer’-I will not read out the exact words. In a sense, what you have is an enormous insurance company with enormous leverage and market power forcing smaller businesses into an arrangement which does not provide freedom of choice. What happens to significant crash repair companies that are reputable and have been in the game but do not want to do this? What happens is that they are subjected, particularly if they have had an agreement with the RACV, to an operation called cash settling. If you are a crash repairer and you do not want to be an approved repairer or to sign that RACV contract or be an associate repairer, they say, ‘If a person comes to you and is insured by us and wants to get the car fixed up, normally we would ensure a fairly smooth process but unfortunately we are going to pay the customer directly after some period of time and then they can pay you.’ This is a standover tactic by major insurance companies over small crash repairers. Most crash repairers are small businesses. On average they employ six or fewer people. I want to refer to some documents that I have received from some of these smash repairers who feel very uncomfortable about what they are being subjected to. I contend that it is an abuse of market power. I will read these into the record; I have been asked to do this by the people concerned. The first document reads as follows: To whom it may concern Delphic Cove Pty Ltd has been providing the RACV with panel beating services since 1983. In that time, we have served both the RACV and our clients who were insured with them with services that do not suffer from interruption, confusion or delaying tactics. In 2003 RACV implemented a preferred repairer scheme and invited Delphic Cove Pty Ltd to participate. After reviewing the agreement and obtaining expert industry and legal advice, we chose not to be contractually bound to the RACV. MAIN COMMITTEE The consequences of this action have had adverse consequences for our clients. They have been threatened and inconvenienced in the following ways as set out in the table shown below. The table also sets out realistic times and conditions which clients should enjoy, in the absence of the tactics used by RACV to dissuade clients from exercising their right to freedom of choice. The table then describes the process in the cash settlement situation. Someone lodges a claim. Realistically that would be processed in about five minutes; with RACV it is a half-hour process. A book assessment process should be immediate; the RACV tactic is to take two weeks. An authority to proceed should generally involve no delay but it takes two weeks under the RACV. In a realistic situation, payment should take three days but it takes six weeks under the RACV. In a realistic situation a warranty should be for a lifetime, but under the RACV it is nil. There are also provisions for policy cancellation and other issues in terms of the individual I have just been referring to. Another assessment was carried out by Gerry Raleigh from Kerry Panels. Gerry is a person whom I regard as a person of integrity. He has been attempting to raise these issues of the abuse of market power for some time. He has asked me to read his statement to the House: The cash settling process used by RACV is nothing more than a spiteful effort to make those repairers who do not wish to sign an RACV contract conform. Cash settling by RACV means the consumer is inconvenienced, he will have to arrange the repairs himself, no warranty is offered by the Insurer, he must wait until he receives a cheque and then proceed with repairs. If his vehicle is not driveable then naturally he would probably buckle and use the RACV repairer. A repairer can have a working relationship with RACV for 20 years, but with the introduction of the RACV repairer contract if the body shop does not conform, a wedge is driven between himself and his customer. And that has happened time after time with this particular smash repairer. This person uses some fairly colourful language here and I read this advisedly: The RACV repairer contracts are akin to a Mafia protection racket, in other words we offer you nothing but if you do not sign we will make life very difficult for you. These are not my words. These are his words; the words of a small business person who has been subjected to this abuse of market power. He went on to say: A common practice is for the consumer who stands by his independent repairer to have his policy cancelled. Those are two incidents, and I have one more document that I need to read to the House. This document is important and it is from LP Bodyworks. The person who runs the business says: In these years of operating our business we have acquired quite a substantial customer base, for these reasons we have always tried to work with our industry affiliates such as the Insurance Sector. This is why I would like to express my concerns with some issues, in regards to the way “RACV” as we know is underwritten ... is conducting itself when they implement their “Cash Settling” process with, what they call their “Non Accredited” shops. I would like to make the forum aware that we have been affiliated with RACV in the past and ongoing processes for the last 10 years, but for obvious reasons we stopped our relationship with them two years ago when they decided to revamp their Preferred Repairer Network (PSR). We found that the way this particular Insurer was trying to influence or control the repairer processes, was not keeping the customer’s and the repairer’s views in mind, but simply at cost not quality and most importantly “safety and manufacturers specifications” when it comes to reinstating the consumer’s vehicle. MAIN COMMITTEE And that is a concern. It continues: This method that the RACV has imposed is nothing more than a ploy to inconvenience and use the customer as a lever hold on the repairer, hoping that they will give in to the pressure and steer them through their own repair networks. That is the third small business. There are many more incidents and there are many more complaints that I have received about the RACV and that cash settling process. Clearly this is abuse of market power and it is something that should be investigated. I note that the ACCC’s Graeme Samuel has said recently that they want to be notified if there are any big businesses using standover tactics, and they are looking at utilising section 51AC of the Trade Practices Act. I am going to suggest that these small businesses start writing to the ACCC. Unfortunately, these small businesses have been saying that they have been raising their concerns with the ACCC and that no action has been taken. But I will be asking each of those people to make submissions to ACCC Chairman Samuel on the basis of the comments that he has been reported to have made in the media. Another issue with respect to the practice of insurance companies is colloquially called a ‘cut and shut’ operation. What does cut and shut mean? There are many cute names and technical terms, but it effectively means that if a car is totalled, if a car suffers extensive damage, if a car-like in the incident that I am about to report-has been half smashed away, the car is cut in half and half a different car of a similar model is basically welded onto it. I would like to talk about the case of a Holden Berlina which was owned by Mrs Sharon Hooper. In May 2004 the car was smashed into from behind and was extensively damaged. It was insured for the value of just over $17,000. It was probably overinsured, but the premiums the Hoopers had been paying for a number of years had been paid on the basis that the car’s value was $17,000. Its actual assessment value would have been less than that. When the car was taken to the RACV’s preferred smash repairer, an extensive quotation was given-it was in the order of $8,000-but the owner and the owner’s husband, Mr Richard Hooper, were basically saying: ‘This car has been totalled. It has been written off. We do not understand why you are attempting to repair this, it is in such a bad state.’ The insurer, RACV, insisted on the car being repaired. The car was repaired. But when Mr Hooper walked in to see what was happening with the car, he noticed that it had been cut in half. He was not even told that this was what was going to happen with the vehicle. When he walked into the premises of the approved smash repairer that had been referred by the RACV, he was told it was a ‘cut and shut’ repair. Mr Hooper picked up the vehicle but, after a short period driving it he realised that it was handling poorly and that the driver’s seat felt different. There is an extensive list of faults, with 31 faults being listed. He took the car back and said, ‘This car is not functioning properly,’ and that he wanted a proper, independent assessment. He left the car there. When he came back to see the progress being made, he found them trying to fix those very faults that he identified. He then demanded, legally, that an independent assessment be conducted. I have a list of 31 faults. It is absolutely extraordinary. The fuel tank was incorrectly fitted. The fuel lines were not appropriately secured. So this car was in fact a death trap. Seatbelts were distorted. The front seatbelts were incorrectly fitted. The fuel lines were incorrectly fitted. The vehicle was driving around right-hand turns; it was on an automatic right-hand turn. This car MAIN COMMITTEE should have been written off. The insurance company should have had the integrity to have had this car written off. These cut and shut practices, not appropriately supervised, are a way for the insurance companies to cut costs. I will say to the RACV and other insurance companies: if you are going to keep on doing this, I am going to keep on raising it in parliament until you get it right. Stop screwing small independent business holders and start acting appropriately or I will urge the Treasurer, in considering the report from the Productivity Commission, to take the appropriate action and make a mandatory code of conduct. and Resources) (5.10 pm)-I rise this afternoon to add my voice to the debate on the appropriation bills and to proudly associate myself with the achievements of this government, particularly economic achievements, over the past 10 budgets that we have had responsibility for. This year is no different. There is an $8.9 billion surplus-the eighth surplus since we have been in government. The unemployment rate is at its lowest level in some 28 years and we are delivering some $21.7 billion worth of tax cuts to the Australian people over the next four years. This is on top of the $14.7 billion worth of tax cuts provided in last year’s budget. Another very significant point in this budget is the fact that we have now paid off $90 billion of debt that we inherited when we came to office in 1996. To put that in simple terms, in 1996 we were faced with the challenge of having to find $9.6 billion out of tax funds just to pay the interest on the accumulated debt that we walked into in 1996, before a cent could be paid towards any services to the Australian people. We are now in the situation for the next financial year of having reduced that debt to less than $6 billion, which of course means that we will have in excess of $9 billion in additional funds available to spend on the Australian people. Of course, the more debt we pay off, the more we can commit to other things-it is not rocket science. As the Treasurer said, this is not by accident. It certainly was not a fluke. This is an outcome of very sound economic management. The budget has been extremely generous to my electorate of Leichhardt. I certainly appreciate the contribution to a number of projects, including the ongoing flood proofing of the Bruce Highway at Tully, south of Cairns. There was an additional $2.9 million to assist the state government in their planning works for this program. There was $1.5 million allocated last year to get these works underway and to prioritise them. Unfortunately, the state government have continued to drag their feet. The planning work was supposed to be completed next month for the work to be finished in 2006-07, but we have now discovered that the state government has not been able to achieve this outcome. We have allocated another $2.9 million to see if that can help light a fire under the state government planning authorities to get something done there. It is certainly a serious economic and social impediment in Far North Queensland. Unfortunately, even at this stage we are probably looking at 2008-09, if they actually get their act together, to get it to completion. I have to say that sending the shadow minister from Victoria up there to become a poor apologist for the state government did not do anything for achieving this outcome. I think he would do a lot better if he were to encourage his state government colleagues to start to do some work rather than make excuses for not doing it. Russett Park was another good example of a commitment from this government. Half a million dollars was committed to the Russett Park community and to the Mareeba Shire MAIN COMMITTEE",152,Appropriation Bill No 2 2005 2006 Appropriation Parliamentary Departments Bill No 1 2005 2006 Appropriation Bill No 5 2004 2005 Appropriation Bill No 6 2004 2005
216,Mr Entsch (Leichhardt,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, TourismCouncil to put a three-metre causeway across a river. For many years the community, which is only about 15 to 20 kilometres from Cairns, has been stranded by that river. Unfortunately that river has taken two lives to date. In spite of a lot of huff and puff from the state government, with the money committed from the local residents, the council and the federal government, people will be able to drive onto a three-metre causeway. However, because of the state government’s reluctance to contribute, there will be quite a significant fall off one end because it is not going to be quite completed, and that is the legacy of the state government. I encourage the council and the residents to go ahead and do what they can to get as much of this completed as they can because, at the end of the day, if another life is lost in another wet season that will be squarely on the shoulders of the Labor state government. The Roads to Recovery program is another very successful one. In my electorate Cairns City Council will receive another $1 million-plus. There will be $700,000 for Cook Shire, a very large electorate; $166,000 for Douglas Shire; and $93,000 for Torres Strait. Since the Roads to Recovery program has come in the amount of bitumen that has been laid by local authorities is amazing. The money is going straight through to these local authorities and they are able to prioritise their work, keep their work force on the job-certainly not allowing anything to be cost-shifted back into the state government coffers-and you can certainly see the results. A good example of that was the opportunity I had the other day to open the new works at Aumuller Road, a four-lane highway. That work had been well overdue. Concrete slabs were laid by the American troops in the 1939-45 war and of course in the period since then the road has deteriorated significantly. The Roads to Recovery funding has allowed the Cairns City Council to upgrade this road to an excellent piece of infrastructure. The other thing in the budget which I was looking for and was very pleased to see was the additional $90 million in the black spot funding program. Again, this has provided vital funding in regional areas and, in my view, it has saved a lot of lives. You only have to drive on any of the highways in Cairns and outlying areas to see outstanding examples of work carried out under this program-work that certainly would not have been done if we were waiting for the state government to put their hands in their pockets. Another very successful funding achievement was $10 million for the Cairns Esplanade. This is on top of a $9 million spend that we had about three years ago, taking the total Australian government investment to some $19 million. The results of the work so far have been quite profound and not only for visitors to Cairns-although 40 per cent of its economy is reliant on tourism, and it is the second biggest international tourism destination to Sydney. The work that has been done on this esplanade area has certainly added to the experience of locals as well as to that of international visitors. It is amazing to see the number of locals who have come to love and enjoy this area. The additional $10 million is going to be able to finish the whole waterfront area of Cairns City and it certainly will make a huge difference to that area. Then there were the unsuccessful bids by the reef and rain forest CRCs last year. I remember that Senator McLucas was on her knees praying every night that they were going to fail, that they were never going to run, because that would give her something to criticise. She makes no effort whatsoever to get off her butt and do something about seeing if she can find MAIN COMMITTEE an alternative. Instead, she uses political opportunism just to criticise or knock for the sake of knocking to try to build her own political stakes. But there are those in the community who realise that the bids that were put in by both of those entities were not appropriate-that they did not fit the criteria-and they are prepared to work with me to find an alternative. Again, I would like to recognise the outstanding contribution of Russell Reichelt, CEO of the Reef CRC; Daniel Gschwind, CEO of the Queensland Tourism Industry Council; and John McIntyre, who was with TTNQ. Rather than criticise and make cheap political shots, as happened with Senator McLucas, they realised that there were problems and that we had to do something different, and they sat down and worked with me. As a direct result of the contribution of those three outstanding citizens, we now have the Marine and Tropical Sciences Research Facility for Far North Queensland, which has been funded with significantly more resources than both the reef and rainforest CRCs combined. There has been some $40 million to establish this magnificent, world-first facility-it will be the best in the world-in both Cairns and Townsville. It will be the premium facility in the world for reef and rainforest research. It will certainly attract a lot of interest from both the conservation and scientific communities around the world. James Cook University have been very excited by this, because it gives them another opportunity in relation to expanding options that are available through their campuses. This is on top of a veterinary school. A few years ago we announced a medical school for James Cook University-again, provided through good economic management by this government and strong lobbying by me-and the member for Herbert, Peter Lindsay, played a very significant role in achieving that. So we had the medical school, and now we have a veterinary school-and the funding has been set aside for that. Of course, the vicechancellor of James Cook University is very excited about the opportunities this will provide and some very significant and unique strengths and attributes will enhance the delivery of services of James Cook University. Another issue that has been of concern in my area-and, again, it has been addressed through this budget-is illegal fishing, particularly in the gulf and Torres Strait. Some 87 illegal fishing vessels were apprehended in northern waters this year alone, and we had to look seriously at dealing with the vessels that were impounded and held in the harbour, which was totally unsatisfactory. Residents on Thursday Island and Horn Island had concerns with regard to health problems and security. But $32.5 million has been set aside for the detection, detention and prosecution of illegal fishermen. A very significant amount of money has been set aside to build a purpose-built, 48-person facility on Horn Island to immediately process illegal fishermen with regard to their health et cetera and send them off to Darwin for prosecution. There will also be a purpose-built facility for the destruction of vessels that are taken in the area. That can be done in a way that is not going to cause any environmental problems. That will provide a significant number of jobs for local residents on Horn Island and Thursday Island, something that has been very much welcomed by that community. Given that, particularly in the Torres Strait, fishing is the only natural resource, other than tourism opportunities, it is absolutely imperative that we do everything we can to protect the integrity of that resource. We are also enhancing search and rescue in Far North Queensland. Some $54.7 million has been allocated out of this budget for the establishment of a new search and rescue service. MAIN COMMITTEE There will be four turboprop aircraft, which are much faster than anything that is available now. Three will be flying at all times. One, I would expect, will be based in Far North Queensland-in Cairns, I expect. These are very high-speed purpose-built aircraft for search and rescue. Instead of taking Coastwatch off task to look for people who are lost in this vast area, these aircraft will be readily available. They will be fitted with the latest technology, including surface search radars and forward-looking infrared equipment, which will allow them to work at night time, and satellite communications, again offering another level of support and safety in our region. A range of other initiatives has also been made available through this budget. They are national initiatives, certainly, but they are initiatives that are going to be of great benefit in my electorate. There is $179 million for new Indigenous health measures. We know of the work that needs to be done there. There is an additional $40 million for primary health clinics in communities. There is over $102 million over four years to improve the health of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander mothers, babies and children and to reduce the impact of chronic diseases. There is $8 million to help deal with issues of petrol sniffing. There is also funding of some $10 million for government hearing services for Indigenous communities, and funding to help communities keep professional staff through an extension of the fringe benefits tax supplementation program for an additional four years. There is funding for bowel cancer. The prevalence of cancer touches all of us in the community. There is some $43.4 million for the national bowel cancer screening program and another $23.1 million over four years to help local groups and care providers offer better support for cancer patients and their families. This new funding will be used to fit out and equip premises for palliative care, pastoral care, counselling and family support. There is also $25 million to assist in tackling problems with young people who are starting to smoke at an early agethey have got to start at the source, particularly in relation to lung cancer. There has been additional funding for mental health, which is an issue I raise regularly in this place. There is some $69 million for youth mental health initiatives, appreciating that three-quarters of mental health problems begin before the age of 25. There is another $39.6 million for the national depression initiative, money certainly well spent and a direct result of responsible economic management by this government. Diabetes initiatives will also receive a boost of some $44.2 million and asthma will receive another $27.1 million. All in all, it has been an outstanding contribution to these areas. Another area which has caused some difficulty for the other side of politics, for the Labor Party, is the tax cuts, with the reduction from 17 to 15 per cent for our lower income earners and the lifting of the thresholds which has been quite significant. You always hear complaints, particularly from the other side, about the brain drain, about our intelligent young people moving overseas because of the high tax problems here. We are losing all those young people. What we have done is bring our tax system into line with those countries that attract these young professionals. It will mean that there is no longer a reason for them to travel overseas. I would have thought that the Labor Party would have offered congratulations, particularly given the skills shortages that we have in this country at the moment and our desperate need to retain those young highly skilled people. But, no, purely for the sake of politics they are out there jumping up and down, threatening to disallow this and coming back with a plagiarised mickey mouse alternative. From talking to my own business community, I know that there is a MAIN COMMITTEE lot of confusion out there. They desperately want this to be introduced on 1 July. We have got to call on the Leader of the Opposition to stop blocking this, stop playing havoc with the employees in Far North Queensland and stop threatening to block these tax cuts. At the end of the day, all he is going to do is cause an unnecessary cost to business. I ask him to stop the nonsense and allow the tax cuts to go through. (Time expired) fend Western Australia. It seems to me that the federal Treasurer and Liberal leadership hopeful Peter Costello wants to base his leadership push on proving just how well he can bully the states. The Treasurer’s recent attack on Western Australia is incredible and his threat to withhold GST revenues from that state is state bashing at its pitiful worse. The Treasurer has threatened to withhold GST revenues from WA unless WA drops more state taxes. It is interesting that the Treasurer would do this because on the one hand the government are saying that this is not a Commonwealth tax but a state tax, yet on the other hand it is a tax they want to control when it suits them. The other interesting thing is that it was a Liberal Premier who signed WA up to the GST. Because of the Treasurer’s threats, I went to the current Premier’s web site. I was very pleased to discover the following information, which I want to quote: In 1999 the then Premier Richard Court signed an agreement on behalf of Western Australia to receive a share of the GST revenue in return for abolishing three state taxes and reviewing a further six. Indeed, since 1999, as part of that agreement signed by Premier Court, WA has abolished three state taxes. It has abolished financial institutions duty and listed marketable securities duty, and debits tax is legislated to be abolished on 1 July 2005. WA has reviewed the other six and abolished three more taxes. It has abolished unlisted marketable securities duty, leases duty and cheque duty. Western Australia also abolished a further two taxes not listed on that agreement: stamp duty on workers compensation insurance and stamp duty on life insurance. In total, the WA state government has abolished eight state taxes, while the agreement only required the abolition of three state taxes. While the GST was signed up under the previous Liberal state government, the incoming Labor government has met those commitments, and I think the Premier’s claim that Western Australia has not only honoured its side of the agreement but exceeded it is demonstrably true. I also want to point out to the Treasurer-Australia’s next Leader of the Opposition-that my home state of WA contributes $2 billion more each year than we get back in federal funding. That is a $1,000 subsidy by every man, woman and child in Western Australia to the rest of the nation. In addition, up to 90 per cent of the royalties Western Australia receives from its resources are distributed to other states, yet the federal government refuses to adequately fund the necessary infrastructure required for mining and other resource development. Indeed, ABS figures show that the Commonwealth tax take is $10,462 per person, while just $2,503 per person is derived from state based revenue. I am grateful to the Premier’s office in WA for the above information. Something else that I have been pointing out in Western Australia for years is that in WA we are free from the plague of poker machines-and we thank successive governments for that. I would certainly call on future state governments in Western Australia to continue with that no pokies policy. We need to remind the federal Treasurer that we do not, unlike other states, derive income from those machines. Indeed, it is worth pointing out that New South Wales derives $1.311 MAIN COMMITTEE",157,Appropriation Bill No 2 2005 2006 Appropriation Parliamentary Departments Bill No 1 2005 2006 Appropriation Bill No 5 2004 2005 Appropriation Bill No 6 2004 2005
217,Mr Edwards (Cowan) (5.30 Pm),"In speaking on the appropriation bills I want to debillion from gambling and Victoria $1.324 billion. That puts WA behind the eight ball right from the word go. But I would rather have it that way than to allow Treasurer Costello to force poker machines into our state. They are not wanted and they are not required-and I think that is pretty well a bipartisan position in Western Australia. The other taxable revenue device we do not have in WA is road tollways. I am not sure what revenue is derived from road tollways, but it seems to me that this is becoming more and more a means of revenue in New South Wales and Victoria. I to say the Treasurer: ‘Thank you very much, but, just like poker machines, we don’t want any road tollways in Western Australia either.’ I also noticed that the WA government in last week’s state budget scrapped the bank debits tax, freed up some 24,000 people from paying land tax, raised land tax thresholds and cut the middle land tax while abolishing stamp duty on mortgage refinancing for owner-occupiers and small business. Overall in WA the state government is returning some $870 million in tax relief over the next four years. This is on top of the $1.5 billion in tax cuts announced last year. In WA, the Gallop government is delivering $2.4 billion in tax and family relief. In addition, it is putting more investment into training teachers, building new schools, providing more police, generating more electricity and expanding and building new hospitals. At the same time, in partnership with the resource sector, it is investing in new infrastructure. Infrastructure is something the Howard-Costello government refuses to accept a fair responsibility for in WA, let alone show any responsibility for. On the one hand the HowardCostello government is refusing to assist with infrastructure and resource development, but at the same time it wants to reduce state revenue and is saying to WA, ‘We want you to generate more income so we can confiscate that for Canberra.’ It is pretty obvious that both the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, who both come from the eastern states-and I am not saying there is anything wrong with that-have little knowledge and appreciation of the fact that it is wellrun and well-managed states like Western Australia that are hand in hand with the resource sector developing our nation, expanding our exports and building our economy. The Treasurer should get off the back of WA and get out of its path. He should stop being an impediment to Western Australia’s development and for a change he should support our state and our crucial resource sector. Mr Deputy Speaker, you would well know that prices of minerals fluctuate-there are peaks and troughs. There is no guarantee in the future that the prices you are getting today will be there in five, six or seven years time. Any state government which cut its funding and by so doing inhibited its ability to work hand-in-hand with the resource sector to explore and develop new prospects, fields or mining areas would be cutting the throat of the state in the long term. My advice to the Treasurer is that he ought to give WA a fair go. He should not be the goose that kills the state that lays Australia’s richest golden egg. If Western Australia allowed itself to be bullied by this Treasurer, this Prime Minister and this government, not only would we be killing the goose that lays Australia’s richest golden egg, but in view of the figures that I gave a little while ago-and in view of the revenue which is generated in Western Australia and distributed to other parts of the nation-we would be doing a great disservice to this nation. So the state government, with the support of all federal members, Liberal and Labor, should stand up to this Costello-Howard government and support the Premier of Western Australia. If they do not, they are turning their backs on the people of that great state. MAIN COMMITTEE Having exposed the Treasurer for the reckless person that he is, particularly in relation to Western Australia, I have a number of other issues that I want to deal with. I want to turn tonight to another issue to do with the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs. I call on this minister to fix the incredible debacle which surrounds the issuing of military medals in Australia. We recently saw the very embarrassing situation our nation found itself in when the president of Indonesia awarded that nation’s humanitarian medal to the nine Australians killed in the Sea King disaster. It was an embarrassment to Australia-not that the medal was awarded but that we had nothing that we could give. It was a very emotional moment for most Australians when they saw those coffins coming back with the medals from Indonesia, and they were matched by a sprig of wattle, I think at the suggestion of the Governor General. The government moved fairly quickly to arrange for our own humanitarian medal to be awarded to those people who were so tragically killed. They did that with this opposition’s support, and I think it was a fair and reasonable thing for them to do. But it is interesting in this context to remember that, some 11 months ago, the government announced a new Australian Defence Force medal, and they said applications for this medal would be called for by the end of last year. Interestingly, that announcement was made as a lead-up to the last election. Where have the medals gone? We have no idea where they are, what their design is, when they will be available, and what the criteria for these medals will be. That is despite this government having promised on more than one occasion that applications would be called for at the end of last year. Labor’s policy is very clear in this area. We announced it last year, and we have stood by that policy. We would award the Australian Defence Force medal to volunteers who have served their initial period of enlistment of three years or in some circumstances two years. You might remember back to the post Second World War era when some people who served in Korea only had to enlist for two years. We would also award the medal to next of kin of those killed on duty or to those who were forced to take discharge because of injury, or in the case of women because of situations where they were forced out because of marriage or pregnancy. A number of women served in the ADF for a period of four years or signed up for four years. Some of them had to get out because they were married or having a child. We would want to recognise the contribution that those women made. I believe that this government has made a farce of these new medals, and it is really high time that it got the house in order. But it does not end there. In July 2002 I, along with several other members of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, visited our troops on the ground in the Middle East. Included in that was a visit to our SAS blokes in Bagram. While we were there we gave a commitment, as much as a group of members of parliament can give a commitment, to pursue the issue of a campaign medal to recognise the wonderful service that those people were contributing in that country. Indeed when we returned to Australia the committee wrote to the Minister for Defence seeking the government’s commitment to such a campaign medal. Last year the minister announced the medal and gave the impression to recipients that it would be available for them to have by ANZAC Day this year. Not only has the Afghanistan campaign medal failed to materialise but there is now a story which causes some concern to me, and that is that the medals, yet to be manufactured, will be further delayed because the MAIN COMMITTEE government is considering having them minted overseas. I do not want to divert from the real case, which is the fact that these people are entitled to their medals. But I do think that the minister should, if she is going to allow these medals to be minted overseas, be prepared to defend that decision, because there will be a fair amount of angst in Australia if that is the case. The real story here is that recognition delayed is recognition denied. In my view, and I know in the view of many former and current serving soldiers, the length of time they have had to wait for these medals is a fair reflection of the lack of appreciation that this government really has for the job that these blokes and these women did. The individual and personal challenges and dangers that these members of the ADF, as soldiers operating in difficult terrain, had to expose themselves to and the dangers of the elements as well as the enemy are exactly what campaign medals are designed to reflect. SoI am going to pose the question: why are our Afghanistan veterans who were serving that country in 2002 and the Iraq veterans still waiting for their campaign medals so many years after the campaign, particularly in relation to the Afghanistan campaign? I think it would be very difficult for any member of this parliament to justify such a delay. As I said, recognition delayed is recognition denied. I want to call on the minister to demand some action here and to demand it now. These blokes are entitled to their medals. They should have them. strong economic growth, the continuing high employment, the continuing low interest rates and low inflation and the record highs in consumer and business confidence are all due in no small way to the policies of the Howard government. In bringing down his 10th budget just three weeks ago the Treasurer called it a budget framed for the future. It was a budget framed for the future, a budget focused on future opportunities for our young people, a budget focused on care for our aged, a budget focused on the continued security of our nation, a budget focused on the health services that our citizens will need in the future, a budget focused on the continued strong economic growth of our nation that is synonymous with the Howard government. The coalition government, under the leadership of John Howard, have a great deal of experience under our belt. Our win at the last federal election has given us a unique opportunity of ensuring that the next three years of policy decisions really count. The agenda for Australia’s future has to be cemented further, given our ageing population. Level-headedness, maturity, common sense and sound decision making are going to be needed more than ever over the next three years. The recent budget sets a blueprint for the next 12 months and lays the foundation for the fourth-term agenda of the Howard government. There has been a lot of talk about the future. Without continued strong economic growth, our future as a country and for our people would not be in the position it is in today. The Australian economy has performed impressively and that is not by accident. It has performed impressively because of sound economic management and a commitment to ongoing reform and policy decisions that have been taken by the Howard government. What does this budget mean to the people I represent in the federal parliament, the people of McPherson? What does it mean to our communities on the southern Gold Coast? How have we benefited and what will those continued benefits mean in the future to our young people, MAIN COMMITTEE",161,Appropriation Bill No 2 2005 2006 Appropriation Parliamentary Departments Bill No 1 2005 2006 Appropriation Bill No 5 2004 2005 Appropriation Bill No 6 2004 2005
218,Mrs May (Mcpherson) (5.49 Pm),"The future prosperity of Australia, the continuingour young families, our aged and our city as it continues to grow at a rate unmatched anywhere else in Australia? Because of our prudent management of the Australian economy, the government will deliver further personal income tax cuts to all Australians. We are a government that believe in giving Australian taxpayers back their hard earned dollars with a budget surplus. It is now up to the opposition to pass on those tax cuts and to allow Australians to benefit from these tax cuts from 1 July. I say to the opposition: don’t penalise the Australian taxpayer by blocking this legislation. Vote with us and pass on the tax cuts. Under the proposed legislation, further personal income tax cuts are worth $21.7 billion over the next four years. These are tax cuts that will assist low-income earners, boost disposable incomes and reward participation and hard work. Australians will keep more of what they earn, and why shouldn’t they? There are now more incentives for Aussies to continue to work hard and reap the rewards of that hard work. With the support of the opposition, from 1 July this year the 17 per cent marginal tax rate will be cut to 15 per cent, and the 42 per cent tax threshold will increase from $58,000 to $63,000 on 1 July 2005 and to $70,000 on 1 July 2006. From1 July 2005, the 47 per cent threshold will increase from $70,000 to $95,000 and on 1 July 2006 it will increase again to $125,000. In my view, these tax cuts and increases in thresholds are fair and well targeted. These changes ensure that more than 80 per cent of taxpayers face a top marginal income tax rate of 30 per cent or less over the forward estimates period, and from 1 July 2006 the top marginal rate will apply to only three per cent of taxpayers. In addition to the income tax cuts and the government’s ongoing plan to encourage people to save for their retirement, the superannuation surcharge will be scrapped altogether from 1 July 2005. The cut in the lowest rate of tax benefits also benefits seniors and means that senior Australians eligible for the senior Australian tax offset will now pay no tax on their annual income up to $21,968 for a single and on equal incomes up to a joint $36,494 for a couple. Once again I say to the opposition: pass the tax cuts. Allow all Australians to benefit from the personal income tax cuts from 1 July 2005. Australians should share in the prosperity of our nation and the economic benefits that have flowed from our strong economic management. I say to the opposition: act responsibly and pass the tax cuts. One of the most significant achievements of this government has been the continuing fall in unemployment rates. McPherson’s December unemployment rate hit a historical low of 5.2 per cent compared to the then national average of 5.5 per cent. It was the first time our unemployment rate was better than the national average. In the past McPherson has trailed somewhere between two and three per cent behind the national average. These figures were welcome news for the southern Gold Coast. It meant that more people had jobs and that young people had job opportunities. The results reflect the Howard government’s strong economic management once again and highlight the significant labour market improvements that are achievable when a government is prepared to reform the employment services market through the Job Network and make the hard decisions on workplace reform. Despite the fact that more Australians are in work today and that the unemployment rate has fallen to a low unmatched for 28 years, it is more important than ever that the opposition support the government’s workplace relations and work force participation reforms, which have the potential to make even further inroads into the level of unemployment. Another chalMAIN COMMITTEE lenge for the opposition is to support key reforms in the areas of increasing work force participation and in the labour market. Part of the challenge for government in securing our future is increasing participation in the work force. Our 14 consecutive years of growth have been accompanied by low unemployment rates, low inflation rates and low interest rates but the future will see Australia come under increasing pressure as it competes in a freer global market environment, where competition will be aggressive, not just for our natural resources, manufactured goods and services but importantly for our greatest asset, our labour force. Participation in the work force, assisting people from welfare to work, is much more than statistics about unemployment rates. It is about people becoming financially secure and sharing in the wealth of this country. In many cases it is about people’s self-esteem and confidence. It is about people overcoming their social isolation. It is about recognising the value of a person’s contribution to our society. It is about people feeling worthwhile about contributing. As a government we have a responsibility to ensure all Australians who want to work and who are able to work are given the opportunity to participate. We have to ensure that there are programs that will assist in training and skilling people so that they can become productive members of our society. It is about assisting people from welfare to work. It is not about paying people a benefit every fortnight and forgetting about them. We have a responsibility to engage those people who are able to and want to work. It is about providing rehabilitation services and education and training opportunities that will give these people the best chance ever of participating. Employers will also be encouraged to employ people with disabilities. Schemes will be expanded to assist employers to take on these people. We will work with industry to identify the skill shortages and ensure we address those skill shortages with the appropriate training programs. We need to encourage as many people of working age as we can to join our work force, to become productive members of our communities. During the last federal campaign our government announced a commitment to 24 technical colleges to be built in regions around Australia. The Gold Coast has been identified as an area to receive funding for such a college. This election commitment provides for the establishment and operation of colleges for year 11 and 12 students to promote excellence in the teaching and acquiring of trade and craft skills at the secondary school level. Each college will be linked to and endorsed by industry and run autonomously by principals who will be able to engage teaching staff on a performance pay basis. We know today that one of the greatest challenges for business is finding people to take up skilled jobs. For too long success for young Australians has been equated to finishing year 12 and obtaining a university degree. This, of course, is a path that many young people aspire to and a path that should be supported. However, there is an attitude in the community that only a university degree will secure employment. In many cases it has become a status symbol and as a country we have paid a significant economic and social cost for this attitude. One-third of students who start university will not finish their studies. As a country we are facing critical skill shortages in the trades, including building and construction, metals, manufacturing and automotive. On the Gold Coast we are also facing shortages in the hospitality industry. We desperately need young people to take on traineeships or apprenticeships as chefs. We need people in this industry, both front of house and back of MAIN COMMITTEE house. People need to be well trained and willing to work in this multimillion dollar industry, which supports our very strong tourism industry. This government is committed to revolutionising vocational education and training, through the 24 colleges. As a nation, we should value trades training as highly as any other form of postsecondary education. I look forward to the Gold Coast technical college becoming a reality and offering choices and another education pathway to the young people on the Gold Coast. I know a number of tenders have been presented from the Gold Coast. I wish each of the consortiums every success with their bids and of course look forward to working with the successful consortium in establishing the Gold Coast Australian technical college. Small business, as we know, is the backbone of the Australian economy. Businesses have been growing. They have had to become smarter. They are now part of opportunities in a growing global market that has become increasingly competitive. We need to ensure that our businesses are as productive and competitive as they can be, and that means we need to address impediments to business activity. There is an increasing need for industrial relations reform to increase work force participation. Legislation such as the fair dismissal bill will assist business in employing those extra people they need. The Treasurer announced $1.8 billion of tax cuts to enhance the competitiveness of Australian businesses. Already abolished is the three per cent tariff on imported business inputs which do not have substitutes manufactured in Australia. This will be a saving to business of $1.3 billion over the next five years. The tourism industry on the Gold Coast is made up of thousands of small businesses, and our tourism industry will be a winner from the extra $453 million being invested into attracting tourists to our country. Our local communities will benefit from the extra $7.5 million that will be spent on promoting tourism projects and encouraging visitors to stay on the Gold Coast longer, through the Australian Tourism Development Program. Tourism is big business for our local communities, and the Gold Coast is no exception. The industry provides thousands of jobs throughout Australia, and by boosting tourism in local areas extra jobs can be created and additional income earned by small businesses. I encourage all members and senators to take a trip north to Australia’s tourism capital. Everyone deserves the chance to experience our unique way of life, to take part in a fresh Gold Coast adventure that stretches from historic rural communities in the north to border towns and coastal centres on the southern Gold Coast, and to enjoy our beautiful hinterland-the green behind the gold-and our pristine beaches. We have it all. There have been many discussions over a number of years about the future of our great country-the future of our ageing population, the future of our environment, the future of our health system and, importantly, the future infrastructure plans for our road and rail systems. Through AusLink, many of these infrastructure plans will be funded. With this budget, an additional $150 million over five years will be provided to expand the Roads to Recovery program, and an additional $90 million will be provided to continue the Road Safety Black Spot Program. The Gold Coast City Council will benefit from these funds. An additional $14 million will be provided to the council for the Roads to Recovery program. There is no doubt that this funding is urgently needed on the Gold Coast to address the serious traffic problems we are MAIN COMMITTEE encountering due to our rapid population growth. I know the council will also be applying for funding under the Road Safety Black Spot Program, which has been a successful initiative in the past. The establishment of the future fund is also a very welcome announcement. There is no doubt that we need to make provision for the future. We need to begin saving for the future to meet the costs of our ageing population. The future fund will be an independent fund with a statutory board of eminent people who are going to make an investment on behalf of Australia’s future. It will be a large fund and it is expected to accumulate earnings over a period of time, which will mean that the government can fund its liabilities and relieve future generations of the costs of the ageing of the population. These earnings will be safeguarded by legislation. The future fund will only invest in infrastructure projects that make commercial sense. The government expects the fund to be able to invest in listed infrastructure vehicles and listed property trusts. There will not be uncommercial, risky investments being made by the future fund that would risk the capacity for government to pay the superannuation liabilities. Since coming to power in 1996, the Howard government has managed to retire most of the $96 billion debt we inherited on coming to office. By reducing this debt, we can look to the future with confidence. We can be assured that our commitments, as a government, to all Australians will be met. The savings by government from the reduction of the debt will ensure that the future fund will meet the needs of our nation in the long term. There are many good news stories in this budget-for example, a one-off lump sum payment this year of $1,000 to eligible carers receiving the carer payment and $600 to those receiving the carers allowance. Carers in our community should never be taken for granted. They undertake a selfless task, often a lonely task, isolated from society because of the very nature of the task they have undertaken. Cancer is an insidious disease. I have recently lost two very close friends to this disease and have a very dear friend who is currently fighting the disease-Wal is being very brave, but I worry about his fight. The government is committed to a major funding package to improve cancer care through bowel cancer screening, dedicated cancer research, the training of cancer nurses, increased funding for palliative care, and $5.5 million over two years to raise national awareness of skin cancer and encourage action to prevent it. Another important program is the commitment to a national youth campaign aimed at reducing the number of young people who take up smoking. We all know that smoking is a killer. Early intervention programs hopefully will have the desired effect. The government has committed $25 million over four years to help discourage young Australians from taking up smoking. The budget also makes dementia a national health priority. The $321 million package will enhance the quality of life of dementia sufferers and their carers. As life expectancy increases, dementia will become more common within our communities. The funding package will offer more opportunities for dementia-specific training for carers, community and residential care workers, and people working in services such as the police, transport and emergency services. I particularly commend this initiative by the government. Dementia is a debilitating disease. Sufferers and their carers face huge challenges on a daily basis, and any help and assistance will be welcome, I know. Diabetes is also becoming a huge national health concern. The government has provided $44.2 million over four years to continue a national approach to improve the prevention and MAIN COMMITTEE management of diabetes. There is no doubt that education on the effects of diabetes, and programs to assist Australians to recognise early warning signs, are positive steps in bringing diabetes under control. Balancing work and family and the daily stresses of life can have huge impacts on families. Often families need outside counselling to help keep relationships and families together. The government has announced funding over four years to establish a network of 65 family relationship centres across Australia. These centres will help couples access premarriage education and assist families experiencing relationship difficulties with information and access to family skills training and support that can be delivered through other departments and agencies. This initiative is another example of government support for and recognition of the importance of strong family relationships within our communities. Strong families build strong communities and ultimately a strong country. The Prime Minister has often referred to Australia as having a decent society, a tolerant society, a society that recognises and supports lowand middle-income families with dependent children. Through this budget, those families and children are being supported and encouraged now and for the future. I commend the bills to the House. Dr EMERSON (Rankin) (6.08 pm)-I would like to concentrate my remarks on the budget primarily upon an economic analysis of the budget and the wider economic implications that flow from it. Members of parliament will be well aware of Labor’s critique of the government’s spending program that began before the previous budget, carried through the 2004-05 budget and then flowed into the pre-election campaign period. That critique was that the budget spending spree amounted to $66 billion and would put undue pressure on interest rates. Labor did not come to this view belatedly but said it consistently as the government went upon this spending spree. There was only one purpose behind that spending spree, and that was to get the government re-elected. It was clear it was going to give total priority to that and then, after the election, worry about the economic consequences. After the election the chickens did come home to roost, as Labor had feared they would: the OECD, the IMF and the Reserve Bank of Australia all expressed concerns about the management of the economy, including in their critique the $66 billion spending spree. In March 2005 the Reserve Bank had no choice left to it but to increase interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point. The effect of the pre-election spending spree was to pour fuel onto the flames of already strong consumer spending. The government knew exactly what it was doing, but calculated correctly that it would be able to get away with it and deal with the consequences after the election. The interest rate rise itself has had an adverse impact on home borrowers. A quarter of a percentage point interest rate increase can be a significant increase when people are borrowed up to the hilt, as they are. If Labor’s critique of the pre-election spending spree of $66 billion was right, then surely a critique of a $103 billion spending spree would carry some weight. And that is, in fact, what the government has done in the 2005-06 budget-it has gone on a $103 billion spending spree. I have said consistently that I am concerned about the impact of this on further interest rate rises. The Reserve Bank’s task is quite straightforward-that is, to keep inflation within a nominated band. It is an independent Reserve Bank, that is its job, and if inflation increases beyond the upper limit of that band the Reserve Bank has little choice but to act. MAIN COMMITTEE The pre-election spending spree was 10.3 per cent in real terms in 2004, which was the fastest in more than 20 years. It is interesting to cast one’s mind back to when such a pre-election spending spree last occurred. It was, in fact, by the Fraser government, when John Howard was Treasurer of this country, when they sought in vain to get re-elected by making very large and expensive promises. It did not work in 1983 because Labor swept to power, but it has worked in the most recent election. But the problem is that the spending that is going on in this economy has been at such a rate that the capacity of the economy to supply the goods and services that are being demanded is now very limited. The government has failed to invest, in its nine years, in improving the capacity of the Australian economy to meet the demands associated with strong consumer spending. When strong consumer spending smashes up against a capacity constraint, it spills over in one of two ways-in Australia’s case, in both. The first is into imports. It is a matter of record that Australia now has recorded 41 successive trade deficits and record current account deficits, and the figures released today put the current account deficit at 7.25 per cent of GDP. This is a horrendously high level, far in excess of the level when Paul Keating warned of the dangers in the mid-1980s of Australia becoming a banana republic, and yet this government is completely complacent about a record current account deficit-a chronic current account deficitwhich, again, is feeding into Australia’s international debt. In 1995 when the government rolled out its debt truck, Australia’s international net debt was $180 billion. Today figures reveal that it has climbed to $425 billion, more than doubling since the time that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer promised to follow policies that would bring foreign debt down. At that time both the Prime Minister and the Treasurer warned that at some point-and they believe that point had been reached when debt was $180 billion-foreign lenders would apply a risk premium to the interest rate that they charge Australia for borrowing such large amounts of money. Again, the Prime Minister has been condemned by his own rhetoric, by his own belief. Now, with foreign debt at $425 billion, foreign lenders are definitely applying a premium, because Australia has the third-highest interest rates in the Western world. If that is not bad enough, we are now in a situation where we are at the peak of a commodity price cycle. Commodity prices can only go down from here. The Australian dollar is a commodity currency. If you track the movements in the Australian dollar with commodity prices you will find a very close correlation. As the commodity price cycle has peaked, the risk for the exchange rate is that it will depreciate. A depreciating exchange rate will increase the cost in Australian dollar terms of goods imported from overseas-and we have lots of goods imported from overseas as a result of the spending spree spilling over into imports. If that happens we have a new source of inflation in Australia through a depreciating exchange rate. In the last couple of years the prices of domestically produced goods have risen above the Reserve Bank’s range at which it would need to act to increase interest rates. But the impact of an appreciating dollar as the commodity price cycle has gone up has been that there has been an offset to domestic inflation from overseas such that the overall consumer price index has remained within the range. Therefore, with that one exception of March 2005, the Reserve Bank has not been forced to increase interest rates. But now that the government has failed to respond to the capacity constraints and has poured fuel onto the spending fire, the risk of a MAIN COMMITTEE depreciating currency means that those strong domestic price rises will not have an overseas offset but will be exacerbated by inflation from overseas. In those circumstances the Reserve Bank will have no choice but to increase interest rates. Recessions in this country have been caused essentially by the Reserve Bank acting too late to dampen spending and then having to put the brakes on too severely. That has caused recessions. The preconditions for a recession now exist in Australia. AmI saying that there will be a recession? I am not making that prediction, but I am saying that this government has substantially increased the risk of a recession. Ask BIS Shrapnel, who earlier in the week were forecasting mortgage interest rates of nine per cent. Mortgage interest rates of nine per cent would smash the Australian economy because of the very high levels of debt of most Australians who are trying to buy a home. One of the indicators of the state of the economy at the moment is that the unemployment rate is the lowest since 1976. That suggests a tight labour market-in fact, it is proof of a tight labour market. Another is that job vacancies are the highest in the 26-year history of job vacancies; again, pointing to a very tight labour market. There are labour shortages. Business is reporting labour shortages as a constraint on output. That particular indicator is the highest in the 15-year history of the survey. Capacity utilisation has just fallen away little, but from a 15year high. Interestingly, over the years I have found the survey of consumer sentiment to be a very important indicator. The survey of consumer sentiment had reached record levels and then, when the quarter of a percentage point interest rate rise came through, it fell away. But now that people have gotten used to that interest rate rise, consumer sentiment has gone up again. In parliament today the Treasurer said that the latest retail sales figures suggest that consumer spending has now perhaps peaked and is starting to moderate. But the retail sales figures were all adjusted as a result of the Australian Bureau of Statistics having another look at those figures, and they were all revised upwards in the previous month. So there is plenty of evidence around of capacity constraints and of strong consumer spending. In respect of the housing market, a fundamental cause of the very high house prices-it is true they have peaked-is the large immigration program, which I support fundamentally. But the underlying contributor to the pressure on housing prices is an immigration program which has continued to increase in this year. I do not complain about that, I simply point out that house prices are unlikely to collapse, that they are moderating and there is a very significant possibility that they will increase in the coming months, if not in a year’s time. Put all those pieces together and you see the preconditions for an interest rate rise. The reality is that the government knew this. It knew when it was bringing down the budget that this was a very substantial risk. If you look at the statement of risks in the budget, you will see that it points to these sorts of risks. Why? Because Peter Costello does not write budget statement No. 1. The people who write budget statement No. 1 are the Treasury. The Treasury need to cover all possibilities so that no-one can say that they got it wrong. parliamentarians can say, ‘Treasury got it wrong.’ If you go through the fine print, you can see in the statement of risks that Treasury are fully aware of the potential consequences of this budget.

220,Dr Emerson,"It is honest disclosure. They do not want to be in a position where we asLate last year, Martin Parkinson, a senior Treasury officer, gave a speech to an economic forum where he pointed out that any budget is just a series of point estimates. By that I interpret him to mean that you can only make your best guess about each of those things, but around each point there is a substantial risk. I am saying that, around the budget estimates, there are very substantial risks associated with the settings of that budget. I do not want it to be the case that, if interest rates rise, anyone can believe that Labor supported the budget. We did not. We did not support the budget on the grounds of equity-that is, the fairness of the tax cuts. I am putting on record again tonight that we do not support the budget on the grounds of macroeconomic management either. I want to go on to some of the longer term opportunities that were lost in this budget. We are talking about capacity constraints, a reform-lazy government that has surfed on the record productivity growth generated out of the economic reform program of the Hawke and Keating years. Wouldn’t you think that a government would say: ‘Wow, what a gift! This is tremendous. Hawke and Keating have unleashed this productivity growth for us. We’ll make sure we keep it going by investing in the new sources of productivity growth in the country: education and new ideas in the form of innovation and infrastructure.’ But a reform-lazy government has failed to do that. Those hard-won increases in productivity as a result of the reform program have now turned negative. In the year 2004, productivity growth in this country not only slowed; it turned negative. Some of that might be statistical aberration or cyclical factorsany such possibility-but if you were a government that was concerned about the long-term economic management of this country, you would be very worried about productivity growth turning negative when, again, our competitors around the world are making sure that they are investing in the new sources of productivity growth. What does this government have against government in public investment in educationpublic investment in schools, vocational education and universities? The fact of the matter is that with the most recent fee increases-25 per cent increases in HECS and an expanded system whereby up to 35 per cent of places at universities can now be taken by full-fee paying Australian students assisted by a scheme called FEE-HELP-the private returns from a university education are now getting to a point where it is just not worth it. Is this short-sighted? Of course it is. How could a government be so ideologically obsessed with private provision and funding of university education that it simply refuses to invest in access to universities in this country? So it has failed on the score of investing in the skills of this nation and in the area of research and development. Under the Hawke and Keating governments business spending on research and development, as a share of gross domestic product, skyrocketed and started making us competitive with other OECD countries, where the gap between their spending on research and development and ours was narrowing. But one of the first acts of this government when it came into office was to cut the R&D tax concession, and business spending on research and development as a share of GDP fell year after year. More recently it has lifted ever so slightly, but not relative to the rest of the world. So on the second score of investing in ideas the government has gone missing, deliberately and wantonly refusing to invest in that public good that is innovation and investment in ideas. The third area, probably the most noteworthy in terms of public commentary, is infrastructure. The government blames the states for infrastructure bottlenecks. There is no national MAIN COMMITTEE infrastructure leadership in this country. What we need is a national infrastructure advisory committee and council, and we need a national infrastructure plan. It does not mean that the Commonwealth has to be the sole investor in infrastructure. The states obviously must do so. The private sector obviously must do so. But the Commonwealth should be taking a leadership role. Labor has been advocating a national infrastructure advisory council now for about three, maybe four, years. But for reasons best known to the government, probably ideological ones or a desire to shift the burden of infrastructure spending on to the states and away from the federal budget, it will not take even that sensible measure. Finally there is the area of incentives. The government talks about the need to give incentive to high-income earners to do extra work. It has lifted the threshold for the top marginal rate of tax to $125,000 a year. The government has been saying, ‘These people need more incentive because 48½c in the dollar is such a prohibitive marginal tax rate.’ Yet many people on lower and middle incomes are facing effective marginal tax rates of at least 60c in the dollar. Many of them face at least 60c in the dollar. I say that if 48½c in the dollar is a disincentive to work then surely 60c in the dollar is a disincentive to work and to participate in the economy. To achieve what we need to do to sustain prosperity in this country for a fair Australia, we must invest in the new sources of productivity growth and increase work force participation. The government’s response to work force participation is to do virtually nothing about those high effective marginal tax rates for lowand middle-income earners but to pick on single mothers and say to single mothers, ‘You must get out and work when your child turns six.’ But the wives of millionaires are actually paid to stay at home. What sort of incentive is that? On all reasonable criteria-economic management, equity, any capacity to look beyond the next election and invest in the nation’s future-this government’s 2005-06 budget is an abysmal failure. things that I practically do not have to bring my own speech to this place. As a person who has got a PhD in something-I am not sure what-it is interesting to hear him make some remarks regarding various aspects of government policy and the effect of overseas debt. He says that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer frequently made promises to follow policies that reduced the overseas debt. If you as a government reduce your own debt by $90 billion, what better policy could you follow? What he is really suggesting is that Prime Minister Howard should go on the John Laws show, predict death and confusion and the banana republic, and deliver the recession we had to have driven by 17 and 20 per cent interest rates. The member for Rankin is suggesting that that is good government policy to reduce overseas debt. Women are going out and buying themselves remarkably cheap Chinese clothing. Qantas, which is booming as one of the few profitable airlines in the world, might go out and buy another few 747s or 777s or a couple of airbuses. Of course we will borrow money from the rest of the world. The evidence is that they are delighted to lend it to us. But they are lending it to people who are making personal decisions about business or consumption, not to the government. I heard Prime Minister Keating or Treasurer Keating tell us time and time again, ‘The government are not borrowing from overseas.’ No; they just soaked up every dollar in savings that was floating around Australia and drove everybody in the private sector overseas.

221,Mr Tuckey (O’connor) (6.28 Pm),"The member for Rankin always says so manyThe real factor pointed out by the Prime Minister today is the fundamental fact that there is a simple test of the risk of overseas debt, and that is how much interest is being paid on that debt as a percentage of the nation’s exports. I understand that you are economically dead if that hits 27 per cent. That is apparently a huge danger signal. I read that many years ago and I will stand corrected, but it is about 27 per cent. The Keating government-and this is why I read it-got up to about 20 per cent. There was an article in the paper that said, ‘mate, you’re knocking on the door.’ The Prime Minister informed the parliament today that the current figure is nine per cent. I would imagine that is comfortable. The member for Rankin also talked about the Hawke-Keating reforms. I think in many respects they were excellent. They frequently followed policies that were espoused by the coalition election after election, policies that were criticised by the then government. But the big deal was, when they put their hands up to float the currency, we came out and said: ‘Good on you.’ I wonder what the response of the present opposition would be if that situation confronted us today. If they were to support the process, it would be about the first thing they have supported in nine years. The same applies with tariff cuts. When you are too scared of your base constituency, or at least of those who have a huge influence on your preselection, you do not go out and write the appropriate industrial law that, as reported in the media the other day, puts up the wages of a dozer driver in the Pilbara by $20,000 and gives that dozer driver access to staff superannuation; you do not do that. You have to find something that confuses the proletariat, so you drop tariffs. It is a nice blunt instrument. I am all in favour of it in a properly ordered way. But the massive drops of the Whitlam and Hawke governments just sent a simple message to workers that said, ‘If you don’t do something and readjust your wage demands, your job will go to China or Thailand or somewhere like that.’ Another difficult thing is the sale of assets. The member sitting opposite knows very well that if we as a coalition in opposition had tried one iota of mischief on the sale of the Commonwealth Bank it would never have gone through caucus. But, as I remind people constantly, whilst the previous government borrowed $80 billion in pursuit of retaining office, they also sold tens of billions of assets and spent that money too. That is not what we did. Having said those things, it is interesting that the member for Rankin wanted to talk about public investment in education. What is happening out there in Australia? People are voting with their feet. They do not want public education. Many of them-sometimes with extreme financial pressure to their family budgets-are moving their children to private schools. Now, in a last line of defence, the Queensland government is legislating to ban for-profit schools. If there are people in our community who think the best opportunity for their kids is for them to go and pay money to a for-profit organisation and if we as the taxing agent can get a bit of that money back as a consequence of any profits made, what is wrong with that? This is an important process. We live with this myth that, unless the government provides the service, the service will not be provided. Every state education budget now represents 50 per cent of revenue from the Australian taxpayer, which is half the cost of educating a kid in a state school. I keep asking why we cannot just send the equivalent of the Australian government’s contribution to education to parents by way of a voucher which would be restricted to being cashed at school. Similar things have been done in other areas. Why can’t we say that ordinary Australians do not need MAIN COMMITTEE a nanny state? I am arguing with my side of politics. We apparently think that people are so deficient in numeracy that, when an airline puts in a newspaper prices of airfares that need to be added up to get a total, the government should do it for them. That is going to create a few problems for small business, who might make a mistake one day and find the ACCC dropping on their head. I have already received communication, which I have circulated today, from the liquor industry saying, ‘Just how do we do that with WET and GST and all the other things that we are supposed to incorporate, which we now put in separately and say, “This is our price plus”?’ As I said, if you want to keep people thinking, maybe you can give them the odd arithmetic problem. I close my remarks in response to the member for Rankin’s comments by saying that we keep being told that the tax rate for somebody re-entering the work force can be as high as 60c to 70c. That is true. But there are all sorts of people out there working-functional families, a husband and wife with a couple of kids, both parents working, both paying taxes. There now seems to be an argument that, when a job becomes available which could be filled by a person who is not working and who is receiving payments due to the generosity of the taxpayer, we should bribe them into taking the job. They are only moving into the same situation as another person who is working in that form of employment. They have not had a job so the government, on behalf of the people, says, ‘Here is assistance for you.’ Of course, that is the nature of Australia. But if someone rings them up or puts an ad in the paper and they take a job, should we add half the assistance that was provided for their previous circumstances, at the cost of other taxpayers, simply because they have taken a job? I do not think we should. I think it is a mythical argument that we have created, and we have got all sorts of people trying to put up solutions. Why not say to everybody on a low income, ‘Keep half the equivalent of unemployment benefits’? You would not do that. I do not think it is an argument we might have to have. I think we are all convinced about it. But it has started to come to me as, ‘Why do I have to pay people to go back into the work force to actually assume a benefit that is different?’ I want to touch on a particular couple of issues in the budget. A lot of people have said things about the new tax rates, and I will spend time on that. I have looked at this Welfare to Work proposal and I congratulate the government on what they are doing. I have received quite a lot of correspondence from people who say that they are single mothers who have a responsibility to their children and that they could not fulfil that responsibility if they were in the work force. I have two married daughters and one daughter-in-law, who are all in the work force, as are their husbands. One has two beautiful daughters, who are very well adjusted and very bright. Another has a son and I think he is a bit like me; he is a bit harder to describe. He is a lovely boy; and his mother works. My third daughter, who is younger, is expecting and I am delighted about that. She is the chief vet of the Western Australian racing industry-a very demanding and highly regarded job. And her husband works. All these families have the problems of getting their kids to school, getting them home and worrying about them. Sometimes someone says to me, ‘Well, I don’t have to be like those other women who work.’ But why do they work? To get on-and to send their kids to private schools, I might add. These are the issues. It is unfair to say: ‘I’m different because I’m a welfare recipient. I’m different from all those who work.’ I do not think welfare recipients are different. But, in order to accommodate both functional families and other, broken families, I MAIN COMMITTEE cannot see why government is not taking more initiatives to encourage business et cetera to create more opportunities to work from home. In my time as minister for local government, I gave local government a $30,000 grant simply to go out and see how many of their staff positions could operate from home with modern technology. As an example, I am told that in the country town of Bunbury, which is represented by the member for Forrest, there is a Centrelink call centre with 300 employees. Why don’t we decentralise that call centre? We are having a good season in my electorate of O’Connor, but with good broadband why can’t some of the farmers’ wives or farmers who are presently in drought conditions sit at home doing their shift in a decentralised call centre? I had a visit from the institute of planners, drawing to my attention the recognised great shortage of town planners. I mentioned this survey I had given money to local government to conduct and the fellow said, ‘If that were available now and people could work from home, there would be no shortage of town planners.’ There are people out there, taking the family option, who have the skills and qualifications to be town planners and, unless you have a faceto-face job in local government, you can do that from anywhere with modern technology. There is a challenge for government to look at opportunities for married women and single women, including women who are no longer with a spouse-or, for that matter, women who are supporting husbands-to work from home. If they work four hours a day at home, they will net as much money as they would from going to work for eight hours a day if they had to pay for child care and those sorts of things. I make those sorts of points as examples of where we can have our cake and eat it too. I have spoken on personal tax cuts at length in recent times. I welcome wholeheartedly the measures of this budget and these appropriation bills, but the quicker we get rid of 42 and 45 the better. There is a myth in society. An anonymous email was read this morning. Let me say to the Labor members present: I do not think the Labor Party realise how many of their constituents, particularly in this town, are in those wage categories. They are not pleased with you-not pleased with you at all. There is a view in the Labor Party that, when you earn $25,000-plus a year, you vote Liberal. In fact, in the modern day, very large numbers of people on very high salaries do not vote Liberal, but they are pretty interested in how much stays in their pocket. I have never employed any person who did not at some time say to me: ‘Thank you for that offer, but what do I get in the hand? How much am I going to take home to my family?’ That is of fundamental interest, and I do not blame them for it. In these higher salary groups, if the tax burden and the add-ons get too high, the jobs will go to India. Government is a major contributor to the cost of employing people. We had better be careful about it because, when you get some high-quality person in your office to an interview and you start talking wages, they want to know how much is left for them. If you have to build that with huge tax burdens, you will start to say, ‘Oh, I can ring up IBM and they will get me some bloke,’ or there are Indian companies running around Australia now. They are the problems. It is no longer a world where certain things are ours because you would have to send gold bars to England to buy the alternative product. If we do not take note of that, we will not do people any favours. I read the other day that if Malcolm Fraser’s arrangements for indexing the tax thresholds, which were implemented I think when I was here, had been retained, the top marginal tax rate would now commence at about $270,000. That is evidence of bracket creep. A little while ago MAIN COMMITTEE I heard certain representatives of the frontbench of the Labor Party complaining about bracket creep and saying that we were screwing the public. I have to agree: I think we are. But we should not be having this debate about what some people earn, the tax cut they get in absolute terms and what somebody else gets. If you want to have that debate it has got to be in percentage terms. It used to be said, comparing an American with someone living in the United Kingdom, that when someone living in the United Kingdom saw someone in a Rolls-Royce they would say, ‘I will get that bloke out of that one day,’ while in America that they would say, ‘I will own one of them one day.’ I think the psyche of Australians today is that we all aspire to something better and we are not jealous about the person who has got it. We should not be trying to get this argument up again. I think it is bad policy. We are not doing it. We are only part of the way as far as I am concerned. I will not go any further into how we can retain a reasonable budget. In that regard, the back page of the Financial Review quoted a Dr Sinclair Davidson of RMIT, who pointed out that the lowest 25 per cent taxpayers contribute 3.1 per cent of the tax collected, the middle group of taxpayers contribute 32.8 per cent, while the top 25 per cent of taxpayers contribute 64.1 per cent. People who earn over $100,000 or more account for 3.5 per cent of the population yet pay 25 per cent of all net income tax. I am not sure that that is entirely fair and I am not sure that it is smart. I do not know why we keep getting dragged into that particular argument and, for those who think it might give them a political advantage, I do not think it is resonating with the Australian people. I favour these tax cuts and I will go on arguing that the best way to get out of all the tax schemes that often trap people is to harmonise the company tax rate and the highest marginal tax rate. There are ways of achieving that. When we get to that our society will be better off. Someone made the silly remark the other day in Queensland that a flat 15 per cent for rural workers would be a good idea. There are not too many rural workers who pay a flat 15 per cent. That is further evidence of it. (Time expired) 2006 and cognate bills. It is amazing that, when we get to these appropriation bills, which are bills about taxes and the things that the government has done in the budget, government members-and I have listened to quite a few of them speak-barely mention the budget, the tax cuts and the details of how good it supposedly will be for their own constituents. There may be an explanation as to why government members are not spending a lot of time explaining how good the tax cuts are. It may be because they are not really that good at all. They talk about looking at it in percentage terms and in dollars. I do not really care whether government members raise it in percentages, in dollars or whatever. The reality is that a lot of people are realising that what they are getting is basically a couple of stubbies worth of a tax cut while people in the top bracket are getting a full buffet, a bottle of wine and a sixpack as well. I am also yet to hear many government members talk about how good this is for them, but I will get to that a little later. This budget was meant to be about Australia’s future. It was meant to be about trying to make Australia a more productive and efficient country and a better place for everybody, where people who work hard are rewarded more. I agree with a lot of the sentiments put forward by government members, by our members and by a lot of people who say, ‘Reward for MAIN COMMITTEE",173,Appropriation Bill No 2 2005 2006 Appropriation Parliamentary Departments Bill No 1 2005 2006 Appropriation Bill No 5 2004 2005 Appropriation Bill No 6 2004 2005
222,Mr Ripoll (Oxley) (6.48 Pm),"I rise today to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2005work, reward for effort.’ I have no issue at all with that principle and that concept. The Labor Party is based on the principle of reward for effort and reward for work. But we do not see that in the budget. What we see are two principles, two ideologies. One ideology within the budget is very clear: it is the argument from the government and from Peter Costello that, to give people at the top end of the brackets the incentive to work harder, you need to give them bigger and bigger tax cuts and to reward them more. We just heard the member for O’Connor talk about what he believes to be middle and high and low, and he has it all over the place. These days when we talk about ‘the middle’, we are talking about anyone on $30,000, $40,000 or $50,000, right up to $80,000 or $90,000. The world has changed, and maybe a few government members should have a closer look at what people are earning in the middle. The ideology of the government in the budget with regard to the middle to lower end is that, to get them to work harder, you need a bigger stick: ‘We’re going to take more off you and we’re going to make it harder for you, because that’s the only thing you understand.’ That is what the government says to people. People will work this out. People will feel this, as the tax cuts start to come through from 1 July. People will start to understand that they are not really getting much of a difference. It is very little. It is always welcome; there is no doubt about that. I am being sensible about this: of course people welcome tax cuts. They would welcome it if you gave them one dollar, but it does not mean they are overly happy about it. It just means you are giving them back a little in return for the masses you have taken from them. In the history of this parliament, there has never been so much money, so much revenue, come into these chambers as now. It is the rivers of revenue that flow into Canberra in unprecedented proportions that can feed the huge surpluses and that can go back in the form of tax cuts. I would have been much more impressed with the tax cuts if they were more about tax reform. I think that is where we should have gone. The issues I have just spoken about are what the budget is about. It should have been about Australia’s future but it was really all about Peter Costello’s future. It was about him putting forward an agenda to demonstrate to his party room colleagues that he is the man to lead; that he as the Treasurer is the person who can deliver massive tax cuts-in terms of the totality, nearly $24 billion-and give the majority, the biggest bulk, the biggest chunk, to high-income earners. Those who are rewarded the most are people who sit in this chamber. I as well as everybody else in this chamber will get the biggest windfall out of this budget, and people will work this out. They will understand that the people who won out of this budget more than anybody else are those on the highest of high incomes-in that top three per cent, as the member for O’Connor said. Only three per cent of taxpayers in Australia earn more than $125,000 and yet they will by far get the largest chunk of the tax cuts. In this budget, Peter Costello’s focus was not on the Australian economy. It was not on efficiency; it was not on productivity and growth or fixing up bottlenecks. It was not on any of those things. It was not about making us a stronger, more robust, resilient economy into the future for the next 15 years. It was all about him, the Treasurer. It was about his personal ambition. It was about him making a statement to his backbench that he will make up for things that might have been lost in previous times. MAIN COMMITTEE I am not the only person to have that view. Government members opposite might not be surprised at this, but former Liberal Party leader Dr John Hewson had this to say in the Australian Financial Review on 13 May 2005: This budget was much more about Costello attempting to build broader political support for his claim on the leadership than it was about setting a detailed medium-term policy agenda ... In short, the Treasurer was paving the way, with the rivers of revenue from taxpayers’ hip pockets, for his tilt at the top job. We know it is a little quiet in the Liberal Party at the moment but it is not too far away. The Treasurer really does not have too many choices, does he? He can be just a complete wimp on this issue and just not bother-why did he even drag people to this point?-or at some stage he has to make a move. We are all watching. We will watch this space. As I said, this budget and this government were about the tax cuts in themselves; they were not about tax reform. Tax reform is what the business community has been asking for, and that is what people on middle, low and high incomes have been asking for. Let us have a look at a real agenda to make the economy stronger and make our tax system a fairer tax system, and let us reward effort and work. Let us do it through a better tax system. There is an unprecedented amount that is being spent, but what is also unprecedented is the unfairness of that which is being spent on tax cuts. People need to remember that the reason the government is giving back such a chunk is that they have taken more than they have ever taken before, and it is not about to end. Future predictions of revenue to government through taxes are phenomenal and like nothing we have seen in the past. It is simply an unfair, unbalanced budget, and I believe that Australians deserve a better, fairer deal and that it can be easily achieved. In the words of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, they deserve a new deal. They deserve a new deal, because they deserve more than the $6. I know government members will laugh, but let me put it to you in these terms, which are quite simple. For the same impost on the budget, the same money-no extra-and without putting a burden or upward pressure on interest rates, you can deliver real tax reform to ordinary Australians, people earning up to $70,000, $80,000, $90,000 a year. You can give them not just $6; you can double it and give them $12. But that is only if members of parliament on the government side-the Liberal and National party members-are prepared to slightly cut their own tax cut. I just cannot see that happening. I cannot see that out of the goodness of their hearts they will walk into this place and say: ‘Hang on; these guys have actually got a point. Rather than pocketing $65, I’ll still get a fairly big tax cut, but a little bit less will be enough to redistribute down to the people who need it. There would be a decent impact on the economy, and it would give them double. I think that is a fair trade; I think that would actually work pretty well.’ They could do that. We are not opposing tax cuts. Where did the government get that crazy idea? We are putting forward a better, new deal on tax cuts-a $12 tax cut. We are saying to the government, ‘Support Labor’s agenda on tax cuts and give people $12 not $6.’ We are not about delaying or somehow making it harder in terms of tax; we want the tax cuts. We want to make it fair, and we want people to get a decent tax cut of $12, not $6, and at the same time deliver some genuine tax reform. People mention all that stuff about bracket creep and they talk about how any real gains we are getting are being whittled away. This is not even to mention what the Reserve Bank, the MAIN COMMITTEE IMF, the OECD and a range of other credible institutions have said. They have made it quite plain and clear that delivering a $24 billion injection into the economy through these types of tax cuts will put upward pressure on interest rates. So one week people will get a $6 tax cut in their back pocket and the following week the Reserve Bank of Australia will be moving to put up interest rates and they will lose more than they will gain. Does the government believe that is fair? Those tax cuts will be eaten away in two ways: one, through interest rate increases and two, through bracket creep and inflation. There is no real incentive in terms of a decent tax cut for people from this government. I believe that a much fairer and more reasonable position would be to service the vast majority of Australians. I will give you some examples. This one is quite simple. In my electorate of Oxley the government are denying around 92 per cent of my electors a decent tax cut of $12 just because they want to keep their own tax cuts in their own pockets. I could go around this chamber and name almost every member in this regard-except, perhaps, three in the wealthier suburbs on the North Shore of Sydney who would not be in that category. Most government members are denying around 80 per cent to 90 per cent of their constituents fair and decent tax cuts. AgainI want to turn just briefly to what Dr John Hewson had to say in terms of where the government is in relation to this budget and tax cuts. He said: Although the government would claim to be a tax reforming government, it has not really bitten the bullet of genuine tax reform. It has just danced around it. That was in the Australian Financial Review on 13 May 2005. So somebody of standing in the business community and in the Liberal Party such as Dr John Hewson also confirms that there just is not any real tax reform. This government claims to be the government of great tax reformers and so forth, but when you look at its record it does not stand. Where is the tax reform? Where are the great changes that will need to be made? It smacks of a lack of leadership. What we have seen is a lack of leadership. This economy and this country need solid leadership into the future. It is not by accident that we enjoy good economic times under this government. It was not the making of this government. They inherited it from the previous government. Any economist will tell you and anybody who is worth their weight in salt will show you that the easy figures on this 15-year economic growth did not come from the nine years of government from this mob. This mob inherited it. Even the Prime Minister said in 1996 that it was an economy ‘better in part than most’. He inherited a decent economy, an economy that had the fundamentals and the principles right. It was an economy built for sustainability into the future. It was built for growth and built to deliver the sorts of returns the government can now enjoy. It takes a very brave and courageous government and people with some fortitude and vision to take the hard decisions. They will hurt and often you will pay a political price for taking tough decisions. Tough decisions never come cheap. Sometimes the political price is losing office. But the reality is that you set the course for the next 20 years, a generation away from where you are today, for the future. That is what this government should do. I would not bemoan it if this government came into this place with a decent reform agenda on taxation. They would probably be very surprised. They would get a very supportive attitude from our side, from Labor, because we are trying to push for reform. The business community wants MAIN COMMITTEE reform and I can tell you that taxpayers certainly want reform, but we are seeing no leadership in this area. There is another area where we see no leadership. A great opportunity has been missed in budget after budget, and we wait in hope. People wait in hope for leadership in terms of infrastructure. Infrastructure is a bit of a buzzword around the place and I do not want to overuse it in this chamber. But the reality is that Labor has been talking about infrastructure for yearsto deaf ears in the government, I have to say. We have been talking about all sorts of infrastructure that drive our economy. But what have we seen from this government? The best they could come up with was AusLink, commonly known around the traps as ‘AusStink’ because there is not much in it. It is $12 billion, a substantial amount of money, but let us put that into context. Let us weigh up ‘AusStink’ on one hand with what the Queensland state government is doing in just one part of Queensland. I see the member for Maranoa in here and I do not think he could disagree with me if I said to him that a $55 billion state infrastructure plan legislated for-the first of its kind in Australia-actually delivers certainty. It actually gives the economy in Queensland a decent place to go into the future. It gives us direction. Mr Bruce Scott interjectingfor Maranoa wants to interject and tell me it is about the south-east corner, I would say to him: you are right because it is called the south-east Queensland infrastructure plan. Mr Bruce Scott-What about the rest? lion on top of everything else the state government is spending. It is a decent and large investment in the Queensland people and in the Queensland economy. It is about roads, bridges, ports and airports. It is about ensuring a future for Queensland. Anyone who looks at the Queensland economy will agree that it has a very bright future. If only we could convince the leader of this country, the Prime Minister, to take on board some sort of comparatively weighted infrastructure plan for this country. If south-east Queensland alone-and, as I said before, I will take the interjection of the member for Maranoa-can spend $55 billion and have a 20-year strategic plan, why can’t Australia do that? Why can we not see this country take some leadership on some of these issues and give us some comparatively weighted infrastructure? I have heard the Treasurer, Peter Costello, bleating to us many times in this place about Dalrymple Bay. But what does he offer? One day we hear him bleating about it and then he comes into the chamber today and says, ‘Oh, they’ve actually done something about it and they’re going to have it done in two years time.’ Can the Treasurer do it faster? I do not think so. Has he offered any money? No. Has he offered any concrete criticism, anything positive, anything we can do to make Dalrymple Bay a more efficient port? No, he has not. All he is offering is criticism. He is not offering a solution. What do we hear John Anderson, the Deputy Prime Minister, say? He goes off and bleats about Dalrymple Bay without knowing what he is talking about. He starts talking about regulation and bringing in the ACCC. The same day he cops a backhander from the Prime Minister and has to apologise to the whole country and recant on what he said. Do you know why he had to recant? He had to recant because he did not know what he was talking about. I was MAIN COMMITTEE",177,Appropriation Bill No 2 2005 2006 Appropriation Parliamentary Departments Bill No 1 2005 2006 Appropriation Bill No 5 2004 2005 Appropriation Bill No 6 2004 2005

All he knows is that 40 ships are sitting off the coast. Anyone could tell you that because they are sitting out there. But it is a much more complex and involved issue and, if people looked at it more closely, they would understand what has been taking place. Yes, I have some criticisms about what has been taking place, but something is being done. It did not take the federal government to do it; it took the Queensland state government to do it. They are working towards a solution now with prime infrastructure. But all we get from this government is criticism. You do not get a positive outcome. You do not get a solution. You do not get some sort of suggestion saying, ‘Okay, let’s work together. Let’s work in a partnership. Let’s find what we need to do to make this economy stronger and grow.’ No. Mr Baird interjectingabout their embarrassment. I would be embarrassed too if I were a government member on this. I will take the interjection from the member for Cook. I would be embarrassed too if I were he, a government member, because he knows nothing of what is happening in the ports around this country-and he should know something. But we get the Treasurer speaking about it and we get a whole heap of people talking about it from the government side, but they offer nothing. In contrast to that, Labor does have ideas. We have a plan. We have a way forward for this country. One plan is in the form of infrastructure Australia, a national body which would coordinate work in partnership with the states. It would form part of a standing agenda item on the Coalition of Australian Governments. It would give us a point of reference, a peak body, to work in conjunction with the states. Mr Baird interjectingbut what more could this country do but work in partnership with the states? Is there something wrong with working in partnership or is it just because the states are Labor? So you do not really care about the people; you just care about the politics-is that right? Is that what government members are telling me? It is not about the people of the states; it is about the government of the states. So you are more concerned about the politics than you are about the issues. It is really disappointing that members of the government have that view because I think there is a real opportunity for us to work with the states and with the federal government regardless of their political colour and personal ideologies to make a difference for this economy, to show leadership, to give us infrastructure reform, to lead the way and not just talk about it but provide some action. That is what we need in this country. about the further privatisation of Telstra. It has been on our agenda since we were elected in 1996, and at subsequent elections we have gone to the people of Australia saying that we continue our policy of looking to the further privatisation of Telstra. I will seek to table some documents during my address. I have checked with the opposition and they are quite happy. The documents I wish to refer to and table during my speech follow my study trip to New Zealand looking at the issue of privatisation of Telstra-what has happened in New Zealand and the comparison between the regulatory regime in New Zealand and Australia.

227,Mr Bruce Scott (Maranoa) (7.08 Pm),"I rise tonight in the budget debate to talkquite a clear document which identifies the differences between the two regulatory regimes. Also there are some press clippings in relation to some of the things I will refer to tonight. Many in this House would know that the electorate of Maranoa is primarily a rural electorate. It is important that all of us in this House represent the concerns of our constituents. After all, they sent us to Canberra and it is our duty to make sure that their concerns are raised in whatever forums are appropriate, including our party forums. I will be raising some of those issues in my address tonight. To begin with, who could forget the state of affairs this government was left to deal with when we came to government in 1996, after 13 years of Hawke and Keating Labor government? I want to remind the House that in 1996, when the coalition came to government, not only were we left with a $96 billion debt, high interest rates and high unemployment but Labor had also deserted regional, rural and remote Australia, particularly in relation to basic telecommunication services and infrastructure. The Labor government had not only neglected the Australian economy but also abandoned the people who live in rural and remote parts of Australia. Telecommunications is an essential service for all Australians. It enables families to keep in contact with each other and allows businesses to conduct their day-to-day operations more efficiently. With the latest telecommunications infrastructure, school students can research their assignments on the internet. Tourists are more likely to visit if they can stay in touch with their families. In reality, the list of benefits from quality, world-class communications infrastructure is endless. Unfortunately, people in rural and remote parts of Australia are simply not always privy to-and have not been in the past-the same essential services that are accessible to people in urban and suburban parts of Australia. An inequity exists between city and country with regard to communications, and we as a government have been trying to close that digital divide. We all know that profits are the bottom line. That is the nature of any business; we understand that. Since Telstra were made a government business enterprise, they have had to make sure that they did not undertake any unviable business propositions. That was one of their responsibilities when they were corporatised in 1991. Telstra will still freely tell you today that, whatever they invest in, it is going to have to show a business return to Telstra in the near future. Sometimes that is four or five years away, but they have seen that as one of their very important charters since corporatisation. Unfortunately, this will all too often become the catch cry of a fully privatised Telstra. It is for this sole reason that the government must safeguard the people of the bush prior to the full sale of Telstra. Since coming to government we have done a great deal. I want to outline some of those things tonight. Many people in rural Australia have vivid memories of the privatisation of government business enterprises in the past. The Labor Party privatised the Commonwealth Bank and TAA, and they were necessary reforms, which we supported when we were in opposition. For that very reason, the people of rural and remote Australia know that when it happens it is all about the business bottom line. You have to make sure when you do thatand in this case when Telstra is fully privatised-that you put in place regulations to ensure that future services will not deteriorate. That is the fundamental concern that people of rural and remote Australia have. They know that we have done a great deal since coming to government. They know that it is our duty, and my duty as the member for Maranoa, to make sure MAIN COMMITTEE that we future-proof communications services and grant access to new technologies as they become available in the future. I remember also that when Labor was in government they abolished, in law, a perfectly good mobile phone technology-the analogue service. It was working well. It reached further than many of our newer technologies because of its power and the type of system that it was. That technology was abolished by law without there being a replacement. I said earlier in my address that the people of rural and remote Australia are still well aware of the Labor government’s record, not only in their management of the economy but also because they took away a perfectly good mobile technology and did not have any plan to replace it or to provide funds to make sure that a new technology was rolled out. Since coming to government we have assisted in closing the digital divide that exists between city and country in telecommunications in Australia. Among other achievements we have had the Besley and Estens inquiries. Following the Besley inquiry a major fund was established called Networking the Nation. The Estens inquiry brought forward many recommendations which we as a government are still rolling out today and the money for which has been provided in the budget to ensure that communications advances continue to be made in rural, regional and remote areas of Australia. Following both those inquiries and the money that we have provided, we have seen substantial improvements in telecommunications infrastructure and I want to mention a few of those tonight. We have been able to inject some $1 billion of capital into infrastructure and the roll-out of new technologies. My own electorate has seen the roll-out of the extended zone contract for untimed local calls. When we came to government there were still 40,000 subscribers-and I know you had some in Tasmania, Deputy Speaker Quick-who still paid for timed local calls. So often I would hear people say, ‘All Australians have access to untimed local calls.’ That was wrong. Telstra needed money to put in new infrastructure so that those communities who for generations had timed local calls were able to access untimed local calls, like 99.9 per cent of Australians. That came as part of the extended zone contract. Being the successful tenderer, Telstra added value to their competitive tender by making available to those communities a two-way satellite which gave them access to the Internet, which was otherwise unavailable. That was a tremendous contract and a great step forward in technology for those many subscribers in rural and remote parts of Australia. The roll-out of the CDMA technology for mobile phones has been a magnificent replacement for analogue. The funding from the federal government enabled the roll-out of this technology in areas where the analogue system used to be. That roll-out has been expanded because of an injection of federal government capital into areas where mobile phone coverage was previously not available. The Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts recently visited my electorate to view the latest communications technology in action. This technology has been made available following the Besley inquiry and the injection of more than $1 billion into communications infrastructure around Australia, particularly rural and remote parts of Australia. The minister was terribly impressed with what she saw. When she visited at a property north of Longreach in my electorate she saw three small children participating in a school lesson. What was so exciting about this was that, while it may be commonplace in the city to MAIN COMMITTEE see children participating in a school lesson, I can assure you that it has not been a normal scene in rural parts of Australia. These three small children were located some 80 kilometres north of Longreach on their family property and were conducting their school lessons via the internet. The internet was connected via the two-way satellite. As I mentioned earlier, that came as part of the extended zone contract at no cost to this family or those who got connected through this technology. And they were using the telephone that comes through the wireless local loop as the clear voice signal. The wireless local loop, the CDMA technology, replaced the DRCS. The telephone call was a local untimed call to the Longreach School of Distance Education. So here were these students doing their school lessons 80 kilometres away from where the teacher was. There were students a further 200 kilometres away on the other side of Longreach, connected via the internet, via two-way satellite, using a clear voice signal. It was magnificent, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker Quick-I am sure you can appreciate the scene. How it has changed, and only in the last few years. These students for decades and decades, until only a few years ago, did their school lessons over an HF radio system. On HF radio only one person could talk at once, and sometimes when atmospheric conditions were poor they could not even make contact with their teacher. This is a magnificent example of how the government’s communications fund money has been used to tremendous advantage to bridge that digital divide. To see young children being able to utilise world-class technology to gain access to education was certainly invigorating. There is still a long way to go to bridge this divide between city and country. In some parts of my electorate people still have a single-channel radio service as their main trunk route. What this means is that this technology does not have the capacity to allow for the installation of mobile phones in these communities. There is not the bandwidth capacity to be able to put mobile phones in places like Birdsville, Bedourie, Windorah and Jundah. In fact, you might have heard of those at question time today. The Minister for Small Business and Tourism answered a question from me today about how tourism is growing in these remote parts of Australia. She talked about the jobs that are being generated because of the tourism growth in this part of Queensland. I know it is similar in many parts of Australia. It is not just confined to the western part of my electorate. Those communities will not be able to have hand-held mobile phones while ever a single-channel radio system is their connection to the main trunk routes into the main network across Australia. Ms HallMr Deputy Speaker, I seek to intervene. tion? Ms Hall-Yes, I am. Ms Hall-Thank you very much. Listening to you talk about the single-channel radio and the problems that your constituents have with mobile phones, I was wondering: have they expressed any opinion to you about the sale of Telstra? What strategies will you have in place to ensure that they have the proper coverage that they need once the government sells Telstra?

230,Mr Bruce Scott,"Yes, I will.in-reply speech tonight. I have certainly been out with them. I am talking about what we have done to bridge that digital divide and to replace the analogue service that was legislated by a Labor government to be abolished, what we have replaced it with and what we have done to bring modern communications into these small rural and remote communities. I said a moment ago that we have got more to do, that our job is not over. My job as the member for Maranoa is not complete, hence my speech tonight. Telstra Country Wide has been one of the most wonderful things that Telstra have done. I am sure that you found that in your home state, Mr Deputy Speaker. They put the face of Telstra back into the communities. They had walked away from those communities. They thought that people of rural Australia and those remote communities would always be loyalthey could go to Brisbane, Sydney and Hobart, and people would always stick with them. I can assure you that the people out there were very disappointed when that happened. It happened over many years, including under previous governments. But we have addressed that by law to make sure that Telstra has a face, which is one of the recommendations of the Estens inquiry-that they have a physical presence in 39 regions around Australia. They understand the geography and they understand the people, and that is why I have to say that Telstra Country Wide has done a magnificent job. My time is going to run out if I do not move very quickly to what I saw in New Zealand; hence I seek leave to table the documents in relation to the reports on what I saw in New Zealand. Leave granted. Australia. There are about 10 to 15 per cent of subscribers who they flag as non-viable business market opportunities. In other words, they have to be covered by a universal service obligation just as ours have to be in Australia, but many of these are in my electorate and rural and remote parts of Australia. There are many concerns from farmers who are living in these non-commercially viable markets in New Zealand, and that concern also resonates here in Australia. That is covered in the reports of my visit to New Zealand. What we have to do as we move to the further privatisation of Telstra is give confidence to the people of rural and remote Australia, wherever they live, that we are going to ensure that, through future proofing, they are not left behind again. They have been left behind beforenot just by something that previous governments might not have done; it dates back in history, and I do not want to point the finger at anyone in that regard-and we have a responsibility to make sure they are not left behind in the future. The challenge confronting the government is that there are parts of Australia where commercial markets will not provide for new and improved services and infrastructure, because it is simply not a good business proposition for the carrier. The same applied in New Zealand. My fundamental concern as the member for Maranoa is to ensure general parity of pricing and equity of services between city and country post the full privatisation of Telstra. This includes connections of new services currently covered by price averaging and should include the cost of satellite internet infrastructure. I would require a minimum of three pillars to ensure future parity, with the first to establish a trust fund using the proceeds from the sale of Telstra for future technology upgrades.

231,Mr Bruce Scott,That is exactly the question I am addressing in my budget address,186,Appropriation Bill No 2 2005 2006 Appropriation Parliamentary Departments Bill No 1 2005 2006 Appropriation Bill No 5 2004 2005 Appropriation Bill No 6 2004 2005
232,Mr Bruce Scott,"In New Zealand, I found exactly the same circumstances as exist infund would be dedicated to providing for any future upgrades to technology and/or infrastructure in rural and remote Australia and would be made available through a competitive tender. The second would be the establishment of a rural and remote independent telecommunications advisory board, which would need to report annually on service levels and conduct regular reviews on the standards of service every three years or when deemed necessary. Furthermore, I would like to see Telstra Country Wide being required by law to maintain a physical presence in rural and remote Australia as a condition of licence. (Time expired) Mr Bruce ScottMr Deputy Speaker, since I took a question from the honourable member for Shortland, I seek to table the remainder of my comments. Leave granted. Ms HALL (Shortland) (7.29 pm)-The Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2005-2006 and cognate bills we are debating here in the House tonight are related to a budget of missed opportunity, a budget under which the people of Shortland have fared very badly. It always makes me feel very sad when I rise in this House and see legislation that has been brought to the parliament that disadvantages the people I am elected to support in this House. There were just a couple of things that I thought the government could have provided to the people of Shortland that would not have been too big an impost for them. For a very long time, we in Shortland have been fighting for the government to reopen the Medicare office in Belmont. I have submitted somewhere in the vicinity of 20,000 signatures supporting the reopening of that office. It is in an area that supports an elderly population. It is in an area where there is a low level of bulk-billing. It is in an area where people really need to be able to access a Medicare office. But, unfortunately, the government was not prepared to move beyond its political agenda and provide that to the people in an area of great needwhere 40 per cent of the people actually vote for the government. I think sometimes the government forget that there are a significant number of people who live within Labor electorates who actually vote for the government. If they have the mentality of only supporting and looking after those people who vote for them then they are ignoring the 40 per cent of the people there whose votes they got. I find it unbelievable that in this parliament the government can totally ignore people in an electorate that is not a Liberal held electorate. The problems that have existed at the University of Newcastle are well known in this House. They are problems that the minister has chosen to ignore. The University of Newcastle has three campuses: two in the Hunter and one on the Central Coast, the Ourimbah campus. I recently attended a meeting at the Ourimbah campus. That is in the electorate of the member for Dobell. I was really surprised when I found out that he was not in attendance at that meeting. Those young people attend an institution in the electorate that he represents, and I have not seen him standing up in this parliament fighting for that university to be assisted in its time of trouble. The third electorate-specific issue I will quickly touch on is Energy Australia Stadium, the home of the Newcastle Knights-a stadium that the Howard government has continually refused to support in any shape or form. It is interesting that it can find money to support a stadium at Penrith, a perceived marginal electorate, in the lead-up to the last election, but it totally ignores the needs of the people of the Hunter-people who are absolutely football mad, MAIN COMMITTEE devoted to their team-and is prepared to let them have a second-class facility. It is very selective. Once again, it is a government that looks after its mates but totally ignores all other Australians, and I will go through a few issues here that will highlight some of my concerns. I started my contribution by saying that this is a budget of missed opportunities. It is a budget that ignores the fact that its answer to solving the skills shortage has been to import 20,000 workers from overseas. The problem we have had with the skills shortage has been in existence for some time. Towards the end of last year, I spoke on the Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill. In my contribution to the debate on that bill, I highlighted how the government’s inaction over a long period of time had resulted in this enormous skills shortage. I went through a report prepared by the Australian Industry Group which highlighted the shortages that existed in the Hunter and how small to medium businesses were having a great deal of difficulty in attracting the kinds of workers who had the skills to address the shortage. This situation has been allowed to develop over a long period of time. The government has actively allowed our training system to run down. One of the first acts of the Howard government was to rip money out of the TAFE system in all states. The result of this is a situation where you have fewer and fewer people able to access training. In this contribution, I have referred to the DEWR skill vacancy index of 2003-04 to look at some of the areas where there are skills shortages and some of the occupations where vacancies just cannot be filled. There has been a 38 per cent increase in the number of vacancies in the electrical and electronic trades. There has been a 21 per cent increase in the number of vacancies in the metal trades, a 45 per cent increase in vacancies in the printing trades and a 17.9 per cent increase in vacancies in the construction trades. That is an enormous increase in the number of vacancies that cannot be filled. It was also appropriate at that stage-and it is appropriate to do so again-to put on record that there has been an 8.9 per cent increase in vacancies in the last 12 months. In the Hunter, 61 companies reported a total of 805 vacancies in 2004, and 85 per cent of the companies surveyed were experiencing severe skill shortages; 633 vacancies were recorded at a trade level and above. I put that on the record because I think it goes to the core of the problem that we see before us. I believe that the budget that was brought down does absolutely nothing to address that issue. The government will be importing 20,000 skilled workers from overseas, but really we need something a little more proactive and a little more far-reaching. We do not need a government that will continue to attack our universities. We need a government that will ensure that every child that has the ability to attend university has the opportunity to do so. Currently under this government a situation is evolving where it is not your ability to attend university that determines whether you manage to go there; rather, it is your ability to pay. I do not think that is good enough. I know so many young people within my electorate who would really like an apprenticeship. I have actively pursued apprenticeships for some of them. I have contacted employers and contacted unions, and in a couple of cases I have been successful. However, generally speaking, the support that employers need in order to offer apprenticeships just is not available. While I am talking about skill shortages and issues relating to employment, I will put on the record a conversation that I had at one of the shopping centres in my electorate last SaturMAIN COMMITTEE day morning. An employee of one of the Job Network providers came up to me on three occasions because she kept thinking of issues she needed to bring to my attention. She said that she was very worried about the government’s philosophy; she was very worried about the availability of places, of suitable jobs; and she was very worried about the government’s proposed changes in the area of disability support pensioners and single parents. She highlighted that there were not enough child-care places, there were not enough out of school hours places-I acknowledge the fact that the government provided more out of school hours places in the budget, and that is very welcome within my electorate-and there were very limited training places. She said that Job Network providers are having a lot of pressure placed on them to breach job seekers, and she found that particularly hard. She said that they are being asked to jump through more hoops more often and that the hoops are being raised higher and are more frequent. She said that, when they are working with job seekers, they go out of their way to create a relationship based on trust and that this pressure tended to undermine that. She also highlighted workload issues and how the breaching of job seekers adds to their workload and prevents them from doing the job that they are being asked to do, which is to find jobs for workers. When she was talking about people on disability support she highlighted to me a case of a 59-year-old woman whom she had managed to place three times. This woman was deaf. It took three failed placements before she realised that people with hearing impairment need special support. I can support that as well. BeforeI became a member of parliament I worked as a rehabilitation counsellor. My occupation required me to assist people with disabilities to enter the work force. The first point I need to make is that the way to get people to enter the work force is not to punish them but to give them a lot of support. I worked with hearing impaired jobseekers and I know how difficult it is to place them successfully and then to enable them to keep that job long term. I worked with one young woman for 10 years. We placed her in a job and even as a member of parliament I intervened a couple of times with her employer to give support and to negotiate to ensure that she maintained that employment. Finally, when there were some management changes she lost her job and is now unemployed. She is a very intelligent young woman but she has problems that are very specific to people with hearing impairment. Any member of this House who spoke to this young woman would see a very intelligent young woman with a lot to offer. However, when it comes to the placement in the workplace, it is not as easy as members opposite think. Another issue that was raised with me was casual work and requirements for casual workers on Newstart to actively seek a job. Someone working casually has to go out and look for a job as well and attend job training seminars et cetera. I was given the scenario of someone who works at the Job Network provider and delivers a session on job seeking in the morning but in the afternoon is required to go and attend the same session because she is only a casual employee. The issues of lack of stability and the inability to obtain finance to buy a house or to plan for the future were also highlighted. While I was at that shopping centre a gentleman came up to me and spoke about his young grand-daughter. He went to ALDI to collect an application form for a job for her. When he got there, they were out of application forms. There was one job and 5,000 people had already applied for it. That is why I believe that the government needs to be realistic about where it is MAIN COMMITTEE going with these reforms. The government’s welfare to work changes are very punitive. The government is not fully aware of the issues that surround people with disabilities. It is just another way of creating a different category of people who are, to use government terminology, on the dole. It will result in peoples’ incomes being slashed by up to $215 a week. If you have a disability, you have special needs. Quite often you are taking medication. The government’s policy will just add to their hardship. It will make it more and more difficult for people with disabilities to even afford to look for work. If you have a disability and you decide to look for work, there is a risk. If you fail, where do you go from there? You could end up a lot worse than you were before you made the attempt to enter the work force. As for supporting parents and single parent families, I believe that the government is once again attacking some of the most disadvantaged people in our community. The member for Sydney gave an example that I thought was very good. She described a woman who is getting extra money through the family tax benefit because she is a stay-at-home mum. On his way home from work one night, her husband has a motor accident and is killed. Then she is a single parent and she has the family tax benefit reduced. I do not think that is fair, I do not think that is caring and I do not believe that the government has the real interests of people at heart. I looked at some figures today on the break-up of people on disability support pension, and that answered some of the questions for me. The 20 electorates that had the least people in receipt of disability support pensions were all government held electorates. SoI suppose that members on the other side of this House feel that, if it is not going to affect the people living in their electorates, they can afford to attack those people who are most vulnerable and most disadvantaged within the community. I would like to mention quickly a paper released this week by St Vincent de Paul which highlighted the great divide between those people that have and those people that have not. This questioned the statistical data that was being used by the government and highlighted the fact that there is greater inequity within the community now than at any other time in Australia’s history. The divide between those people that have and those people that have not is getting greater. This shows that it is harder and harder for people on low incomes to survive. With the cost of living constantly increasing, those people at the bottom end of the income scale are constantly disadvantaged. The only thing that this budget delivered to age pensioners was an increase in the cost of their medication. As of this year, pensioners-and everyone else for that matter-will have to pay for an extra two prescriptions before they reach the safety net. I highlighted pensioners and veterans because they are two groups that are more reliant on prescriptions and medication than other people in the community. I was speaking to some partners of veterans today, and they are absolutely disgusted about the carers allowance. They are staying at home looking after their veteran partners who are extremely disabled, but they are ineligible for the $1,000 carers payment because they are not on the carers allowance. They feel they are being discriminated against. The other area as far as veterans’ affairs is concerned is the fraud that the government is putting out into the community. There is no new money. All the money in the budget in the area of veterans’ affairs is natural growth. In fact, there is an $82 million saving with the toughening up of the safety net. This is definitely a budget that ignores those people in need. I do not know how the member for Dobell can go back to his electorate and tell the majority of his constituents that they MAIN COMMITTEE are getting a tax cut of $6 a week while he is getting $65 a week. I do not know how he can go back to his electorate and say to all those people on disability support pensions and single parent pensions that he is not going to support them or fight for them. AndI do not know how he can say to all those young people who attend the University of Newcastle that he is not going to fight for them and for their futures. (Time expired) bills, these appropriations for what is a great budget for families and business in Casey and right across Australia. Before addressing some of the detail of the budget, I point out that the previous speaker, the member for Shortland, like so many of those opposite, has demonstrated once again just how out of touch she is with not just her own electorate but Australia. In a 20-minute speech supposedly on the budget there was not one mention of debt, not a single mention of interest rates, no mention at all of the fact that the budget is in surplus, no mention of the historic challengeMs Hall interjectingchance. land, who was listened to in boredom and silence, was not interrupted at all for 20 minutes. If she wishes to stay here and interject, that just reflects on her. I would have thought that on the budget, where we have a 20-minute speech, it would be possible for people to express their views without the member for Shortland losing control and without her trying to drown out people who have a different opinion to her. That might be something she is used to in the Labor Party. I would have thought that on a budget bill it would have been possible to have a calm discussion and to deal with some of the facts at hand. I point out again that she failed to mention interest rates, failed to mention the fact that the budget is in surplus and failed to mention any of the issues on which the Labor Party failed so tremendously when they were last in government. I can understand why she would want to do that. She wants to forget what Labor did when last in office. She wants to forget the fact that we had the recession we had to have and she wants to forget the fact that under Labor the budget-these very appropriation bills-looked very different. We were not talking about surplus budgets and we were not talking about budgets that were able to fund key responsibilities. That is what these appropriation bills do. They fund important national priorities, they fund reform that is needed to sustain the Australian economy in the years ahead and they plan for the future. I will address some of those in detail as I go. To give a budget speech and fail to mention the past and fail to acknowledge Labor’s past failure says one of two things: it says that either the Labor Party are ignoring their own history or the member for Shortland is ignorant of it. I am not sure what the answer is. Those opposite would have a better idea. For the sake of the record I will go through how things have changed in these appropriation bills compared to the last set of appropriation bills presided over by those opposite. For a start this is a surplus budget. We have grown used to surplus budgets under the Howard government and under the treasurership of Mr Costello. But of course in Labor’s day surpluses were rare things.

234,The Deputy Speaker ( Mr Quick),Order! The member for Shortland has had her,191,Appropriation Bill No 2 2005 2006 Appropriation Parliamentary Departments Bill No 1 2005 2006 Appropriation Bill No 5 2004 2005 Appropriation Bill No 6 2004 2005
235,Mr Anthony Smith,"I will happily place on the record that the member for Shortyears but never delivered. The last five years of the Labor government were the horror years for Australia in terms of fiscal mismanagement. In the entire period from 1900 until 1990 Australia had run up a debt of $16 billion. In the five years from 1990 debt rose from $16 billion to $96 billion. When you look at the figures and the budget outcomes you can see how that happened. We are talking about consecutive budget deficits of $11.5 billion, $17 billion, $17 billion again and $13 billion. In the final year of the Keating government the Leader of the Opposition, who was then finance minister, said this on 1 February 1996 in the middle of the election campaign, as quoted in the Age: We’re operating in surplus, and our projections are for surpluses in the future. What was the budget outcome? It was not a surplus but another deficit of $10 billion. That quote and that outcome will rightly haunt him as long as he is in politics, because it demonstrates one of two things: either in the election campaign he had no idea what the budget was doing and what the outcome was, how the so-called projected surplus had slipped into deficit-that is, he was ignorant-or, as the member for Cook knows, he knew all along. I will let him make the choice of which one it was. It was either ignorance or dishonesty. In that five years government debt went from $16 billion to $96 billion. This budget will take government debt down to $6 billion. Nine years of reform, difficult decisions on the budget and fiscal responsibility have seen that Labor-Beazley legacy of debt finally paid down to $6 billion. It has been a $90 billion improvement. What does that mean, tangibly, for the budget and for Australians? I can tell you: it means a great deal. The cost of servicing the interest on that debt was monumental. Every year, an interest bill came for the Commonwealth to service that debt. I want to take the time to go through those annual bills one by one. In 1995-96, when government debt was $96 billion, it cost $7.8 billion. I will go through the forward years from 1995-96: $8.4 billion; $7.3 billion-it starts to come down as the Howard government begins paying off debt-$6.9 billion; then $6 billion, as it comes down. Today the cost of servicing the much smaller debt is $2 billion. The difference between 1995-96 and today is a saving of $5 billion. That is $5 billion every year that now does not have to be spent on servicing the debt that was run up by former Prime Minister Keating and the current leader of the Labor Party, Mr Beazley; that is $5 billion more that can be spent on services like education and health-on the sorts of things the member for Shortland was talking about. That has made a tangible difference. As I said at the outset, this is a budget which has provided a surplus, is a down payment on Australia’s future and has managed to fund the important national priorities. The member for Shortland spoke about skills but neglected to mention that this budget funds 24 new Australian technical colleges. It funds important areas right across Australia. As I said, it funds reform such as welfare to work-important reforms that have to happen. Those opposite know that these reforms have to occur. The former leader, the now departed member for Werriwa, knew that was the case. In every utterance he could make before he became leader of the Labor Party he spoke about the problem Australia has with the number of people on disability pensions. But, of course, once he became leader of the Labor Party-as always seems to happen; whether they pass through some force field, I am not sure; the member for Cook might know-he became quite opportunistic. After writing more articles and speaking more from his backbench position than any other member of parliament, the memMAIN COMMITTEE ber for Werriwa, when he became Leader of the Opposition, conveniently and opportunistically took the opposite position. This budget funds $21 billion worth of tax cuts-important tax cuts for all Australians to reward effort, to restore incentive, to basically give the economy that boost into the forward years that has to happen. I have mentioned skills and training and the technical colleges. Compared to 1996, the government is spending roughly double the amount on health-on pharmaceutical and Medicare benefits, new drugs being listed, important announcements in the budget on cancer and improved cancer care, important announcements on a national awareness for skin cancer, an important youth campaign discouraging smoking, funding for dementia, additional funding for carers and, importantly, the establishment of a future fund that will operate at arm’s length. They are all the sorts of issues that the member for Shortland and previous speakers opposite have conveniently ignored. I would like to mention how these benefits do not just accrue nationally but also fund in a tangible sense important things in the Casey electorate. The Roads to Recovery program was created by the Howard government. It funds roads through funding local councils directly. That program has been very successful and has made a tangible difference in the electorate of Casey, which straddles the outer suburban and rural areas of the outer east in Melbourne, the Yarra Valley and the Dandenong Ranges. We have seen $8.3 million for local roads in the region over recent years. This budget continues that Roads to Recovery program. It has been extended for another four years until 2008-09, and it is going to provide additional funding of vital need in Maroona and the shire of Yarra Ranges. The black spots program, again commenced by this government, recently has provided funding for two important projects in Croydon and in Lilydale, where traffic lights are being updated. That program has operated right across Australia. I am sure those opposite, in moments of candour and fairness, would say it has been a very good program. Aged care is a big long-term cost to the budget that the government is funding. We have seen an increase in high-care places, low-care places and specific places relating to dementia. We have seen that roll-out of the additional resources that we need. I mention all of these because these sorts of things were not easily possible in the Labor years. The choice to fund them meant a bigger deficit. That is where the run-down in aged care services, roads and some of the other important areas began to occur. I would like to take the time on some of the specific issues in the budget that also deserve a mention. The budget provides a surplus to fund these important areas. When you look at the financial changes that have occurred in the last five or six years, it is hard to imagine how they could have been funded in the Labor years, when we had those five consecutive deficits that I mentioned-an $11 billion deficit, two deficits of $17 billion, a $13 billion deficit and a $10 billion deficit. How would the budget of the years 1990 to 1995 have coped with the Asian financial crisis, the billion-dollar fund for the tsunami, the war on terror and the funding that has been needed for defence that was not foreseen before September 11? Between 1990 and 1995 that would have meant those deficit figures that I just read to the House would have increased. But we have been able to fund those things, meet those big challenges that are unforeseen but always around the corner, maintain increased spending in areas of priority and maintain a budget surplus that is the best guarantor of future prosperity and future funding of all these issues. MAIN COMMITTEE I would like to mention in the remaining minutes some important local issues that I did not mention before. Nationally, as I said, we have doubled funding for health. In Casey the national policies that have been introduced by the Minister for Health and Ageing, Mr Abbott, are having a good impact. They are very much welcomed by the electorate. On top of those there are some specific areas of funding that go directly to the Casey electorate, particularly the funding of a new after-hours GP clinic. Where the service will be based is still being determined, but it will be of major benefit to the Casey electorate and to the surrounding electorate of McEwen. Another service that is to be based in Boronia will service parts of the Casey electorate as well. On top of that there has been new Medicare funding for MRI equipment at Box Hill Hospital, which will benefit the entire eastern suburbs of Melbourne. We have had some important funding recently for the Small Business Enterprise Culture Program, which is helping small businesses and traders in Mount Evelyn, a town right in the heart of the Casey electorate that is really moving forward and moving ahead. There has been a massive increase in capital funding to both government and private schools over the last couple of years. The out of school hours child-care program, invented by this government, has proved to be very popular and a great success. It is something of increased importance to people in electorates like Casey where, more often than not, both parents are working and often travelling long distances. It is about a 40-kilometre trip into town. So that program is very popular and the extension of it is going to be very welcome indeed. There has been a massive increase in the number of apprentices in training. As I mentioned, there will be 24 technical colleges across Australia. It has already been determined that one of those will be in the outer east area in the electorates of Deakin, Casey, Aston and La Trobe. That will be of major benefit to my electorate, where trades are so important. Since 1996 there has been a massive improvement in the national unemployment figures. When the Howard government was elected in March 1996 the unemployment rate was 8.2 per cent; it is now 5.1 per cent, the lowest it has been in 28 years. In the Casey electorate, that rate has fallen, as you would expect. Casey’s unemployment rate is actually lower than the national average, which shows that the area really is moving ahead and that there is a demand for jobs. In 2004 the unemployment rate in Casey was 4.1 per cent, compared with the national average, which is a bit higher. This is a budget that provides opportunities to families and small businesses right across Australia. It is of great benefit to the Casey electorate. Importantly, it lays the foundations for future continued growth. The last five budgets handed down by those opposite were in deficit, which created a fiscal nightmare and a debt nightmare. Unfortunately, their approach in opposition has been to get in the way, to be a collective roadblock. We are seeing that at the moment with the tax bills. The opposition are now in a situation where they have to make a decision on whether they will move to disallow the tax schedules. The small businesses of my electorate and the small businesses of Australia wait for the Labor Party to make a decision. If they decide to disallow those schedules, they will not stop tax cuts, they will merely delay them. If they decide not to disallow them, it will mean absolutely that the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer have gone full circle and they will have egg all over their faces. We wait to see them make a decision. They decided a week ago not to make a decision. The small businesses of my electorate and the small businesses of Melbourne and Australia wait for the Labor Party to make a decision. MAIN COMMITTEE The superannuation surcharge, which will be abolished in this budget, is another example that I will mention in winding up as an illustration of the confusion and hypocrisy of those opposite. That surcharge was a measure that we introduced to help pay off the deficits of Labor. When we introduced it, the Labor Party opposed us. Now we are abolishing it and they are going to oppose us. It is another illustration of their utter confusion and their economic muddle-headedness. 2005-2006 and cognate legislation is really one about equity. Great changes are taking place in the Australian political landscape, in the social landscape and in the economic landscape, but from the point of view of those of us on this side of the House ultimately the debate in this parliament over the past week or so on the budget has been a debate about equity. Whilst the government has finally delivered some tax relief to lowand middle-income earners-it left these people out last time-our contention is simple: the latest round of tax cuts is too focused on high-income earners. As a matter of record, the latest census information shows the average wage and income for Kingsford Smith residents-the electorate that I represent-is $39,826. So it easily falls into the $6 a week tax cut that the Treasurer has announced. When you compare that tax cut of the average worker in Kingsford Smith to someone earning, say, $130,000, the difference is large. A Kingsford Smith resident will most likely get $6 a week while someone on $130,000 will get $65 a week. That is why this debate is about equity and fairness. Labor members have consistently pointed out the implications of the budget. For an ordinary family on a combined income of about $90,000 a year most if not all of this tax cut has already been written off by the latest interest rate rise. On a $300,000 mortgage, which is about the norm in Kingsford Smith, an average family has had to fork out an extra $48 per month, so the tax cut goes. But on top of that, families are experiencing pressure from increases in the cost of living, such as the rise in petrol prices, increased costs for child care and of course the government’s broken promise over the so-called Medicare safety net. So the proposition that we put goes to the core of who benefits most from the tax cuts announced by the Treasurer, and the simple answer is that it is not the majority of Australian taxpayers. The budget is also under our scrutiny not because of the past record of the government but because of the likely future consequences of the surplus of the budget, the sequestering of money into the future fund and the likelihood of inflationary pressures embedded in that budget-inflationary pressures which, if you only get $6 a week, will impact heavily upon some seven million Aussies. Scant regard has been paid to the terms of Australia’s trade. It is very clear from media reports and reports from various departments and research organisations that we have a serious problem with our terms of trade. Our export growth is not good. There is something seriously amiss when we have ‘achieved’ 39 consecutive months of trade deficits, when net exports do not really contribute significantly to economic growth and when our current account deficitnow 7.1 per cent or so of GDP-continues to rise. Today we had figures coming out that our foreign debt bill is about $423 billion to $424 billion. There is no question that commentators, economists, those in the parliament and others of interest recognise that large current account deficits and foreign debt levels inevitably put upward pressure on interest rates, particularly in the event that economic turbulence arises down the track. The OECD recently noted: MAIN COMMITTEE",191,Appropriation Bill No 2 2005 2006 Appropriation Parliamentary Departments Bill No 1 2005 2006 Appropriation Bill No 5 2004 2005 Appropriation Bill No 6 2004 2005
236,Mr Garrett (Kingsford Smith) (8.09 Pm),"This debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 1)Australia has had a history of relatively balanced government finances but a persistent current account deficit, resulting in higher real rates. This links to skills, to the question and the issue of building an innovative export sector. But it also leads to the question of the long-term stability of the Australian economy. The current account deficit is of real concern and is something that was not addressed in this budget. Interestingly enough, when the Treasurer spoke about bringing down the budget, he spoke about sustainability, and I will come back to that later as I speak. But there are structural issues at play which the budget does not address. In respect of the current account deficit, CS First Boston estimated that our current account deficit would be more than 10 per cent of GDP if we had not had the current commodities boom. A figure of 10 per cent of GDP is a truly preposterous and clearly unsustainable figure. On the issues of welfare, the government’s welfare to work initiatives are really churn and burn policy failure. Changes to the disability support pension will mean that new entrants will be about $77 a fortnight worse off. When the budget seeks to address issues of welfare, namely by moving people from so-called welfare to work, what it really does is move people on a disability pension to a payment, Newstart, which has a high withdrawal rate. Changes in the way people are assessed do not take into account illnesses, such as mental illnesses, that many of these people have where symptoms can change over time. The government’s changes to single-parenting payments are, we believe, unfair and unworkable. By making single parents look for part-time work when their youngest child turns six, the government seems to be punishing sole parents. There does not appear to be much proper assistance to enable them to move from welfare to work. How many workplaces will be willing to provide flexibility so parents can get their children off to school in the morning and then pick them up in the afternoon? What about when kids are unwell and cannot go to school? The problems multiply. Then there is the question of employing people with disabilities, Madam Deputy Speaker. Even the Australian government has not managed to employ large numbers of people with disabilities-the rates in the figures available to us show that since 1996 the percentage of Australian Public Service employees with a disability has fallen from 5.6 per cent to 3.8 per cent. If the government will not employ people with a disability then how can they expect other employers to do so? A person with a disability who does not earn any private income currently receives around $482 a fortnight, but after 1 July 2006 on the new Newstart allowance this same person’s income falls to about $399 a fortnight. A single person on the current disability support pension who earns $500 of private income a fortnight receives $830.90 at present. From1 July this same person’s total income will fall to $655.30. That is a significant decrease in the income available to these Australians who are amongst the most disadvantaged in our community. I want to refer in this speech to the St Vincent de Paul Society report which was released on Monday. It makes for interesting reading and it backs up some of the comments that have been made on this side of the House that the government in this budget is really allowing inequality to increase. The report, named The reality of income inequality in Australia, says: Contrary to recent assertions by the Government and certain researchers, income inequality in Australia is growing. MAIN COMMITTEE What that report shows is that real mean incomes for low-income earners grew at 12 per cent between 1994-95 and 2002-03. For high-income earners real mean weekly income rose by 16 per cent. What this shows is that the government really has said to us that poor people are going to be better offA division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 8.18 pm to 8.33 pm inequality amongst Australians is shown in a report from the St Vincent de Paul Society called The reality of income inequality in Australia, which was released on Monday this week. It says: Contrary to recent assertions by the Government and certain researchers, income inequality in Australia is growing. The statistics that this report refers to show that real mean income-that is, average incomefor low-income earners grew by 12 per cent between 1994-95 and 2002-03 but that, for highincome earners, real mean weekly income rose by some 16 per cent. Clearly there is a discrepancy. The statistics do not look too bad until you follow them through, when you see that the increases equate to an actual increase of $32.28 for low-income earners and $156 for highincome earners. There is a vast difference, and the issues of inequity that lie behind our opposition to the budget can be seen clearly in these figures. I note that the report is also critical of the government’s budget. It says: ... there is no doubt that income inequality will grow even further once the tax cuts and welfare reforms are implemented. The debate about infrastructure, the predominance of those discussions within the House and the lack of real attention in the budget to infrastructure issues are one of the key features I want to address tonight. We can make the claim that the government is dropping the ball with regard to funding for infrastructure in Australia. The Deputy Prime Minister made a lunchtime announcement recently that the federal government would be taking over the ports of Australia. As the member for the electorate of Kingsford Smith, which houses one of the most important ports, Port Botany, I can inform the House that this was news to the port authorities, the local councils and the state government. Nevertheless, I think the real issue with the budget is that, because of the surplus that has been generated from the tax that has been taken, particularly through the minerals boom, Australia has never had a better opportunity to ensure that we set a platform for long-term sustainable growth. But when we look at the budget we cannot see any substantial initiatives about what that platform might be. We have a future fund, which I will refer to later, but otherwise there are no substantial initiatives to deal with what has been called a bottlenecked infrastructure crisis. There is no real sense that this is being considered by Treasury or by the Treasurer. When we look at the sketchy details that have been given to us about the future fund, we see that the premise of the future fund is a false one-that is, to pay ongoing superannuation obligations. The Productivity Commission, the government’s own Intergenerational report and long-term cost reports show that the public sector superannuation liability will be declining as a share of GDP over the next 40 years; and it is clear that, even with surplus budgeting MAIN COMMITTEE",195,Appropriation Bill No 2 2005 2006 Appropriation Parliamentary Departments Bill No 1 2005 2006 Appropriation Bill No 5 2004 2005 Appropriation Bill No 6 2004 2005
237,Mr Garrett,"As I was saying before the division, the real effect in terms of incomesuch as the Treasurer has projected, those liabilities will be met. So there is a question about what will happen to the future fund, to what ends it will be put and who will benefit from participating in it. I notice with interest an article by Alan Kohler in the Financial Review of 11 May where he says: ... the Future Fund (that is, gaining the effect of compound interest by locking up the money in the RBA bank account, investing it a bit better and reinvesting the income) could produce decades of Liberal Party hegemony. He is saying that it could greatly assist the Liberal Party over the coming decades. Whether this is true or not, we do not know. What we do know is that we have not got a sufficient amount of information in the parliament to enable us to have confidence that the future fund, as proposed by the Treasurer, is an appropriate use of those future surpluses. Australia is gripped by drought. The country is literally drying up as we watch. Farming communities are experiencing great stress, and there is an intolerable burden upon them, particularly those in marginal areas, as they seek to maintain the productivity of their land without any rainfall. I said in my first speech in the House that climate change is the most pressing issue that this country and the global community face, and I restate that tonight. We are in the warmest autumn, I think, on record. Three of the last 10 years were the driest years that this country has faced. If ever there was a challenge that Australia really had to come to grips with, it is the challenge not only of climate change but also of the impact that drought will have upon our farming communities and ultimately upon farm exports. There was not much provision in this budget for drought relief-although I do note, and welcome, that that has in part been addressed subsequently. More importantly, no consideration was given in the budget to long-term issues of sustainability-the sustainability of our use of landscape, which ultimately is the sustainability of our economy. Nowhere do we see something that is quite common in company reports-that is, triple bottom line reporting. We do not have any reporting in the nation’s accounts that gives us an indication as to the impact or cost that the national economy has upon those things which are not costed-namely, the natural capital of this country: the air, the water and the soil. As members would know, triple bottom line reporting, or sustainability reporting, is an attempt in the nation’s sets of accounts to put a value on environmental and social externalities and, by so doing, to provide a more accurate representation of the country’s overall health. Wealth becomes health. A number of institutions, eminent academics and governments have argued for some time for the need to increase the level of environmental and social reporting-and, in fact, some parts of Europe have begun the process. Speaking as someone who has recently come into the parliament, who has a passionate concern about the environment and about the long-term sustainability prospects for this country, I am astonished that it is not addressed in the national budget. After all, we rely on that environment for our economic as well as our social and environmental well-being. The European Union, the Australian Collaboration, Environment Business Australianumerous authorities and academic institutions have proposed something akin to triple bottom line reporting. There are a number of good reasons to do it, not least of which is that many people consider that the environment is as important as the economy in determining their quality of life. There are various opinion polls around, but I refer to a European Union study MAIN COMMITTEE which shows that about 88 per cent believe that environmental concerns should be taken into account when economic or employment policy is developed. It is true that environmental awareness and concern in terms of poll figures here in Australia may have plateaued in the late eighties and early nineties, although, as with all polling, it certainly depends on the question that is asked. For instance, the Lowy Institute recently reported a large-scale poll on Australia’s international obligations. It asked people what they rated as the most important issues that Australia should take into account for foreign policy. Equal numbers of people believed that the environment-as well as job, employment and security issues-ought to be dominant. In the absence of strong environmental leadership, though, there is no doubt that the public concern may wax and wane somewhat. But underlying these remarks is the fact that environmental well-being is absolutely critical to our economic as well as our social health. The closest thing that we have to an integrated report to consider the environment in Australia is the Australian Bureau of Statistics project called MAP-Measures of Australia’s Progress. It contains economic, social and environmental indicators, but the project only provides us with summary information, and it is only intended to be used in conjunction with other reports like the budget; whereas really it should be embedded in the budget. BeforeI came into the parliament, I was involved with something called the Australian Collaboration, which was a collection of churches, the Federation of Ethnic Communities Councils of Australia, aid organisations, a conservation organisation and others. Amongst their deliberations and recommendations was an identification of the need to establish a comprehensive, regular and independent reporting procedure for trends in human well-being. I think people are calling out for this. It is important for us as parliamentarians to understand the economic jargon that is associated with bringing down a budget as best we can and it is important to communicate to the public about it-but so are issues which go to people’s well-being, and the environment is certainly one of them. I note that the Australian Collaboration recommended a number of initiatives which would help to bring into place independent reporting procedures for trends in human well-being. They include regular, comprehensive and independent national reporting of social, environmental and economic trends. At present, where that reporting exists, it is in disparate places and is not drawn together in one easily accessible or comprehensible strain. The recommended initiatives include annual preparation of a new set of composite indicators that provide continuous measurements so we know how we are going. Nowhere could this be more important than with climate change or evaporation rates, for example, in our dams and rivers at present. The Australian Collaboration also recommended the introduction of comparable reporting regimes in all states so that we can form a national snapshot of the environmental state at a given point in time. And, of course, it recommended that government agencies assist this by publishing triple bottom line reporting and that public corporations, universities and community organisations also publish triple bottom line reporting-and already a number of them do that. Progressive corporations understand that there are environmental and social responsibilities, and it would be very important to see those in this budget. (Time expired) pm)-Today, in this debate on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2005-2006 and cognate bills for the following financial year, I want to comment on three areas that the Minister for Health and MAIN COMMITTEE",197,Appropriation Bill No 2 2005 2006 Appropriation Parliamentary Departments Bill No 1 2005 2006 Appropriation Bill No 5 2004 2005 Appropriation Bill No 6 2004 2005
238,Mr Pyne (Sturt,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Ageing) (8.44Ageing has been kind enough to give me since the election that have caused a bit of concern since the budget was handed down. In three areas some misinformation has been raised in the community and in the media, particularly by the shadow minister for health. They include community concern over the Codex, community concern over the country of origin labelling issue and the concern raised by the shadow minister for health over spending on mental health. In the appropriations debate tonight, I would like to put to put to rest the three concerns that have been raised. Mental health is a shared responsibility between federal, state and territory governments, business and consumer groups alike, consumers and carers. Mental illness is not discriminatory; it affects everyone either directly or indirectly. With one in five Australians suffering from a mental health disorder in any one year and three-quarters of all mental health problems beginning before the age of 25, it becomes every Australian’s concern. To help combat these alarming statistics, the Australian government has done a great deal over recent years. Between 1995-96 and 2001-02, the Australian government’s own expenditure on mental health care increased by 47 per cent in real terms, from $770 million to $1.145 billion. This included funding for the medical benefits schedule to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and funding provided under the National Mental Health Strategy to facilitate further mental health reform for the first and second national mental health plans. Through the Australian health care agreements of 2003-08 the Australian government is providing funding of up to $331 million to all states and territories to facilitate further mental health reform under the National Mental Health Strategy. A further $66 million in Commonwealth ownpurpose outlays funding has been allocated for national reform activities. The federal Labor Party have not been able to get their minds around the complexities and diversity of administering mental health in Australia. The recent scare campaign run by the opposition health spokeswoman, the member for Lalor, about mental health funding and the better outcomes for the mental health program showed us what a shallow wading pool the Labor frontbench has emerged from in recent years. Madam Acting Deputy Speaker Bishop, it certainly is not the frontbench that was in office when I first came into parliament in 1993, when you had already been here for some time. These days, Labor are more concerned with scoring cheap political points than considering for a second the real concerns their scare campaign might have caused amongst mental health groups and those suffering from mental illnesses. In fact, it is an indictment on the Labor Party. It is interesting that the member for Lalor, who came to parliament only in recent years, could be their spokeswoman for health, a very important area of government policy, and also the Manager of Opposition Business in the House. I am sure it frightens many long-term Labor supporters, members of parliament and former cabinet ministers to see the Labor Party sunk to the depths that they have unfortunately sunk to in recent years, although on this side of the House we welcome the position of the Labor Party. It makes it much easier for us, but it is sad for public policy when people of such limited public experience can be as important in the opposition as the member for Lalor is these days. Federal Labor remain an empty vessel when it comes to mental health. They are without ideas and without policies or even a vague intention of announcing any and have recognised that mental health is an excellent whipping boy for cheap political stunts and scaremongering. MAIN COMMITTEE On the other hand, the coalition government continue to champion the cause of mental health in Australia. We named and shamed the state governments who have neglected their state mental health systems for so long, and now we see mental health becoming targeted spending areas in state government budgets. The coalition have put mental health back on the agenda and made it a priority for state government spending. It will horrify members of the House to know that, after deinstitutionalisation in the late eighties and early nineties at the state level, for every $6 the states had spent on institutionalisation in mental health, $5 was returned to state government coffers and $1 was spent on community support for the mentally ill. From that decision of the states back in the late eighties and nineties and from their failure to support the mentally ill in the community have come many of the woes that the mentally ill are experiencing in Australia today and that we trying to ameliorate at the federal government level. Remember that, in fact, the federal government has no constitutional jurisdiction in the area of mental health, and yet one-third of every dollar spent on mental health in Australia comes from the Commonwealth. The Australian government’s Better Outcomes in Mental Health Care program has assisted GPs with education and training to help them deliver care to patients with mental health problems. We are reaffirming the Australian government’s commitment to the prevention of, and early intervention in, mental illness in the community and we have committed $228.5 million over four years to 2008-09 for the best practice management of patients with mental health. The $228.5 million is available to continue to fund the better outcomes in mental health initiative, with $102 million committed in the budget and $40.5 million for the expansion of the initiative announced as part of the government’s mental health election commitment. This additional funding will increase access to allied health professionals and allow greater focus on rural and remote primary mental health care through better outcomes in mental health. In addition, there is $86 million for a new Medicare chronic disease item including patients with mental health problems. The highly successful national initiative on depression beyondblue also continues to raise the awareness of depression at the same time as breaking down the stigma of this insidious illness. I think it is no secret to members of the House that having Jeff Kennett, the former Premier of Victoria, as chairman of beyondblue has dramatically raised the profile of mental illness in Australia. He often says to me that, yes, he has raised the national consciousness about mental health but, in lifting up that rock and exposing the slaters, centipedes and snails that exist underneath, he has highlighted the problem and now governments have to try and fix it. That is what we have been trying to do. To that end the Australian government has provided a further $40 million over five years to expand the work of beyondblue. You would remember, Madam Deputy Speaker Bishop, that beyondblue began as a Kennett government initiative. Sadly, Mr Kennett lost the election, but Mr Bracks picked up the idea as the Premier of Victoria and, to his credit, put money into beyondblue. Every state followed suit except New South Wales-the state from which the Deputy Speaker comes. They started their own group called Black Dog. It is unusual that New South Wales needs to have their own group; I do not know why. But they have their own organisation. These days beyondblue is largely funded by the Commonwealth government, with the states’ support, and we are very pleased to fund it. The funding supports early intervenMAIN COMMITTEE tion, encourages research and improves information about depression. The funding will also assist beyondblue to establish a national postnatal depression screening and follow-up program for new mothers. Mr Cameron Thompson-Hear, hear! in fact, beyondblue did an excellent research program into postnatal depression as one of its key signatures in the last couple of years. Now, with our support, that is being expanded into a service delivery program so that the research does not just sit there-so that it does not just get talked about at conferences and forums and evaluated et cetera but actually becomes a real program for new mothers about postnatal depression. We are also helping beyondblue to target workplace depression by continuing to provide a voice on care and treatment matters. The organisation beyondblue works with many different partners across Australia, including the Alzheimer’s Association, the Australian Football League, the Australian Rotary Health Research Fund, the Centre for Adolescent Health, Jeans West, Inspire Foundation and Lifeline. When left untreated, mental health problems like depression and anxiety lead to serious alcohol and substance abuse problems. Half of all young people with alcohol and substance abuse problems can directly attribute them to untreated or poorly treated mental health issues. Three-quarters of all mental health problems begin before the age of 25. Young people with mental health problems will benefit from the Australian government’s $60.9 million election commitment to boost funding over the five years from 2004-05. The initiative will support the health care system in the detection, early intervention and management of young people with mental health problems, including those with complex mental health needs related to substance abuse. The initiative will also improve access for young people to appropriate services and ensure better links and coordination between services for young people in their local areas. The youth mental health initiative is something that the Minister for Health and Ageing and I are working on right now, with a view to making announcements later this year about exactly how that money will be spent and on what it will be spent. Mental health and suicide prevention are obviously linked. While the government continue to invest and develop policies targeting help for those with depression and other mental health problems, we are also investing in suicide prevention measures. Under the National Suicide Prevention Strategy the Australian government has committed approximately $10 million since 1999 for addressing suicide prevention in a range of population groups across their lifespan, including young people and other groups identified as being at risk. The two largest spikes for suicide across the lifespan are the youngest people and the oldest people. Before 1999 the government’s program was to in fact target young people alone. I am glad to say that since 1999 we have expanded the policy across all age groups. I was in New Zealand recently meeting with the minister who is responsible for suicide prevention in New Zealand. This year, in 2005, they have just adopted our strategy of dealing with a whole lifespan rather than just young people. So it is good to see the government program being exported across the Tasman, where they do not need to recreate the wheel but can pick up some of the work that we have been doing.

239,Mr Pyne,"The honourable member for Blair says hear, hear and well he might because,Implementation of the National Suicide Prevention Strategy is guided by LIFE, a framework for prevention of suicide and self-harm in Australia which provides a strategic framework for national action to alleviate suicide and promote mental health and resilience across the Australian population. Over 170 community based initiatives totalling over $22 million are being funded across states and territories according to locally identified priorities. The Australian government is currently considering recommendations put forward by the National Advisory Council for Suicide Prevention for funding under the National Suicide Prevention Strategy until June 2006. All the above activities represent a long-term investment in the social and emotional well-being of Australian communities, but they also have the potential to achieve cost savings for the community. We have lots of friends that work with us tirelessly on the mental health crusade, and we would not be able to make any headway without them. We thank our friends at beyondblue, SANE and Lifeline; all the members of the Mental Health Council of Australia, the Australian Divisions of General Practice and the Psychological Society; and all the GPs and allied health services. In the academic world, the college of psychiatrists and general practice keep the training going. There are many others who relentlessly work to support those suffering with a mental illness, particularly their families and friends. We acknowledge their strong commitment and the extraordinary effort that they make to help their loved ones have as normal a life as possible and, quite frankly, to save the government and the Australian taxpayer vast amounts of money through the unpaid care which they provide to their children and to their friends. There are two other issues in my area of responsibility that do not touch on mental health but that I would like to touch on tonight. One is Codex and one is the country of origin labelling issues, both of which have come up with some drama in the last couple of weeks. On the matter of Codex, in Australia vitamin and mineral supplements are regulated as complementary medicines under the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989-as you would know, Madam Acting Deputy Speaker Bishop, having had some experience in the area of complementary medicines over your political lifetime. They are required to meet the same standards of quality and safety as other types of complementary medicines, and the TGA is responsible for the regulation of these medicines in Australia. In some other countries these products are regulated as foods and are subject to the standards and guidelines that apply to food. The Codex Alimentarius Commission was established in 1963 by two United Nations organisations: the Food and Agriculture Organisation and the World Health Organisation. Its main purpose is to protect consumer health and to ensure fair practices in international food trade through the development of food standards and guidelines. Codex standards and guidelines are developed by committees of the commission, which are open to all member countries, including Australia. The Codex Committee on Nutrition and Foods for Special Dietary Uses has developed draft guidelines on vitamin and mineral food supplements. The draft Codex guidelines on vitamin and mineral food supplements specifically state that they apply in countries where vitamin and mineral supplements are regulated as foods. As these products are regulated as medicines in Australia they will not be affected by the proposed Codex guidelines. The TGA is aware that many consumers have expressed concerns that the draft guidelines on vitamin and mineral food supplements, as developed by the Codex Alimentarius Commission, will MAIN COMMITTEE have an effect on the regulation of vitamin and mineral supplements in Australia. The proposed Codex guidelines on vitamin and mineral supplements will not apply in Australia and will have no impact on the way these types of products are regulated in Australia. I can assure all those people who are genuinely concerned about the role of the Codex Alimentarius Commission in the regulation of our vitamin and mineral supplements that the Codex guidelines will not apply in this country for the very simple reason that we do not regulate vitamin or mineral supplements as foods; we regulate them as medicines. As a consequence, the Codex guidelines-for all, I am sure, their great benefits-will have no impact at all on the way our vitamin and mineral supplements are regulated in Australia. So all those people who keep emailing me, particularly from Queensland-may I say to the honourable member seated here-do not need to continue to do so because I can assure them that they have nothing to be concerned about. There has been a similar level of public interest in the country of origin labelling issue. Food Standards Australia New Zealand works to protect the health and safety of people in Australia and New Zealand by maintaining a safe food supply. It is a bi-national, independent statutory authority that develops food standards for composition, labelling and contaminants-including microbiological limits-that apply to all foods produced or imported for sale in Australia and New Zealand. FSANZ has recently sought public comment on the Draft assessment report: proposal P292-country of origin labelling of food. FSANZ was seeking to amend the current requirements for the country of origin labelling of food to bring the labelling requirements for unpackaged foods into line with the general labelling provisions of the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code and to address the inconsistencies between the current transitional standard of the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code and Australia’s World Trade Organisation obligations. proposed that, where foods are sold unpackaged, the standard require that displayed with the food, or provided or made available to the purchaser on request, is a statement identifying the country of origin of the food or a statement indicating that the food is imported. Obviously Australian consumer and industry groups were concerned that giving retailers the option to make the country of origin information available only upon the request of the purchaser might create a less transparent system, making it more difficult to be sure you are purchasing good Australian produce. Currently the code requires that there be identification of the country of origin on imported unpackaged food or an indication that the food is imported. The coalition government have already indicated that we will not support any dilution of the current code and that we wish to ensure the clear display of the country of origin on unpackaged food at the point of sale. We continue to support the mandatory labelling of imported produce because we believe consumers have the right to know when they are buying imported produce. Public consultation is part of the FSANZ process. It is required to go through public consultation when it is reviewing standards. I wish to assure all members and their constituents that there is no enthusiasm at all in the federal government for us to remove the requirement for consumers to be able to know clearly at point of sale if they are buying an imported product or a domestic product. For all of the Australian producers of fruit, vegetables and other unpackaged foods, we believe it would be a radical and unhelpful departure for consumers to have to request informaMAIN COMMITTEE tion from the retailer as to whether the product they are buying is imported or domestic. We believe it is important that, when a consumer purchases products, they can look directly at the point of sale and note whether they are buying an imported or a domestic product. I want everyone in the House and all of those people who have emailed me about this on a regular basis to know that, again, as with Codex, the government do not intend to depart from our previous policy. (Time expired) colleague the member for Hinkler in the chamber tonight. The Treasurer’s 10th budget represents yet another budget of lost opportunity, especially for central Victorian motorists who use the Calder Highway between Melbourne and Bendigo. The government continues to walk away from its commitments to this project and blame the state government for delays in completing the construction when the real cause of these delays is the federal government’s failure to adequately fund its 50 per cent share of the construction. The Calder deception has involved the federal government constantly shifting the goalposts. The Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads confirmed this last Thursday when he told a deputation from Bendigo that the state government should finance the rest of the construction and the federal government might-and I emphasise the word ‘might’provide its 50 per cent share at some stage over the next 10 years or more. Can you imagine a building construction company accepting a contract from the Commonwealth government to build a building in the hope that it might get paid some time over the next 10 years? I am sure you cannot. I do not know any company or business that would be silly enough to accept this proposition and the Victorian state government is no exception, especially with this government’s sorry record of honouring its commitments. An article prepared by the Bendigo Advertiser and published on 25 May 2005 said that the Bendigo electorate was amongst the poorest in Australia, with an estimated 15,500 people living below the poverty line. Bendigo city has unemployment levels varying between nine per cent and 12 per cent. A La Trobe University study showed an economic benefit of close to $500 million and potentially an additional 2,700 jobs for the region when the Calder project is completed. The highway in its current form is experiencing vast increases in traffic volumes and is becoming increasingly dangerous, with many accidents occurring in non-duplicated sections. The Liberal Party have promised to match the state government’s funding for this project for the past two federal election campaigns, but the federal government is currently $82 million short of its full commitment. The state government has now allocated its full 50 per cent share towards the completion of this project. It was the Howard government that first granted the Calder Highway its road of national importance status in 1996, qualifying the highway for joint Commonwealth-state funding. Now, because it suits the government’s political agenda, the Calder Highway is no longer a road of national importance. However, the Scoresby and Pakenham road projects retain their RONI status. Why? Because it suits the Howard government’s current political strategy. The Howard-Costello government have always played political poker with Victorian road funding, declaring and then abolishing Victorian roads of national importance-or RONIs-to suit their political agenda of the day. Mr Costello deals all of the cards in the game of political poker, and he has allocated another $120 million for the Scoresby project in this budget when he knows that it will never be needed. The state government has made other funding arrangeMAIN COMMITTEE",202,Appropriation Bill No 2 2005 2006 Appropriation Parliamentary Departments Bill No 1 2005 2006 Appropriation Bill No 5 2004 2005 Appropriation Bill No 6 2004 2005
240,Mr Gibbons (Bendigo) (9.04 Pm),"I am glad to see my good friend and parliamentaryments for Scoresby and no Commonwealth funding is required. The Treasurer has not the slightest hesitation in using people’s lives as pawns to advance his personal self-interest. Mr Costello has several federal Liberal MPs whose seats surround the Scoresby corridor to protect, especially when he needs every Victorian MP’s vote he can secure for a future tilt at the prime ministership. Playing political poker is one thing, but using people’s lives as the stakes is just beyond comprehension. And this man, this Treasurer who has no hesitation in using people’s lives as pawns to get what he wants, aspires to be Prime Minister of Australia. The Howard-Costello government’s announcement of an increase in the threshold for claiming the Medicare safety net completes a series of broken promises since the 2004 federal election. The average central Victorian family budget has received yet another substantial hit since the October federal election because of the government’s backflip over its absolutely rock solid, ironclad commitment to keep the Medicare safety net in its original form. The backflip is bad enough but, in what can only be described as criminal, the government also spent a massive $20 million of taxpayers’ money in a media blitz in the run-up to the federal election telling us how the Medicare safety net policy was carefully crafted and fully costed. This latest example of this dishonest government’s willingness to say and do anything to get through an election campaign completes a sorry picture of deceit and broken promises since the October election. First we had the election promise to keep interest rates low. The Reserve Bank then lifted interest rates by 0.25 per cent, cementing Australia’s place as having one of the highest interest rate regimes in the Western world. At the same time they approved massive increases in health insurance premiums of between eight per cent and 19 per cent, after promising that their policy of the 30 per cent Medicare rebate would drive down health insurance costs. Then we had the pre-election commitment not to send more troops to Iraq, yet there are now an additional 450 soldiers on duty in southern Iraq. And now we have the increases in the Medicare safety net threshold, after what the Prime Minister and the Minister for Health and Ageing said during the election campaign with regard to keeping the Medicare safety net in its original form. At a Sydney press conference on 8 October 2004, the Prime Minister said, ‘Well, I commit to keeping it in place.’ Mr Abbott, in an interview on 6 September 2004, said, ‘That is an absolutely rock solid, ironclad commitment.’ This arrogant government is clearly showing nothing but contempt for the Australian political process and the Australian people. Average central Victorian families are paying up to $339 extra per month because of this government’s deception. At a time of rising petrol prices, families are under increasing pressure. The last thing Australians need are John Howard’s and Peter Costello’s porkies adding pressure to the family budget. The Liberals talk about sound economic management. Sound economic management Liberal style means hitting families with rising interest rates, rising child-care costs and rising medical costs. The Howard government can only manage to provide a miserable $6 by way of a tax cut for most Australian workers. The attitude of the Liberals shows that they have no understanding or respect for the plight of most Australian working men and women. Since the 2004 election the Howard-Costello government have displayed utter contempt for Australians. It has been proven that they will say and do anything to get elected-untruth after untruth hitting Australian families. The sad truth is that the Liberals perpetrate untruths and Bendigo working families pay. In the six months since the 2004 election John Howard and Peter MAIN COMMITTEE Costello have broken six of the very promises on which they were re-elected and this budget provides very little by way of relief to average wage and salary earners. No. 1, John Howard and Peter Costello broke their promise that interest rates would not rise. Their $66 billion spending spree and their neglect of the nation’s skills and infrastructure needs put upward pressure on interest rates. This has added another $579 per year to the cost of servicing a $300,000 mortgage. No. 2, Peter Costello and John Howard’s broken promise on the Medicare safety net has added $200 to health costs every year for average income families whose out-of-pocket expenses reached a new threshold of $500. For singles and higher income families the threshold was jacked up by $300 to $1,000. No. 3, John Howard and Peter Costello broke their promise to families with kids in child care to introduce an uncapped 30 per cent child-care rebate from 1 January 2005. No rebate will be available until July 2006. For a typical family with a child under five years of age in full-time day care this means that they will be $1,557 worse off this year because they will have to wait until January 2006 for any rebate. No. 4, Peter Costello and John Howard broke their promise to single income families to increase the maximum rate of family tax benefit part B by $300 from 1 July 2005. The cash bonus available in 2005-06 was reduced to $150. In other words, that was $150 less than they promised at the election. No. 5, the Howard and Costello government broke their 2001 election promise that the private health insurance rebate would reduce health insurance premiums. And that has been broken again, with an average eight per cent increase in premiums since March this year. That has added $164 per year to average premiums for a family with hospital ancillaries cover. No. 6, as I said before, the Howard and Costello government said before the election that there would be no further addition to the number of troops deployed in Iraq. Now there are an additional 450 troops serving in that part of the world under extremely dangerous circumstances. Australia’s current interest rate of 5.5 per cent is among the highest when compared with those of other advanced economies around the world. Australians are already paying among the highest interest rates when compared to other economies that Prime Minister Howard and Treasurer Costello like to compare Australia with. In the United States, the federal fund rate is about 2 per cent. In Europe the Central Bank’s key interest rate for Euro economies is around 2 per cent. The Bank of Canada’s overnight rate is 2. 5 per cent. In Japan the official discount rate is just 0.1 per cent. If you want to look at housing loan interest rates in 2005, you will see that the reality is that Australia’s rates are also among the highest in the Western world, significantly higher than those in the US and the UK and more than double that of Japan’s. This completely buries the myth peddled by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer that the coalition will always preside over lower interest rates. Another 0.25 per cent interest rate increase would mean the standard variable rate would increase from 7.3 per cent to 7.55 per cent, resulting in an additional $48 per month on an average monthly mortgage repayment for a $300,000 loan over 30 years. That is what Australian working families have to look forward to. National statistics show that sales of new houses and home units fell a further 4.5 per cent in January to a new four-year low. Housing Industry Association new home sales figures show that fear of interest rate rises continues to impact on the new home market, with house sales down 1.5 per cent and unit sales down a massive 21.2 per cent. The Prime Minister and MAIN COMMITTEE Treasurer are constantly trying to portray the coalition as the government of low interest rates when in fact Australia’s interest rates are among the highest in the developed world. Regional Victorian motorists have paid a staggering $198 million more in petrol taxes since the introduction of the GST, with central Victorian motorists contributing a massive additional $22 million to the Howard-Costello government’s fuel tax rip-off. The Howard-Costello government claimed the GST would lead to a drop in some indirect taxes, but when it came to petrol taxes the GST was used to conceal a grotesque petrol rip-off. The fuel fraud was revealed at a national trucking convention in Newcastle where my parliamentary colleague the shadow minister for regional development and roads, Kelvin Thomson, proved that, if the government had stuck to pre-GST fuel taxes, it would have reaped $41 billion in the past four years. Instead, it was estimated that it collected more than $44 billion. Spread evenly across the nation, this made regional Victoria’s share of this secret windfall around $198 million. I suspect our true share of that vile amount is even more than the $198 million, given that country people pay more per litre for their fuel and, according to transport economists, make more long car trips than city motorists. Country people are even more affected by the secret taxing because of the transport costs component in absolutely everything they consume. The country transport industry has every right to feel angry about this. In his address to the Australian trucking convention, the member for Wills said that in 2000-01 total petrol tax revenues were $8.38 billion. In 2004-05, it was estimated the tax take would be $9.32 billion, almost $1 billion more than in 2001. By the end of this financial year, the federal government will have collected an estimated $44 billion in petrol taxes since the GST came in-$36 billion in excise and $8 billion from the GST. If the government had stuck with the pre-GST petrol tax arrangements, it would have collected $41 billion, or $3.31 billion less during this period. Even allowing for the 1.5c per litre cut in March 2001 and for revenue forgone as a result of the nonindexation of petrol excise, the Howard government is still over $3 billion better off in petrol taxes since the introduction of the GST. The Howard-Costello government’s approach was to walk away from its responsibility to fund and maintain Australia’s national highway network while its AusLink strategic regional roads component was used as a $93 million slush fund in coalition held or targeted seats during the last election campaign. The miserable $6 tax cut for most Australian wage earners will disappear when they fill their vehicle with fuel each week. The Howard-Costello government admitted in Senate estimates on 14 February 2005 that most of the AusLink strategic regional project funds established by legislation currently or recently before the parliament were dished out during the election campaign without following any application or assessment processes. The coalition ignored the commitments in the AusLink white paper of June 2004 that there would be an application process, a call for submissions, and project development and assessment guidelines, which would then be published in late 2004. The government admitted in Senate estimates that this simply did not happen-it did not happen before the election and it has not happened since. The Liberal and National coalition government has turned AusLink into yet another slush fund for the government’s political benefit, which would explain the coalition’s appalling record in inadequately funding the Calder Highway development. Legislation setting up new discretionary funds is currently before the parliament, and Labor has referred the AusLink bills to a Senate committee for scrutiny. The coalition committed almost $100 million out of a MAIN COMMITTEE total of $150 million allocated on the AusLink strategic Regional Partnerships program during the election campaign. The Department of Transport and Regional Services conceded in Senate estimates that there would be no cost-benefit analysis of the projects. Despite having committed almost two-thirds of the money as election commitments, Minister Lloyd still saw fit to tell the Australian Local Government Association national general assembly on 10 November 2004 that the AusLink regional strategic fund was: ...based on competitive applications, so the enlistment of your local Federal Membersand get thisCoalition and Labor to advance a well documented case for serious projects is keenly awaited. There were not too many Labor projects funded, let me tell you. This raises more serious questions about the way the government do business. They promised a more strategic approach to land transport planning under AusLink but went ahead and used the money allocated to engage in old-fashioned pork-barrelling in the run-up to the recent federal election. This budget contains $11.1 million for the Australian Defence Force for assistance in the Boxing Day tsunami affected regions. The Prime Minister in his usual fashion has exploited this tragedy for his own self-promotion. He has certainly got his $11 million’s worth of value from this commitment. Prime Minister Howard has virtually admitted that he made the men and women of the HMAS Kanimbla spend useless time at sea so that he could seek the glory of welcoming the ship back home after it had concluded its duties in the tsunami ravaged regions. The PM has been caught out playing politics with Australian service personnel who are crew members of HMAS Kanimbla. The ADF people on Kanimbla had performed an outstanding tour of duty in Aceh, where they were confronted with almost unimaginable death and destruction resulting from the Boxing Day tsunami. They finished their task and were headed home when they were turned around to assist in the aftermath of the second earthquake off the Indonesian coast. Faced with a catastrophe of enormous proportions in Aceh and given that they had lost nine of their colleagues in the tragic Sea King accident during the second tour of duty, they should have been given every opportunity to get home to their families at the earliest possible time. A simple study of the cruising speed of the ship and a comparison with the officially reported time it arrived in Townsville showed that the Kanimbla could have arrived in Sydney as early as the Thursday, two days before its Saturday arrival. What makes this appalling matter even worse is that Prime Minister Howard told the John Laws radio program yesterday that, while he had not ordered the ship to wait, that was certainly the understanding that the commander of the ship expressed. When a commander of the ship gets a request from the Prime Minister that he would like to be there to welcome the ship, that is taken as a paramount order; and that is what happened. Certainly that is the understanding from at least one unnamed officer on the Kanimbla, who told the same radio program, ‘We were ordered to slow our ship down to arrange our arrival for shortly after the Prime Minister’s flight was due to land home from Greece.’ The simple facts are that the Kanimbla arrived outside Townsville Harbour-and you would be well aware of that, Mr Deputy Speaker Lindsay, because that is part of your region-at 6.55 am on Tuesday, 26 April. Townsville Harbour is approximately 1,080 nautical miles from Sydney Harbour. The RAN web site states that the Kanimbla travels at 20 knots per hour. One thousand and eighty nautical miles divided by 20 knots or nautical miles per MAIN COMMITTEE hour equals 54 hours, or 2¼ days travel. Kanimbla could very easily have arrived at its base at Garden Island on or shortly after midday on Thursday, 28 April. She arrived home on Saturday, 30 April around 1 pm. The Prime Minister is reported to have arrived home in Sydney at midday on Saturday, the same day. John Howard has been caught out in a vain grab for glory at the expense of military people who had already been asked to do so much and who had already made substantial sacrifices. It was opportunistic, shabby and shameful, and he should admit his arrogance and apologise. Dr JENSEN (Tangney) (9.23 pm)-All this criticism of the coalition’s economic policy is interesting, particularly on issues such as interest rates, when all one has to do is have a look at the records to see who has a better record as far as economic management is concerned. Labor has decided to oppose the tax cuts theoretically, as a matter of principle. Let us reiterate this: Labor does not want to give any Australians tax cuts at the moment. Labor is proposing a tax cut regime whereby Australians would get their tax cut in 2008. Clearly, that is not a situation that we should seriously consider. It is worse than this. They are causing confusion for business as far as tax schedules are concerned. The schedules have been tabled but there is no word as to whether the schedules will be disallowed or not. This has thrown businesses into confusion. The crazy thing about this is that there is really no hope of achieving anything. The tax cuts in the budget will be passed in the new Senate and all they can do is delay things. This opposition to tax cuts is simply spoiler tactics to make the Leader of the Opposition look tough, but it is to no avail. It is a case of Labor putting politics before the national interest or the individual interests of Australian taxpayers. God help us if we should get a Beazley government, where politics would be the primary issue of importance and politics would completely override policy. As I said, the opposition leader is attempting to look tough. This move clearly demonstrates that he is trying to walk both sides of the street yet again. The opposition leader knows that he cannot stop the tax cuts in the medium term, so he sees this as a risk-free strategy for Labor: all care, no responsibility. On the one hand, he cannot stop the cuts, which deep down he knows are in the national interest; on the other, he believes that he will appear to be a leader of principle. What principle? The Labor position is one that is entirely damaging to all concerned-apart from Labor’s perception of political advantage. It is stopping every Australian taxpayer from getting a tax cut that they so richly deserve and therefore it damages the financial position of many households. Maybe the $6 tax cut does not mean very much to the Leader of the Opposition, given that he is sitting on a very comfortable pay packet, but it means a great deal to many people waiting for tax relief. The Leader of the Opposition can afford to play fast and loose with tax relief; he can afford it. But many Australians cannot afford the unprincipled game playing that Labor are embarking on to try to gain some political credibility for the Leader of the Opposition. Newsflash for the Leader of the Opposition: you gain credibility by doing the hard yards and generating some real policy; you do not gain credibility by playing games with people’s pay or adversely interfering in business operations in a damaging way just to try to gain perceived political points. This clearly demonstrates why Australian voters did not, and do not, consider Labor fit to govern. Labor are far too fickle in playing politics over the national interest. MAIN COMMITTEE I notice that the member for Kingsford Smith is here. I am sure that he, being very environmentally aware, would be interested in my next subject: Australia’s water crisis. Water is a precious resource. In Australia, the driest inhabited continent on the planet, we cannot afford to take it for granted. Australia’s prosperity depends on a secure water supply for our houses, farms, environment and industry. A growing population and degrading river systems have shown why the nation needs new and better ways to secure water for the future. Mandatory water restrictions are now in place across each state in Australia. In Sydney, for example, as at Thursday, 26 May this year, the available water storage in Sydney’s water supply reservoirs was a mere 39.7 per cent of capacity. In my own state of Western Australia, water storage in the dams on Monday, 30 May was a meagre 25.1 per cent of total capacity. There are a few different ways that you can attack the problem of the dwindling water supply. One way is to simply move people to where the water is. However, this is a case of social engineering, and social engineering in this sort of way never works. You cannot force people to live where they really do not want to. Another way is to reduce water consumption. Of course, we have water restrictions in the capital cities, so clearly this is an avenue that is being tried, but it will only work to a certain extent. It is limiting and it clearly does not help farmers. We can use grey water recycling, but once again there is limited scope for use of this method. A method that is popular, it would appear, with the Western Australian Labor government and also with the New South Wales Labor government is desalination. However, there are significant environmental and energy costs. I do not believe that they have been anywhere near adequately evaluated. The method which we really need to look at is getting water to where it is needed. The first thing to do is to identify the best site where there is water. Twenty per cent of Australia’s rainfall flows into the Ord River catchment. There is a fantastic proposal that a constituent of mine has proposed that clearly shows out-of-the-square thinking, which is to pipe water from the north-west to Perth and the other major capital centres of mainland Australia. The cost would be about $55 billion to $70 billion. However, this is a cost that would not be borne by the taxpayer. The cost of delivered water would be between 18c and 23c per kilolitre in constant 2005 dollars over a period of 50 years. In effect, the cost of water would, in real terms, be reducing over this period. As I said, this system, at essentially no cost to the taxpayer, would from the outset be in public hands. How is this achievable? The idea is to sell water rights to farmers and other interested parties for a period of 50 years for around $8,500 per megalitre. This would give owners of the land that the pipe crosses approximately $22,000 per kilometre right of way for easement. Water supply to water rights owners would be charged at about 3c per kilolitre to provide funds for ongoing operational expenses. The water rights would be a tradeable commodity for the water rights owners-in other words, the farmers. The idea is that about 80 per cent of the water rights would be marketed for agriculture and about 20 per cent would be for urban use, which would obviously help with the urban dam situation. The pipe length would total about 7,200 kilometres. About 15 per cent of this would go through land that is suitable for irrigation. If you work on a lateral distance of up to 25 kilometres from the pipe, as far as irrigation is concerned, you can then determine the total land area. Using this, you can see that there would be a very significant economic benefit to all of Australia. MAIN COMMITTEE intervene? ability of water flows in, for instance, the Fitzroy River catchment and the role that is played by the river in aquifer regeneration in the Kimberley region. a speech, if I recall correctly, about two months ago. Domestic utilities would be able to sell the additional water that they get at about 45 per cent above cost. The water cost to the agricultural sector would be cheaper than it is for irrigation purposes now. Let us have a look at the state of affairs on this. In 1975, an acre-foot of water cost approximately $35. Currently, it is approximately $326. Clearly, looking at this, we can see that water rights would be an appreciating asset. How will farmers afford water rights? Reliable water will increase the value of the land, as I have stated. The idea is that in order to gain a loan from the bank, the landowner will purchase, in effect, an intention to purchase a water right for a cheap price, whereafter the farmer can go to the bank with a strategic business plan and obtain a loan. There is potential, as well, for any excess water-and as the member for Kingsford Smith said, there is variability in the rainfall in the areas; there is variability everywhere-in the years where there is an abundance of water. It could be purchased and fed into the Murray-Darling catchment, with the potential to assist farmers in the catchment area as well and still enable the Murray-Darling system, particularly the Murray, to have a healthy flow at the mouth of the Murray River. I commend this proposal to the House. I believe it is an excellent proposal to consider, given that, as I mentioned, there are a few different methods in which you can attack the water problem. As I have said, I do not think that moving people to where the water is will work. Reducing water consumption clearly works, but there are limitations. As far as recycling is concerned, it can only be used to a certain extent-there are limits-and with desalination there are significant environmental and energy costs. In terms of the Western Australian proposal, you are talking about 10 per cent of the base load electricity, which will be used for the desalination plant in addition to the chemicals that are put in the front end and are going to go into Cockburn Sound, which is not a well-flushed waterway. In conclusion, the way to do it is to get water where it is needed. I believe that this is an excellent proposal that really deserves consideration in terms of helping to alleviate Australia’s water crisis and to give many farmers some surety as far as water supply is concerned. and the triumph of the Costello silvertails. The government is awash with money; it is literally drowning in revenue. Spending is out of control. It has delivered tax cuts that are heavily skewed to high-income earners, and it has made virtually no serious hard decisions on spending or on tax reform. There are punitive changes regarding the disability pension and sole parent pension, and there is a very limited strategy towards seriously lifting work force participation.

247,Mr Tanner (Melbourne) (9.37 Pm),"This budget sees the end of the Howard battlersborrowing to play the stock market, a new, subtle socialist strategy on the part of the Howard government-government ownership by stealth-to tackle what is really a minor problem: public sector superannuation obligations into the future. There is minimal action to address very serious structural economic problems such as capacity constraints and infrastructure difficulties; investment in education and training; excessive borrowing and consumption, which are clearly underpinning to the current growth we are experiencing; declining non-commodity exports, which are a crucial component of our soaring current account deficit; declining productivity; and the absence of any serious reform agenda on competition and productivity. The Howard government is literally drowning in money. It has had the good fortune to be in office during a demographic peak. We reached a point-roughly about 2002-03-where about 47 per cent of the population were in the work force, but after about 2010 that will start to drop dramatically. It has also had the good fortune to experience an enormous commodities boom, which has had a massive impact on tax receipts, and, of course, it continues to benefit in varying degrees from bracket creep. Since the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook papers in December, we have seen that the projections for company tax for the forthcoming financial year were upgraded by $5 billion and the projections for income tax upgraded by $2 billion. That is just within six months. To give a more stark illustration of the massive increase in projected revenue, the 2003 budget projection for company tax proceeds for the 2005-06 year was $36 billion. That has been upgraded in the 2005 budget for the same financial year to $47 billion. There has been an $11 billion upgrading of the assessment of company tax revenue for that financial year. Had there been no new policy initiatives after the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook papers in December last year, the surplus in the forthcoming financial year would be $15 billion, not the $8 billion that is projected. So in effect the government in this budget has given away a further $7 billion on a giant spending spree that started in the 2004 budget and of course was continued during the election campaign. In 2004 the Howard government had a 10.75 per cent real increase in its own-purpose spending, which is the fastest growth rate for federal government spending since 1983. It was fuelled, of course, by the notorious 1982 budget, which just happened to be the last budget with John Howard as Treasurer-but at least he had the excuse of being in the middle of a recession and the need to pump prime the economy. So there has been a giant increase in federal government spending. Roughly three-quarters of the revenue windfall that the government is experiencing as a result of this economic good fortune is effectively being given away over the forward estimates period. Add to that fact that all recent budgets except the 2001-02 budget have hugely underestimated the revenue and cash balance outcomes, what that amounts to is a picture of a government literally drowning in money. There has been virtually no action on spending in this budget. The only significant spending reductions have been the backflip on the Medicare safety net and minor tightening of the PBS safety net, saving in effect only an average of $400 million per annum over the forward estimates years. There has been no action regarding the outrageously wasteful and politically driven Regional Partnerships program, nor the vast array of similar spending programs that are politically driven that are using enormous amounts of taxpayers’ money for naked political purposes. MAIN COMMITTEE This budget has rightly been described by ANZ Chief Economist Saul Eslake as involving ‘the biggest budget giveaways in history’ and creating a ‘distinct possibility of further interest rate increases’. The budget is leaving the Australian economy enormously vulnerable to the prospective impact of future falls in commodity prices, which will have a significant impact on taxation receipts, capital gains tax receipt reductions and things of that nature. Added to that we see very wasteful new spending that is completely off the track in terms of the appropriate structural reforms required, such as the absurd technical colleges proposal-the government directly invading areas that are the province of the states. The government has used its largesse to shower tax cuts on the better off. If you look at Budget Paper No. 1 on page 1-10, you will see that over the three sets of tax cuts in 2003, 2004 and 2005, some of which come into effect in 2006, for those earning between about $60,000 a year and $100,000 a year there is an effective 12 per cent reduction in their income tax burden. But for those earning around $40,000 to $50,000 a year over those three budgets there has been only an effective three to four per cent reduction of their income tax burden, a very serious skewing of the distribution of tax cuts in favour of higher income earners. The budget papers also suggest that a lot of this is simply the returning of bracket creep. If you look at Budget Paper No. 1 on page 10-9 you will see that revenue from income tax is projected to grow from $111 billion in 2005-06 to $133 billion in 2008-09, effectively a 20 per cent growth or five per cent per annum. By 2008-09 it is projected that income tax collections will in fact be a slightly higher percentage of GDP than they are projected to be in the immediate future. In other words, the tax cuts are trimming cream off the top but not really restructuring the tax system, except to shift the burden away from higher income earners and in effect increase the burden on lower income owners. That is what this is all about. The government’s response to this is to talk about the politics of envy. That phrase is what you hear when there is a rich person’s hand in a poor person’s pocket. It is the last refuge of the political scoundrel. If the economy deteriorates and we need serious surgery on the tax scales, if there is a serious need for fiscal repair, you can bet your life that the Howard government will not be reimposing the burden on higher income earners who are benefiting from its largesse. It will hit people lower down the scale. The budget does nothing serious to deal with the participation issue, which is one of the biggest challenges facing the Australian economy. We have nominally record levels of participation in our work force but, when part time and full time are factored in, it is at a much more modest level. We are still only 12th in the OECD with work force participation rates and we are below the OECD average for people over 55. We need a real effort to make it easier for people to get into the work force. Instead, we have had a nasty punitive assault on those on the disability support pension and sole parents, punishing them and diminishing their entitlements. The tightening of the disability test for DSP applicants means that we will now have three categories of people on the DSP: those who have been on it previously, those who go on to it between May 2005 and June 2006-to whom a 30-hour work availability test will apply at the start and thereafter a 15-hour test-and finally those who apply for the disability support pension after June 2006. Those who are already on it will have an enormous incentive not to look for work or take work because, if they do, they will be taking an enormous risk: if they take a MAIN COMMITTEE job and then lose it or they find they are unable to cope, they may not be able to get back on the disability support pension. There is a range of other changes of very dubious purpose. Sole parents whose children are above the age of six will be forced on to Newstart and, therefore, will face a substantial increase in their effective marginal tax rates from 40 per cent to 60 per cent. There is a $504 million increase to Job Network for welfare to work purposes, but it is counteracted by a $457 million cut to general Job Network funding. The criteria for the highest level of Newstart assistance have been made tougher. Wage subsidies are being reintroduced for disadvantaged job seekers, which-as has been the case in the past-will be wide open to employer rorting and churning. The different indexation arrangements between pensions and other entitlements will mean that the gap between Newstart, on the one hand, and the disability support pension and sole parent pension, on the other, will continue to grow, making the problems I have referred to previously even worse. We will see sole parents losing access to the pensioner education supplement. There is very limited new child-care money, most of it coming on stream only in 2008. We will see nothing new for long day care funding and only about 20,000 training places for the hundreds of thousands of DSP and sole parents whom we aim to get into the work force. There is minimal action on the biggest problem in the Australian taxation system: the effective marginal tax rates. Labor’s alternative proposes a serious assault on that problem. The budget proposes a future fund, which effectively involves the government borrowing to play the stock market. To keep the bond market alive, the government is refusing to repay government debt. That is similar to what has been occurring with the government having had enormous amounts of money on deposit at the Reserve Bank-up to $16 billion in recent times earning 5½ per cent-while at the same time paying similar amounts and in some cases higher on outstanding government debt. Keeping the bond market alive, for whatever is the government’s purpose, would have to qualify as perhaps the most bizarre industry assistance scheme Australia has ever seen: an employment creation scheme for bond traders. The future fund proposal is effectively the equivalent of a person getting a substantial pay increase and, instead of paying off their mortgage or paying for their kid’s education, putting that money away in a bank account to cover their next 30 years of council rates. That is the equivalent of what is happening with the future fund. The public sector superannuation issue is a minor problem. It cost the public purse $3.4 billion in 2003-04, which is less than two per cent of total outlays. It can easily be carried on a pay-as-you-go basis and it will decline over time. There is no doubt that eventually, sooner or later, The Nationals will get their grubby paws on the money in the future fund and it will be there as an additional pork-barrelling source. The money should be given back to taxpayers and in the most effective way, which is into individual occupational superannuation accounts. That means that the money would go into investment and not consumption. In addition, because fluctuation in future surpluses is unavoidable, it is not locked in as a permanent tax cut. It would help fill the retirement savings gap and could become a permanent part of the reform of superannuation tax. This budget does very little to tackle the enormous structural problems in the Australian economy: capacity constraints, skill shortages, excessive consumption, household debt, deteriorating export performances and declining productivity. There are many worrying signs of MAIN COMMITTEE these problems in the budget papers. For example, there is the absence of serious new skills and education initiatives, with the exception of the absurd and wasteful federal technical colleges proposal. The OECD data in Budget Paper No. 1 at 4-24 shows that Australia is lagging the OECD very seriously in post-secondary non-university education-that is trade and TAFE. We are well below the OECD average. Demand growth has been 5.6 per cent over the past three years while GDP has averaged only 3.1 per cent. In other words, we are spending the largesse that the terms of trade change have delivered to Australia; we are not investing it. Since 2000, the vast bulk of the increase in nominal household wealth has come from housing prices rather than productivity improvements, compared with between 1992 and 2000, where it was the reverse. From the figures for 2004-05, the year we are about to complete, we can see that GDP growth has been contributed to more by household consumption and public expenditure than it has by business investment. We have a serious current account deficit problem that is well known. It is running at seven per cent plus for the first time since 1951-52 and the government’s half-baked justifications about the ratio of debt servicing simply do not address the key structural problem, which is our abysmal recent exports performance. Exports as a percentage of GDP are falling sharply. Imports are soaring. And it is predicted that we will have a seven per cent growth in exports in the forthcoming year, off the back of a prediction this year of eight per cent when the outcome is going to be two per cent. There will be virtually no changes in volumes. The explanations in the budget papers for the appalling export performance in manufactured exports and services exports are thin. They talk of the Australian dollar appreciation, the maturing of some of Australia’s manufactured exports, more intense competition from China and other countries, and health and security concerns re international travel. When we look at the actual evidence though we see that there are a lot more serious concerns here. The Australian dollar appreciation only gathered pace in late 2003, early 2004. The trade weighted index only managed to get back up to the June 2000 level in early 2003, so in fact we had several years of very positive position with the Australian dollar. It was lower than it had been in 2000 for nearly three years. Australia was highly competitive during that period of global slowdown. Disaggregating the data for elaborately transformed manufactures, simply transformed manufactures and services shows big variations across specific categories which are not explained by the government’s excuses. There are big drops in exports of precious stones, basic non-ferrous metals, textiles and yarns, and the total drop in simply transformed manufactures over the four-year period from 2000-01 to 2003-04 was from $12.2 billion to $9.5 billion. There was a similar experience with elaborately transformed manufactures, big drops in non-metallic mineral manufactures, big drops in office and telecommunications equipment and in machinery and transport equipment. The total drop in elaborately transformed manufactures was from $20.5 billion in 2000-01 to $18.1 billion in 2003-04. Services exports have been pretty static over that period. It is significant that the Commonwealth Bank’s analysis of the budget states that in the past five instances of recovery from bad current account deficits the bulk of the recovery has come from higher export volumes. In a classic piece of understatement, the Commonwealth Bank says, ‘A rise in export volumes is elusive’ and, ‘Progress in sorting out the current account deficit problem will be slow.’ Contrast the budget papers where it is suggested that the probMAIN COMMITTEE lem is a saving problem. We have an exports problem and the government is doing very little about it. If we do face a very serious economic correction as a result of the giant structural imbalance in the global economy caused by the US current account deficit there could be a major problem for Australia, possibly even a serious recession. The prospect of that is gradually mounting, as the OECD has warned, and indeed even the budget papers acknowledge it. It is unclear what the implications would be for Australia but, because of our huge current account deficit, our very weak export performance, our big consumption and debt overhang and the huge increases in government spending, we are seriously exposed to some very negative consequences if that global realignment occurs. Now is the time for serious action on productivity and participation, not the cosmetic touches and ideological crusades that we have in this budget. As Saul Eslake correctly pointed out, the budget has ‘no comprehensive productivity growth agenda’. Productivity is now declining, which means real wage costs are increasing, even when wage growth is constant. Since 2002 we have fallen behind the OECD average on productivity after outperforming it from the early 1990s until 2002. Since 1998 our percentage level of productivity compared with the US has been declining. It hit 86 per cent; it is now back to 81 per cent, which raises a big question about how effective the Peter Reith industrial relations reforms have been in increasing productivity. Tackling exports and productivity decline is fundamental to grasping the emerging opportunities that Australia faces. To do this, we need a serious economic reform agenda. We should not waste the best opportunity Australia will ever have in the current benign circumstances, as the Howard government is doing. Instead of out-of-date ideological obsessions such as imposing individual contracts on low-paid workers, we need serious reinvigoration of competition reform and fiscal consolidation. Nothing is happening on these issues. That is why exports have stalled, that is why productivity is going backwards and that is why government spending is soaring. My challenge to the Howard government is to develop and implement a serious economic reform agenda to do the things it should have been doing over the past few years. It should broaden the income tax base and lower the rates by eliminating concessions and deductions, by tackling the effective marginal tax rates problems and by integrating the payment system and the taxation system. The government should slash wasteful government expenditure, in part to help it to finance serious tax reform on superannuation taxes. It should invest the fortuitous surpluses that it has been gaining and pay them into individual occupational super accounts rather than the absurd future fund. It should accelerate the roll-out of broadband, which is an absolute disgrace in Australia. We are way behind most of the developed world, and this is the economic foundation for the 21st century. The government should seek a total realignment of the federal and state divisions in health, education, aged care and various other responsibilities to eliminate the enormous duplication and waste that characterises those areas. The government should use drought assistance to ensure genuine reform of farming practices-where farms are located and which land is farmed. The government should institute sweeping genuine competition reforms in the areas that nobody talks about-telecommunications, so we have stricter regulation of Telstra and stricter separation of its functions; broadcasting, to accelerate the uptake of digital television and radio by sweeping deregulation; aviation, so we can have genuine competition for Qantas MAIN COMMITTEE on the LA route. Qantas is happy to play the little Aussie battler when it seeks protection from competition but is all about exporting Australians jobs. Qantas wants a global labour market but protection from global competition. We need more competition for pharmacies, with the PBS growing to nine per cent per annum on real returns. We should invest seriously in R&D and develop a major participation strategy to ensure that we have genuine work force reform. (Time expired) Debate adjourned.

249,Mr Mcgauran,"The Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts(2) Can she confirm that the daily care fee for Prisoners of War receiving low-level hostel nursing care is fully subsidised; if not, why not. (3) Does the Government provide low-level, or similar, non-means tested nursing care for TPI Veterans; if so, what are the details; if not, why not Mrs De-Anne Kelly-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) Yes, the Australian Government does provide full medical support to all totally and permanently incapacitated (TPI) veterans. All TPI veterans hold a Gold Card, which entitle them to treatment for all medical conditions. TPI veterans may use the Gold Card to access any medical service listed on the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS). The Gold Card also provides access to a number of support services such as Allied Health and Community Nursing Services, Veterans Home Care, the Rehabilitation Aids and Appliances Program, the Repatriation Transport Scheme and the Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. (2) Yes, daily care fees for Australian ex-Prisoners of War receiving low-level (hostel) residential aged care in Australian Government funded facilities are fully subsidised. (3) The Government does not provide low-level or similar non-means tested residential aged care for TPI Veterans. The Government believes that people, including TPI veterans, should make a reasonable contribution towards the cost of their aged care if they can. Veterans (Question No. 608) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, in writing, on 17 February 2005: (1) Can she confirm that from May 2005 totally and permanently incapacitated (TPI) Veterans will (a) no longer be able to obtain their free or subsidised footwear from a podiatrist and footwear supplier of their choice and (b) receive free or subsidised footwear supplied by a company nominated by the Department of Veterans’ Affairs; if so, why. (2) What are the details of the company or companies nominated by her department to supply footwear to TPI Veterans from May 2005. Mrs De-Anne Kelly-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) The Department of Veterans’ Affairs (DVA) is making a number of changes to the supply arrangements for medical grade footwear services, with the overall objective being to improve the quality of the services provided to all eligible veterans with a clinical need for medical grade footwear, including TPI veterans. HoweverI must emphasise that these changes are administrative only, as there has been no change in policy in relation to the provision of these services. It is important to the Department that veterans receive high quality medical grade footwear services. To ensure this happens, the Department has undertaken a procurement process to find footwear suppliers which are suitably qualified and have a good understanding of the special clinical footwear needs of veterans. The list of DVA approved suppliers will be those which participated in this recontracting process and which have been assessed as meeting the high standards set by DVA. (a) In the majority of cases medical grade footwear is currently supplied by specialised footwear suppliers who are contracted to DVA to provide these services. Under DVA’s health care arrangements the role of a podiatrist is to provide veterans with clinical treatment. This includes prescribing, but not supplying, medical grade footwear. However, a small number of podiatrists are currently approved to prescribe and supply medical grade footwear services. These podiatrists have been approved to supply medical grade footwear in exceptional circumstances only, that is where no other footwear supplier is available in a particular area. DVA will continue to contract with specialist footwear suppliers to provide eligible veterans with medical grade footwear services from May 2005. At this stage I believe the exceptional circumstances that have in the past necessitated some podiatrists also supplying MGF no longer exist, due to the availability of other medical grade footwear suppliers. This means that podiatrists will no longer be required to supply medical grade footwear. So whilst a small number of current MGF suppliers, including podiatrists, will no longer be contracted to supply MGF, eligible veterans can continue to attend their current MGF supplier if they appear on DVA’s list of approved footwear suppliers. (b) Under DVA’s health care arrangements it is important that, wherever possible, veterans are able to attend the health suppliers of their choice. Eligible veterans will continue to be able to attend any contracted medical grade footwear supplier of their choice. Those veterans requiring medical grade footwear should continue to consult their prescribing podiatrist to determine the supplier who will be able to provide footwear that meets their clinical need. (2) Details of the new contracted suppliers are currently being finalised. Podiatrists and other footwear prescribers will shortly be able to advise eligible veterans which supplier/s in their local area are contracted to DVA to provide MGF services from May 2005. Hillsong Foundation and Associated Entities (Question No. 636) Dr Lawrence asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, in writing, on 7 March 2005: For each of the last five years, what are the details and sum of each grant and service payment by the Minister’s department and agencies within the Minister’s portfolio to (a) the Hillsong Foundation, and (b) its associated entities. has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (a) and (b) I am advised that the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, and its agencies, have not provided any grants or service payments to the Hillsong Foundation or its associated entities in the last five years.

250,Mr Mcgauran,"The Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts(1) With respect to the decision by SBS to televise the Ashes cricket series on free to air TV, what ‘prodding’ was undertaken by the Minister and Prime Minister of SBS and whom did that ‘prodding’ involve. (2) What is the value of the television deal and did any discussions take place between the Government and SBS management concerning a possible additional financial contribution by the Government to SBS to assist in securing the television rights. has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) The Minister deals with the representatives of the commercial and national free-to-air broadcasters on a regular basis as part of her role as Minister for Communications. Prior to SBS’s acquisition of the rights to the Ashes matches the Government indicated repeatedly that it hoped a free-to-air broadcaster would acquire the right to televise the 2005 Ashes series. However, the Government also indicated that it considered the matter to be a decision for each of the broadcasters. (2) SBS has advised that the value of the rights is subject to confidentiality provisions in the agreement with the rights holder. Discussions between the Government and agencies relating to financial matters are subject to Budget confidentiality. However, SBS has advised that its capacity to acquire the Ashes was not dependent on securing additional funding assistance.
