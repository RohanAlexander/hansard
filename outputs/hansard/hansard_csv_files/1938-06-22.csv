3,Mr Hughes,"X now propose to ask"" of the sites that might be considered suitable for the new administrative headquarters. Salamaua, Wau, Edie Creek, Bulolo, Upper Watut, Lae, Bamu and Madang. The report of the committee, and the in formation I have been able to furnish to my colleagues, have been considered by the Government, which has reached the following decision:1. Saliiiiiaua to be tlie site of tlie administrative head-quarters. 2. A road to bo constructed from Salamaua to Wau, the centre of the rich gold-mining area of the territory. Koads already connect Wau and Edie Creek, and Wau and Bulolo and other places, but there is no road built from the mining fields to the coast. 3. A long-range policy to be formulated tbnt will in time permit of the road suggested from tlic coast to the gold-fields being extended to the Markliam Valley and eventually to Banm and further inland; this road to be the backbone of a system for the hinterland of the New Guinea m'ainlaind, which can in time be linked with Madang on the north' coast of New Guinea. It is proposed that the necessary finance for the foregoing projects should be provided in the following manner:1. The cost of the preparation of the newsite for the administrative head-quarters at Salamaua, the transfer thereto and harbour improvements aud other works incidental to the establishment of the administrative headquarters at Salamaua (estimated at £350,000) to lie the subject of equable arrangement between the Commonwealth Government and the New Guinea Administration. 2. Provision for a district staff near Rabaul' (approximate cost £45,000) to be a matter for the New Guinea Administration from territorial funds. 3. The estimated amount necessary to provide a road from Salamaua to Wau (£150,000) to be secured by a loan to be raised in New Guinea. Such loan to be guaranteed by the Commonwealth Government and to bo amortized over a period. A toll to be charged to users of the road and payment of interest on the loan and provision for redemption to be a first charge on the revenue obtained from the toll. The maintenance of the road to be a matter for tlie New Guinea Administration as an ordinary administrative function. It is difficult to estimate the time that will be necessary to prepare Salamaua. for the administrative head-quarters, and to build the road from Salamaua to Wau, but both projects w ill be placed.in hand immediately.

Minister for Commerce whether it is not a fact that of the four shipping"" lines trading between Australia and the East, one is an Australian company, and the other three, foreign companies? If this be so, will the honourable gentleman give tlie House an assurance that a quota of 22$ per cent, to the Australian company would not be regarded by the Government as adequate ? Will he also say that, in the circumstances, the Government would not contemplate agreeing to any quota of less than 25 per cent, for the Australian line? subjeet, which has been under the consideration of the various interests concerned for a long time, is one for the Australian shipping companies to deal with, rather than the Government. I assure the honourable member that as soon as any definite information is available, I shall inform the House of the effect of it. Minister aware that the Japanese Government is actively interesting itself in tbe preservation of the interests of the Japanese companies? If this be so, does lie not think that the Commonwealth Government should do all in its power to see that in this matter, which may affect the negotiation of trade agreements, the interests of tbe Australian shipping line are preserved? Commonwealth Government has been actively engaged throughout the negotiations in endeavouring to get the greatest possible percentage of freightage for the Eastern and Australian Line which trades to Japan. It will continue those endeavours with a view to achieving a settlement which will be satisfactory to shippers of both Australia and Japan. of the Minister in Charge of Development to a recent press article on the whaling Minister for Commerce whether applicaindustry, which stated that unless the tions for the positions of Assistant Trade killing of humpbacked whales off the coast of Western Australia were reguI cannot say lated by international agreement, such whales might eventually be exterminated, thus destroying a potential valuable Australian industry. Will the Minister say what steps have been taken to secure an international agreement for the protection of the whaling industry of Australia? I should also like to know what his department has done in recent weeks to encourage this industry? Apparently negotiations initiated some years ago by the honourable gentleman's predecessor were not brought to a successful issue. honourable gentleman's question is in two parts. The first relates to the discouragement of tbe killing of whales, and the second, to the encouragement of the killing of them. The protection of whales to prevent their extinction has been discussed internationally for a number of years. I am not certain, offhand, whether Australia has adhered to the relevant Convention, but the Australian delegation at present overseas is making inquiries into the whole matter. As to the second part of the question, the development of the whaling industry is a matter for private rather than government enterprise, but if the honourable gentleman will give me further indication of his wishes I shall be glad to furnish him with a more adequate answer.

46,Mr Lyons (Wilmot,"Prime MinisInter-State Commission has been increased from three to five, and a reduction of salary has been made whereby the chairman will receive £2,000 per annum and the other four members £1,500. .The total salary cost under this bill will, thereNowhere is this desire for. safeguards fore, be only £1,500 in excess of that provided for by the bill of last year. The reason for the increase of the number of members is, I think, apparent. The duties of the commission conferred on it by this bill will rapidly grow to pro-' portions that would be too large for the commission always sitting as a single body to cope with. By providing for a commission of five members it will be possible for that commission to appoint sub-committees and thus enable it to deal with nearly twice as much business and to sit concurrently in different parts of the Commonwealth. To thisend provision has been made in the bill for the appointment by tbe Inter-State Commission of a committee of two members vested with all the powers of the InterState Commission, excepting the very important power of making a decision as the commission. Any such committee must report back to the commission itself ancl the full commission, guided by that report, will reach a decision and make its report to the Governor-Genera]. The purpose and functions of the commission are set forth in Parts III . and TV. of the bill and may be divided into' four groups. Eirst and foremost is the Interstate Trade and Commerce Enquiries. Clause 18 empowers the commission to enquire into and report to the Governor General upon[a) any anomalies, preferences or discriminations alleged to exist in relation to interstate commerce; and (6) any alleged contravention of tlie provisions of tlie Constitution reposed tribunal. Although the tenure of lating to interstate commerce. This -is the initial and most important sphere in which the Constitution intended that the duties of the commission were to be exercised. Honourable members are well acquainted with the negotiations from which our Constitution emerged, with the spirit of compromise which made that Constitution possible, and with the surrender of powers by the States. They are also Mr Lyons. aware that in surrendering these powers certain safeguards were inserted in the Constitution, in order to afford some guarantee that interests peculiar to certain States should not be overlooked. more real than. in. the provisions of the Constitution relating to trade and commerce. In this sphere the States were surrendering tremendous power. No longer might they protect or encourage their domestic trade by restricting the entry or establishing the free flow of goods from overseas. The power over customs and excise passed exclusively to the Commonwealth; the Commonwealth was also given power to legislate for overseas and interstate trade and, although not an exclusive Commonwealth power, any legislation of the State touching these matters was to be subservient to the Commonwealth legislation. Trade; intercourse and commerce among tbe States was to be absolutely free. Cani t be wondered that the States wanted some machinery whichj if it would not in all cases guarantee, would at least go a long way towards ensuring, that the interests of the States would be protected. Consequently, one of the safeguards which the States inserted in the Constitution was that contained in section 101 which providesTliere shall be an Inter-State Commission with, such powers of adjudication and administration as the Parliament deems necessary for the execution and maintenance, within the Commonwealth, of the provisions of this Constitution relating to trade and commerce, and of all laws made thereunder. Whilst one can readily appreciate the purpose and the wisdom of the framers of the Constitution in inserting such a measure, one cannot but be critical of the apparently conflicting provisions"" in the Constitution as to the nature of the"" prooffice specified would indicate that the Inter-State Commission was to be a nonjudicial body, the fact that an appeal from its decisions was given to the High Court in its appellate jurisdiction led many to believe that the Inter-State Commission was a body capable of exercising the judicial powers of the Commonwealth. Accordingly, the act passed by this Parliament in 1912 vested the Inter-State Commission with certain judicial functions. How in the case of Now South Wales v. Commonwealth, in 1915, the power of the commission to exercise judicial functions was challenged before and disallowed by the High Court is well known to honourable members. Suffice it to say that the High Court held that insofar as the Inter-State Commission Act purported to constitute the InterState Commission as a judicial tribunal it was invalid. The very. basis of that legislation appeared to have been, taken away by that decision. For the remainder of their terms the'Inter-State Commissioners continued to function as something equivalent to a. standing royal commission, but since then no new appointments have been made and the act has remained inoperative on the statute-book. As the result of the High Court decision it is not competent for Parliament to vest judicial powers in the commission; it is not possible, therefore, to empower the commission to enforce its own findings. No doubt we are all a little disappointed that those powers cannot be conferred on this body, but in this respect, unless and until the Constitution is amended, Parliament is helpless. That, however, does not mean that the Inter-State Commission cannot serve the Commonwealth as the framers of the Constitution intended it should. The framers of the Constitution intended .this body to be the policeman the trade aud. commerce power, or, as Mr into which the Inter-State Commission Deakin put it, the eyes and ears of the Parliament. This bill proposes to give the Inter-State Commission the widest possible powers of inquiry over matters relating to interstate commerce and to report to the Governor General. If that report indicates that remedial or preventive action is necessary, such action can then be taken, perhaps legislative action by this Parliament, perhaps executive action by the Government, or even, in some cases, where the report discloses a contravention of a law, an action instituted in the High Court, which court will then be enabled to take the action necessary to restrain the contravenyear because its operation was confined to tion. Consequently, by adding the powers of inquiry and report which this Parliament proposes to vest in the Inter-State Commission to the functions which tbi.3 Parliament, the Executive Government and the High Court possess, it is felt that the objectives of the States when framing the Constitution will be adequately achieved. No longer will a State claiming to be adversely affected by federation rely upon agitation or its ability to convince this Parliament that it suffers a disability. If it feels that it is adversely affected by federation it, may .invoke the jurisdiction of the Inter-State Commission which is being constituted primarily for the purpose of hearing such complaints. Armed with the findings of the Inter-State Commission the Commonwealth will then know just what the state, of affairs is that it must remedy, and bow best it may remedy it. wealth know tlie state of affairs from the representatives of the States? tlie establishment of the Inter-State Commission will prevent the necessity for States having to agitate or appeal direct to this Parliament. This bill will enable the setting up iof an impartial body to investigate the claims and to ascertain if there is any injustice or contravention of the law. The commission will be watching affairs from day to day and it will become more expert a* time passes. I know that it is the desire of certain honourable members io specify certain of federation with respect to aspects of interstate trade and commerce should inquire, but I ask why specify a list of particular matters that are indisputably embraced by these two general paragraphs relating to interstate trade and commerce. The specifying of certain matters cannot add to this wide general meaning; on the other hand it may, by implication, cut down that width of meaning. I turn now to tbe second phase of the commission's functions, that empowering the commission to decide that certain preferences or discriminations in respect of State railway rates are unfair or unjust. In this connection, certain criticism was levelled at the bill of last State railways. Such criticism however, fails to appreciate the purpose of this part. Part IV . of the bill does no more",17,Second Reading

48,Mr Lyons,"I have just said thatthan provide the necessary machinery for carrying into effect the specific propreserving the provisions of that section visions of the Constitution. The Constitution contains many prohibitions addressed either to the Commonwealth or to the States, or to both. So far as the Commonwealth is concerned, section 99 of the Constitution specifically states that the Commonwealth shall not, by any law or regulation of trade, commerce, or revenue, give preference to one State or any part thereof over another State or any part thereof. This prohibition is absolute. It is not confined to cases in which some tribunal deems that the discrimination or preference is unfair or unreasonable. It is not made dependent upon the prior finding of any such body as the Inter-State Commission that there is indeed a preference. It is not, for that matter, confined to Commonwealth railways. directed to the Commonwealth, forbidding it to give any preference to one State over another State, by a law apper-= taining to trade, commerce, or revenue. So far as the States are concerned, the prohibition is not absolute. Section 102 of the Constitution permits this Parliament, by any law with respect to trade or commerce, to forbid, as to railways, any preference or discrimination by any State or by any authority constituted under aState, only if that preference or discrimination is undue and unreasonable, or unjust to any State. Even here, due regard must be had to the financial responsibility incurred by any State in connection with the maintenance and construction of its railways. Most important of all for our present purposes, honourable members should note that those preferences or discriminations are not to be deemed undue and unreasonable, or unjust to any State, unless so adjudged by the Inter-State Commission. Unless and until tbe Inter-State Commission is constituted, and machinery is provided whereby it can reach its conclusions as intended by section 102 of tbe Constitution, no action by this Parliament or by the High Court can give effect to the undoubted meaning of that section.

Honourable members will note how restricted is the operation of this provision in its application to States when compared with the prohibition directed against the Commonwealth by section 99 of the Constitution. In the ease of the Commonwealth, no preference at all, whether by railway rates or otherwise, may be given to one State over another; in the case of a State, it is merely provided that the preference is not to be undue and unreasonable, or unjust, and whether it is undue and unreasonable/ or unjust, having regard to certain specified factors, is made depenI t is an absolute prohibition dent upon the prior adjudication of the Inter-State Commission.

That is the second purpose of Part IV to provide for machinery whereby complaints of any contravention of that part may obtain the adjudication of the InterState Commission, without which no further action could be taken. This adjudication may be obtained at the instance of any one of the numerous authorities specified in clause 23 of the bill. Clause 24 requires the commission to submit to the Governor General a report of all such investigations, and if that report discloses a contravention of the part, clause 25 empowers the Attorney-General to institute proceedings in the High Court to restrain that contravention. any inquiry? an inquiry by this commission and the commission would carry out that inquiry.

Part V. requires the commission to make an annual report which must be tabled before both Houses of the Parliament. Provisions in the bill relating to the taking of evidence, summoning, examination and protection of witnesses, and production of documents, are all similar to provisions in existing acts dealing with such matters. dence shall be taken on oath. That ought to be made clear. that point. Mention may be made of the requirement that the commission must takeevidence in public, unless in the public interest it considers it desirable to takethat evidence in private. Where such matters as trade secrets are involved, howwordsever, the commission must take the evidence in private when so requested. There can be little doubt that it is. highly desirable lib-art the legislative and administrative functions of any Parliament are greatly assisted by the existence of permanent bodies empowered to inquire into .difficult subjects and report to the Parliament. apply to a Federal Parliament such as this. This Parliament is concerned not only with the welfare of the whole of the Commonwealth but also with the interests, sometimes divergent, of the six States forming the Commonwealth. Many bodies already in existence are designed to assist Parliament in this respect. I need only refer to the Tariff Board, the Commonwealth Grants Commission, and the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. But notwithstanding the existenceof these permanent bodies, it is frequently necessaiy to appoint royal commissions to inquire into certain matters. The commission which this bill proposes to establish will be a body of. experts which, by reason of their long tenure of office and the permanent records of their activities which will be kept, will have every phase of federation and its effects at their finger-tips and will be able, therefore, .not only to safeguard the interests of the States, but also to advise this Parliament onmany matters of vital importance. The question of re-constituting this rommission is not a new one; it has been under consideration ever since the expiration of the original tribunal'. Many requests for its re-establishment, have, been made, including recommendations by royal commissions. References to pages 249 and 250 of the report of the Royal Commission on the Constitution will disclose that that royal commission dealt in detail with the functions which might be conferred on the Inter-State Commission, and recommended its re-constitution. The royal commission on the finances of Western Australia as affected by Federation, and the royal commission appointed to inquire into the finances of South Australia, also recommended the re-constitution of the Inter-State Commission. On page 59 of the report of the former commission appear the The creation of an Inter-State Commission is one of the terms of the federal partnership' agreement. It is in the bond. At this stage, perhaps I may refer to a question put to me at question time by the honourable member for Griffith( Mr Baker) in regard to criticism of this measure recently made by the Right Particularly does this Honourable Sir Isaac Isaacs. criticism. Having regard to the very high offices which Sir Isaac Isaacs'has occupied, any criticism emanating from him cannot be ignored and must be treated with respect. If he has been correctly reported, it appears that his comments on this measure can rather easily be answered. In the first place,, he objects to the passage of this bill before the meeting of the new Senate on the 1st July next. It is difficult to appreciate this objection.

If there is anything in this objection it woiild follow that no. legislation should be passed after the date of the elections, and before the commencement of the term of service of the new senators. In many cases the adoption of this course would suspend the legislative machine for nine or ten months. There is surely nothing in this objection. The next criticism is that no constitutional mandate exists for such a commission as is proposed, and that whatever mandate does exist for the establishment of an Inter-State Commission has not been followed. This objection appears to be based on the ground that the bill now before the House is not limited to the carrying out of the specified provisions of sections 101-104 of the Constitution, but gives the ,commission powers of inquiry concerning certain other matters specified in -paragraphs ,c to g of clause 18. The criticism that the only powers which the Parliament may confer on the commission are those contemplated in sections 101-104 of the Constitution does .not appear to be a valid one. It appears to be based on an analogy derived from the decisions .of the High Court in relation .to the exercise of judicial power. As members are aware, the Constitution contains a tripartite division of powers into legislative, executive and judicial. It has been held by the High Court that the judicial power of the Commonwealth may not be exercised except by courts. But while this clear demarcation exists in the -decision of the court with respect to judicial power, the same line does not exist between legislative and executive powers. The court has held that the division of powers between the Executive and the legislature is not a hard and fast division, but that certain powers in their nature legislative may be conferred on the Executive. It will be remembered also that the High Court has held that judicial powers may not be conferred on the Inter-State Commission. It follows, therefore, that, in the division of the organs of government between legislative, -executive and judicial, the functions of the Inter-State Commission cannot be regarded as falling within the judicial division and that the limitations which are. applicable to judicial powers are not applicable to legislative and executive powers. It follows also that the Parliament, in creating an executive body such as the Inter-State Commission, is not limited by the specific provisions of sections 101-104 of the Constitution but may confer upon the commission other powers falling within the general legislative powers of the Commonwealth under section 51. This is the principle upon which the Parliament acted in 1912 when it conferred many additional powers on the commission, notably powers relating to marketing, the effects and operation of tariffs, prices of commodities, profits of trade and manufacture, wages and social and industrial conditions, labour, employment and unemployment, bounties paid by foreign countries, population, migration and "".other matters referred to the commission by either House of the Parliament, by resolution, for investigation."" So far as I am aAvare, no challenge in any shape or form has ever been made against these provisions, notwithstanding the fact that 'they were actually exercised for seven years, during which time the act formed the subject, of a. leading case before the High Court in which others of its powers were held to be invalid. The next objection appearsto be that provisions in the bill relating to State railways violate an important' mandate intended for the protection of the States. It is difficult, in the brief reference made in the press to this objection, to appreciate the grounds of it, seeing that clauses 21 and 22 of the bill, which relate to State railways, follow very closely the provisions of sections 102 and 104 of the Constitution, including the provisions which those sections contain for the protection of State railways. The remaining criticisms appear to be based on the view that the bill is unnecessary. This is a view which the Government does not share. As many honourable members know, this measure played a prominent'part during the last elections in certain of the States. It is undoubted that there should be some such body to inquire into the disabilities which those States allege they suffer and into certain anomalies in tbe effects of federation which they allege exist. The present Government, when it established the O'tuimonwealth Grants Commission, took a very important step in the direction of giving justice, particularly to the smaller States; and in bringing forward this bill it is taking a still further step in that direction. It is doing something which I hope will bring about better feeling between the States and the Commonwealth, something that will create a better federal spirit throughout Australia as a whole. The fact that we propose to increase the number of the commission will, in addition to the advantages I have already mentioned, enable us to make that body even more representative than is the present Commonwealth Grants Commission. I commend the bill to the favorable consideration of the House. adjourned. Second report brought up by Mr sion is necessary, and which are now being BILL 1938. Debate resumed from the 29th April (vide page 660), on motion by Mr and no one ean view recent trade returns That the bill be now read a second time. ""When considering the proposals contained in this bill it is necessary to take the long view. It is true that we are looking for some early results, but, in my opinion, the main results will be achieved -many years hence. agree that the Council for Scientific and Industrial Eesearch, which was appointed twelve years ago, has since then established a. very fine record of achievement, and that it has won the confidence of the primary producers of Australia, upon whose problems attention has been particularly concentrated. This bill is to provide a fund of £250,000 to extend the activities of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Eesearch to secondary industries. Under the original charter, the council had power to conduct research into all industries, but it never had the funds to pursue its inquiries into more than the primary industries. Now it will be able to turn its attention to the secondary industries. In the opinion of the Opposition, this is a step in the right direction, and we commend the bill. I do uot lose sight of the importance of the primary industries, which are the foundation upon which the prosperity of Australia has been built. The primary industries supply us with food, with the raw material for other industries, and with a surplus for export, thus enabling us to maintain our credit overseas, and to meet our obligations there. In addition, they provide very considerable employment. However, the power of the primary industries to absorb labour is diminishing, whereas that of the secondary industries is ever increasing, and will increase still further when science is applied to them. The application of science to manufacture should result in many of those machines and tools of trade in which high preciimported, being manufactured in this country. In addition, a very large percentage of the articles now imported will also be manufactured locally, thus making Australia more self-reliant in peace or in war. That also has a very important bearing on our trade balance overseas, without a certain amount of disquietude. We have seen that the markets for our primary products are closing in, while imports into Australia are increasing in volume. Although the immediate position is not dangerous, it will require only a continuation of the drift for a year or so, culminating in a drought, and the position Honourable members will will be really serious. Therefore, the more we can do to increase production in our own country of those goods which we are now importing, the safer will Australia be. I have said that tbe markets overseas are closing in, and that is true, particularly in regard to wheat. in "" ; say, rather, "" being destroyed "". no control over such matters. The honourable member who has just interjected would say, no doubt, that we have brought it upon ourselves by our own tariff action, but I point out that there were othermotives besides retaliation for tariffs.",22,Second Reading

Speaker, to make a passing reference to the matter. and of the interjection which caused the honourable member to digress. were apt. This bill opens up a very wide vista; there is really no limit to the consideration one could give to a proposal such as that now before the Housei f time permitted. The proposed expenditure of £250,000 to extend scientific research and the application of science to secondary industries opens up the whole of the ramifications of our national economics which affect, not only the production of primary industries, but also the importation and exportation of all classes of goods. Just on that point it is well to recall that, some six years ago, the German Minister for Agriculture, in a very important broadcast speech, saidGermany has so increased her wheat acreage here. Having done that we can then that she no longer need import grain for liread. Nobody will now force us to our knees by ti hunger blockade. There you have the incentive in foreign countries to produce uneconomically wheat and other products. That necessitates us extending the field of our secondary industries so that they will be able to produce in this country the goods we are now importing in order to offset the lack of exports of primary products to those countries. A more important aspect than that, however, is the importance of having in this country a diversity of industries essentia] for our national development and for the protection of the nation. ""We cannot develop this nation unless we have a balanced economy. I have never taken the part of any one who held one section against another; I believe the one is complementary to the other. Primary and secondary industries must march forward side by side in our national development, if we enlarge our home markets by the extension of secondary industries, we shall increase the markets for primary and secondary industries alike. That is a -most important aspect. Another very serious and important'aspect that this subject opens up is the question of population. We are constantly being told about the vast empty spaces in Australia, though in are exaggerated. We certainly have vast empty spaces, but a large proportion of them are not capable of settlement. be empty. some new method of production is discovered about which science at present knows nothing. developed by irrigation. Mv. SCULLIN I should like to see the honourable member endeavour to irrigate the dead heart of Australia. It is true that there are portions of Australia capable of more intense cultivation today, and it is equally true that Australia can carry a much larger population than it, does at present, but it is also true that before we can contemplate large schemes of migration for the rapid filling up of Australia we must first provide for the employment of those who are already make provision for the absorption of new arrivals. It would be of no use for a man with an empty paddock to dump a lot of fruit trees in it, and let them lie there and say, "" I shall have an orchard "". It is the same in regard to human beings. Migrants must be given a chance to dig their roots deep into the soil by employment; they should not be dumped here and scattered over the empty spaces without guidance or assistance. Anybody who has given passing thought to this question must know that the room for expansion in Australia lies in its secondary industries. The object of this bill is to extend the capacity and efficiency of secondary industries, and because of that I support it as I have supported the extension of scientific research and the application of science to the primary industries of Australia. I am glad to see that great results have been achieved in the past, although greater, I believe, are to come. The two principal institutions to be set up by the funds to be established under this bill have been explained by the Treasurer ( Mr Casey), and I shall not go into too much detail in connection",24,Casey

79,Mr Prowse,"They could, perhaps, bewith them. One is the National Standards Laboratory to cost £S0,000, in respect of which there will be an annual expenditure of £10,000; the other is the Aeronautical Research Laboratory to cost £143,000, and in respect, of which the annual expenditure will be £12,000. We have at the present time, and have had over the last eight or nine years, an organization known as the Standards Association. Prior to that the other organizations dealing with standards were tbe Association of Simplified Practice, and the Commonwealth Engineering Standards Association. Those organizations have been amalgamated into the Standards Association. Those associations have done excellent work in the past in preparing specifications and in the formulation of methods to standardize manufacturing operations throughout Australia. We have not yet. got to the higher foi;m of standardized organization and, until this measure goes through, . we have no Commonwealth authority. Without such an authority we cannot 'have standards because, as I think the Treasurer said in his speech, a number of standards means that there are really no standards. needed, and more elaborate equipment is required, to bring about the proper organization 'of standards in the manufacturing and other industries in Australia. A committee was set up by the Government some two years ago known as the Secondary Industries Testing and Research Committee. That committee bas submitted a ""report -which, although extremely technical, is, nevertheless, very interesting. I myself found it interesting to a degree. I have no doubt that many honourable members have read the report, but there are some portions of it which I think are worthy of emphasizing;. The committee statesCases have been cited in many industries of tlie disabilities imposed upon manufacturers by the lack of facilities in conducting certain tests, and the difficulty of securing any authoritative certificate of test as to quality or other requirements. That, is a very serious disability which Successful specialization. il/v. Scullin. machines are made in separate factories -and institutions by the thousands and by the hundreds of thousands. There is no such thing to-day as the individual fitting together of one part with another. It has to be done on a wide scale under what is called mass production, and because of that very much greater accuracy is required in the gauges employed for measuring and testing of parts. Therefore, there arises the very important necessity for having standard gauges. Here is a very interesting and striking paragraph in this technical report which supports the arguments advanced in justification of this considerable expenditure of public moneys:The range of equipment from primary standard down to working gauges is extensive. At the top o£ the range is the costly and very' accurate equipment which must be housed and handled with every precaution against injury and against temperature and other influences that would impair the accuracy of a calibration. At the other end of the range are the working gauges. In normal manufacture of medium high precision, the limit gauges measure to .1/1.000 of an inch. The master gauges for checking those would measure to 1/10,000 of an inch. The sub-standards for checking the master gauges must be accurate to 1/100,000 of an inch, and the comparators used in the highest grade of calibrations in the standards laboratory -measure to 'Greater facilities are 1/1,000,000 of an inch. These are staggering statements. It is for the establishment of a standards laboratory equipped to carry out such highly accurate measurements that this bill has been introduced. The equipment of the maximum accuracy that is required in industry is not obtainable in Australia at the present time. In rare cases, Australian firms have used the services of this description now obtainable in Great Britain, but that is very inconvenient; hence the need for this proposal to have set up in Australia standards of this very high maximum accuracy. Of course, if a crisis arose and we were cut off, even temporarily, from the other side of tbe world, a standards laboratory such as I have mentioned would be very necessary. Another very important feature of the bill is that it proposes to set up an aerofrom nautical research establishment. MrH . industry is suffering to-day. E. Wimperis, a former director of aeromodern production means nautical research in Great Britain, instiSpecialized parts of tuted an inquiry in Australia and has submitted a -number of recommendations which, so far as I can gather, coincide with the recommendations of tbe other committee to which I have referred. In his report, Mr Wimperis said that there should be set up an engineering research establishment for experimental work in wind tunnels, in engine tests for aircraft and automobiles, and in tests for -aircraft ""instruments. agree that it is important that we should be able to detect faults in the manufacture of engines for aeroplanes during the course of manufacture, and should also be able to ascertain the cause of any engine Such an institution would be an excellent help in any inquiry into the unfortunate tragic events that have occurred too frequently in recent times in Australia. The two institutions I have mentioned w ill play a very important part in the industrial life of Australia.. A t present, this country is very f a r behind most other countries, certainly -behind seven or eight nations in the matter-of applied science. Germany, I tbink, leads the world in the 'application of -science to industry ; (Russia has also made rapid strides in this direction in recent years; and GreatB r it a in and the United States of America have gone a long way; but Australia lags behind. Apropos of this'question, I should like to draw attention to what I regard as a very serious matter that has come under notice recently. Melbourne Age of the 2nd June last read as follows:For the development of the military and economic four-year plan, all German chemists and engineers employed hy firms outside Germany have been ordered to return to Germany. I notice that the president of the Victorian Chambers of Manufactures, Mr F. Sanderson, has pointed out that this w ill mean a serious depletion of the ranks of the technical experts in Australia. He states that the chemical industries have ..employed many Germans, and their recall w ill handicap Australian firms, because no other-members of their staffs are trained to do their work. That, in my opinion, is a serious reflection on the industry itself, and it is something of which the Government should take note. If firms permit foreign technical experts to come to Australia because men of that class are unobtainable here-and that is the position-compulsio n should be laid upon those firms to have Australians trained by the imported foreigners. show a preference to foreigners over Australians. ment of foreign experts should provide that they should train Australians to do the work. One can see what might happen. JsTo easier way could be found for a foreign -country to sabotage Ausfailure after manufacture. tralia in time of war than by withdrawing its experts from the key industries on whitih we should have to rely in a national-emergency. Yet we have allowed foreigners to do the skilled work until their services are required for military and other purposes in their own country. When we train our own experts, we shall .have some assurance that our key industries w ill bo carried on. This precaution is particularly necessary in A iew of the r -fact that local industries have to compete --with industries .overseas that have employed a large number of highly skilled experts for many years. are attracted overseas by high salaries. ; are not so highly remunerated as they should be, and that is one reason A cable published in the why we lose them. We now have under notice an instance of German nationals having been recalled by the German Government, and some have responded to that call, leaving our key industries without trained experts. It w ill be useless to expend £250,000 on further research work if we do not have trained Australian experts to carry on these industries. When we have trained our experts, it w ill be of no use if the local market is flooded by goods dumped from overseas. We must preserve Australian industry for the purpose of ensuring national safety, as well as for national development. Having been accustomed to speaking of millions of pounds, we may be apt to overlook tbe fact that the £250,000 proposed to be expended under this'measure is a large sum. to devote merely to research",25,Casey

It would be hard to estimate the economic and productive, value of the council's work since its Canada, I was impressed by the very great attention paid in' that dominion to the application of scientific methods to both primary nnd secondary industries. Almost every form of production there is being afforded scientific aid. In a young country like Australia, such guidance is becoming more than over imperative. However, "" better late than never "". A fine feature of the work of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Eesearch is that it is entirely free from political infor the red-legged mite which is so defluence. The council has been given a free hand. to the direction of the Minister. activities are entirely in its own hands. All that the council needs from the Goernment is the provision of financial aid, though, of course, ministerial direction may be given that, particular problems shall be investigated. I am looking to the council to add to its valuable achievements by discovering, from current investigations, a virus for the destruction of rabbits. These small animals have caused damage to the extent of untold millions of pounds in Australia. In a young State like Western Australia, whicli has recently become seriously infested witb rabbits, the settlers are totally unprepared to deal with the situation. The taking of effective measures will involve the expenditure of a large sum of money. I , therefore trust that the council very soon will be able to prove the vims satisfactory and release it to may be avoided. We speak frequently about the losses incurred in Australia by drought, but we should also remember that very heavy losses are also caused by rabbits. I trust that this particular work of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Eesearch will be expedited. The reports so far released encourage me to cherish the hope that the promising results already obtained will lead to complete success. Not long before Dr. Tillyard died, he told me that practically everything in life had its parasite. Australia had a fine native flora and fauna when the country inception. When I was in was first settled, and the parasites in the country kept in check animals and diseases that might have become a pest; unfortunately, the many pests that have been introduced without their particular parasite have involved the country in tremendous losses. I mention the lucerne flea in this connection. The Council for Scientific-and Industrial .Eesearch is to be complimented on having discovered the parasite for this flea. I sincerely hope that, a parasite will also be discovered structive to all kinds of clover. Tbe right honourable member for Yarra referred to the insect which has destroyed the prickly pear, to the tremendous advantage of certain parts of the Commonwealth. I should like to know whether the council is making investigations to discover a fungus or some other method to destroy bracken fern. If such a discovery could be made, it would mean that millions of acres of the best land in Australia would become available for production. Not only is the bracken fern in itself a pest, but it is also a harbour for foxes, rabbits and other pests. The money to be provided under this bill is intended to make possible the scientific investigation of certain problems relating to our secondary industries, the determining of standards, and the like. This is manifestly highly necessary in order to permit our secondary industries to be more effectively developed and maintained. If satisfactory work be done in this direction no doubt the burden which these industries at present impose upon certain sections of our people will be lifted to some extent. In view of our",28,Casey

I commend the bill and shall vote for it. I wish to compliment the right honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) upon his interesting and informative survey of the work of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, and I endorse his tribute to that body for the fine work that it has done in connection with primary industries, particularly in regard to the eradication of pests. The information which he conveyed to the House was worthy to be rehearsed. I also compliment him on the attention he has given to the technical side of the Council's operations, which it is proposed this bill will cover. Although he is not himself a technician, he has placed us all under an obligation to him because eff his obvious research into and study of this aspect of the subject, particularly in relation to standards, gauges, and the other work it is proposed will be done. His remarks have enabled us to grasp more clearly tbe intention of the bill. I wish' to ask the Treasurer ( Mr stand that this proposed organization will Casey) for some information in connection with the measure. How far is it proposed that the work intended to be done shall go? a body is to be established to deal with Australian standards of measures, gauges and other matters in relation to the testing strength of materials, and so on. ""Will an investigation be made into tbe requirements of specific industries? I have in mind, particularly, the electrical industry, which is ones. I want the determinations by this natural, since I was engaged in it before I became a member of this Parliament. For instance, will the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research concern itself with the determining of electrical standards of one kind and another for application to all parts of Australia ? It has become imperative, particularly in Australia, that more work of this description shall be done. I am formed in the different, States to discuss standards. These bodies, which are "" offshoots"" of a larger body, are evidently exercising powers delegated to them by different States, but unfortunately this method has led to the setting up of varying State standards in the Commonwealth. It is now proposed, I understand, that the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research shall become a central authority to determine the degree to which existing standards shall be accepted, and I want to know if its decisions will override the decisions of the State authorities in different industries where these are now operating. It may be that its decisions will have to be applied by voluntary, rather than compulsory, methods, but I sincerely trust that the whole subject will be dealt with in a common-sense way, and that State jealousies will not be allowed to perpetuate varying standards instead'of -securing uniformity. We have had enough of that kind of thing in the past. A particularly sorry state of affairs can be cited in the lack of uniformity of our railway gauges. If this central authority has not the statutory power 'to impose its will on the States, it will at least have the power to direct attention to the futility of trying to develop the industries of this country except on standardized lines. I undermake the necessary tests to arrive at the proper formulas and to decide standard measures, gauges and the like to be I understand that accepted, I suppose, by those who seek the organization's advice. It is just as well to be frank on these matters. I should be loth to see Commonwealth money expended and all the benefits from its expenditure derived by the large industries to the exclusion of the .smaller authority to be within the reach of not. only those organizations which are established but also those which are seeking to be established. I wish to be assured also that if money is expended in research for secondary",29,Casey
90,Mr Beasley (West Sydney) [2.24].,"industries there will be some reciprocation to the people of Australia by those industries Frequently Commonwealth money has been expended to assist industries and there has been no reciprocation by those in charge of such industries. I have no hesitation in naming the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company Limited as an example. A great deal of Commonwealth money has been expended on behalf ot that company in tlie form of concessions of various kinds, financial assistance and in research, not necessarily by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, but with funds provided direct from Consolidated Revenue. company, benefit of all of that expenditure of public moneys, when it needed ships to trade on the Australian coast, and had the opportunity to reciprocate to Australia by having those vessels built in Australia, bought them overseas. That is the sort of thing that tends to make honourable members sour when assistance to the larger industries is contemplated. It should be borne in mind by the men who for the time being are operating these large industries that they are trustees, not only for their shareholders, but also for the country as a whole. recognize that the welfare of the nation is equally as important as that of the shareholders, and all-important as the dividends of shareholders may be to them, the principle of dividends to the nation should be the pre-eminent consideration. If I with other honourable members am prepared to vote Commonwealth moneys for the development of industry those industries which benefit should realize that this Parliament has in its mind not only their welfare but also tbe welfare of the country generally. The betterment of the conditions of persons engaged as employees in industries is -also a factor in our taking action to provide assistance to industries. If I am ready to help those industries they should on their side be prepared to reciprocate .and to band back to the community some of the benefits that they receive by purchasing their requirements in Australia, even though the cost be higher than they may be 12,000 miles away. The fact should be impressed upon those industries that this Parliament is prepared to help them only if they are willing to accept which have benefited. these considerations. The purpose of this measure, I understand, is that the secondary industries of Australia should achieve the highest and most scientific standards possible. The right lionorable member for Yarra put it very nicely in his speech when he declared that it would be useless to expend money on research on behalf of industries unless those industries received at the hands of the Government adequate protection from foreign competition, particularly when the standard methods suggested had been applied. Honourable That members appreciated the constructive after having had the speech made by the right honourable member, particularly in this matter. The research work by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research on behalf of primary industries has bad beneficial results, largely because of the successful co-operation by that body with the agricultural departments of the States. It is to be hoped that the same spirit of co-operation will apply i ' regard to secondary industries. 1 I agree that even if the standards to be established by the body to be set up under this bill do not override the stanThey must dards that have already been established in the various States, at least the spirit of co-operation between the Commonwealth and the States will be cultivated on this important matter. The cooperation which has resulted so happily to the primary industries should characterize the proposed efforts on behalf of the secondary industries. I am particularly anxious, however, that those firms which are in a big way will not be the only concerns that will benefit from the establishment of this department. The benefits must be spread throughout all sections of industry. Furthermore, in order to assist towards making Australia self-sufficient in the engineering industries, I believe that technical students at the universities and colleges and trade schools should have the opportunity to watch the research work. Lectures and practical demonstrations should be available to engineering students from the gentlemen who will be in charge of the proposed work. If that policy were adopted, the scientinc application of the brain-power of the Australian people would be considerably assisted. I conclude with the hope that those people who will benefit from the expenditure of this amount of £250,000 on industrial research will not fail to do something practical for the nation in return. is gratifying to know that all sides of the House are congratulating the Government on bhis national movement in the direction of extending the operations of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research to research into secondary industries. Such research has been required for years by secondary industries. The world marches on rapidly aud when we review the many inventions, such as air-conditioning, wool fibre, fabricated houses, oil from coal, television, advances in air-craft, and all of the labour saving appliances, we must realize the need for research. We have men of talent in Australia and, instead of the services of many being sought by overseas organizations, we have now the opportunity to make use of them locally. To take only one of the recent developments, air-conditioning. What an effect this must have on industries in such tropical centres as Darwin and Townsville and in inland towns like Bourke! Air-conditioning has an important bearing-on the amenities of life. Air-conditioning, for instance, is necessary for the proper development of New Guinea. When I was in Washington last year the United States of America National Research Committee was engaged on the very important effect of new inventions on industry, and employment and general living conditions. It issued a remarkably interesting report. I believe that in Australia research in the direction contemplated in this bill will enable us to plan proper adjustments and to obtain full benefit from modern inventions. The secondary industries need a bureau of standards. I understand that this bill will establish such a bureau which will deal with formulas for various essential materials which will be of great value to local industries and enable them to compete more effectively with overseas industries. I listened with interest to the right honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin), who made an excellent contribution to the debate. I agree with his statement that there is a good deal of exaggeration in respect of the vast open spaces of Australia. When we compare the rainfall of Australia with that of other countries and realize the fact that a large part of Australia is within the tropical zone, we know that the reason why there are empty spaces in Australia is exactly the same as the reason why there are empty spaces in other parts of the world, namely, they are not suitable for human habitation. I am pleased that the Government has introduced this measure,' which has my strongest support. mend the Government for its action in bringing down this measure. Such a step was absolutely essential in view of the development of secondary industries. Tbe Council for Scientific and Industrial Research has already done a great amount of valuable work on behalf of primary industries. The cactoblastus insect has saved Australia millions of pounds by its destruction of the prickly pear pest. The council's experiments in the direction of exterminating the blowfly are still in progress, but, even so, the council has done valuable work in that direction. It has done splendid work in discovering a remedy for the blue mould in tobacco. Its work on noxious weeds is being extended and its efforts to combat the skeleton weed menace, are particularly appreciated. The honourable member for Forrest( Mr Prowse) referred to the council's efforts towards the elimination of the rabbit pest. If the council is successful in its attempt to deal with the rabbit problem, it will have done a work of tremendous value. In the secondary industries, it is absolutely necessary to secure greater standardization. This is too big a problem for manufacturers alone. In big engineering projects, standardization is particularly valuable, but the need for it also exists in connection with primary industries. Any one who has purchased farm plant realizes how many different patterns tliere are in the machines purchased from",30,Casey
91,Mr Jennings (Watson) [2.36],It,32,Casey
92,Mr Nock (Riverina) [2.44],"I comdifferent manufacturers, and how difficult and expensive it is to obtain duplicate parts when needed. A 2-inch or 3-inch bolt with a right-hand thread can be bought for 2d., yet the firm which manufactures the machine that turns out a bolt of the same size with a left-hand thread charges Is. 3d., although the cost of production is no greater. This furnishes absolute proof of the need for standardization. In the case of spindles carrying a particular kind of cog-wheel, rhe cogs at the end should be interchangeable, so that when the spindle wore it could be transferred to the other end, but the manufacturer of the machine deliberately tapered the spindle at one end so that that could not be done, and more duplicates would be required on which a profit could be made. I urge the research committee which deals with these matters to press for greater standardization, not only in connection with engineering and electrical appliances and the parts necessary for aeroplane construction, but also in respect of plant required in primary production. [2.47] I rise to support the bill. We are fortunate in having a technical man in the person of the Treasurer ( Mr the broadening of the activities of the Casey) to bring such a measure before the House, and I congratulate the honourable gentleman upon its introduction. I regret that I was unable to be here when he introduced it, and that I had to make a few notes from the newspaper report of bis speech. We are entitled to congratulate ourselves upon having had such a report as was made by MrH . E. Wimperis recently in the matter of the manufacture of aeroplanes. I was particularly struck with his remarks on page 4 of the report, which show that he has presented something that is worthwhile. He there statedI t is natural that it should bo asked whether Australia, by reliance on research work done elsewhere, could not obtain all the information it will need. The answer is that it could not. tions (whether public or confidential) carried out diately communicated, to the A i r Board in Australia, and that such published work ns may be issued in the United States of America, Germany and elsewhere is also available. But vitally important as this is, the whole of the field of inquiry cannot be thus covered. Australia will wish to know the degree to which liomc-produecd products can safely be used in substitution for materials that have tn be imported, bow far it is safe to adopt novel methods of manufacture which may suit local conditions, and, most important, to leai'ii promptly the cause of any failure during manufacture, or use, of any aircraft component, or of the aircraft as a whole. I am quite in accord with the suggestion of the right honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) that we should lose no time in making use of such a valuable brain as that of Mr Wimperis for the training of our own people. The Treasurer has reminded us that, in 1936, the Government set up the committee known as the Secondary Industries Testing and Eesearch Committee, consisting-of leading industrialists and eminent scientists. This body recommended, among other things, the setting up of an Australian standards research reference laboratory, an aircraft and engine testing and research testing laboratory, a research service, an information service, and a testing service for secondary industry. The honourable gentleman also informed us that the Government had availed itself of the services of Mr Wimperis in the preparation of this measure. He has stressed the point that Council for Scientific and Industrial Eesearch has a distinct defence flavour, for the reason that the two main institutions to be brought together are an essential link with the big defence effort that Australia is now making, and that it will make in the years to come. My principal reason for addressing myself to the bill is to point out that, praiseworthy as is the idea of spending £250,000 on standards, we actually have no guaranteed standard of length in the Commonwealtli; all the States are working to a. different standard pf length. Further, we have no standard of level in height, based on mean sea level; all the States work on a different basis.' In Melbourne, instrumentalities such as the The results of aeronautical investigaMetropolitan Board of Works, the State in Britain are, it is true, immeRivers and Water Supply Department, and the Harbour Board, work on different data, simply because the matter of arriving at the mean sea level is a highly technical process which has never been attended to in the past. Tbat applies",32,Casey
93,Mr Blain (Northern Territory),"also in Sydney; there has always to be a plus or minus adjustment in respect of levels. When a surveyor or an engineer comes to a datum peg or a bench mark, he has to find out what level he is on-whethe r he is on the Harbour Board datum or the railway datum-and make rhe necessary adjustment. This matter should be attended to before a commencement is made with measurements on any other work. All the measurements on which we propose to spend such an enormous sum are really based on a national standard of length-o n the science of measurement known as metrology. I shall show how we have developed this science by drawing freely on the notes of a fellow surveyor, the late Mr Herborn, who has left quite a wealth of valuable material behind him in the articles that he wrote prior to his death. As to what is meant by metrology, he saidMetrology is defined as "" the science of at intervals of every 2 feet, so that they measure and "" measure "" as size, or quantity, could be checked as accurately a3 posin relation to a standard. That is the standard we are now discussthat the temperature would be more or ing, and which we propose to inaugurate. less even.

For that much attention, and valuable aud interesting purpose, two steel tapes were prepared information has been gathered. Although the ancient measures have varied considerably in and standardized by comparison with the different countries, and in the sa.me country 10-ft. iron bars. These tapes were used at different periods, it is found that, in to evaluate the distances between the measures of length, the practice has almost terminals placed on bhe blocks.

Up to recent times tlie measures have been used mostly for trade and constructional purposes, but with tlic advance of scientific and industrial development it has become essential to establish standards ot tlie greatest accuracy and to make units of great .precision. We have continued to use those standards of measurement up to the present day. But there is no co-ordination among tbe Australian States in respect of a standard of length. Let me trace what the States have done in an attempt to bring this about. I shall deal first with New South Wales. In 1867, 10-ft. wooden bars were used to measure the Lake George base. These bars had microscopes at their terminals. That work was subsequently completed in 1S70, with 10-ft. iron bars with microscopes at their terminals. Those iron bars are now in the Sydney University. Thermometers were placed sible, and they were kept in a cellar so of verification was measured and checked It is said that without down a standard 66 feet and 100 feet in three large trachyte blocks under the basebeing awaited to make the necessary comfrom 3 inches to 5 inches out of measurein Gresham College, London, is the task to which the Treasurer should Since his time this devote his attention. member says that the measurement of the Richmond base was found to be faulty, I presume he suggests that it was found to be shorter rather than longer than was thought. or a minus value had to be applied to it ; but there is a variation of from 3 inches to 5 inches. 5 miles. I am trying to point out that, before we can start with any accuracy, we must have that basic standard fixed. Since then we have adopted chains composed of the alloy "" invar "",. which varies very little in length with variations of temperature. A new procedure has had to be adopted in testing for expansion due to temperature. Australia for testing this alloy when its coefficient of expansion changes after a period of years. Treasurer the need for having an apparatus to test the variability of the coefficient of expansion of this alloy. is wrong. military officer in charge of the survey was so concerned about the variability that he imported an electrical apparatus for testing, but found that so much current was used at the terminals that they actually had to discard it, and tbey have gone back to the old-fashioned steel tape, and the utilizing of thermometers at every chain, a very tedious practice. Therefore, I urge the Government to see that the proper apparatus is brought here immediately. In Queensland, an act was passed in 1924 to establish an official set of standards of that State. I communicated with the Surveyor-Generali n Brisbane by telegram, and he informed me of what had been done there. The Queensland measure is described as an act to consolidate and amend the law relating to weights and measures. into five parts, the second of which deals with standards. ground satisfactorily so f a r as Queensland is concerned, but we need legislation to set up standards for the whole Commonwealth. The standards defined in the Queeuslaiid act were based on the old wooden bars, and I was informed that it. was only in 1S95 that they were checked against the iron standard bar in Sydney. I urge the Government to introduce legislation to provide for a uniform standard of weights and measures for the whole Commonwealth. This would provide, among other things, a standard for surveyors' measuring tapes. There is also a lack of a uniform standard in regard ro height above sea level. Various authorities in New South Wales work on different data. Some time ago ' the president of the Victorian Surveyors' Institute urged that a standards association be formed, and that this association should, among other thingSj carry out a complete range of measurements, extending There are no means in over a period of at least ten years, to establish a mean sea. level datum for the whole of the Commonwealth. TbeI urge upon the State authorities seemed to think that this would be an easy matter, but, actually, it is an important scientific undertaking. The recommendation traversed the grand circle-that is, it I think the Treasurer went, fro m one authority to another, and I understand that the finally back to a source from which it emanated, but nothing was done. The president of tbe institute, who had made the recommendation in the first place, was a senior officer of the service, and was eventually, in bis official capacity, requested, to report on his own recommendation. One reason given by the States for not carrying out the work was that they lacked money, but with the £250;,000 which it is proposed to appropriate in this bill, that difficulty can be overcome. I suggest, that the necessary apparatus should be purchased immediately for measuring high and low tides, so that we may work out over a period -the longer the better for the sake of accuracy-the .mean sea level for the Commonwealth. I repeat that at the present time, in Victoria, for instance, harbour and river boards, -the State railway authorities and It. is divided the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works are working on different levels. That act covers the If a surveyor or an engineer wants a datum spot he should be able to refer to a national datum, and I suggest that he should refer to Canberra. We",33,Casey

The trouble is, however, that this is a local datum, and does not. bear a.u exact relation to mean sea level for the continent, because it has never been determined with precision. This state of affairs should be remedied, and I suggest that some of the money which it is now proposed to appropriate should be devoted to this purpose, a course that was recommended to the standards association, which is replaced by this new body. port, the bill, as, I think, does everybody year. The council should endeavour to in the House. I was pleased to listen to the speech of the right honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin), who made a valuable contribution to the debate. Our only regret is that he does not speak more frequently, but we trust that' his health will, in the future, allow him to take a more active part in the debates. The money whicli is being appropriated in this bill will, I am sure, be well spent. As a matter of fact, I believe that unlimited funds should be placed at the disposal of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, because the success of all our primary industries depends largely on its activities. We all know the debt which tbe fruit growers owe to the scientific experts for their advice and instruction regarding the growing and preserving of fruit. In all fruit-growing countries, the problem of the control of pests is becoming more serious every year. It may be that, when one pest is destroyed, its parasite becomes more active, so that it in its turn becomes a pest and must be controlled. When work was first begun on Some years ago, it was necessary to spray fruit trees only once or twice a year; now they must be sprayed about fourteen times. Five years ago, the orchardists began spraying for a certain pest. A poisonous spray was used and eventually the pest was eradicated, but next year another pest, equally destructive, developed, and it was found that the first one had been living on the second. Thirty years ago, bird life was plentiful in Australia but, through the laying of poison for rabbits, crows, &c, tbe birds have been killed off, so that one may travel for miles and miles and hardly see a bird at all. The birds used to control pests of various kinds, but, in their absence, scientific methods of control have had to be developed. It is desirable that uniform methods of control be employed, as otherwise different methods would be in use in the various States, and even in the same locality, with the result that costs of production would be increased. The council has done much to improve methods of storing fruit, and for transporting it to overseas markets. Some years ago, the export of fruit was attended by a great risk. There is still some risk, but it is being reduced every discover the most suitable temperatures at which to store fruit, and the best way of transporting it so that it will retain its freshness and flavour. Great advances have been made recently in England in the storage of fruit, with the result that the consumption of fruit in that country has increased by 26 lb. a head during the last five years. A,s the result of scientific research in connection not only with the growing of fruit, but also with its preservation, considerable savings have been made by fruit-growers. In my opinion, a large sum of money should be set aside by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research for research into the causes and the prevention of contagious abortion in cows. At present many thousands of cows suffering from this disease have to be slaughtered. The disease is prevalent, not only in Australia, but also in many other",35,Casey

I emphasize that, fro m by the great standards laboratory of now on, expenditure by the council will, Great Britain, the expense would be imin tbe ordinary course of things, increase measurably greater than it w ill be if we very rapidly, particularly capital extake advantage of that link. with honourable members who have ing the proposals of the Government, stated that the need for the esta'bment of a standards laboratory in for the expenditure of £250,000 for estabAustralia is a very pressing one.

It will enable Australia to compete more successfully than has been possible in the past, with manufacturers in other parte of the world. In On examining the expenditure of the CouncilI agree penditure. One can see that by examinunder this bill alone. The bill provides",36,Casey
101,Mr John Lawson (Macquarie) Properly To Safeguard The Lives And Well,"The whole trend of industrial development goes to show that expenditure upon research into the problems of secondary industries will increase from now on very rapidly and steeply, particularly if Australia is to advance industrially, as we hope it will, during the next few decades. I wish to cast no reflection on private industry when I say that, having regard to the tremendous benefits conferred upon it by the work of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, private industry has not contributed, as it ought to have done, to the expenditure of that body. I take advantage of this opportunity to appeal to those secondary industries of the Commonwealth which will benefit as the result of the expenditure proposed under this measure to generously to scientific research work in the future than they have in the past. I think it can be truthfully said that the secondary industries of Australia, are enjoying at the present time, if not a boom period, then something very closely akin to a boom. One has only to examine the balance-sheets of certain industries to see that that is so. I believe that the balance-sheet of one concern discloses that it made a profit of approximately £1,000,000 in one year, representing more than SO per eent. on its paid-up capital. sheets show regular profits of over 20 per cent! When big industries in the Commonwealth are in such a healthy financial position, it should not he necessary for the Government to bring down a measure to appropriate £250,000 for the purposes set out in the bill now before the House. Industry which will undoubtedly derive such tremendous benefit from tbe work of these laboratories could very well afford to find the whole of the money necessary for their establishment. We find, in other parts of the world, that private industry has endowed research work very richly indeed. .Imperial Chemical Industries Limited, in Great Britain, boasts-and I see no reason for assuming that it is an idle boast-that in respect of the problem of the extraction of oil from coal alone it has expended £1,000,000 in research work. Both the United Dairies and the Mr John LaAoxnu. General Electric Company in Great Britain have remarkably well equipped research laboratories entirely supported out of their own financial resources. In Germany, the leading dye and chemical industry research laboratories are entirely conducted with the aid of privately subscribed money. The United States Bureau of Standards is certainly richly endowed by the government of the United States of America, but here again we find that its income from private sources totals £200,000 per annuma very substantial sum, though perhaps not so large as it ought to be in the circumstances. I appeal to private industry, which has benefited so much in Australia' from the protection this Parliament has afforded it, and whicli to-day throughout the contribute more liberally and length and breadth of the Commonwealth is enjoying a period of prosperity, to come forward and liberally assist the Commonwealth Government to provide these laboratories which will ultimately bring rich benefits, not only to industry itself, but also to the Australian people as a wholo. [3.27] I join with the right honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scu'llin) and other honourable members who have supported this measure in congratulating Other balancethe Government on its decision to continue to allocate sums of money for the research work undertaken by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. I believe that, having regard to the benefits which the council has conferred on industry generally during the last two decades, it is one of the finest branches of the Public Service in Australia'. In discussing a measure such as that now before the House, one cannot help contemplating what must be regarded as one of the greatest romances in our generation. I refer to the romance of the application of science to industry generally all over the world. Within the short space of two decades, scientists, who formerly confined their attention to a study of the zodiac, have turned their attention and applied their scientific knowledge to tbe betterment of industry in the interests of the more economical production of commodities of every description. I , like every other",37,Casey
102,Mr Holloway (Melbourne Ports),"decent Australian citizen, am glad that Lhc Government is helping in this way to make this country more technical, more efficient, more scientinc, and as tbe result, are of the finest quality, and, in order to more self-contained; and I , personally, and the whole of the members of tbe Opposition, will always vote for a measure of the character of that now before the House; but I cannot help pointing out that scientific work in industry almost invariably results in the displacement of labour. Unless, side by side-with scientific development of industry, arrangements are made for the rehabilitation of human labour displaced as the result of greater efficiency, the whole objective of the scientific -development of industry will fall to the ground. The Taylor Society, in the United States of America, another group in that country known as technocrats, the British group led by Lord Hugo Hirst, and other groups in Sweden and Czechoslovakia have been trying for the last ten years to evolve formulas-to enable them to make greater strides, by rationalization, standardization and other means, in reducing the cost of production, and at the same time re-absorbing the human labour displaced by every forward step taken in the mechanization of industry. WhilstI recognize the efficiency and ability of Sir David Rivett and his staff, who, I think, are as capable as any similar group of men in the world, and whilst we all desire Australia to be placed as nearly as possible on a level with its industrial competitors, the Government should take a broad outlook, and should endeavour to meet the rapid changes in methods of manufacture with plans to balance the industrial ledger. If the advantages gained by industrial development; with the aid of scientific discoveries are outweighed by the evils which are inevitably brought in its train, then all our progress will be in vain. The purpose of good government is to overcome these difficulties. I do not imagine that the Treasurer ( Mr Casey) will consider that good government means adding to the advantages of the great capitalist groups by enabling them to produce more cheaply than in the past without giving corresponding benefits to the rest of the community. At the present time, the coal mining industry of Australia is deteriorating, although it formerly exported coal to Vancouver on a profitable basis. The seams of coal to be found in this country enable the industry to be carried on profitably, tbe latest scientific devices have been introduced, with the result that one-third of the men who have been employed in this industry for five or six generations now find, themselves out of work. A critical period has been reached in the history of one of our basic industries, because of the application of scientific discovery to it. I am sure that men employed in the industry recognize the necessity for the employment of tbe latest industrial machinery, but they expect this Parliament so to regulate their working conditions that they will not be crucified in the process. By good government it should be possible to solve this problem as well as others. Recognition of the importance of solving them is the cornerstone of the International Labour Office. It was stated by Albert Thomas at the Peace Conference at Washington, that the world could not get peace unless all sections of the peoples of the world strove to bring about social justice. The dangers to which attention has been directed did not arise so much, if at all, when scientific efforts-were directed to the application of scientific discovery to primary industries; but, owing to the enormous advantages which scientific developments have given to secondary industries, less human' labour will be required each year, with the result that the hours of labour will have to be l educed, and the spending power of the people increased, to enable them to absorb tbe products of industry. I congratulate the Treasurer upon the introduction of this bill, for I have great admiration for the work of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. I hope that the bill will be the forerunner of similar measures, and I trust that the benefits accruing from the application of science to industry will be shared by the people generally. I keenly appreciate the most interesting speech delivered by the right honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin), who paid a well-deserved tribute to the work",38,Casey
103,Mr Fairbairn (Flinders) [8.88],"done by tbe Council for Scientinc and In tion, he provides the council with valudustrial Research. I am pleased to know that the right honourable gentleman has been so fully restored to health that he can once again participate in the debates in this chamber, ancl even take a leading part in them. I hope that, by the extension of the activities of the council, secondary industries will receive benefits comparable to those already obtained by primary industries. We are apt to refer to the great successes of the council, such research work to a greater extent than as its spectacular victory in overcoming the prickly pear menace in the northern parts of Australia; but I think that an important part of its work, which is often overlooked, is that done in collecting information concerning research in other parts of the world, ancl disseminating it amongst those who require it throughout Australia, The average farmer discusses bis problems witb his neighbours, and often adopts remedies recommended by them. preparations which are described as certain cures, ancl, whilst some of these are useful, others are often valueless. If the of it. I assure him that the primary prowork of the council were given greater publicity, the farmers could be saved much needless expenditure. Every man engaged in farming operations should receive the excellent bulletins issued from time to time by the council. Although many farmers are already using these publications as their chief guide, many others are still unaware of this valuable source of advice and reference. value of these publications should be made known generally by the Government, the press, all organizations of producers and industrial leaders. The honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr John Lawson) has pointed out that it is not wise to leave the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, which is subsidized by the Government, to carry on all the research work, but that private industry should co-operate with it. In Victoria, the graziers employ, at their own expense, a research officer who works under the direction of tbe council, and occupies his time primarily with the problems of his district. In this way he carries out valuable research work, and disseminates throughout his own district the results of his own discoveries, as well for the eradication of rabbits. I am as those made by the council. In addiMr Fairbairn. able data. This system should be extended to all industries throughout Australia. This is essential, if both primary and secondary industries are to be established on an efficient basis. It is unlikely that the council will be able to do for the secondary industries what it has done, and will do, for the primary industries. The secondary industries are more centralized, and can carry on their own oan the primary industries, because the former are nearer to the main sources of information. Nevertheless, if the council can do only one-tenth of the good for the secondary industries that it has already done for the farming community, the public will receive good value for their money under this legislation. pleased that the Government has introCommercial travellers sell duced this bill. I heartily congratulate tbe right honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) upon his speech in support ducers of Australia will welcome assistance of this description, for they are well aware of the need to apply scientific methods to secondary, as well as primary, industries. As the honourable member for Flinders( Mr Fairbairn) has said, the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research has done wonderful work. This country owes a great deal, not only to Mr S. M . Bruce for having introduced The the measure to establish the council, but also to Sir George Julius, the chairman of it, and a first-class electrical engineer, ancl Sir David Rivett, the world-famous scientist, who have done so much, to organize its activities on business-like principles. The council, through its various agencies, has done remarkably fine work in connection with fisheries investigations, soil drift, afforestation, export industries and pest eradication. We all greatly appreciate the capable management of these various activities, and value the highly useful information that has been imparted to our people. Reference has been made to the success of the council's investigations into the eradication of the prickly pear, and also to the endeavours being made to discover a virus hopeful that the information that has",39,Casey
104,Mr Gregory (Swan) [3.45],"I ambeen made available in this connection will be supplemented by a definite declaration, in tbe not distant future, that complete success may be expected from ihe release of an effective virus. Tbe development of Western Australia bas been greatly handicapped by the depredations of tbe rabbit. Unfortunately, an apparently ill-founded newspaper report led to a rumour in Western Australia that tbe investigations of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research in this connection had proved abortive. I was able to give an assurance that this was not so; but I hope that i u the near future an authoritative statement ou the whole subject will be made by the Treasurer ( Mr Casey) and that it w ill be possible to include in it a definite declaration that the virus may be expected to be entirely effective. In view of the remarks made by some honourable gentlemen in the course of this a statement will very shortly be made debate, I wish to say emphatically that in connection with the release of the virus tlie strength of the Council for Scientific for the destruction of rabbits. and Industrial Research is due, in no small degree, to the fact, that it is-entirely congratulate the Government upon havbeyond political influence.

The right honourable member for Yarra w i ll well remember that several bits were exported from Compton.

I mention this, in passing, to indicate how political pressure may affect such matters. I am sure that primary producers generally will welcome the extension of the activities of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research to secondary industries, the more effective organization of which w ill undoubtedly lead to the manufacture of less costly machinery and materials for use in primary production. In conclusion, I repeat the hope that vities of the Council for Scientific and to the development of beneficial to primary industries, I believe Years ago hundreds of thousands of crates of rab-",40,Casey

Undoubtedly our secondary industries are in urgent need of assistance in connection with scientific testing and research activities which offer a great field of service. As it is essential to the true progress of Australia that secondary industries should be developed side by side with primary industries-for this country cannot be permanently prosperous if its production is confined to wool, wheat and other primary products from the landI consider that the move now being made is laudable in every respect. If the intenmy hope that it will not be long before tions of this bill are fully carried out nothing but a useful purpose will be served. Australia needs a. national standards laboratory. It is regrettable that the standards of weights and measures in the various States are not uniform. That condition of affairs should be remedied without delay, ancl the machinery to be established under the provisions of this bill should contribute to that desirable end. I trust that while we are training young men to engage in standardization ancl testing services, we shall not lose sight of the necessity to provide them with work when their period of training is completed.* Some years ago we trained a considerablenumber of forestei'3 but did not assure them of permanent employment upon the completion of their period of study. We should take care to avoid that error in this connection. The report of tbe Secondary Industries Testing and Research Committee stated that the survey had yielded an astonishing volume ancl variety of problems, ancl had clearly demonstrated the disabilities of the Australian manufacturer, who was without the assistance of a national research service, ancl was geographically isolated from the great research organizations elsewhere. We can be assured from that report that we need to train men in. this country to supply a national research service to Australian manufacturers. Australia needs secondary industries, but they must be successful. hope that the time will come when we shall be able to compete in. oversea markets with other countries. In order to maintain the high standard of living ilr. Price. of the Australian people, we must use up4o-date methods in industry. We"" must look to the secondary industries more than to the primary industries to absorb the people in employment, and in order to ensure that the secondary industries will be able to take the greatest possible numbers of employees, who should do everything possible to encourage research which will develop those industries. {Quorum formed.'] A great field of secondary industry is to be covered by this bill. First of all, there, is the all important manufacture of aircraft and automobiles. Although many honourable members clo not agree with me it is we shall be manufacturing our own motor cars, and I trust that the Research 'Committee will be able to give some assistance to that project. I had intended to elaborate on each of tbe industries which I think need research service, but as honourable members seem anxious to. bring this sitting to a close. I shall content myself with u bare reference to them. In addition to the two industries which I have just cited, industries which need up-to-date methods are those concerned with the manufacture of electrical appliances, drugs and chemicals, varnish, rubber, leather, textiles, and probably the most important of all from the point of view of the physical well-being of tbe people, foodstuffs. Modern engineering also needs the greatest possible technical assistance. Order!

I wish to reply to a few of the matters raised in this debate. One matter concerned the number of Australians whose services are utilized by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. Ninety-five per cent, of the employees of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research are Australians. There is a very small sprinkling of employees from overseas, mainly scientists who are specialists in the subjects on which they are engaged, and in every case the man from overseas has Avorking with him, and trying to pick his brains, a young Australian. The Commonwealth Government, a year or two ago, made £30,000 available to the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research specifically for tbe training of young Australian scientists who would be available to the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research and Australian industry. This bill will be rounded off in a Territory ( Mr Blain) referred to the relatively short space of time by a weights need for a uniform sea-level datum.

I would to fit in with the standards laboratory that will be erected in Sydney. The honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr John Lawson) referred to the amount of the contribution to be made towards the cost of research under this bill by the industries concerned. I do not feel that the ratio between the Commonwealth's contributions and tbe contributions of the industries is inequitable to the 'Commonwealth, but I shall be doing a great deal personally in order to increase the amounts of money paid to the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research fund by private industry. I have given directions that, where research work is carried out merely for a minority or a small group, the whole of the cost of the work shall be borne by those for whom it is done. People in industry are playing up very well to this proposal. I have no information concerning the matter of flame-proofness mentioned by the honourable member for Macquarie, but it is a reasonable suggestion that I shall place before the appropriate authorities.

I suggest that when the Federal Aid Roads Agreement is being renewed no mention be made of the i d . a gallon for other than road construction purposes. would still be allocated to the States for roads, but some means should be devised for making a refund to taxpayers who do not use the roads. On a previous occasion I raised this matter with the Minister by way of a question in the House, and lie informed me that when some suitable means were devised of giving effect to my proposal he would consider it. I understand that a system is in operation in New Zealand whereby a person who is entitled to a refund of tax may make application through the post office. He is required to fill in a form describing the engine in which the petrol is used, the number of hours it runs, its size, etc., ancl whether he uses any other petroldriven engine. I understand that the system works fairly successfully in New Zealand, and. I see no reason why it should not be introduced here. The authorities should study the New Zealand act with a view to introducing a similar measure in this country. Severe penalties could be imposed for any abuse of the provision. [4.33] -As I had not an opportunity to do so on the third reading of the Scientific and Industrial Research Appropriation Bill, ' I desire now to add one or two observations which I omitted from my speech on the second reading of that bill. representations regarding the establishment of a standard of length, the Treasurer ( Mr Casey), was good enough to state that the Commonwealth proposed to introduce legislation for the setting up of uniform standards of weights and measures, including a standard of length. It is necessary that this standard of length be established in a place which, for all time, will remain undisturbed, and the natural and proper place for it, of course, is in Canberra. I suggest that the Government should confer with the Director of Commonwealth Surveys in Canberra regarding a suitable spot. I do not know enough about the territory to suggest a place myself, but perhaps a site might be selected near the War Memorial. The standard should be accommodated in a well-protected place, preferably in a tunnel, to guard against variations of temperature. The most suitable length would be five chains, and after the standThe threepence ard had been established in Canberra, tbe apparatus could be lent for the setting up of a duplicate standard at the laboratory in Sydney. For that standard, the same high degree of precision would not be as necessary as in a national standard, and there would not be the same need to ensure that it should remain completely undisturbed in perpetuity. There are in Canberra survey officers possessing the necessary qualifications for carrying out this precise work, and I suggest they sliould be entrusted with it. The fact that a standard is to be established suggests, of course, that it is to be used, and the obvious way in which to use it is in the carrying out of a precise geodetic and topographical survey of the continent. Therefore, part of the money which it is proposed to appropriate should be used for the beginning of such a survey, which has been already delayed too long. I suggest to the Treasurer that such a survey is closely associated with the setting up of a standard; the one cannot be isolated from the other. Surveying is a. matter of ever-increasing importance, and is related to tbe science of astronomy. The reason that astronomers have not occupied a position of prominence recently is that there has been no inducement for them In answer to my to offer their services. I also desire to make a plea on behalf of our technical men, who should be given a greater administrative authority under",46,Monwealth Bank And Brokers Firms

148,Mr Scholfield,I quite realize,47,Monwealth Bank And Brokers Firms
149,Mr Blain (Northern Territory),"fhe Government, At the present time, they are denied this authority, particularly in the north, where so many technical problems await solution. As Professor Soddy has said, there is a reluctance to extend to technical officers administrative Government to give some consideraauthority. The Treasurer is a technical man himself, and he will agree with me that technical men have demonstrated their ability to carry out administrative work. I appeal, therefore, to the Treasurer, as the only technical man in the Cabinet, and oiic of the few in the House, to see that his fellow technicians are given a greater share of administrative authority in the future. desire to renew the request which I made last year, and on many previous occasions, that relief from petrol tax should be afforded to those persons who are to-day paying 7£d. a gallon tax on petrol that is not used in road vehicles. I refer to fishermen, and motor boat users generally, and to primary producers who use stationary engines or tractors on their farms. As long ago as 1925, a proposal was brought forward to exempt such persons entirely from'the payment of petrol tax, that is, to the extent of 2£d., being the amount which is specially collected for road construction purposes and when the Bruce-Page Government was in power a promise was given that legislation would be introduced for this purpose, but it was found impossible to devise a fool-proof scheme in order to avoid fraud or improper claims for refunds. The Opposition at that time promised that when it came into power it would give this relief. However, when it was in power for two and a half years nothing was done, though I remember, as a member of the then Opposition, on many occasions asking that such action be taken. member of a previous government this matter received consideration, and Senator Massy-Greene, the then Acting Treasurer, who was visiting New Zealand on trade matters, was asked to investigate the system in operation there. However, even after this it was not found possible to devise a system to give the relief sought. I do not think that the problem is insoluble. For over ten years persons who paid tax on petrol used in non-road-using engines obtained no benefit whatever from the tax they paid. When the Federal Roads Agreement was renewed recently many honourable members joined with me in urging the tion to the non-road-using taxpayers, even if it were impossible to exempt them from the payment of tax. Ultimately the Treasurer made available a special grant of £600,000 a year for ten years to be divided among the States on a population and area basis, and to be used mainly for the provision of havens harbours, shelters, channelling, beacon lights, &c, for the benefit of motor boat users. Prior to the introduction of the amending Federal Aid Roads Agreement Bill, some form of agreement had already been arrived at between the Treasurer and the Premiers of the various States concerning the manner in which the extra £600,000 was to be expended. When the bill was brought down, this House objected to that proposal and insisted on amending the agreement to provide for the establishment of a fund of £600,000 to bo applied by the States for the purposes I have outlined. The agreement was altered to read "" purpose associated with transport "". This was considered the best way to express in the agreement the wishes of the House. From inquiries I have made, however, I am able to say that the States have displayed no real genuine desire to use the money for the purpose intended, and that very little, if any, of it has been spent in the desired direction. I ask the Treasurer if he will obtain a return from each of the State's of the Commonwealth showing how its proportion of the special grant of £600,000 has been expended? Owing to constitutional limitations the Commonwealth is unable directly to apply that money for the purposes for which it was When I was a made available, but must rely on the States to carry out its wishes. I hope that the Treasurer will be able to make -a statement to the House at an early date furnishing a return from the States in regard to this veiy important matter. Some time ago a bill was introduced into this House to provide for £12,000,000 for the States for rural, debt adjustment but owing to the failure of the Commonwealth to make the necessary money",47,Monwealth Bank And Brokers Firms
150,Mr Francis (Moreton) [4.40],I,48,Monwealth Bank And Brokers Firms
151,^ Mr Wilson (Wimmera) [4.48],"available, the States have been placed in a very invidious position. I am not conversant w i th the procedure in the other States, but I know that the Debt Adjustment Boardi n Victoria is finding itself seriously hampered and is in grave difficulties because of the inability of the State government to honour its undertakings in respect of debt adjustment made as the result of the promise of the Commonwealth Government that it would provide a certain amount for that purpose. A few weeks ago a large meeting of business men in Victoria appointed representatives to approach the board and the Victorian Government to press that rhis matter, which was causing serious concern to creditors because settlement of compositions could not be made, should be brought prominently under notice. When tbe Loan (Farmers' Debt Adjustment) B ill was introduced by the Minister for Commerce (i Sir Earle Page) into this House the right honourable gentleman saidThe total sum to bo made available by tlic taken to correct the position. Commonwealth Government is £12,000,000. It is anticipated that the total amount of £12,000,000 wil l be disbursed within three or I take this opportunity to support, the four years. It is estimated that the disburseremarks of the honourable members for ment will amount to from £1,500,000 to Wannon( Mr Scholfield) ancl Moreton £2,000,000 iu the first year, and probably £4,000,000 in the second year when the machinery has been more or less perfected. After the bill was passed, the Debt the petrol tax which normally goes to Adjustment Boardi n Victoria held meetroads. I have particularly in -mind the ings of creditors and arranged composiclaim of fishermen to such refunds. tions which were considered satisfactory When this question has been brought hy both farmers and creditors.

Whatever hard to believe that the ingenuity of may be done at this juncture, I consider the Customs Department is not sufficiently that, in order to facilitate the completion great, to enable it to devise a method by of these undertakings, it, would be a which refunds of the petrol tax could bo g'ood thing if each year the Commonmade to those who use petrol for other wealth made a definite allocation of a than road purposes. I do not think it certain amount of money to the States would be reasonable to refund that part to be made available to their respective of the tax which normally goes into Conboards, .so that they would know exactlysolidated Revenue; but It h i nk there is where they stood. If that were done, logical argument in favour of the refundthey would be able to enter into undering of that part of the tax which takings which should be satisfactory to is devoted to roads to those who creditors. As honourable members arc use petrol for purposes other than aware, the Commonwealth Government road transport. It has been suggested has taken up the attitude that the prothat patrol used for fishing boats should vision of moneys to be made available for rural debt adjustment is contingent upon the unanimous approval of the Loan Council. That was not stipulated in the first instance when tbe Commonwealth proposed to provide £12,000,000 for the purpose outlined. I trust that the Government will do its best to rectify the unfortunate position which has arisen. In 1935-36, the first"" year in which the scheme was to operate, the amounts approved for debt adjustment totalled £317,000. In 1936-37, the amounts approved by the State governments totalled £2,750,000, but only £1,500,000 was made available by the Commonwealth. The figures for the year 1937-3S are not complete, but I understand that, although £2,500,000 has been approved by the Commonwealth to meet the commitments of the States, the latter require approximately £3,900,000. I hope that the Government will see the justice of the claim for an early settlement of this matter, and that immediate steps will be ( Mr Francis) with reference to refunds to those users of petrol for purposes other than road transport of that portion of",48,Monwealth Bank And Brokers Firms

In my opinion, if the Customs Department is anxious to find a method of overcoming the difficulty, it is not beyond its capacity to do so. I trust that the Treasurer ( Mr Casey) will deal with the points raised by the lionorable member for Wimmera( Mr Wilson). points in respect of which I should like some confirmation. Isi t not the case that the States this year asked for £3,800,000 for farmers' debt relief; that tlie 'Commonwealth Government indicated its willingness to provide £3,800,000; that requires that money to be provided out of loan; and also that the Commonwealth at the Loan Council meeting, in asserting its willingness to provide the whole amount asked for by the States, indicated that this would necessitate the States being satisfied with a somewhat lesser amount for works? for 1937-38, the Loan Council decided that some of the telephonists would rather that £16,000,000 was the largest amount remain in the employ of the Department that could be raised without unduly pushunti l they attain the age of twenty years ing up rates of interest, and that if the than leave at the age of eighteen years.

The reference to this impost as a road tax is based on a misconception.

A t any rate, this is a revenue tax, and this is hardly the time to talk of reduction of taxation, when we have the prospect of increased taxation, generally, because of our much' increased obligations with regard to defence and national insurance. I shall not repeat arguments of which honourable gentlemen are well aware. This tax occasions considerable administrative difficulties, but tbe main point is that it is not a road tax, as far as it relates to federal taxation. The persons whom the honourable members to whom I have referred desire to shield from the incidence of this tax contribute very little, if anything, to the revenues of the Commonwealth by way of direct taxation. I suppose that the petrol tax is practically the only federal impost they have to bear, except a small amount of sales tax, for they have been relieved of practically the whole of the incidence of the sales tax. should be relieved only of that portion of the petrol tax which goes towards the cost of roads. lead me into looking up the whole history of the matter. happens to be devoted to roads, because the Commonwealth Government desired a method of determining what was a f a i r sum. of money to give to the States for roads. I shall do my best to obtain the return of which the honourable member for Moreton spoke. The standard of length, to which the honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Blain) referred, is one of the foremost matters that w ill be dealt with by the standards laboratory to be established under the bill discussed this afternoon. The remainder of the honourable member's observations w ill be given serious consideration, and to some of them. I shall direct the attention of the The honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Wilson) discussed the question of rural debt adjustment. Much misconception has arisen in regard to this matter, particularly in the mind of the Premier of Victoria. I believe that it is quite true that the Minister for Commerce( SirI should have to look Earle Page), who is now abroad, made the statement attributed to h i m that it might be anticipated that £10,000,000 or £12,000,000 would be made available in the course of the following three or four years. [Quorum formed.] It was well known that this money had to come out of the fund raised by the Loan Council, and the sum to be made available to the States for rural debt adjustment has been discussed ever since at the meetings of the Loan Council. The representatives of the States at those meetings have largely been able to determine the sums required for this purpose, bearing in mind the -fact that, as the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Paterson) has pointed out, all this money comes out of a common pool. Therefore, the Premier of Victoria, in particular, might well have made the simple calculation necessary to show how much loan money would he available to h im for the purpose of rural debt adjustment. Victoria, in particular, which has had by fa r the greatest proportionate share of rural debt money, has gone ahead rapidly with the settlement of claims and the provision of the machinery to deal with them. All of the other States have estimated the amount of money that may be made available to them, but have not proceeded The 2£d. a gallon to settle claims on such a large scale as has Victoria. been anxious to secure more money than has been made available to it .",50,Monwealth Bank And Brokers Firms

Victoria has had a far greater proportion of the total of £12,000,000 than has any other State, and it now finds itself in difficulties which are not experienced by the other States. I quite agree with the Leader of the Opposition that the State governments wou'ld like more money, and the Government is providing an additional £2,000,000 this year to even up the process of adjustment. Hitherto Victoria has gone ahead of all the other States. MT. BKENNAN -But it has been in the process of adjustment. not the fault of this Government. The State governments could have had any amounts they cared to ask for, bearing in mind only that they could not have it both ways. They knew they could have had money for rural debt adjustment, on which the Commonwealth Government would pay interest and sinking fund contributions; or that they could have had money for State works on which the governments concerned would pay interest and sinking fund contributions. Generally speaking, they preferred to have money for State works. therefore say that the Commonwealth Government cannot be blamed for the existing situation. member for Gippsland pointed out, the Commonwealth Government has practically retired from the loan market, except to provide rural debt adjustment money for the State govern-, ments. Although Commonwealth works estimated to cost between £7,000,000 and £8,000,000 have been put in hand this financial year, the cost of them is being provided out of revenue. I have stated on several occasions that the Commonwealth Government is maintaining its rates of taxation to an appreciable degree in order to carry out such works from revenue. This is being done so that the State governments may have the freest possible access to the loan market for their own purposes. That is briefly the position. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Holloway) referred to the position of certain telephonists employed in the Postmaster-General's Department. I shall bring his remarks under the notice of the Postmaster-General who will doubtless adequately reply to them. The honourable member'for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) asked me a question recently concerning the relations of the Commonwealth Bank with certain sharebroking firms in Sydney. The ordinary stock exchange activities of the Commonwealth Bank are spread over nineteen sharebroking firms in the various capital cities, six of which are located in Sydney. In addition to the ordinary business of the purchase and sale of bonds, the bank, in connection with its central banking functions, has to engage, from time to time, in transactions which also involve the purchase and sale of bonds. This business is restricted to a much more limited range of brokers, only about six firms being concerned in it. This course is necessary unless the bank is to be prejudiced in its operations through its affairs being disclosed to a wider circle of persons than is deemed desirable in the public interests The firm of Messrs. Sydney Evans and Company, mentioned by the honourable member for West Sydney, is held in high repute in Sydney. From time to time it has been employed by the Commonwealth Bank in both I capacities to which I havj^referred. It is true that one of the junior members of the firm is a son-in-law of the chairman As the honourable of the board of directors of the Commonwealth Bank, but it will be appreciated that the control and direction of administrative matters of the nature to which I am referring rests entirely with the board of directors and is not the prerogative of the chairman. -plan of rural debt adjustment, to which the Treasurer ( Mr Casey) has referred, is an essential feature of the Lyons' Government's policy and is designed to achieve two primary purposes for the Government. One of these is to take cognizance of the Wheat Commission's report and the tremendous problem which the debt structure of the primary producers of the Commonwealth presents, involving, as it does, high charges of interest and in other respect in connection with each year's production. Unless something had been done to reduce the indebtedness of",51,Monwealth Bank And Brokers Firms

The other purpose of the Government in promoting this plan arose out of its political necessity to do something to secure the support of the Country party. Obviously it was necessaiy, in the circumstances in which the Government found itself at one stage, to do something definite to solve that problem. Government undoubtedly faced a problem in relation to several electorates which returned Country party members to this Parliament. The Leader of the Country' capacity as Deputy Prime Minister, said, when dealing with this plan, that an amount of £12,000,000 would be made available for rural debt adjustment within a period of three or four years. expected to be made available. kind. His original proposition was that £20,000,000 should be provided for this purpose. That was when he spoke purely as Leader of the Country party. When he became Deputy Prime Minister he had ro prune the figure down to £12,000,000. it was pointed out during the passage of the legislation to implement this scheme that the need for action was urgent and imperative. The Government of Western Australia promptly appointed trustees to administer the fund within that State. It believed that within three years, or at the most within five years, the total amount to be provided for use in that State would have been made available and that the trustees would have been able to discharge tlieir whole duty in relation to it. What has happened? It is perfectly true that the Commonwealth Government has not been approaching the loan market except for money for rural debt adjustment, for it was fully conscious that had it done so, a radical contraction must liave been made in the ordinary employment programmes of the Sbate governments. Obviously, the State governments were not able either to reduce their provide full employment for a great numexpected .to find work, or economically to interrupt the completion of works which had been commenced. From either point of view the State governments would have found any great intrusion of the Commonwealth Government into .the loan field embarrassing. three or four years that the Commonwealth Government has withdrawn from the loan market that is, during the period that the rural debt adjustment The legislation has been in operation. that period; but now the Government is entering the field to obtain at least some of the money available to enable it to party ( Sir Earle Page), speaking in his discharge its promises to the Country party. Such action must distinctly embarrass the State governments in connection with their ordinary employment programmes. . The State governments did not prefer to pay interest upon money which they borrowed rather than allow the Commonwealth Government to borrow money without calling upon the States to pay interest. They went on the loan market because of their necessity to raise money to proceed with their works programmes. Apart from the necessity to provide for unemployment, the ordinary developmental services of the State governments had to be maintained. The right course for the Commonwealth Government to have taken in connection with its rural debt adjustment scheme would have been to spread the obligation over the whole community. Instead of doing so the Government chose to pass on a. heavy burden of debt to posterity, all its burdens. ence between the State governments borrowing for public works and the Commonwealth Government borrowing for rural debt adjustment is undoubtedly that, whereas the completion of the works programme of the State governments adds to the assets of the nation, the provision of rural debt adjustment money out of loan funds simply",52,Monwealth Bank And Brokers Firms

Treasurer has, at present, an acknowledged surplus of £4,000,000 some of which could have been devoted to rural debt adjustment. the Opposition suggest that the remainder should be found? surplus of £4,000,000 is available in this financial year. do with it. gentleman prefers to use this fortuitous surplus for some purpose other than providing for the welfare of the unemployed, or the farmers in respect of debt adjustment, or the wheat-growers in respect of a wheat bounty that is his business. We say that the Consolidated Revenue Eund could be drawn upon to some extent for those purposes, which would avoid adding to the debt burden of posterity, expenditure for defence and national insurance? gentleman sets aside £2,000,000 for national insurance, he could still hypothecate the remaining £2,000,000 for some other purpose. Opposition consider that these subjects can be considered in water-tight compartments ? brought down a budget which estimated a small credit balance. At the end of the financial year he finds the Government in possession of an unbudgeted surplus of £4,000,000. He, therefore, has some discretion in using that money. The plain fact is that he has exercised his discretion without having made a single shilling of the money available for the assistance of the wheat-growers. the obligations which rest upon the Government to complete its programme of rural debt adjustment, the honourable gentleman has decided to use the whole of the surplus of £4,000,000 for other purposes, and to borrow money for rural debt adjustment. the Opposition suggest that the money for rural debt adjustment should be obtained ? Treasurer is acting unfairly in obtaining the money for this purpose from the loan market, for by that means he is simply increasing the burden of posterity. A proportion of the surplus of £4,000,000 could have been used for rural debt adjustment, but the Government has chosen to use the whole of the money for some other purpose. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 5.28 p.m. The following answers to questions were circulated:honourable the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Forde) asked me a question, without notice, regarding the refusal of the Australian Broadcasting Commission to provide facilities for Archbishop Wand, of Brisbane, to broadcast from St. Barnabas's Church, Ithaca, on the occasion of the church's jubilee. As promised, I have had inquiries made in the matterTlie general manager, Australian Broadcasting Commis,sion, has advised that the granting of the request would entail a spec al : Treasurer opening of the station at 7 o'clock on Sunday morning. The normal broadcasting hours are from 6.30 n.m. to 11.30 p.m., on week days, and from 8 a.m. to 10.30 p.m. on Sundays, and the commission has found it necessary except in special instances to restrict the",53,Monwealth Bank And Brokers Firms

194,Mr Lyons,"On the 17th June, thegrunting of requests for broadcasting faciji* ties to within these hours. The commission considers that tlie present hour of opening on Sundays, viz., 8 a.m., is a reasonable one. Prior to the 3rd April, 1038, the opening time wus 0 ii.ni., and prior to Soptenibor, 1037, priated for this purpose in tlie current finannational stations were opened on Sundays at 10 a.m. The general malinger in pointing out that (.lie mailer of expense did not enter into tlie present case, ns mentioned in the honourable member's question, states that if the commission were to consent to the opening of one of the Brisbane stations at 7 a.m. on Sunday as requested, it would find itself in a difficult position if similar requests were made by other churches. He points out that Dr. Wuud himself frequently conducts services from tbe Cathedral and other churches which are broadcast by one or other of the commission's Brisbane stations. It was not considered, tlierefore, that the circumstances of the present request justified a departure from the established practice. Tlie Queensland iiutionnl stations broadcast a morning and evening church service every Sunday, and in addition special school services are included each Sunday afternoon. The general manager states that of these broadcasts the Church of England already has ii greater proportion than any other denomination. nard) asked the following questions, upon notico1.

Is money available, under the terms and conditions laid down under this act, to persons desiring to build homes in Canberra or other parts of Australia? -'). Does thu Government encourage public servants or private citizens to take advantage of building tlieir own homes, under this act, in the Federal Capital? The answers to the honourable member's questions arc ns follows:1. 127 houses were built in Canberra during the period 1927 to 1030 from funds made available under the Commonwealth Housing Act 1(127-1028. 2. Xo advances have been made under the powers conferred by the Commonwealtli Housing Act 1927-1028, since the financial year 1920-1030. As the Commonwealth would be required to provide its share of any such advances, the necessary funds would have lo be found from the Commonwealth's share of loan moneys available to the Loan Council, thereby depicting the limited finance available for ordinary loan programmes of the Commonwealth and the States. 3. It has been the practice for some years past to appropriate a sum annually for. the jmrposc of advances to residents of "" the Jforteral Capital Territory to enable them to build their own homes. The amount approcial year is £30,000. The whole of this amount will be expended.",54,Wireless Broadcasting Church Service At Ithaca
