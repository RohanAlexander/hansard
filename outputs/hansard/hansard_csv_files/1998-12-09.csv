Sitting suspended from 10.00 a.m. to 10.01 a.m. Address-in-Reply Debate resumed from 3 December, on motion by Mr Cameron Thompson: That the following address-in-reply to the speech of His Excellency the Governor General be agreed to. May it please Your Excellency: We, the House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Australia, in Parliament assembled, desire to express our loyalty to our Most Gracious Sovereign, and to thank Your Excellency for the speech which you have been pleased to address to Parliament. was one other speech to be completed in this address-in-reply debate before mine. I take pleasure in responding to the Governor General's speech on the opening of the 39th Parliament. I return to this parliament as the only Independent, after receiving a strong vote of support from the people of Cal are. Others have analysed the result in various terms, looking at the final two-candidate result from different angles, but all agree that the seat is now regarded as safe independent-whatever that means. That result was achieved on the back of hard work by a dedicated team, including Rod Bruem, Tim Payne, Susan Young, my sister Patricia in Lithgow, Dianne Abbott and the scores of volunteers who helped throughout the past 2Y2 years and during the recent campaign. As we know, the state of New South Wales is facing a redistribution next year, and I am ready for the cynical political submissions from the major parties designed to redistribute me out of existence. It would obviously suit the conservative side of politics to try to shift Calare's boundaries away from the traditionally Labor supporting Lithgow area, as it would be in Labor's interest to try to move Lithgow into the seat of Macquarie to the east to try to break my hold on the former Labor vote. Any analysis of the Calare result will show that I have won support from all sides of traditional politics, not because I pretend to be all things to all people but because I believe I have identified the issues impacting on regional and rural Australia and particularly on my area. Because of the truncated GST debate I intend to detail my strong opposition to that tax package in a moment, but first I want to address some of the other issues on which I campaigned that were strongly supported by the people in Calare. I continued my stand against any sell-off of Telstra. My office has become a lightning rod for complaints against the service provided by Telstra.

381,Mr Andren (Calare) (10.01 A.m.),"I apologise profusely for my lateness. I thought there1770 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 9 December 1998 telephony infrastructure in this country. We only have to look at today's ACA report showing a continuing decline in the speed of fixing phone faults to realise we still have a major problem in service delivery out there. Internet access is at best patchy, and people in regional Australia just do not accept the argument that government can and will regulate community service obligations when Telstra is privatised. Apart from that, most Australians, particularly those in the bush, have a strong emotional attachment to the former PMG, Telecom and now Telstra, as they do to Australia Post, and they want to remain shareholders, not by paying for them again but by retaining the ownership of these national assets vested in all Australians by dint of generations of taxpayer investment. Like millions of Australians, I am very cranky that the silverware has been stolen off the shelf, flogged at the pawnshop and part of the money used to pay off debts I had nothing to do with. Especially angry am I when I think of the increasing value of that asset and how it could have been there to improve the lot of my children. In supporting the need for fiscal responsibility, I also say here that there needs to be a greater emphasis on social economics. We cannot afford the social cost of filling in budget black holes by hurting those most in need. The solution lies in an honest tax based broadening. We cannot, as this government did, cut deeply into labour market programs when we have no solution to the unemployment question. We should not blame the unemployed for their situation. The obligation is not so much mutual as ours to create ways of generating meaningful occupation. Workfor the Dole is a poorly named program that could offer more if it included a training component, and perhaps, in the case of our farm sector, provide much needed assistance to farm families who have no other way of affording labour but who desperately need it. We cannot brag about our economic performance when it comes on the back of cuts to our welfare net, education, health and research and development. We must not ask, 'What is the cost of doing something?' but, 'What is the cost of not doing something?' The Prime Minister, whom I congratulate on winning the October election, is predictably arguing that the government now has a mandate, when in opposition 11 years ago he took just as predictable a line by saying that the mandate view of politics has always been an absolute phoney. 'Is this a core or a non-core belief?' I ask. I, too, have a mandate for my own electorate and, as a legislator,' I will argue the case that I believe the majority of my electorate support, whether it be coalition policy or not. I support, as do the very many in my electorate, a philosophy of user who can pay. I argued that case through the public relations debacle of the aged care legislation of this government's first term, because I believed it was right, not because I supported the way it was implemented. With a university town in my electorate, I supported the philosophy of increased HECS charges, but not the cutbacks in funding to TAPE or universities. I supported the common youth allowance, particularly for the opportunities it gave to students leaving country areas to study away from home. But I must say that I am now concerned at some of the impacts on young people forced to stay on at school or forced to come home-from where there is a chance of a job to where there are no chances. The vast majority of Australians will pay their own way, but, in withdrawing funds from areas of acute need, such as the delivery of Centrelink services, this government is not showing the warmer arid fuzzier side it allegedly hopes to develop in its second term. The government's Wednesday, 9 December 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1771 own senator, Senator John Watson from Tasmania, dared to suggest, 'We've got to be seen to have a heart, to have a social conscience,' but he was quickly silenced. There are issues this government needs to address in the months ahead that are concerning the electorate outside purely economic ones. Child support is one. The Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill 1998 is an entirely inadequate response to the problems the child support regime poses, especially the formulae used to ascertain payments. It is a half-hearted response to the major concerns of the Joint House report of 1994, and this issue will need to be revisited soon if we are to properly address the weaknesses in the current child support program and the potentially homicidal and suicidal anger out there. I look forward to a positive approach to the needs of rural Australia from the new Minister for Transport and Regional Services, though, I must say, judging on reports of talks last night on the Parkes IMC proposal, he has got a long way to go to catch up with the support that the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Mr Mark Vaile, is offering that project. I look forward to the contribution by his shadow spokesperson, the new member for Dickson, whom I welcome to this chamber as a person with a true social conscience. As the member for Bradfield said in this debate, the issues raised by One Nation go to the heart of the matters facing rural and regional Australia. Much of One Nation's rhetoric was insular and scapegoating, but it raised issues we must not believe have been swept away. One Nation did not just give us a punch on the nose, as one minister said. The sentiments are still out there and they have to be constantly addressed so that we do have genuine reconciliation with our native inhabitants, so that we properly explain the down and up sides of globalisation and so that we ease people out of inefficient industry and into new training. We must put aside short-term political aims to look for proposals that will serve this country well for decades ahead. To facilitate that, we must also examine the parliamentary term, and, in a bipartisan way, examine the need for a four-year term and a fixed term at that. To not embrace a fixed-term provision, allowing always for double dissolution on supply or other grounds, is not to reform anything. I will be seeking support for a serious debate on this issue during the life of this parliament, as I will for a serious examination of the parliamentary superannuation scheme, which is way outside the ballpark of community expectation. I now want to move on to the goods and service tax in more detail. If we are talking mandates, I have a mandate from my electorate to oppose this tax. I surveyed my electorate during the recent election campaign and found that 56 per cent rejected the GST. Asked if they would support a GST if food was exempt, 54 per cent said no. Asked if the proposed changes to income tax rates were fair, 66 per cent said no. Asked if the needs of low and fixed income earners had been properly considered, 68 per cent said no. The survey showed not only that a majority of people are opposed to the government's proposed tax changes but that even the many who support the package believe it to be unfair to fixed and low income earners. The government is right when it says that the bills are the most far-reaching tax reforms introduced into this parliament since Federation. But far-reaching does not mean visionary or progressive, it means far-reaching into the pockets of ordinary Australians. The GST is all about shifting tax from the well-off and big business, to the not well-off and small business. The tax is about taking the heat off corporations and those who continue to avoid tax responsibilities. It is about taxing those who have no discretionary spending and who have no means available to avoid tax. Those who would argue a goods and service tax will pick 1772 MAIN COMMITfEE Wednesday, 9 December 1998 up the high fliers and income tax avoiders are deceiving no-one. Professor Patricia Apps of Sydney University says it clearly: It is a matter of simple arithmetic to show that unless marginal rates at the top rise high income groups must gain overall. She goes on: A fundamental limitation of the reform is a shift to a flatter marginal tax rate schedule in the critical $38,000 to $75,000 range combined with no increase in the 47 per cent rate. Apps neatly sums up my basic argument that, to broaden the tax base, we must tax income that is now untaxed, either directly or indirectly. The focus of any reforms must be on measures which reduce non-compliance and the use of tax minimisation schemes. The proposed clampdown on trusts is not enough. In the 1995-96 financial year, while 73 per cent of Australians declared earnings of less than $35,000 and 90 per cent declared earnings of less than $50,000, only 571 Australians declared incomes in excess of $1 million. Of Australia's 200 richest people, 80 declared income of less than $20,000. Those 571 who did declare income over $1 million paid an average of only 20.7 per cent of their earnings in income tax because of tax minimisation measures such as dividend imputation. This was about the same as the average percentage paid by the ordinary battler of between $25,000 to $34,999, who paid an average of 20.8 per cent and considerably less than those on between $35,000 and $49,999 who paid 25 per cent. Then we have those true blue Aussies like Kerry Packer who paid just $25,000 tax instead of the $260 million-over three years-the Australian Tax Office believes he owes. His Australian companies can borrow money at high interest from a foreign company that he controls. The interest is tax deductible in Australia. The foreign company earns the interest as income and pays tax at the very low rates available in the tax shelters-in this case, the Bahamas and Virgin Islands. The foreign company then repatriates the money to the Australian company as capital. This is the tax avoidance of a person who wants to keep foreign hands, including Murdoch's, off any more of our media, yet can use these devices to avoid tax that, by any moral standards, should be paid here. It is not only the Packers. In another study conducted by the Australian Tax Office, 100 Australians were found to be avoiding tax to the tune of a combined $800 million per year through trusts. There is no doubt our tax system needs reform, but that reform should concentrate on a deliberate and determined assault on income tax avoidance. The government has indicated it will tax trusts at a company rate and so it should. But this will still not tax the money shifters like Packer, to whom· the government of the day-Labor or coalition-Qwes so much. There is no stomach for the kind of tax reform this country needs because it is unpalatable and politically risky. We know nothing from the government's GST bills about how the tax avoidance industry will be tackled. We are asked to trust the government to introduce reforms in the business area, when we know the truly necessary reforms to big business taxation are not even on the agenda. One of the members of the government's Small Business Consultative Committee, Angela Ryan, is a strong GST advocate and cites the New Zealand example as 'the envy of the world'. Well, the envy of the world is now officially in recession, as is every other country in the region with a GST. Ms Ryan based her assessment of the New Zealand GST on the need to Wednesday, 9 December 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1773 have broad bases so that, if you are taxing income or if you are taxing goods and services, you tax all income and all goods and services. The fatal flaw here is that we are in no way taxing all income. While many members on the government side point to the inexorable creep into higher tax brackets by ordinary wage earners in this country, they are only underlining the fact that the broad base of income taxing is not broad at all. That is because the middle and lower income earners are bearing the burden of income tax through PA YE, and they will continue to bear the burden under this' goods and services tax while high income earners and the burgeoning self-employed sector continue to avoid their responsibilities. If the OECD at the behest of the IMF can come up with a concept such as the Multilateral Agreement on Investment, then with our economies more and more globalised surely a tax reform program for the next millennium should investigate a multilateral agreement on taxation, a transnational global taxation system that ensured that full tax was paid on financial movements, transfer pricing and tax haven financial gymnastics. Even George Soros, the 'master of global financial markets', is calling for this type of approach. No; instead, we tum on those who have absolutely no discretionary spending, with a bottom-up rather than a topdown tax reform. That is why big business is so keen on this new tax system. According to Chris Evans and Michael Walpole in their Hidden cost of a GST: The international experience unequivocally points to the fact that the benefits of a GST will accrue to the largest finn, whilst those at the other end of the scale will endure disproportionately high compliance costs and few of the benefits. The impact of this tax on the less well-off has been well covered in debate on the bill. The fact is that the fixed income earners, the pensioners, will not be adequately compensated and that that compensation will not be indexed or applied indefinitely. The blanket four per cent pension adjustment makes no allowance, for instance, for higher costs of transport, heating costs and clothing costs in my cool-climate electorate. It makes no allowance for the 25 per cent spent on food by lower income earners as compared with the 12 per cent spent by higher earners. The ABS household expenditure survey shows expenditure per person on food, excluding discretionary restaurant meals, scarcely varies with income. Tax on food, according to John Quiggin of James Cook University, is effectively equivalent to a poll tax, the most regressive tax of all. According to Quiggin, a tax on food will bear four times more heavily on the poor than on the rich. A 10 per cent tax on food amounts to a 2.8 per cent tax on income for members of the lowest income households and only a 0.7 per cent tax for high income households. Claims that a food tax is not regressive do not stand up to examination. There are also concerns, particularly from local government, about the.impending transfer of responsibility for local government financial assistance to the states under these tax reforms. For local government, 13 November was Black Friday, when local government reps were turned away and told to go home, while the big boys sorted out their future share of tax revenue. At a time when we should be moving towards constitutional recognition of local government as the genuine third tier of government, this so-called tax reform gives the states almost total domination over local government. No wonder they are rubbing their hands. So much for reform! I must place on the record the government's willingness to listen to some of the arguments about the unfairness of the goods and services tax. It has wisely responded to some community 1774 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 9 December 1998 concerns and exempted all recognised education courses, op-shops and non-commercial welfare services from the tax. But it does not go far enough, as I have pointed out. My other great area of concern is the explanation process for these changes. Without a tax office in regional centres, will it be left to local members to explain the detail? Who will explain the impact of this tax to such community organisations as the Western Region Community Transport Forum, which are already faced with the impact of the GST through increased leasing fees for motor vehicles? Quite apart from the complexity of explaining this series of reforms-which lack any detail on trusts, for instance-the GST is a bottom-up, regressive tax on consumption of goods and services. It will impact on those least able to pay, with inadequate and unsustainable compensation, when top-down income tax reform is the only fair and progressive system that we should be contemplating. I will be supporting the opposition's amendments to this legislation. I hope the Senate inquiry process and the likely amendments in that place will deliver a package that has more substantial elements of equity and fairness-something which at the moment the bills certainly lack. a.m.)-I am privileged to be able to speak in the Main Committee. In my elevated position as the parliamentary secretary, I find that I have very limited speaking opportunities. In the 10 minutes that is remaining, I would like to speak on a couple of subjects. I acknowledge and thank the people of the electorate of Richmond for re-electing me on 3 October. I certainly trust that I can provide them with the best possible services and, indeed, good government in the next three years. The areas that I would like to cover are the recent changes to child support, some of the changing demographics in the Richmond electorate and, in particular, some of the recent economic developments that are happening now on a local level. I will specifically look at the port of Ballina and, if time allows, I will give my views particularly on the Private Health Insurance Bill, which is currently before the Senate. The election on 3 October did produce a mandate for the Fischer-Howard government to introduce major changes in the area of tax reform. It is to provide a workable tax system which is not based on a 1930s system but one which is relevant for the next century. It is a system that is relevant and it also reflects the changing work nature of the electorate, changing particularly from an area where the wholesale sales tax system was geared towards the primary and secondary sector to an area where our tertiary and service sector is now the major employment generator. Indeed, this is where most of the future for this country is. The new tax changes, in the original statement put out by the Prime Minister, particularly look at a mechanism to encourage savings, to encourage incentive, to· provide a fair and more equitable tax system, to actually start reducing the high levels of PAYE that we pay in this country. At the sallie time, the changes look to provide adequate compensation for those on low incomes or no incomes and, lastly, to provide a workable solution to have a constant income stream from the Commonwealth to the states. Indeed, the tax reform package that was placed before the Australian people was endorsed by them in the majority of seats. I can speak with some confidenctf in making that remark, as I campaigned on a variation of this package in 1993, when it was rejected by the Australian people, but it was endorsed in the 1996 election. I do hope that, despite the opportunism",125,Representatives Main Commitiee
382,Mr Anthony (Richmond,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Trade) (10.20Wednesday, 9 December 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1775 displayed by the Labor Party, particularly with the tax reform package, and most importantly in the Senate, the bill will be allowed to pass prior to the changeover to the new Senate. In the area of child support-and I note that the member for Forde is in the chamber-it gave me a great deal of satisfaction that the actual bill was passed through the Senate this week to ensure greater flexibility and equity, particularly for supporting children and for custodial and non-custodial parents. Whilst this is only a start, it is probably the most positive start that we have seen in the child support area for the last 10 years. A division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 10.24 a.m. to 10.41 a.m. recently went through. I notice in this Main Committee today a number of members who had a vested interest in this. I would certainly like to thank all those on the task force. I would like this legislation passed through the Senate, for a lot of it to be enacted on 1 January and for the rest of it to be enacted on 1 July. I would like to place on record my thanks to Chris Emson and all those associated with Dads Against Discrimination, particularly on the North Coast, those in Ballina and in Lismore and other parts; to George Watts and other members of the Kingscliff Men's Group who have had a very close interest in this; to Tweed Valley Family and Youth Support Services, and to the many individuals and families who have approached me with tales of hardship under the old child support arrangements. Indeed, in the e](-ctorate of Richmond, there are over 3,500 child support payers and nearly 4,200 payees. There are more than 3,800 lone parents, one of the highest levels in the country. So the reforms that came through underscore two basic principles: firstly, that children are the financial responsibility of their parents and, secondly, that the government should not seek to intrude unnecessarily into people's lives. Parents who subsequently have a family and pay child support from a previous relationship will now be assessed under the new income test rules f9r family allowance and child-care assistance from 1 January 1999. Other changes will come into effect on 1 July 1999. This will be the first time many families will be eligible for help such as family allowance and childcare assistance. Those who already receive assistance may qualify under an increased rate of payment. . Non-custodial parents will now be able to pay up to a quarter of their child support in kind-a very important initiative. This may include school fees and mortgage payments. This gives payers more control over their payments. Parents will now be able to deduct 50 per cent of their child support payments from their annual income used for family allowance purposes. This means more families will be eligible for family allowance and child-care assistance because they will not be. assessed at the lower rate of annual income. The parliament and coalition have certainly made a good start. I look forward to seeing more changes-let us hope of a bipartisan nature-in the years to come in a very sensitive area. It is a privilege that in my tenure so far in parliament a group of us have been able to achieve some reforms which will be of great benefit to those families. I would like to just conclude with some of the changes that have happened to demographics in the electorate of .Richmond in the last couple of years. On the north coast of New South Wales, the average household income level is around $29,000; in the seat of Richmond it is",130,Representatives Main Committee
383,Mr Anthonyi Was Mentioning Before Changes To The Child Support Legislation That,"1776 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 9 December 1998 significantly lower than that. That means we are $20,000 below the ACT and $30,000 below many parts of Sydney. This has created some of the problems that we have on the North Coast with quite high levels of unemployment. Indeed, the effective employment to population rate is around 44 per cent compared to figures of around 60 per cent in metropolitan areas. Nevertheless, it is certainly one of the best places .to live and that is causing part of the problems. People are voting with their feet and they are coming up to the North Coast, which is one of the fastest growing regions in the country. At the 1996 federal election I had around 81,000 constituents on the roll; 2Y2 years since then, at the 3 October poll, that figure had risen to 86,664-an increase of between 5,000 and 6,000 people-which does not include children or foreign residents. There is rapid growth principally because of population movements. I would like to note some of the local developments, particularly in the three shires of Tweed, Byron, and Ballina and Tweed Heads. There has been a recent development in the new main street in Tweed Heads where the council-and here I would like to acknowledge Rose Wright-has given it a freshness and a new image for the next century. It will be good for tourism and particularly good for attracting business from what you could call some of our more prosperous cousins across the border. There has been a large redevelopment program on Marine Parade in Kingscliff. This has been hugely successful with outside dining and has given the town an uplift and a new cosmopolitan feel which is particularly good for employment generation. I also note that there is concern about aircraft noise in Kingscliff. Aircraft have not been sticking to agreed flight paths and have been overflying the majority of the population in Kingscliff. That should not be happening and I do hope that in the near future that can be rectified. In Murwillumbah there is a new plan being developed now to upgrade the town. I hope that the conflicting interests come together to restore the town to its traditional colonial heritage as a way of making it competitive, particularly against the markets in Tweed Heads or perhaps the Gold Coast. The biggest project there will start next year. It is the Chinderah to Billinudgel motorway, a $220 million road which was a major coalition commitment in 1996. This follows on from the recently completed Bangalow bypass and Brunswick bypass which were done when the coalition was in government. Some other initiatives are quite exciting. In Tweed Heads there is a commitment for a hightech university campus-an extension of Southern Cross-and this will be a major benefit to that region. I acknowledge Southern Cross University's cellulose valley concept which is trying to develop into a world leader in researching, growing and manufacturing natural medicines, which I think will give it a very good advantage. Another important initiative will be to have more telephone call centres. I would like to acknowledge the recent Port of Ballina concept for which the area consultative committee recently gave $20,000 to commission a study. This is a very exciting project in that it is redeveloping the Ballina waterfront which has been its best natural asset. Most of the development of the town has actually been happening away from the river so that the river bank now is not in a prime condition at all. This particular plan, if it is endorsed by the community, by council, by indigenous groups and by land-holders-and there was a memorandum of understanding signed recently-ultimately could pump up to $75 million into the local economy and create up to 420 jobs. The historic port of Ballina is indeed a grand plan. I would like to acknowledge the work of Keith Davidson, the Mayor Alan Brown and Wednesday, 9 December 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1777 others in pushipg this project through. They have shown great community leadership in this area. Finally, as I have limited opportunities in my new capacity, I would iike to acknowledge the government's approach to private health insurance. I do note that Senator Mal Colston is showing encouraging signs that he might support a very worthy bill to introduce the 30 per cent rebate. It is particularly important on the North Coast because in the electorate of Richmond over 38,000 individuals have private health insurance and in the neighbouring electorate of Page it is 35,000. Giving this 30 per cent rebate will not only encourage people to stay in private health insurance but also hopefully encourage more people to go into private health insurance and ultimately free up beds in public hospitals which are in a chronic condition at the moment. In conclusion, I hope the main bill that the government has been endorsed on in the tax reform package will be passed next year. The coalition government is providing strong leadership and a strong vision for Australia into the next century. support so perhaps I could say a few words about that a little later. Firstly, in the address-in-reply debate, I want to inform the House that, following a successful walk for reconciliation in Penrith, one of my branch members, Al Svirskis, wanted to know what I and other local state members were going to do about reconciliation. It took some time to get our act together but, with enormous goodwill and assistance from the community, the Australians for Reconciliation Chifley Committee staged a walk and gathering for reconciliation last Saturday. I was enormously pleased at that event. The Governor General in his address to both houses talked about reconciliation and so I was very pleased that he was able to send a message. That message was read out by Kayla Hall, a young Aboriginal lass from my electorate, and I would like to read it into the Hansard. It says: I am very pleased to send this message of greetings and goodwill to all who are taking part in the Walk for Community Reconciliation through the suburb of Mt Droitt. This is an area where some of the largest numbers of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people live in metropolitan Sydney. Reconciliation is about people coming together; and the best way in which people of any community come together is by walking, talking and sharing the road together. I have long believed that the achievement of genuine reconciliation between the Australian nation as a whole and the indigenous peoples who constitute such an important part is of critical importance as we approach the second century of our Australian Federation. Until such reconciliation is achieved we are a diminished nation. Those of you taking part in the Walk for Community Reconciliation are taking some very important steps as individual Australians along the journey to reconciliation. You are also sending a powerful message of goodwill, tolerance, fairness and mutual respect that I hope will be taken up by communities everywhere. It is signed by Sir William Deane. Both Kayla Hall and Kylie Conn read the messages from other people-Gatjil Djerrkura, the Chairperson of ATSIC; Norma Ingram, CEO, NSW Aboriginal Land Council; and, of course, Evelyn Scott, Chairperson of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation. Linda Burney was our special guest of honour. She is the Chairperson of the New South Wales Council for Reconciliation. She gave a very inspiring speech.

I regret to say that I do not have a copy of her speech. I missed two of the meetings of the committee, and we had quite a few, I have got to say. At one of them, unbeknownst to me, they had suggested that I should also say a few words. Although these words do not stack up as well as Linda's, and were done in some haste, because we were still trying to get the cricketers off the playing fields and deal with a few other problems that we had on the morning, I would like to put them on the record. This is what I said: I am here to say a few words about what you have already acted out the walk and gathering for reconciliation. Actions always speak louder than words, your actions today are louder than my words. I want to say sorry I want to say it for me my family and my community. Some people have great difficulty in saying sorry or more importantly recognising why we would want to say sorry. But I want to say it for good and selfish reasons. We are today like a chain linked together as a community. Each link is vital and to be valued and esteemed and we are only as strong as our weakest link. We are on Darug land and clearly the people have been dispossessed, as others have been allover Australia. It was not some clever business transaction but it was brutal, dehumanising. Indeed some practises such as taking children from parents, systematically, generation after generation, continued to my time. We know it today as the stolen generations. These actions in the past have stained this great country, and that is what we need to come to grips with and atone for today. We cannot as individuals or as community achieve great things if we are not at peace with one another and ourselves. We are a land of many cultures and peoples but we are Australians all. In dealing with our past we are freed to then be truly better able to celebrate and to take great pride in the oldest surviving culture that of our Aboriginal peoples. In return for all that has been done I am saying sorry. We say sorry if we spill milk, or someone is sick or didn't do as well as they wanted to in some endeavour. Sorry is a small word, which we use often in every day life. To say sorry doesn't seem to me to be hard and I wonder if it is enough. To say sorry, it seems so little and in return the aboriginal peoples are offering forgiveness. It seems to me that forgiveness is the greater gift. Our walk and gathering today commits us to greater understanding to mutual respect and esteem and commits us to work together to overcome entrenched disadvantage. The feedback we have had from the walk has been all positive, but there are a number of organisations I would like to mention, and the list was reproduced on the official program, along with, by the way, an original painting on reconciliation by Danny Eastwood, one of our local esteemed Aboriginal artists. The organisations that I would like to briefly mention include Blacktown City Council, the Blacktown Sun, the Coca-Cola company-by the way, Pepsi, which has a very large warehouse on the border of my electorate, declined to participate-Drug Arm, Featherdale Wildlife Park, Holy Family Community, Mount Druitt Marketown, Mount Druitt Police, Mount Druitt SES, Mount DruittiSt Marys Standard, Mount Druitt Workers Club, my electorate office, Rooty Hill RSL Club, St lohns Ambulance, Sydney Water, Tip Top Industries, and Uncle Bucks, Mount Druitt. All these organisations either donated money or gave generously of their services. The other initiative or matter that I wanted to talk about today was something that started well before the last election, and that was the Mount Druitt Cottage Industry Employment Project. It does seem odd for an opposition member to be thanking the government, but I am Wednesday, 9 December 1998 MAIN COMMITfEE 1779 deeply grateful that the government saw fit to provide $50,000 for a demonstration program. This was something that Father Hanna, Bridget from Grow and I had discussed informally for some time, but the nub of it is this: usually with labour market programs we try to grab people who have been long-term unemployed and put them through a five-day routine and then prepare them for work in the formal economy-that is, with small business or Woolworths or a variety of firms. But this project is something different. It tries to work with people for actually only one day per week. If they get a job in the formal economy, I do not say that that is a failure, although it is not a stated aim. We are trying to look at, if you like, cottage industry skills and at developing the potential of those skills to allow the participants to earn extra money by producing things and then to graduate from the program, hopefully going out as sole traders or even working with others in some form of company or co-op. So it is, in my experience anyway, a radically different program. It has already started and there are some exciting outcomes. To date, we are acting more like a NElS or, if you like, an unemployed business incubator. That is perfectly valid. I am not unhappy about that, but we have strayed somewhat from what we originally intended. But I am sure that, over the 12-month lifetime of this project, we will be making a significant contribution. I really do hope the project is successful and is seen as being successful, so that it can be expanded and, if appropriate, replicated around Australia. I must say, too, that I suppose the impetus for this scheme was the fact that I think both sides of politics, or both the major parties, are moving together to really crack down on the unemployed. I think a community needs to respond before it is left in a ditch. In this way, of course, we do a number of things. We credential people .as being involved in a very worthwhile activity. We provide skills and we allow people to earn extra money and even to have a full-time income. I think all these things are very worthwhile. IfI have a disappointment, it is the fact that we were not allowed to provide the participants with any extra money for their participation, as was the original design of the scheme. So, in a sense, there was no reward other than their existing social security benefits. I was not intending to speak on child support, but the honourable member for Richmond had a little to say on this. I acknowledge that the member for Menzies is in the chamber. Along with a number of other colleagues, he participated in the review of child support and did a great job. I cannot thank the members of that committee enough. I believe their role has never been properly acknowledged. He has gone on to be Chairman of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs and he has brought down a very important report that looks at premarriage education and counselling, which is an additional and very valuable aid in this whole area of family law and child support. The point I want to make is that the more I go on in this area-and, in a sense, being a little frustrated-the more I have come to understand that this is one area where the major parties have particular responsibilities. We really do need to come together as legislators in this particular area. I guess the only mechanism to date is the formality of parliamentary committees. It is really difficult to develop other devices, but we need to pay attention to that. I have been critical of both the Liberal Party and the Labor Party, and I will give some examples of my criticism of the Labor Party. At the beginning of the last term of the parliament, Kim Beazley set up a shadow cabinet task force on child support. In the 30 months of its existence, it had three convenors. These convenors did not change deliberately nor did 1780 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 9 December 1998 they fail to perfonn. They changed because of shifting portfolio responsibility. At the end of that 30 months, we had not developed one new idea about child support. In desperation, before the last election, I tried a proposition to allow a new departure which I thought may have addressed the critical area of second families. That was that there was a right to seek a review against an assessment of child support on the basis that children may be discriminated against. In that departure, the reviewing officer would be able to look at the actual household income of both families-I stress 'household' income, an important distinction-and if the reviewing officer was able to detennine that, on balance, there was less money to support children of one family compared to the other, then that departure should be allowed. I regret to say that that just fizzled in the wind. In this tenn of parliament, when the opposition is perhaps more convinced that it is close enough to win the election, we have to do some policy hard yards. I do not believe we can just replicate that 30 months of relative inaction. In relation to the coalition side, I have given credit for the changes that have gone through the parliament. I have taken exception to the fact that you have picked some figures, like the 10 per cent figure, and will not show us the modelling, and will not even justify, or encourage us to see, how you arrived at that particular point. As we have moved some amendments, we have tried to gazump you, then you have adopted them and, bit by bit, inch by inch, there is a package of coalition measures and some that the opposition have had an influence in. B1,lt none of these measures-and I think the honourable member for Menzies will agree with mereally goes far enough. The minister said he is looking for 1999 as a year of action. I certainly hope it is going to be a year of action but across a broad front of refonn-not only child support, but family law and also in the area that the honourable member for Menzies seems to have carved out as a real speciality, which I acknowledge. I do hope that we can work together in a bipartisan way. The Attorney-General, for example, mentioned having a federal magistracy, particularly in relation to the Family Court. Let me make this point on the record-and I must get a question on the Notice Paper: if the federal magistracy is going to make such a profound difference to the way people feel about family law, then clearly this will be demonstrated in Western Australia, which operates under the state jurisdiction which already has a federal magistracy. I am not saying there would be no improvements-far from it. The point I want to make is that there is no appreciable difference that I am aware of in people's views about family law in Western Australia from those in any other state or territory. If that is true, and I suspect it is-maybe I am wrong; maybe people can produce some surveys-then, yes, we will again have made an incremental change but not really gripped what is required, which is some bold refonn. There were some other things that I needed to talk about but I have nearly used up all my time. There is another project that has been dear to my heart-the new Mount Druitt college system. I understand that John Aquilina, the New South Wales Minister for Education and Training, will be visiting my electorate on Friday. I am hoping parliament does not extend to Friday, because I would like to be there and he would like me to be there. But, if that is not the case, that is not the important thing. I believe that he will be making an announcement about the new college system of junior and senior secondary education, which is going to be of profound importance to my electorate. It isomething that I have been involved in with Wednesday, 9 December 1998 MAIN COMMI'ITEE 1781 my parliamentary state colleagues and the community, and I am very much looking forward to being there. Madam Deputy Speaker, I have used most of my time. In the remaining few minutes I want to say that, by serving ori the Standing Committee on Procedure again this term, I hope one of the things we are going to be able to do is get some decent reform into the procedures of the House and lift the standing of the House of Representatives in the eyes of the people. The committee system has been one of the greatest innovations in making parliament more accessible to ordinary people. Clearly, we need to develop means whereby they feel that their voices· are being heard. to the words of the honourable member for Chifley, and I must say on his last point I would certainly concur with him and support his efforts in everything he does in trying to lift the standing of the House and the importance that it plays in parliament, in government and, of course, in the eyes of the nation. However, I also noticed in his remarks that there was quite a strong element of frustration regarding the approach to the way this whole issue of child support has been handled. In particular, I noticed a not too thinly veiled criticism of the Labor Party and the Labor leadership, where he made it very clear that he was less than impressed with the Leader of the Opposition and the fact that after 30 months, I think he said, no new ideas have been put forward by a policy committee. I thought that probably sums up the problems that the Labor Party continue to have and that is probably why they are sitting over there and not over on this side. In the brief time. I have available to me I would like to talk a little bit about some of the difficulties facing regional and rural Australia and the need to work harder to address some of the inequalities in access to services. I think it is worth noting that in 1986 the federal Public Service Board estimated that people living in towns with a population of fewer than 10,000 experienced 'considerable disadvantage', while those living in towns with a population of fewer than 5,000 people experienced 'extreme disadvantage'. Unfortunately, in the 13 years of Labor, not -nough was done to address those disadvantages and I believe that, while the present government has tackled many of those problems, there is still much to be done. I think it is important that in order to maintain the fairness and equity of our society people living outside our major centres are not made to feel as though they are getting inferior services. We must, of course, remember that we are talking about a significant part of the Australian population and a part of the country that makes a very significant contribution to this nation in so many different ways. It is clear that over the last 50 years there has been a very significant change in the demographics of Australia. In 1947, for example, approximately 31 per cent of the Australian popUlation lived in the rural regions. By 1987 this had been reduced to 12 per cent. The decline is particularly a factor amongst the 15to 19-year-old age group who migrate to the larger regional centres or the capital cities to seek education and employment opportunities. It is also worth noting that poverty is higher in rural areas than in urban areas, with the average weekly earnings for rural families considerably less than those for city families-approximately $641 as compared to $808. It is worth noting also that of the 37 poorest electorates, 33 are located in rural regions.",133,Representatives Main Committee
385,Mr Hawker (Wannon) (11.10 A.m.),"In joining in this debate I was interested to listen1782 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 9 December 1998 I would like to tum to a couple of specific areas where in the coming term I think the government really has to work very hard at tackling some of these inequalities to ensure that there is better access to service. The first one I would like to talk about is education because there is no doubt that everyone recognises that education IS the key to solving so many of the other problems that people face, whether maintaining a better lifestyle, improving opportunities for creating new jobs or new businesses, or just allowing people to maintain some equity in their income. While most rural students do have access to primary school, and in most cases can live at home to do it, many have to leave to get access to secondary school. What we already see is that the retention rates in the country are lower than those in city schools and the completion rates are also lower in rural areas than in metropolitan areas. In the 1980s there was roughly a 10 per cent gap in the year 12 completion rates of urban and rural students. In the 1990s the figure is still the same for females but, rather alarmingly, the gap is getting larger for males. We all recognise these days that failure to complete year 12 means that people are more likely to join the ranks of the unemployed. When we look at the proportion of students going on beyond secondary education, we again find that it is significantly lower for rural students. A study that was undertaken in 1995 by the University of Southern Queensland highlights the trends in terms of access of rural and remote students compared with disadvantaged groups. I seek leave to· have the table incorporated in the Hansard. Leave granted. The table read as followsUniversity of Southern Queensland study (1995) which highlights the trends in terms of access of rural and remote students compared with other disadvantaged groups Access to Higher Education for 'disadvantaged' Equity Groups Equity Groups 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 Isolated 0.66 0.69 0.61 0.64 0.65 Low SES 0.62 0.61 0.30 0.62 0.62 Rural 0.81 0.80 0.78 0.77 0.76 ATSI 0.90 0.99 10.6 1.13 1.18 NESB 1.02 1.13 1.19 1.19 1.22 Females 1.12 1.11 1.11 1.12 1.13 In the above table, all values have been standardised so that a value of 1.0 denotes parity in relation to the general population. Access is defined as the number of commencing students in each equity group, as a percentage of total enrolments. Mr HA WKER-I thank the Committee. This table shows that in the various groups that were looked at over the years from 1991 to 1995-isolated students, students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, rural students, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students, students from non-English-speaking backgrounds and females-while access to higher education in the last three groups has in fact improved and is seen to be above the parity in relation to the general population, the same cannot be said for students from isolated areas or lower socioeconomic backgrounds or for rural students. Wednesday, 9 December 1998 . MAIN COMMITTEE 1783 WhatI find very alarming is that, for example, access to higher education for the rural students has in fact been declining over that period. So we are not even holding our own; we are seeing a drop from 0.81; where one is seen as parity, to 0.76. I think this trend does highlight a very real need for further policy development to allow that access. The National Farmers Federation have done some excellent work in highlighting this problem and, equally, in coming up with some solutions. I think one of the comments they made in a recent policy paper really sums up the problem, which they see as twofold: access and finance. Many students in regional Australia have to go away for tertiary study-not as a matter of choice but as a matter of necessity. The National Farmers Federation states: . . . many fann families are able to pass the AMTthe actual means testand the income test, but are ineligible to receive Austudyor Youth Allowance, as it is now known. . . due to the assets test. The point they make quite clearly and simply is: If the Government does not expect these families to sell their livelihood in order to support their children through education, then the obvious question must be asked, how are these families expected to pay for their children's education? It is a very valid question: how are they expected to pay? Clearly, if they cannot qualify for assistance because of the assets test, yet the assets they rely on are their livelihood, then, as these figures show, many students are not going on to tertiary study and therefore are being disadvantaged by not being allowed to get the same access to services and employment as people in larger urban centres. In this situation the National Farmers Federation have come up with two very sensible recommendations, one questioning the whole basis of the assets test for farming families and the second questioning whether or not there should in fact be a straight allowance paid to all students, who have to go away. But we are not just talking about farming communities. A case was brought to me a couple of months ago by a constituent, a qualified teacher residing in a regional centre in my electorate. He is married and has four children. One child resides in Melbourne, attending university; next year a second child will move to Melbourne to attend university also; and there are still two children in secondary education living at home. My constituent has a wage of $50,000 per annum, which is higher than the male average weekly earnings. The three eldest children take part-time work as much as they can, and his wife also works part time. Yet, as he pointed out to me, he will really be struggling to provide support for the two children who will be away at university next year. He has already had to extend the mortgage on his home to help support the second son who will be going to university next year. His children do not qualify for youth allowance, yet he has to face this burden-and it is a real burden. He and his wife will no doubt do everything they can to help those students. But it indicates the growing inequities in regional Australia. I point out that this is not an isolated case; I would like to go into this in a lot more detail, but I realise there are time constraints on this debate. The government, in its first term, has recognised many of these problems and is addressing, across a whole range of areas, the need to create for people living in rural and regional Australia access to services similar to those in the city. But we can see from just this example in education that there is still real inequality 1784 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 9 December 1998 and real difficulties for people in country areas. I can see that, in the coming term of parliament, the government-no doubt with the support of the opposition-is going to have to continue to work on addressing these inequalities because, clearly, I think we all believe that this is part of making Australia a better country for all people, no matter whether they live in the city or whether they live in regional areas. today's Australian Financial Review, we are reminded that, 15 years ago today, at 1 a.m. on Friday, 9 December 198-, two men took a decision that would forever change the Australian economy. That editorial refers to the decision taken by then Prime Minister Hawke and then Treasurer Paul Keating to float the Australian dollar. Much has been said in debate in this parliament over the last several years about the way in which Australia's economy has been internationalised. Much has been said about changing circumstances with respect to our financial institutions. Also, of course, as in the old adage, success has spawned many fathers, while failure is often an orphan. In the case of success with the Australian economy at the present moment-the Treasurer is trumpeting five per cent growth rates, low interest rates and so on-if you could believe everything that the Treasurer said, you would believe that it all happened in the last 2V2 years. But, as was clearly identified in the editorial today, anybody who sat back and dispassionately analysed just what major contributions had been made in terms of Australian economic policy in the last 15 years to enable the government to claim the success that they believe has been engendered in the Australian economy in recent times would, I am sure, agree that it was in fact a number of decisions over the past 15 or so years that have assisted that process, not least of which was the decision to float the Australian dollar 15 years ago today. That was a decision that was taken in some very interesting times, and it was taken by the Labor Party. It was taken by a Labor Party that, over a long period of time, had really been at odds over the concept of whether there was a community service obligation on the part of banks to deliver services in Australia generally. It was at odds with traditional views within the Australian Labor Party that, in some way, the banks themselves were part of a money power conspiracy which seemed to be established for the capital side of the equation; it did very little for the working class in Australia. It was taken at a time when that government, within a relatively short space of time after coming into power, had been faced with a massive inflow and outflow of capital on a regular basis from Australia. In terms of what to do with Australia's currency, over a long period of time Treasury officials had always said that it should be propped up and that we should not engender a float. The view that was subscribed to at the time by Treasury officials, led by John Stone, clearly was against what was happening around the world. The decision taken by a Labor government and by Labor Prime Minister Hawke and Labor Treasurer Keating was a very courageous decision at that time. In the subsequent years we saw that decision built upon. We saw that decision built upon in the Australian banking industry by a subsequent revision of Labor policy in respect of the entry of foreign banks. We saw the government decide that it would licence 16 foreign banks. In the final analysis, 15 foreign banks took up those licence opportunities. That decision came after much debate, much. pain within the Labor Party, but it did demonstrate that a genuinely progressive Labor Party was prepared to look at its policy and, where necessary, change it.",137,Representatives Main Commi Itee
386,Mr Martin (Cunningham) (11.21 A.m.),"I think it is quite timely that, in an editorial inWednesday, 9 December 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1785 As a consequence of that decision we saw quite a number of foreign banks enter Australia. They did not come in and do everything they were supposed to do. They did not come in and set themselves up to be genuine competitors in a traditional banking sense to the big four banks that were in Australia, but what they did do was come in and offer real competition, particularly in niche markets. The business sector, in particular, was one area where competition became rife. The Labor government subsequently changed that policy and agreed to put a numerical cap on the number of foreign banks that could operate in this country. We then changed the policy again and eliminated that numerical cap. That resulted in an exponential increase in the number of foreign banks here. We saw some come and go but what we have seen is a strengthening of many of those financial institutions. What we have also seen accompanying that around the world now is a whole series of bank rationalisations between big foreign competitors and foreign banks which are operating in Australia. We have seen major banking institutions merge to form megabanks. Those banks operate in this country and they compete against our own domestic banks. Is it any wonder that at the present moment there is so much confusion out there in the community about what the government's intentions are in respect of Australian domestic banking? I am pleased that the speaker before me, the honourable member for Wannon, participated in this debate because in the last parliament he chaired an inquiry into an aspect of banking. As I understand it, that inquiry will continue in this parliament. The inquiry is looking at the way in which banking services can be provided in regional and remote Australia. A consequence of domestic pressures, of competitor edge and so on, has been a shrinking, in some locations, of traditional banking services delivered by the traditional big four banks, but in other cases we have seen community based banks like Bendigo Bank and so on coming in to take the place of those banks that have decided to exit some of those locations. We have also seen credit unions and building societies taking a more active role. In recent times we have seen proposals for a people's bank to be established by the Australian Local Government Association, and we have also seen chemists talking about operating in-store banks. What we have also seen over time is the way in which technology is helping ordinary customers in dealing with what they have perceived previously as traditional financial arrangements. When people shop at a Woolworths or a Coles supermarket they simply swipe their card. Madam Deputy Speaker Gash, I am sure you have seen that in the supermarkets in Nowra or in the Southern Highlands. People now buy groceries or clothes or anything else simply by using EFTPOS facilities. Alternatively, before they go into those particular stores to shop they simply go to an ATM somewhere and withdraw money. Those ATMs are now multi-linked across a whole variety of financial institutions. That level of technology has been with us for some time and people are now starting to feel much more comfortable with it. Similarly, of course, you have telephone banking and banking on the Internet. Internet banking is growing rapidly and will be offered as a product by major banks shortly. You will see that those opportunities are going to present some real benefits to people in Australia. Is it any wonder then that there is still some confusion as to what the government's policy is in respect of the future of Australia's big four banks? Some short time ago, we had the Prime Minister apparently giving some succour and comfort to the big four, suggesting that mergers would be allowed. We subsequently had that particular view disavowed. We then had a view expressed by the Minister for Finance and Administration that all policy was under 1786 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 9 December 1998 review. That was disavowed two days later. We then had other mixed signals sent to the broad community that maybe the government would be prepared to review these sorts of issues. Mr Deputy Speaker Mossfield, I know you have a particular interest in the issue of elimination of some banking services in your own electorate. I know you.are concerned about the way in which suburban banking branches are disappearing in your own area. But what, in a broader picture, people are concerned about is the direction in which the government intends to take policy in respect of the big banks, and whether mergers are going to be allowed. Labor for its part, of course, has steadfastly refused to embrace the notion that there should be a change in the four-pillar policy. However, as we embark upon policy review at the present moment, I am of the view that we should not necessarily simply say-for some of the bad old bank-bashing reasons that are quite easy for any politician to use-that we will not consider any option before making a final decision. The world has moved on and the world has changed dramatically compared to what it was in the 1930s, 1940s and 1960s in terms of the provision of financial services in Australia. The world has changed dramatically in terms of the internationalisation of our economy, much of it done by a Hawke-Keating Labor government. Much has changed in terms of the way in which we have internationalised our financial services. Yet some have argued-NAB has been at the forefront in this, and Mr Argus, the chief executive, in particular-that Australia does really stand to perhaps be left behind in this world of international finance if we do not have a domestic operation which is able to match it with the big boys. It is a question which I think needs reviewing. It is an issue which I think needs addressing. We need to take into consideration as a parliament: what is in the national interest? Is it going to be in the national interest for that four-pillar policy to disappear? Is it going to be in the national interest for the ACCC to ensure that levels of competition are not downgraded by such an act? Is it going to be in the national interest to have a major domestic bank that is going to withstand foreign takeovers? It does seem that one of the issues out there in respect of the four-pillar policy is whether or not Australians would be more prepared to allow two domestic . Australian banks to merge than to allow a major foreign bank to come in and take over one of our own. They are just some of the issues that are around about this very complex issue at the present moment. I do think that on our side of politics-indeed, I think in the parliament as a wholeit is time that this issue received some real airing and some real discussion. Too often and too easily, we as MPs can stand here and, for whatever reasons, kick a bank to death. After politicians, probably banks are the next in line to get kicked to death by the general public. I suspect that a lot of it ensues because of people's memories about interest rate regimes at different times of the economic cycle or because they have been unable to get a loan or whatever. I have to say that banks underpin every aspect of the economic and social elements of our society. They play an integral role in everything that happens in this nation, as they do around the world. We want to make sure that, as we go into the next millennium, our world-class banking system is able to continue to play a constructive role in the internationalisation of banking services. What we do not want to see is a head in the sand attitude that says to people, 'We are too frightened to even examine an issue because we do not think the politics of it at Wednesday, 9 December 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1787 the minute is right.' What we have to do is to say that we want to look at these issueswhether in banking or a whole range of things-to find out what is for the good of Australia. In conclusion, I would hope that we are not afraid to do that across the parties and across the parliament. I would hope that the decisions that are taken will come. after thorough examination of the issues, because nothing could be worse for Australia-nothing could be worse for your constituents in western Sydney or for my constituents down in Wollongongthan to find, under the guise of improving competition or providing an opportunity to buttress Australia against international pressures, a diminution in some way of the way in which services are delivered to our constituents. That has got to be important. If the banks are really serious about this they need to not only look at a better way of selling the proposition but also take a more pro-active role in ensuring that the services that underpin every aspect of our economic and social life in this nation are delivered fairly and equitably. They also need to understand that from time to time people need to feel that they can walk into an institution and talk to someone face to face about a particular problem. Let us not be frightened of change. It is always difficult when one embraces change in a general sense. The world is moving so quickly, technology is advancing so rapidly and banking systems are changing so dramatically around the world that we should not be frightened to look at the issues as they might affect Australia generally. Ms WORTH (Adelaide-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs) (11.36 a.m. )-1 am pleased to able to speak in this address-in-reply debate at a time of such significant change. In today's BulletinI note Max Walsh's commentary and quote him for the benefit of those listening: During the 13 years in which Labor ruled in Canberra, the real earnings of Australians-that is, their inflation-adjusted wages and salaries-rose by 6%. In the two years to the June quarter of this year-the latest figures we have available for the Howard era-reaJ. wages rose by 10%. And what is critically important in respect of that figure is that the profit share of income climbed from 16% of GDP to well over 17%. Not since the '60s have we had it so good. The explanation of this simultaneous rise in both real wages and profits is that our national productivity has moved up a gear. Just how and why this has happened is something that the economists will pore over. However, the statistical fact is that the Howard government, by the most sensitive measure of the hip pocket nerve, really has delivered. This was confirmed last week with the recent release of the national account figures for the September quarter. Whilst the Asia-Pacific region has experienced economic turmoil, Australia's economy has grown by five per cent over the last year. Japan and New Zealand, for example, have struggled to achieve positive growth while Korea and Hong Kong have experienced a seven per cent constriction on their economies. Even the economic powerhouses of the United States and Germany could only manage 3.5 and 2.5 per cent growth respectively. In the last three months, 90,000 jobs have been created and interest rates continue to fall. When the coalition government first came to office, variable mortgage rates were at 10.5 per cent. Today they are 6.5 per cent. Inflation remains below two per cent. Australia is performing strongly in an international economic environment that has seen many other regional economies verge on collapse. The sound management of the Howard government and getting the fundamentals rightreducing debt and improving the delivery of government services-have provided all of us with an economy that is secure and that will safeguard our lifestyles into the next century. 1788 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 9 December 1998 After receiving a clear mandate at the last election, the coalition government is committed to boldly replacing the outdated wholesale sales tax system, which has held Australia back for so long, with a new and fairer tax system that will create a more competitive and secure Australia able to face the challenges of the new century. The introduction of a GST and other tax reform will guarantee a revenue base for future welfare and community spending, deliver income tax relief for Australian families, address the social and economic challenges that will accompany the ageing of Australia's population and will ensure that we will all pay our fair share of tax while giving business the opportunity to expand and hire more of our young and long-term unemployed. The Labor opposition has chosen to defend an outdated tax system and ignore these challenges. Without any credible alternatives it is no surprise that Labor refuses to acknowledge the mandate given to the coalition at the last election on tax reform-reforms that many traditional Labor voters supported. It is appropriate that I take this opportunity to make"" some observations and to raise some concerns that I have following the recent election. It is my strong belief that when we are elected to this place we have a duty to represent all of our constituents, whatever their political persuasion or social or economic background. I have worked hard to do this in my own electorate of Adelaide with, I might add, some positive outcomes. As a consequence, some loyalties are formed that seem to enrage the local Labor organisation and retaliatory action follows. For example, Phil Martin is a hard working and active achiever for the Kilburn community. He was a vocal supporter for my re-election, not because he was a Liberal voter, but because I got results for Kilburn. Unfortunately, he is no longer chairman of the Kilburn Football, Cricket and Community Club and, sadly, he has taken some flak because of his support for me. Cliff Votier, who has been a Labor supporter in the past, and his wife, who has been a union delegate, believed that both the coalition government and I should be re-elected because of our record of achievement. Cliff has been subjected to nuisance phone calls since. As another example, I had formed a close working relationship with a parent from the former Croydon Primary School. She wrote a warm letter to me thanking me for my support when the school was facing closure. However, during the election campaign, her name appeared on a document entitled 'When we needed her most, Trish Worth let us down'. She subsequently told a member of my electorate staff just how helpful I had been. I feel concerned that this parent may have experienced the same form of intimidation by Labor activists along the lines experienced by some of my other supporters who live in traditional Labor territory. People being judged by their so-called class and the suburb they live in is a thing of the past in our modem Australian society. Labor, in attempting to drum up class distinction where there should be none, shows how out of touch it really is. Labor in Adelaide once again adopted the Graham Richardson approach of 'whatever it takes' to win the seat. What Labor failed to realise was that the voters want sincerity and genuine commitment to represent their needs. They do not appreciate mud-slinging or scare campaigns, such as the fake bills for household expenses Labor sent out against the GST, or misleading information, such as the false claims made by my Labor opponent that there had only been one pension increase over the last two years. As Terry McCrann said in the Advertiser during the campaign, 'Beazley wants to launch a vicious and breathtakingly cynical attack on the great mass of middle Australia.' This of course was evident in Adelaide. Wednesday, 9 December 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1789 This negativism and division continue. In the last weeks, we have heard the maiden speeches of all the new members. I was in the chamber for the one given by the new Labor member for McMillan. He said, 'The political centre is not where I want to be,' and speaking as if he and his family had a mortgage on hard times and a tough upbringing. His statement that Liberal and National Party members are 'the sons and daughters still of the moneyed elites' is so offensive and incorrect that it does not warrant a response-suffice to say that the coalition is incredibly diverse. I remind the member for McMillan and others who hold his view that the coalition is the party with the ideals that middle Australia, and a good number of traditional Labor voters, continue to embrace as being fair and responsible. Time in parliament is often set aside before elections for valedictories of retiring members but there was no opportunity to thank members who were not returned. Ian Sinclair, Ian McLachlan, Bob Halverson, Noel Hicks, John Sharp, Michael Cobb, Bruce Reid and Bill Taylor chose to retir-, and I wish them all well. Others like Andrea West, Elizabeth Grace, Graeme McDougall, Russell Broadbent, Richard Evans, Ricky Johnston, Chris Miles, Susan Jeanes, Eoin Cameron, Warwick Smith and Bob Baldwin sought to be re-elected and were not. Those members worked hard for their constituents and made a contribution to this place. Eoin Cameron of course entered parliament with me in 1993, and I will miss his very fine sense of humour. Warwick Smith, with whom I formed a close working relationship when we shared responsibilities in the Health and Family Services portfolio, will be particularly missed. Susan Jeanes, a fellow South Australian, failed by only a handful of votes, despite her tireless work on behalf of the constituents of Kingston during her parliamentary term. In the last parliament, in my position as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Family Services, I was fortunate enough to continue working in an area in which I had been involved for many years. In this parliament, I am looking forward to making a significant contribution as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs. My aim is to raise the profile of young people so that their needs and aspirations for the new century are heard and acted upon by the government and the wider community. I have already been impressed by the Green Corps initiative introduced by the coalition in the last government. I have visited two of these projects and have heard and seen first-hand the job skills that the young participants are learning and the environmental benefits for the surrounding communities. Only yesterday I released for public comment the draft National Schools Drug Education Strategy, which is part of the Prime Minister's $290 million Tough on Drugs policy. Parents, teachers, key health care experts and community groups have been invited to submit suggestions on how to fight illicit drug abuse in schools and to achieve world's best practice in educating young Australians to the dangers of drugs. I would also like to use this opportunity to express my thanks to the Prime Minister and the foreign minister. After my representations on behalf of my local Greek Cypriot community in Adelaide, the appointment was made of John Spender as special envoy to Cyprus, to help convey Australia's views directly to the parties in the region and to encourage greater participation with the United Nations effort to reach a peaceful settlement. I am disappointed to learn from the foreign minister that Labor had said that the envoy would be sacked if Labor were elected. I shall continue at every opportunity that is available to me to raise the Cyprus problem and the need for justice and human rights in that country. 1790 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 9 December 1998 My electorate of Adelaide is multicultural; it is diverse. I thank everybody there who supported me and voted for me. I undertake once again, in this term of government, to do the best I can for my constituents. address-in-reply. It is great to be back for my third term in this House. At the outset I would like to pay a few tributes to the many people who assisted me not only in the campaign period but also during the life of the last parliament. To Alma, Sarah and Hannah, thanks for being there. I know it has not been easy with all of us trying to make our marks in the world, each of us with our differing priorities. For us to have succeeded as well as we have done shows a real resilience and a real love for each other. To my staff-Cheryl, Glenda, Roger, Miriam and Vicki-I give my heartfelt thanks. You have been the front-line people in the office, day after day, dealing so superbly with the varied concerns of the constituents. Each of you has done much to ensure that, whatever the problem, just about everyone has gone away happy in the knowledge that their problems have been sorted out. To my wonderfully organised campaign team of John Shepherd, Bernie Harrington, Martin Titherley and Mark Sayer, and to the many branch members, friends, union members and volunteers, thanks for the long hours you have spent doing all the bits and pieces that make effective campaigning seem so straightforward and simple. Being elected this time around places all of us in the 39th Parliament in a unique position. God willing, we will be able to claim a place in history as the first members of the House of Representatives to have served in two centuries and two millennia. The Franklin electorate has had nine members this century-unfortunately, only three of them Labor. We have seen long stints by Liberal members, interspersed with Labor members. The three Labor members have been able to complete at least three terms in the House: Charles Frost, Ray Sherry and I. Following on from the state Labor Party's great election result a month out from the federal poll, it was very pleasing to see the federal Liberal primary vote in this election come in at 39.41 per cent, the fourth worse vote for the Liberal Party since World War II. It was also extremely gratifying to see Tasmania return five federal Labor members this time around, a 100 per cent record. The last time this occurred was in 1974. Congratulations to Michelle O'Byrne and Sid Sidebottom for their tremendous work in defeating Warwick Smith and Chris Miles and in joining Duncan Kerr, Dick Adams and me in this great place. Each member in this place has their own style, their own way of doing things, their own way of trying to convince the electors that they are the person to put their faith and trust in. What the local member does, how effective he or she is, and how efficient and effective the electoral office staff are, does have a huge bearing on the result achieved on polling day. Do not believe the newspaper experts and pollsters and the party spin doctors. In order to survive in this place and not be a 'oncer', you have to have laid the proper foundations right across your electorate, servicing the whole cross-section of the various communities and being there seven days a week for your constituents. People from all walks of life heap it on us. We are regarded as being a different subspecies. People constantly question our motives and try to second-guess why we do what we do. Every time one of us falls from grace, the Australian media loudly trumpet the fall and insinuate that collectively we are all the same. Just you wait and see!",140,Representatnes Main Commitfee
387,Mr Quick (Franklin) (11.46 A.m.),"I, too, welcome this opportunity to speak on theWednesday 9 December 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1791 Members of this House, as we near the century, represent a community unsure of their country's future direction, unsure of their own job security and unswc; of their children's future. In many regions of our electorates, communities see morc and more resources removed to the larger towns-Medicare offices, banks, child-care -entres, state and Commonwealth agencies, and private sector agencies closed. The call centre has become the latest icon in society and the 13 number, if you foolishly believe the spin doctors, will solve all our ills and still provide a service to the customers. Arrant nonsense! Face-to-face and person-to-person service is what our constituents deserve and what they are now demanding of their legislators. The bottom line and the dollar return to investors is not what society is all about, as far as I am concerned. Every night on our news bulletins, we see nations across the globe struggling to overcome yet another catastrophe, their citizens asked to bear yet more grief. Developed nations are being asked to bailout country after country and the list continues to grow. The IMF and World Bank continue to give money out in what seems a never-ending futile exercise. Hurricane Mitch's devastation of Central American countries recently is forcing developed nations to seriously look at finally resolving the debt problems facing so many Third World countries. The phrase 'global community' is constantly bandied about, yet whim it comes to seriously tackling global problems, the developed world often puts up the shutters and tries to ignore what is happening across the ocean or else intervenes to serve their own strategic self-interest. My neighbourhood, your neighbourhood, is a microcosm of society in general and the world at large. How well is your neighbourhood faring? How well are the many neighbourhoods in your electorates faring? Doorknocking in my suburbs as I do on a regular basis, trying to keep in touch with the mood of my electorate, what do I find? Telstra quietly removing phone boxes from the neighbourhood because they are sick and tired of the constant vandalism. Who suffers? Families who cannot afford the phone and rely on the local phone box in times of emergency. When this vandalism occurs, does anyone really bother to intervene, to even report it to the police? No; better not get involved as those antisocial misfits might take it out on you. The cycle continues. Because it is not reported, the police statistics do not reflect what is happening and the need for action to sort out these troublemakers is not forthcoming. The aged in our community, fearful of this criminal element, fortify their units and retire from society before dark. Local schools face horrendous maintenance bills from mindless vandalism after school and during vacation time-money far better spent on proyiding wider educational opportunities for the kids that really care. Local government has been forced to divert much needed resources away from basic service provisions due to the antisocial behaviour of a small percentage of our community. When they are finally caught, we see them go through the farce we call our judicial system. Have a closer look at your local newspapers and read the punishments handed out. What a joke! What sort of society do we have when the answer to many of your community hassles is to spend $11 and take out a restraining order? What sort of society do we have when the answer to tens of thousands of families' inability to cope with a pending Christmas is for the governmentto give more money to the Smith Family, Salvation Army and St Vincent de Paul and then to wash their hands of the problem? Think back to your childhood, your teenage years, when you bought your first home and settled into your current neighbourhood. Compare and contrast those times to the social confusion and uncertainty present in your neighbourhood today. 1792 MAIN COMMIITEE Wednesday, 9 December 1998 I mentioned earlier that politicians are seen as distant from society. Have a closer look. Those of us doing our jobs in our electorate offices are confronted daily with a plethora of social problems that constituents cannot cope with. We as politicians are part of our society; our families are going through the same stresses and strains-we are not immune. I have a 19-year-old daughter at Melbourne University experiencing the highs and lows of first year. I have a 22-year-old daughter, also in Melbourne, coming to grips with her new job-the second since she graduated from university. I have an 81-year-old mother living in Victoria, hundreds of kilometres from the capital city, battling to access aged care services. As we approach the centenary of Federation and the start of a new millennium, let us all take another look at what we are really on about as citizens, not only of Australia but also of this beautiful planet. As we focus on our foundations, our local communities, and see how we as federal members can assist in a meaningful, constructive and productive renewal of our Australian society, let us always be mindful of the even bigger perspective. Former US President Jimmy Carter put it so eloquently in his final address to Congress when he said: The same rocket technology that delivers nuclear warheads has also taken us peacefully into space. From that perspective, we see our earth as it really is-a small and fragile and beautiful blue globe, the only home we have. We see no barriers of race or religion or country. We see the essential unity of our species and our planet, and, with faith and common sense, that bright vision will ultimately prevail. I thank you. I would like to make a few comments about the federal election with respect to my electorate of Eden-Monaro and also to talk about some of the things I want to pursue over the next few years. Firstly, I am extremely pleased to have been re-elected the member for Eden-Monaro and very honoured to be once again representing the people of Eden-Monaro in the federal parliament. I often say to people that when I first walked into the House of Representatives chamber it gave me quite a chill up the spine. It still does that and I have said that I hope that never disappears, because it really is quite an .honour to be one of so few people with the privilege of representing a very large community in the federal parliament. It is also very gratifying to be part of the second Howard-Fischer government. It was a courageous move by John Howard to take major tax reform to an election. He certainly put his political neck on the line, and he won. I believe the people of Australia are quite relieved that the coalition won the election because, although there was always going to be some hesitancy about taxation reform-the fear of the unknown or the fear of change-underneath it all the people knew that reform was needed. In political terms, taking taxation reform to an election is a gamble simply because it is easier to scare people in a global sense than it is to explain a new tax system in a global sense. Prior to the election announcement, I conducted a series of information sessions throughout my electorate. I found that the basic problem in explaining a new tax system was that very few people understood the current system. There was an amazing lack of understanding of just how the wholesale sales tax system works. I guess I was fortunate in that I have had to deal with it for many years within my business, trying to work through the complexities of how sales tax applied to something like producing a map, which was my profession. It was just staggering the different rates that applied to different parts of that process all the way through. So it was no stranger to me at all, but people did not understand the system.",146,Representatives Main Committee
388,Mr Nairn (Eden,"Monaro) (11.56 a.m.)-In responding to the Governor General's speech,Wednesday, 9 December 1998 MAIN COMMITIEE 1793 When people used to ask me to explain aspects of the taxation reform we were putting forward, I would often start the conversation by saying, 'Well, explain to me the current system.' It was not surprising, I suppose-but, in other respects, it was surprising-that so little was known. What that did in an election campaign was basically give our opponents an opportunity to run some fairly predictable scare tactics that were used in the 1993 electionsuccessfully for them at the time but, fortunately, unsuccessfully for them this time. We had brochures being sent around the electorate that specified that a whole series of items would be going up-not saying that they would have a GST of 10 per cent but specifically saying that the price would go up 10 per cent. When you delved into those particular items, you found many which had 12 and 22 per cent sales tax on them. They were very borderline cases from an advertising point of view. I regret that recommendations for changes to advertising, which were made by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters that I chaired in the last parliament, were not taken up at the time. It is an aspect that could possibly be pursued further in this parliament and when a review of the Electoral Act takes place. Towards the end of the campaign in my electorate we also had money being offered and thrown around like confetti. Fortunately, once again, those bribes that were put out in a last desperate bid in the last week of the campaign did not work. The end result, as most people would know, was a close result in the electorate of Eden-Monaro. From the coalition's point of view, it is supposedly the second most marginal seat, with a difference of about 262 votes. It should be pointed out that our Labor opponents barely increased their primary vote from 1996. The lowest Labor vote on record was in 1996 and they only increased that vote by a whisker over one per cent. The only reason that it became a very close result in the end was that nearly 60 per cent of One Nation preferences flowed to the Labor Party. So, from 1996, votes lost by the coalition went to One Nation, which picked up about 9Y2 per cent of the vote, and then nearly 60 per cent of that flowed to the Labor Party. The reason that such a large proportion did flow in that direction was that the how-to-vote card that the One Nation Party put out in my electorate was heavily biased to the Labor Party. This was an interesting circumstance because my Labor opponent ran a very hard campaign early on about how dreadful One Nation was and all those sorts of things, but then we found that One Nation ended up basically preferencing the Labor Party. It was a very curious result, although some people put it down to the fact that there were identifiable Labor people handing out how-to-vote cards for One Nation. The end result though was that justice prevailed and I retained the seat. Certainly, I thank very much the many supporters who worked very hard for me. Stephen Beer, my campaign director, and all of the people right around the electorate, worked extremely hard, particularly on polling day. It is a major feat to man over 70 booths on the day; it is a very large number. We were very fortunate that we had all of our supporters out there manning all the booths. My Labor opponent had to import union people from Sydney to fill up many of the booths, so I am very proud that our local people were able to be there on the day. Over the next couple of years there will be major projects throughout my electorate that I will certainly be working on. Key infrastructure projects which will have ramifications right throughout Eden-Monaro are the armaments complex and the Eden multipurpose wharf. The armaments complex is a project which has been developing seriously probably only in the last year. It was totally off the equation there for a while because the previous Labor government had decided to put this complex in Victoria, near Geelong. The Public Works Committee 1794 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 9 December 1998 brought down a report some months ago saying that Point Wilson in Victoria was not an appropriate location for the armaments complex; Eden was seen as a much more appropriate location. Defence studies are currently going on and I would expect that a reference will go back to the Public Works Committee very shortly. Hopefully, we will see that project come to fruition over the next couple of years. An armaments complex will then justify the construction of a multipurpose wharf. As many of us know, once you put in place major infrastructure projects like that, it is amazing the sorts of additional industries that can grow as a result. It is the old chicken and egg situation .. I certainly will be pursuing that. The Queanbeyan area will benefit from the Very Fast Train project which is gathering momentum, and certainly I would like to see the region participate in that project. After we get it from Sydney to Canberra there is then the possibility of taking. it further. Hopefully, a route through Eden-Monaro into Victoria will bconsidered eventually. That will definitely happen in the long term, but the first stage is to get it from Sydney to Canberra. The regional forest agreement is a crucial project to get finished in the south-east, but I have spoken in the House on that topic numerous times in the last couple of weeks as We try to pull the Carr New South Wales government back into a proper. RFA process with the Commonwealth rather than have the unilateral decisions·that they continue to make. There are additional Medicare Easyclaim facilities that have got to get into some of our smaller towns. I managed to get about six or seven of those into areas where there was no Medicare facility. We had them going to places like Bungendore, Eden, Jindabyne and Moruya. Certainly there are other towns like Bermagui and Braidwood which would benefit from extending that service. A further project that I will do some work on concerns the Queanbeyan River. It is a major river through the Queanbeyan area. but it has been neglected over a number of years. The Landcare people are putting together a great management plan for it. I think it is an opportunity for Green Corps and Work for the Dole type projects to pick up on the management plan for that river. They are just a couple of the projects spread out around the electorate which we will be doing some work on, and which will help the overall area. CouldI say in conclusion that the Governor General's speech set out a comprehensive plan for the future. The coalition government has the runs on the board. We have reduced government debt. We have created a climate that has allowed interest rates to not only come down but stay down. We have brought inflation down. Economic growth has been strong, outperforming all expectations, and this has resulted in many more jobs and sustained falling unemployment rates. . . In the next three years I want to see that good performance nationally extend throughout my electorate of Eden-Monaro so that my constituents enjoy a higher standard of living. I look forward to representing each and every one of them during this term of the government. not the way to fix it. This government is engaging in a 1970s answer to the tax issues of the coming century. Whereas the industrial revolution gave rise to the taxation of labour and capital, it is not yet clear how the tax system might be structured for the information age. The narrowing of the tax base in Australia is a sign of this dilemma. In every case the foundations of the base-wholesale sales tax, PAYE taxation and the corporate system-are weakening.",148,Representatives Main Commiitee
389,Mr Latham (Werriwa) (12.08p.m.),"The Australian tax base is broken, but aGST isWednesday, 9 December 1998 MAIN COMMITIEE 1795 The sales tax regime has been undermined by the shift in consumer spending from goods to services. This is the inevitable consequence of a modem service based economy. Tax modernisation is needed to protect the integrity of the public sector's revenue base. The PA YE system has seen a large number of taxpayers move onto corporate rates. This is a product of the disaggregation of economic activity with the huge growth of small businesses, franchisees and outsourced workers. The new economy has facilitated a shift from labour earnings to corporate earnings. These new companies have been able to take advantage of the 14 per cent gap between the top personal rate in Australia and the company rate. Notwithstanding this movement, the corporate tax base is also in poor shape. The growth of multinational transfer pricing, income splitting and other avoidance measures have put a large hole in government revenue. This has coincided with a loss of public trust in the fairness of our taxation system. It seems the wealthy corporations and individuals are able to find holes in the tax net faster than the parliament can close them. This is what the Commissioner of Taxation, Michael Carmody, had to say on 19 November: ... the sort of arrangements that we are seeing are of businessmen: you've got a risky venture, you want to get some capital-:-<lon't worry, we'll do that through the tax system for you; or you've got a capital gain that's a bit of a worry for you-:-<lon't worry, give us $4,000 and we'll manufacture a $50,000 loss for you. It's potentially several billion dollars we are concerned about. .. . . . things like tax-effective investments in a variety of primary production films, research ... circular loans . . . In some of the superannuation arrangements. . . Huge amounts of revenue are also being lost through the practice of multinational transfer pricing. Despite the strong economic growth of recent years, 60 per cent of multinationals in Australia continue to report losses. Some have been doing this for decades. They are large global companies with billions of dollars in assets and turnover, yet they never claim a profit and, therefore, never need to pay tax in this country. Moreover, in all nations, the footloose features of capital have forced policy makers to drive down their corporate tax rates in search of international competitiveness.' If a nation taxes earnings too severely, corporations and even some citizens have the capacity to move to a more generous jurisdiction. Like so many other aspects of public policy, the taxation system is struggling to cope with the globalisation of investment. No-one genuinely supportive of the active role of government in our society could be satisfied with the existing tax base. It has meant that public revenue is only likely to grow off the back of strong economic growth and wages growth. This is why successive governments in this country have engaged in the deceit of bracket creep. It is estimated that, by the year 2000, the annual bill for returning the rate scale to an indexed version of those introduced in November 1993 will be $11 billion-that is, $1 in every $8 collected from income tax will come from bracket creep. In the absence of tax indexation, the progressivity of our tax system has gradually been eroded. Whereas the top marginal tax rate in the 1950s cut in at 19 times the level of average weekly earnings, this ratio has now fallen to below 1.5. This problem is further illustrated in the table I have distributed, for which I seek leave for incorporation in Hansard. Leave granted. 1796 MAIN COMMITIEE Wednesday, 9 December 1998 The table read as followsIncome taxes and multiples of average earnings, Australia Average income tax rate Proportion of average earnings (%)a Year 33 66 100 200 400 800 1977-78 0.0 14.8 21.1 31.4 44.4 53.6 1981-82 6.6 19.3 23.5 33.8 46.0 53.0 1982-83 7.4 19.0 22.9 33.9 46.8 53.4 1984-85 8.7 18.9 23.7 37.5 49.1 54.6 1987-88 9.1 18.9 25.0 35.7 43.0 46.6 1990-91 9.7 16.8 24.1 35.3 41.8 45.0 1992-93 9.7 15.2 22.8 34.0 40.5 43.8 1994-95 10.4 16.3 22.2 33.0 40.0 43.5 1996-97b 10.9 17.3 22.8 33.8 40.4 43.7 Note: These figures equal the average tax rate applicable in certain years to income levels, expressed as a proportion of AWE. a Average total earnings for all male employees b Estimates Source: Average Weekly Earnings, States and Australia, various (ABS Cat. no. 6302.0), Australian Taxation Office. its progressivity. In 1995-96, the poorest quarter of taxpayers received 9.5 per cent of total pre-tax income in this country and 11.2 per cent of after-tax income, while the top quarter received 47.5 per cent of the nation's pre-tax income and 43.7 per cent of the after-tax income. This indicates that the net redistributive impact of our income tax system has fallen below three per cent. Those who believe Australia still has an acutely progressive tax system are deluding themselves. This is a major problem for left of centre parties. The new labour market is characterised by the growth of income inequality that rewards the information rich while punishing poorly skilled workers. The tax system now needs to offset this inequality with a strong redistributive role. Improving the integrity and progressivity of the tax system has become a first order priority for the Australian Labor Party. The work of government cannot be adequately funded from its current revenue sources. Social democracy is in search of a sound tax base. This is an important response to globalisation and the way in which footloose capital is able to seek out low tax regimes. Across the developed world, taxes on earnings are losing their effectiveness. Among the possible sources of taxation now available to nations, only acts of expenditure and property related assets appear unaffected by the mobility of investment. If someone lives in a nation, they must also undertake their consumption of goods and services within its boundaries. This is an important part of the new economic geography-taxing items and assets which are not easily shifted across national boarders.",150,Representatives Main Committee
390,Mr Latham,"It is simply not possible to defend the current tax system on the basis ofWednesday, 9 December 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1797 Traditionally, consumption has been taxed through flat rate levies on transactions. This option is now being pursued by the Howard government via the revival of proposals for a GST. This agenda, however, represents an exercise in retro-economics. It ignores the challenges to tax policy posed by electronic commerce. The great tax avoider of the next century will be the Internet. The rise of electronic commerce is likely to make the policing of transaction taxes exceedingly difficult. Whenever the place of purchase varies from the location of actual consumption, the potential for tax avoidance will arise. Consider, for instance, an information related service purchase from an overseas bank account, yet transmitted for consumption in Australia. The Australian Taxation Office would have trouble assessing records related both to the payment and consumption of this service. It is becoming easier to police individual taxpayers than taxes on transactions-especially given the prospect of billions of transactions in cyberspace. Each of these trends, Mr Deputy Speaker, points to the virtues of the direct taxation of expenditure. This represents a third way in tax policy. The old Left, with its reliance on the progressive taxation of earnings, is struggling to cope with the nature of the new economy. Equally, the New Right's policy for the indirect taxation of consumption is being challenged by the rise of electronic commerce. This is why proposals for a progressive expenditure tax-a PET-now look more appealing. This is a relatively simple concept: income must be either spent or saved. Under a PET the taxpayer is required to provide evidence of their savings to the tax office. Once savings are deducted from earnings, an expenditure amount can be identified for each taxpayer. This system is one step removed from the current income tax system in Australia. This taxes earnings as they accrue, irrespective of whether they are subsequently saved or spent. The PET taxes income minus any net additions to savings. That is, it taxes income only as it is spent. As the PET applies directly to each taxpayer it is possible to levy a progressive scale of tax rates, thereby satisfying equity objectives. Someone spending $100,000 a year for instance would face a higher rate of tax than someone spending $20,000. The tax scales can be made as progressive as policy makers might desire. It is important to understand that the progressivity of the tax system is not necessarily linked to the incidence of tax. In this regard, tax rates matter much more than tax incidence. This is an important adjustment for left of centre thinking. The old Left has convinced itself that the taxation of earnings is inherently progressive while the taxation of consumption must be regressive. Yet this is simply a question of timing: the difference between taxing earnings as they accrue and taxing earnings as they are spent. The key issue lies in the application of various tax rates. As Australia's leading tax expert, Vince FitzGerald, has argued: By contrast with an indirect tax on spending, a PET applying to individual taxpayers can be made as progressive as desired-just as comprehensive income tax can. Both models can be designed to raise any given amount of revenue using similar marginal tax rate structures, notwithstanding that the base for the PET is at any time somewhat smaller than for income tax-noting that since in Australia, as in most western countries, household savings rates out of disposable income are relatively low, the percentage difference is not great. Raising any given amount of revenue will therefore require a slightly higher tax rate under a PET than under an income tax. That is what our leading tax expert has had to say about. this proposal. Yet some retro journalists such as Brian Toohey and Tim Colebatch have argued a PET would favour the wealthy, given their relative propensity to save. It needs to be appreciated, however, that under 1798 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 9 December 1998 the current tax system people with high rates of savings have available to them a range of tax concessions and deferrals on their savings. Conversely, low income earners tend to make more use of high tax forms of savings such as bank deposits. The PET would eliminate this inequity in the taxation treatment of savings across various income bands by treating all registered savings as PET exempt. . The PET does not provide unreasonable tax benefits for savings. In fact, it is neutral in the taxation treatment of consumption and savings. It taxes both once: consumption as it occurs and savings as they are withdrawn and then spent. This corrects the unfortunate way the current system taxes savings twice-once at the point of initial earnings and then at the point of interest earnings. Australia has. one of the worse savings records of any advanced nation, leading to a chronic current account problem and high structural unemployment. A progressive expenditure tax would help to correct this fundamental weakness in our national economy. The progressivity of Australia's tax system can be enhanced through the introduction of a PET based on two principles: first, a tax-free threshold addressing the basic food, shelter and clothing needs of low income families-that is a subsistence amount exempt from the PETand, second, high marginal rates on high levels of personal expenditure, designed to harvest substantial revenue from the extraordinary growth in consumption among wealthy Australians. This is a breakthrough, in the fairness of the tax system, ensuring that the big spenders in this country face a progressive scale of tax rates on their expenditure decisions. The PET also has a critical role to play in the taxation of footloose capital. It taxes the cash flow of companies. Investments are expensed as made, with full cash margins taxed later. If companies trade in Australia they must have a cash flow here. The PET thereby establishes a relatively secure tax base for corporations. Avoidance techniques, such as transfer pricing, become less effective. Anyone concerned by the incidence of corporate tax avoidance in Australia would strongly support the progressive expenditure tax. This tax needs to come onto the parliament's agenda. If, as seems likely, the GST passes the Senate some time next year, the opposition will need to devise a better way of taxing expenditure. Having declared war on the GST during the last campaign, it will not be tenable to go to the next election with a promise to keep it. The answer lies in the progressive expenditure tax as a revenue neutral way of replacing the Howard government's regressive GST. I fully agree with the shadow Treasurer's House amendment two days ago describing the GST as 'an unnecessary, unfair job destroying tax which discriminates against low and middle income earners, the aged and families'. If it is ever introduced, such an unnecessary, unfair, discriminatory and job destroying tax will need to be repealed. That strikes me as self-evident, particularly from a party of social justice. This, of course, is the historical purpose of Australia's great party of social justice, the ALP. We are here to replace bad taxes with better taxes. We are here to replace unfair taxes with fairer taxes. This is why Labor exists. It is not as if, as some have said, the GST is like some scrambled egg which can never be unscrambled. It is in fact just another tax, which this government is trying to place on the statute books. Just as the GST can be legislated in, it can be legislated out. The progressive expenditure tax gives Labor its best chance of replacing the GST with a fairer and more practical tax. The PET can be introduced as a complement to the existing tax system and raise the same amount of revenue as the GST. Wednesday, 9 December 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1799 It is self-evident that any set of progressive PET rates must be fairer than the GST's flat 10 per cent rate. The PET rates can be as progressive as policy makers desire-such as three stepped rates of five, 10 or 15 per cent or, even more progressive, of two, 10 and 20 per cent. The PET would also reverse the job destroying impact of the GST. As a direct tax, it takes away the transaction paperwork burden on small businesses. It also helps to boost national savings and take the brake off Australia's underlying rate of economic growth. The PET is not only fair and progressive; it is a job creator, against the job destroying impact of the GST. So in each of its features this tax that 1 am proposing-the progressive expenditure tax-is the antithesis, the exact opposite, of the government's GST. The PET is Labor's logical alternative in tax policy. If this government introduces its proposed $13 billion in personal tax cuts, there will be little room for further cuts of this kind. It is hard to imagine a party topping up $13 billion in tax expenditure with the promise of further personal tax cuts at the next election. At the last election, 'the opposition promised $5.8 billion in tax cuts for people who work. This was an earned income tax credit-a policy that, was first introduced in the United States under the Ford administration, for those who remember Gerald Ford. It has become a very expensive policy in the United States, with the tax credit now providing up to 40 per cent of the income of some families. The tax /iredit, of course, is best known for its role In assisting the deregulation of the labour market. It is a tax cut offered as compensation for real wage cuts with the greatest impact on minimum wages. In the United States, the tax credit has facilitated just one increase in the minimum wage since 1975. Australia needs a strong, indexed minimum wage, not wage deregulation for our lowest paid workers. Australia is well placed to be the first nation to implement a PET-ither the full progressive expenditure tax or as a replacement for this government's insidious GST. The transitional issues involved for a PET are not severe, due to Australia's relatively weak range of asset based taxes. Moreover, advances in information technology are likely to make the recording and data processing of savings flows and balances a comparatively simple task. The PET now represents an entirely practical reform. It is important to note that this concept is not foreign to the Australian tax system. Aspects of the PET have already been introduced into tax policy both here and overseas. AgainI quote Vince' FitzGerald: Australia, like every other country, has some elements of expenditure taxation in its direct tax system, even though that system is basically modelled on the comprehensive income tax. For example, most capital gains are taxed on realisation (although in many cases this occurs earlier than withdrawal of the resources for spending on consumption, because the gains are reinvested). In respect of the major savings vehicle in Australia, superannuation, the present treatment is neither pure income taxation nor pure expenditure taxation, but a complex hybrid. That is;, a combination of both. He continues: Most other OECD countries, however, provide a large area of pure expenditure taxation in respect of pension fund saving, as indeed Australia did prior to 1988. That is, prior to the changes in 1988. He continues: While the treatment of saving in the form of equity in owner-occupied housing may not appear to match the direct expenditure tax model, as above defined, nevertheless it is (Jne of a number of variants of ,REPRESENTATIVES MAIN COMMITTEE 1800 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 9 December 1998 expenditure taxation. The key points of commonality are that the principal is taxed once and only oncealbeit at the outset; and period-to-period returns are not taxed. In short; while the model as advocated by the 1978 Meade Committee (in Britain) has not been implemented at full scale in any country, large elements of it exist in most, and some elements of it exist in all countries. This is an idea whose time has come in Australia. The PET is feasible, practical and progressive. It is a fair alternative to this government's determination to introduce a regressive, flat-rated 10 per cent GST. I believe the PET will come much more onto the agenda of the parliament. Labor will be looking, logically enough, for alternatives to the GST if the legislation passes the Senate some time next year. We cannot leave such an insidious and regressive tax on the statute books. A social justice party will seek to remove it at the first available opportunity, and the progressive expenditure tax is the best option in that regard. address-in-reply to the Governor General's speech to take stock, in a sense, since it is now approximately 2Y2 years since I made my first speech in this place. It is a great honour for me to speak in this place as the member for Makin in the 39th Parliament, to again represent the constituents of Makin. I thank them for supporting me at the last election and I will endeavour to represent them to the very best of my ability. At the time of my first speech, my three sons were present in the gallery to hear me speak, and it was for them as well as my constituents in Makin that I stated that what their mother hoped to achieve in this place was 'to secure a better Australia for them and their generation which can provide a lifestyle and job opportunities to allow them to achieve their aspirations in the future'. Two and a half years on, I can say with some pride that this government has achieved a substantial amount in this regard. Not only did Beazley, Keating and company not bring home the bacon with their last budget before the 1996 election but the cupboard was more than bare: $10 billion in debt, in fact, at the time of the March 1996 election. In my first speech I reported to the House that poverty, inequality and unemployment were continuing to increase, despite the denials of the ALP. In a very short time, the government has turned these factors around. Interest rates and inflation are now at historically low levels, and unemployment is finally falling although, as we all know, it is still too high. But the Howard coalition government will continue to implement reforms to address this problem, particularly in macro-economic policies and in micro-economic reforms, such as the unfair dismissal laws. In 13 years of self-proclaimed socially just policies, the previous government had manifestly failed these key tests of economic management for the good of all, particularly for those on low incomes. At the time, I asked, 'Where is the social justice in unemployment?' Two and a half years on, people can once again aspire to such things as gainful employment, home ownership and greater control over their own destiny. The government has been able to achieve these things because it understands that having a social conscience is not about crying crocodile tears for the less well-off but about taking practical action to help them and to enable them to help themselves. The Australian Labor Party will stand with its hand on its heart and speak about its concern for disadvantaged Australians, but it fails every challenge to give practical effect to its professed concerns. You would think that the Australian Labor Party would now be eager to grasp every opportunity to make amends to the Australian people and support measures which might",152,Representatives Main Commitiee
391,Mrs Draper (Makin) (12.27 P.m.),"I wish to take this opportunity in speaking in theWednesday, 9 December 1998 MAIN COMMlITEE 1801 improve opportunities for Australians who are battling. Does their record so far in this 39th Parliament reflect such a desire? Sadly, it shows just the reverse. Wednesday, 2 December was a historic day not only in the life of this 39th Parliament but also of our country, Australia. It was a day on which the government introduced into the House the new tax system series of bills, to fundamentally reform Australia's taxation system. I commend the Treasurer, the Hon. Peter Costello, and our Prime Minister, John Howard, for the tremendous way in which they have been able to achieve this magnificent reform. This legislation seeks to redress the inequities that afflict the current wholesale sales tax system. It seeks to reform the tax base, so that governments of the 21st century will be able to finance the social services that are needed by our society. It also seeks to safeguard the incomes of people on government pensions and benefits, something that the previous government failed to do when it increased sales taxes to the tune of billions of dollars. The Australian Labor Party have opposed the abolition of the ramshackle wholesale sales tax system, which taxes baby food but not smoked salmon. They have opposed the abolition of job destroying state taxes and charges, such as FID, BAD and a range of stamp duties which currently afflict small business. They have opposed a private rebate for people who wish to take out private health insurance, a measure which would unquestionably relieve the burden on our public hospitals, which many of my constituents in Makin are concerned about, as they want the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate as promised by the coalition in the last election campaign. Over 42,000 of my constituents in -he electorate of Makin, 56 per cent, are currently privately insured and have a right to the rebate. I will fight for the rights of my Makin constituents. You have to hand it to the Australian Labor Party-they are consistent. They have consistently opposed every measure which would make an appreciable difference in the lives of people they claim to represent. Ironically these are the very same measures which will deliver more to their constituencies than they were able to do in 13 years. The government's proposed new tax system will create jobs because it will remove the administrative complexity associated with the existing system. It will allow for pay-as-you-go taxation and it will abolish a series of state government stamp duties. These measures, together with further industrial relations reforms, will free up business and small business in particular. This is the only way that sustainable new private sector jobs can be created-by creating a favourable climate for businesses, and particularly for our small businesses. What the opposition seems to have so much difficulty coming to terms with is the social benefits that will be associated with these reforms-namely, more equitable taxation, including tax cuts to people on lower and middle incomes, more job opportunities and more affordable health care. I would like to make some comments in relation to reconciliation. It is my firm belief that genuine reconciliation can only take place when we have finally been able to address the continuing inequities that exist in the areas of health, employment, education and living standards for our indigenous people, with successful outcomes. In the House in June this year, I referred to: ... the importance of teaching our children-()ur next generation of leaders-that to differentiate one person from another you only have to ask their name, and that race, colour, religion, age, gender, disability, or, rather, special ability, is not critical in order to differentiate one person from another. 1802 MAIN COMMITIEE Wednesday, 9 December 1998 I went on to say on that day: It is up to us, with the help of our children, to ensure we pass on the most worthwhile of all life's lessons: acceptance of ourselves and others as truly worthwhile and valuable individuals. But, of all the achievements of the Howard government's first term in office, perhaps the area in which I take the greatest personal pride is the work that has been done to create a safer environment for our children. Prior to entering parliament, I had taken an active role in opposing the screening of a film in Adelaide called Salo, in which were depicted various acts of sadomasochism and sexual abuse of children. Since that time, the government has taken significant steps to strengthen Australia's approach to the fight against child exploitation. We played a substantial role in the declaration and agenda for action against the commercial sexual exploitation of children, in Stockholm in August 1996. Our own law and justice amendment legislation in that year tightened the criteria for classifying certain advertisements which may· contain child pornography. The same legislation also made it harder for sensitive material to be hidden in sophisticated computer games and 'click on' access films. The coalition has developed a national paedophile database to protect our children. I also have the pleasure of reporting to the House that I have personally been in contact with the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator the Hon. Richard Alston, to express my concerns and those of my constituents about the recent use of obscene language on commercial television. The minister has been investigating this issue through also discussed the issue of ongoing funding of Young Media Australia to enable the good work that they do to continue in monitoring television and media in relation to violence and other issues for our children. During the recent election campaign, the government undertook to, amongst other things, provide up to $50 million to establish a national information system, Crimtrack, to significantly improve the ability of law enforcement agencies throughout Australia to solve crime. In cooperation with the Judicial Conference of Australia, I will be organising a South Australian forum between members of the parliament and the judiciary, similar to the forum held here in Canberra, to promote better understanding between judges and parliamentarians and to discuss issues that are of particular concern to our constituents, such as sentencing laws. In the electorate of Makin, the government's Tough on Drugs program has also been very well received. That program provides more resources for law enforcement, with noticeable results in recent times, as well as a preventative education program to warn our kids of the danger of illicit drug use. In Makin, as part of the schools drug education. strategy, and in conjunction with Senator the Hon. Nick Minchin, l.launched the Makin schools competition in which students were encouraged to devise new ways to educate their peers about the dangers of drug abuse. . Students at the Salisbury East High School produced a board game called Choices, in which players are confronted with a range of facts about the consequences of drug use and real life situations in which to apply their knowledge. I am pleased to announce that Senator Nick Minchin, along with me, presented a cheque for $500. for first prize to those students. These .are just some of the examples of this government's social policies in action, though there is clearly more work to be done in this very important area. In all of these examples we see the government empowering individuals and communities to face challenges in their own Wednesday, 9 December 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1803 way. Instead of thinking of each other as competitors for the welfare dollar, we as Australians need to further cooperate with each other to build a stronger society to mutual advantage, a social vision which is positive rather than negative, which seeks to build rather than tear down and which looks for mutual obligation rather than compensation. This government will continue with the economic and social policies that seek to strengthen individuals, strengthen families and communities, and strengthen Australia and our place in the world. Finally, I take this opportunity to thank my family, friends, staff, the Makin federal electorate committee and volunteers, all of those who gave their time to the Liberal Makin campaignmy FEC president, Bob Day; Senator the Hon. Nick Minchin and his staff; the Barker FEC; the former Minister for Defence, Ian McLachlan, and the new member for Barker, Patrick Secker. I look forward to continuing to work with the Barker FEC in the future and thank them for their support. As we all know, not one of us is able to get here on our own. Finally, to my three boys-Chris, Graham and Michael-to Zara and Alex, and especially to my partner, Paul, without whom I would not be here in the first place-thank you. the ceremony of the opening of a session of parliament. As we come to the conclusion of this debate, it is worthwhile to reflect on the change that has come about as a result of the recent election and what that really will mean for the work of this parliament over the next few years. Indeed, there has been a great debate over these first few weeks of the parliament about what it has really meant with regard to a mandate. The notion of a mandate, of course, is worthy of a greater and longer debate, but certainly we on this side acknowledge that-because we are on this side-we lost the election. We failed to gain the majority of votes in a majority of the seats. But in saying that, I think that the government really needs to look at the election result and understand how finely balanced the Australian public is in its support for the coalition, as opposed to the Australian Labor Party. The government should not be in a position where it thinks that it is not open to criticism about the platform that it went to the Australian public with. The government should understand that it needs to engage in a dialogue with the Australian public not only at the time of an election but also during its time of government. The debates that we have seen about things like the private health insurance rebate, and the continuing debate-however truncated over the next few days-on the GST package indicate that perhaps the government has taken a very closed-ear policy about continuing discussion. One of the things that Labor learned after 13 years in government was that if you stopped listening, and if you stopped having a dialogue with the Australian public, they would punish you. That is a lesson that the Howard government should have learned. It should realise that Australian politics does not work in the way it envisages-that simply because they say something is right, they say they have something they want to put in place, on the basis of a two-party preferred support of 49 per cent, they should be cautious in the way in which they put it in place.

394,Mr Jenkins,"The honourable member for Cowper is Mr Garry Nehl.. He said that this1804 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 9 December 1998 his staff had been open to abuse. I would make similar observations about the campaign. Yes, this was a tough campaign. It was an indication that people were perhaps a little polarised in the way they were approaching the election and in the way they were taking it seriously. Yet again, there is a lesson to be learned from that: that the Australian public, in the way in which they are approaching politics, have a very great desire to see that they are included in the way in which decisions are made. Hopefully, with the result of the state by-election in Queensland, we have seen yet another decline in what we hope was only a transitory factor in Australian politics, the rise of a party that was able to cash in on the disquiet that the Australian public had with the major parties. In talking about disquiet, I have a degree of concern with a couple of elements in the run-up to the election campaign in the way the government was projecting policies that it had in place. I had some concern that Centrelink, which had been put in place to take over the administrative responsibilities for the Department of Social Security, and certain aspects of the Job Network, decided in a self-promotion exercise to insert advertisements throughout Australia under the headline '4,500 People Have Been Convicted of Fraud; Don't be the Next'. WhilstI do not think there is any debate from either side of the chamber about whether those that try to defraud the social security system should not be dealt with, I have some question about the way in which these figures might be heralded, because of the damage that it actually does to those who try to do the right thing. In fact, when we talk about 4,500 people being convicted of making fraudulent claims since July 1996, we should also acknowledge that in Labor's last two years of government there were some 4,933 people convicted of social security fraud. This is a continuing phenomenon and organisations such as Centrelink, which have the responsibility to ensure that social security legislation is put in place and that it is done in a legal sense, should have continuing responsibility. When that figure is used against the Labor opposition to try to suggest that we in government had not been as diligent about these matters, I have great concern. These as were run in the run-up to the declaration of the election. They also included the information that 570,000 people were found to have been overpaid and had their payments reduced or stopped. These figures might at first blush be quite startling but when you really look at the reasons for these figures you might take a more sanguine view about what they really represent. For instance, the 4,500 people convicted of fraud represent 0.044 per cent of the over five million clients of Centrelink. As for the 570,000 people who were overpaid, many of them were unintentionally overpaid because they had difficulties in understanding what was required of them by Centrelink. That is something that we have to continue to look at, to ensure that people understand when they should be explaining changes in their circumstances to Centrelink. Also, some of those 570,000 cases actually are as a result of the way in which Centrelink processes claims. As I understand it, the government in part acknowledges that point and has tried to change the legislation to put in place start-up dates for benefits and the like to try to minimise those effects. The real concern I have is that the coalition, when the election got under way, used those 570,000 overpayment cancellations or reductions to indicate that there was something like $46.4 million per week being saved because of that action. One line comments were made in advertisements, both in the print media and on television, that Labor was opposed to measures that would lead to these savings. I just do not think that there is any proof of that. Wednesday, 9 December 1998 MAIN COMMITIEE 1805 I do not think that there is anything that indicates that Labor was opposed to that. That was a regrettable aspect of the election campaign. Another aspect that I wish to go to, and I will only go to it briefly on this occasion, is the continuing use of statistics to herald that the Job Network has been successful. These statistics suggest that Job Network has been more successful in placing people in employment than was the CBS. I call upon the government, and now Minister Abbott, to come clean on what these figures actually represent. In the full explanation of the methodology behind these figures it has to be acknowledged that in comparing Job Network only with the CBS we are not comparing like with like; we are comparing chalk with cheese, apples with pears. An article in the Sydney Morning Herald on 25 August that did not really get much of a run indicated that those figures comparing Job Network with CBS ignored the case managers who looked after 250,000 long-term unemployed, and they ignored the 622 sites outside of the CES where these case managers were. If we are going to be fair dinkum, let us compare the totality of what was on offer in the Labor programs with the totality that is on offer in the coalition's Job Network. This is something that I will be returning to throughout the course of this parliament because I believe that, if we are going to have a debate, it is important to have the facts. If we have ministers using question time to falsely quote those figures to indicate that they believe there is nothing wrong with Job Network when it is obvious to anybody on the ground that there are deep problems with Job Network, deep problems that have to be addressed, we need to have the facts. We do not need mickey mouse batidaid solutions addressing those problems; we need a serious review of those problems. We must ensure that the minister responsible does not continue this farrago where he is suggesting that Job Network in comparison with the CES is an improvement, because it is simply not so. In the remaining moments that I have, I just wish to return directly to a portion towards the end of the Governor General's speech, where he went to the question of reconciliation, because I believe that there can be no more important question that the Australian parliament should be addressing as we approach the end of this century and the start of the new millennium. The Governor General said: As we approach the new millennium and our Centenary of Federation we also face the challenge of reconciliation between indigenous and other Australians. The government will work to achieve the goal of reconciliation over the next two years. It will do so in the knowledge that the great majority of Australians want true reconciliation to be achieved and will support a co-operative approach to achieve that outcome. The government continues to believe in the importance of achieving practical outcomes for indigenous Australians-particularly in terms of improvements to their health care, their education, their housing and their job opportunities. In its second term, therefore, the government will be looking to secure ongoing progress in these key areas. The opposition would wholeheartedly support the achievement of those outcomes in those endeavours. Throughout your parliamentary life, as you would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, you not only use the types of experiences that are directly to do with your own electorate but build on the opportunities that the privilege of being a member of the House of Representatives gives you. One of those experiences for me was in the last parliament when, as a member of the 1806 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 9 December 1998 House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs, I was involved in the commencement of the reference given to that committee on indigenous health. Something like 500 people of indigenous background live in my electorate according to the census. It is not something that I am exposed to in my day-to-day carrying out of my duties as a member of this place. To be able to go and investigate the problems that our indigenous people face, especially to do with their health, throughout the whole of Australia was quite an eye-opener for me. I think there can be no other greater issue that we should confront than the deplorable state of the health of our indigenous people. The ABS Health& Welfare, Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Peoples report of 1997, for instance, stated about indigenous people: In most States and Territories, their babies are about 2-3 times more likely to be of low birth weight and about 2-4 times more likely to die at birth than are babies born to non-Indigenous mothers ... Indigenous people also suffer higher rates of infectious diseases, including tuberculosis, and sexually transmitted diseases. There were 4-5 five times more hospitalisations and 15-18 times more deaths from infectious diseases . . . And it can go on and on. It is a very bleak picture that can be revealed and it is a picture that we all owe a responsibility to take an interest in. One of the aspects that was interesting as we developed the inquiry and gathered infonnation was that, despite a myth that appears to be popular out in the general public, very few additional funds are given to indigenous health. In fact, if we compare the expenditure on he-dth for indigenous people per capita with that for the rest of the Australian public, it is only about 10 per cent more. It is a ratio of one to 1.1. This is on the basis of a very fair analysis of the expenditure. It acknowledges that indigenous people are unlikely to use the medical benefits scheme and the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. It acknowledges that there are barriers for them to the use of those schemes. So it is a fair analysis. This is something that we really need to work on and work on hard. In the first instance I hope that the government gives this parliament the opportunity to continue the investigation through the Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs. I think that would be the desire of those people from both sides of the parliament who took a particular interest on that committee in the last parliament. At this stage I place on record my gratitude for the way in which the honourable member for Mallee conducted himself as the chair of the committee and the chair of the inquiry. He endeavoured to seek and get our cooperation for this to be very much a bipartisan approach, because we knew that without bipartisan agreement we would not get lasting solutions to what is a very deep problem. There is just one piece of evidence that I want to put into the record in this address-in-reply speech. It comes from Professor Gus Nossal, who I think can be quite easily described as an eminent Australian. Gus Nossal appeared before the committee as part of the AMA's expert panel. But in introducing himself to the committee he quite rightly indicated that he was there not only as President of the Australian Academy of Science but, secondly, as the recently elected Deputy Chainnan of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation. In his opening remarks to the committee, Gus Nossal had this to say: This country will be the focus of world attention twice in the near future. In the year 2000 there will be 200 or more cameras pointed towards the opening of the Olympic Games. In the year 2001 certainly all of the Commonwealth countries-and I dare say other countries-will be looking at the centenary of our Wednesday, 9 December 1998 MAIN COMMITIEE 1807 federation. If reconciliation is not a done deal by that time we will be diminished in a serious way, to the detriment of all the Australian people at that time. He went on to say: The two aspects of reconciliation that are uppermost in the minds of Aboriginal people are land rights and reparation for the stolen generation and what flows from the stolen generation report. He said: I believe ... we have to grope for other elements in the reconciliation spectrum and what better place to start than health. Health is a non-controversial: there is no division between the political parties about the shameful state of Aboriginal health; there is no division about the need urgently to address it. I think that that gives this group-:that is, the committeeenormous leverage to press on and make the kinds of financial demands which we are making. That is the AMA panel. He went on: That would be my first point: health as a tool of a non-controversial sort and a doable towards reconciliation. In supporting the words of the Governor General's address with regard <to reconciliation, I believe that indigenous health is an important aspect. It is, in the words of Gus Nossal, a doable. It is not the only one. I believe that we have taken evidence that the questions of Aboriginal education and Aboriginal employment opportunities are all interrelated. They are something on which we can put together a package that is holistic, that gives an opportunity for the indigenous· people of Australia to be directly involved in outcomes that they would want to aspire to and that I believe. the whole Australian public would want to aspire to on their behalf. This is something that this parliament, this particular parliament in the run-up to the end of the century, can make a mark in. I believe it is something that both sides of the chamber can seek cooperation on. I think it is something very positive and a great reflection on the Australian parliament. (Time expired) this debate, having started as second speaker in the main chamber and almost sliding off the end of the debate up here in the Main Committee. But can I say it is a pleasure to rise and speak in reply to the Governor General's address given at the start of this 39th Parliament. No doubt it is one of those addresses that we all understand. It sets out the government'.s policies and programs for the next three years, a continuation of a responsible fiscal policy which has done so much for this country over the last 2Vl to three years. Since coming to this parliament after the 1996 election, I have seen that progress take place. As we know, it has often been painful overcoming the enormous debt that was left by the previous government. It was very painful in programs where we needed to balance that budget. I think my electorate of Page has certainly suffered as much as any other electorate. But we knew full well that we would have to take the pain if we were going to get the gain at a later date. I would like to thank the electors of Page for recelecting me for my second term in the federal parliament. Undoubtedly, we were very proud of the result. It was one of the lowest swings in Australia, in a fairly volatile election. The campaign was waged very strongly. I will be very interested to see the declarations by the various parties of their donations and who was involved in the funding.

It will be very interesting to see where those funds came from. On top of that, we had at least four unions involved in the advertising campaign-one disguised as 'Australians for a Fair Go', which sounded great, as far as the public were concerned, until I found that it was the Public Service union. We had the timber workers, the school teachers and the Public Service union. It was a very strong campaign but we saw it through, because the people of Australia realised that they needed this strong leadership. In my history in politics, and going back before I was involved in politics, I do not think I have ever seen a braver stand than was put forward by the Prime Minister in this particular election. He laid it all on the line. It was a very risky exercise-as a few of us would have thought at the time-to put forward clearly what he intended to do. People are now saying, 'When we look across Australia, and we add up the numbers, more people voted against the government than voted for them.' That is just splitting straws for the want of coming up with an excuse to oppose the clear policy that was put forward. It could not have been clearer. The misinformation, the lies and the scare campaign that went on obviously affected the electorate and cost seats. There is no doubt in my mind. Certainly, it cost big majorities in many electorates. But, despite that, the Australian people realised that there had to be some change in the system and therefore they voted for it. The Governor General's speech outlined a lot more than just the tax package. It indic-ted clearly the commitment the government has to electorates such as Page. While the figures are not spelt out within the speech, I know that the government has a strong commitment to the upgrading of the Pacific Highway-something I know Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl has a great interest in-and the Summerland Way, which is a main arterial route leading to Brisbane. Obviously, with the program that has been set out, and with the fact that we now have a very balanced budget-which leaves money available for those types of programs-it ensures that that promise set out clearly by the government can be fulfilled. I thank the House for its indulgence. I know that we are terminating this debate here at the present time, and that we intend to deliver the address-in-reply to His Excellency this afternoon. If His Excellency delves. through the speeches that have been made in this august parliament he will see that many members have contributed to it. There have been many maiden speeches-probably the largest number of maiden speeches that I have seen, although both times I entered different parliaments there was a large entry of new members. I think it was 21 in New South Wales and 30-odd in the federal parliament. Nevertheless, there has been a healthy contribution to the address given by His Excellency. I am sure the government will forge forward with the policies that were set out clearly in that address. I dare say the government will succeed by the end of the three-year period in establishing its position as a very responsible government and it will be re-elected at the next election.
