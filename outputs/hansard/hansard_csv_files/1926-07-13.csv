"" They Toil Not, Neither Do They Spin."" The Honourable Member For Frank","lin took exception to the Trades Hall being asked to supply labour for Canberra. Thank God, labour cannot be got except through the Trades Halls, and it is a good thing for the workers, the employers, and the country generally that the Trades Halls and the Political Labour party have been able, despite the united resistance of the wealthy classes, to establish a fair basic wage and good working conditions. member for Franklin belongs to that class whom we have to continually fight in order to retain those advantages. opposed to the payment of good wages. member has never made a speech in favour of the workers, and his mentality is such that he never will. order. Is the subject before the Chair the character of the honourable member for Franklin, or the Seat of Government Bill? ber for Darling is legitimately criticizing the attitude of the honourable member for .Franklin-, but I suggest to him that the exclusion of .personalities would be in the interest of sound debate. workers who have been libelled by the honourable member for Franklin cannot be heard in this chamber, and, as a representative of the working classes, it is my duty and privilege to refute some of the lies which are told about them. If words were bricks, the honourable member for Franklin would lay a lot. With that summary of his character I leave him. A fifth-rate clerk would know that the Invariably the construction of 300 homes at Canberra should have been referred to the Public Works Committee, and the Government should frankly tell the House whether the Minister or the commission is responsible for the omission to refer it. The members of the Public Works Committee, whose first duty is to the House and the country, should not allow that body to be ignored and attacked as it has been. A portion of my electorate is close to Canberra, many of thp workers at Canberra are my constituents,. and I feel it is my duty to defend the commission, the contractors, and the workers against the attacks that have been made upon them. When the Federal Capital Commission was first appointed, some doubt as to .its .success was expressed, but, living near Canberra, I know that the general opinion in the district is that the commission has proved a pronounced success. Of course, it is criticized, and, on my last visit to the district, I was told of several directions The honourable in which it was alleged to be wasting money. An investigation of such charges, however, convinces one that less money is being wasted now than under the former regime. I do not reflect upon any previous administration; such mistakes as were made were inevitable when the centre of control was so far from the seat of operations. The commission had to accept responsibility for the sins of the past, and take over Canberra as it found it. The consensus of opinion is that it is handling the job well. In regard to the houses that are being built there, I agree with other honourable members that this House is as much to blame as is the commission for some of the faults of which complaint has been made. Shortly after my election to this Chamber, I attended a meeting in Sydney of New South Wales representatives, at which a deputation was appointed to wait upon the Prime Minister and urge that the work at Canberra should be expedited so that Parliament might meet there on the 26th January, next. The Government recently decided that the date of the first meeting at Canberra should be postponed until the 9th May, and, in order that the city might be ready by even that date, construction had to be hastened.

15,T Cannot See How The Cost Mr West (East Sydney) [ 9 . 3 6 ],"I.Reference has heen made to the quality of the workmanship in some of the buildings at Canberra. I say, without fear of successful contradiction, that the workmanship in the buildings there will compare favourably with that in any other part of the world. With the possible exception of the bricks made by the New South Wales State brick works, Canberra bricks are equal to any in Australia. The honourable member for Franklin never tires of abusing those who have to work for their living. He spoke of the number of bricks laid in a day. I point out to him in this connection that cottages are very different from larger buildings Cottage walls are usually built with a cavity, which means, that two separate walls, each 4$ inches in thickness, have to be built, and ties placed between them every second or third course. Moreover, window and door openings and struck brickwork require great care. The honourable member said that 1,000 bricks should be laid by a man in a day of eight hours. That would necessitate more than two bricks being laid every minute. That is impossible when building a cavity wall, where allowance has to be made for windows and doors. It might be possible on a big building with walls 18 inches thick with struck joints on one side only, and with the centre bricks merely grouted in j but it is not possible when building cottages. Because of the difficulty of getting contractors to undertake cottage construction, the Government should have erected these cottages. Many contractors when giving evidence before the Public Accounts Committee have stated that cottages do not pay them, and that they lose money on Government contracts. The honourable member for Franklin also referred to the action of the commission in getting the Sydney Trades Hall to send workmen to Canberra. None but the best tradesmen are sent there. I know that the secretary of the Plasterers' Union visited Canberra, and that he has -done his best to get men to go there. Competent tradesmen, whose wives and children live in Sydney, cannot be expected to leave their employment in the city to go to Canberra, even to receive 30s. or £2 a week more. When I was working at my trade I should not have done so, because it would have paid me better to lose one day a week in the city than to go to the country. I sympathize with the commissioners, because of the difficulty experienced in getting qualified workmen at Canberra. There is no necessity for first-class artisans in Sydney or Melbourne to be unemployed, and the only persons who are out of work there are casual labourers, who have not any particular trade. As honourable members are aware, the Public Works Committee Act provides that all works the estimated cost of which exceeds £25,000 shall be referred to the committee for investigation and report; but, in this instance, the commission, at the instigation, I believe, of the Government, evaded the law. A PubliG Works Committee and a Public Accouaits Committee, which are responsible only to Parliament, have been appointed with the object of supplying Parliament with information of public, importance, and in this instance the Public Works Committee could have given this House valuable information. It is surprising to find that the Government has assisted in breaking the law, particularly as the composition of the House is such that, if it were considered imperative that certain works should be undertaken without inquiry by the committee, approval would, I believe, have been readily given. The rights of Parliament should be jealously guarded by every honourable member, and I trust that in future such action will not be countenanced. If the law is to be broken, expenditure involving £1,000,000, or even £2,000,000, may be incurred without investigation. The ventilation of this matter has enabled members of the Opposition to express their strong disapproval of the action of the Government, and I trust that the discussion which has ensued will prevent a recurrence of the mistake. three weeks ago, I asked the Prime Minister( Mr Bruce) if, in view of the heavy cost of constructing cottages at Canberra, the Government would appoint a committee, or some similar body, to make a comparison between the cost of the cottages being erected at Canberra and those being built in Adelaide under the Thousand Homes Scheme at a cost of £750 each. For the last four or five years it has -repeatedly been",50,Setup
16,Mr Gregory (Swan) [9.55],"Aboutstated tliat the cost of the buildings erected departmentally was excessive, and the cottages now being built are costing more than they should. Works Committee recommended that the services of some outside -person be obtained, not only to institute a comparison between the cost of houses at Canberra and elsewhere, but also to consider the desirability of a change in the style of architecture. The Chief Gommonwealth Architect was quite agreeable to the proposal, and said that he thought the idea a good one. The Federal Capital Com*mission, as honourable members are aware, is an independent body, which has absolute control of affairs in the Federal Capital Territory, subject to the act of Parliament under which it operates. The evasion of the act is the responsibility of the commission, and not of the Government. The commission has made a mistake, but there is no doubt that it was under the impression that in building a number of cottages, the individual contracts for which were for less than £25,000, it need not comply w it h the provisions of the Public Works Oommittee Aet. In that it was wrong, and the mistake w ill have to be rectified. member think that the 'commission had power under the act to accept that contract? it has done it statutory powers. made to the use of slates and shingles for roofing purposes; but I understand that slates were used because the owner of the house preferred them, and shingles were used at the request of the architect, who was anxious to show that they produced an entirely satisfactory effect. Before any bitter declamation is made against the commission or its officers, further inquiry should be made. As the commission was extremely desirous of providing the necessary accommodation for the public servants to be transferred to Canberra, prompt action had to be taken in constructing homes. three or fou r years, the Public Works Committee has kept the Government well advised concerning the necessity of expediting the construction of cottages. But there has been too much anxiety to transfer the Seat of Government to Canberra. Honourable members on both sides of the chamber have urged that ParliaThe Public ment should meet there this year, or early next year, but I know that it would be impossible for it to do so in any degree of comfort u n t i l next June or July. The commission, in pushing on with this work, considered that it was meeting our wishes. sion responsible for over-riding the act? made the mistake of assuming that it had the right to let separate contracts for cottages without giving any consideration to the total amount involved; but the Publio Works Committee Act makes it quite Clear that any work that w i ll u l t i mately cost more than £25,00 0 must be referred to the committee. The mistake that has been made should be rectified. Costs are altogether too high at Canberra. I cannot understand why bricks are so dear there, for one of the most up-to-date kilns in the world is operating there with a magnificent shale deposit right alongside it . Bricks ought toi be obtainable there as reasonably as anywhere in Australia, and the commission ought to be able to purchase its requirements as advantageously as building contractors anywhere else, for it has the credit of the Commonwealth behind it . An investigation should be made into costs generally there. Living is much dearer than it should be. I suppose not a single person has exceeded its in the Federal Capital Territory is growReference has been ing his own vegetables. When the Public Works Committee visited the city all the vegetables that were being used at the hostel were imported. liament have to be imported. Parliament have been altogether too anxious to get there, and the haste is a good deal responsible for the high costs that prevail. Seeing that we have such a huge war debt to shoulder, we should have been content to remain in Melbourne for the next ten or twenty years.

However, we have gone too far to withdraw, and we should make an effort to get to Canberra next year. In my opinion the Government would be well advised to appoint a commission to visit .Adelaide to inquire into the cost and type of cottages being erected there under the Thousand Homes scheme. The splendid scheme in operation there is well worthy of examination. I understand that a right-of-way runs behind every block, and that the water supply, sewerage, and mains of every description run from the right-of-way into the blocks, so that footpaths would need to be broken up only when surface drainage was necessary. I am sorry that some of the provisions of this bill are to 'be retrospective. I object to retrospective legislation. I regret, also, that it is proposed to give the commission power to make regulations which will become effective before submission to the Governor General in. Council. Power to make regulations should be granted to the commission only under the ordinary condition that the regulations must be approved by the Attorney-General's Department and gazetted before becoming effective. I hope that I shall not throw a bombshell among honourable members, but I trust that something will be' included in the bill to determine definitely whether Canberra is to be a licensed or an unlicensed area. We should not shirk our When a bill somewhat similar to this was before Parliament in 1909 an honourable membermoved a motion to provide that no spirituous liquors should be sold at Canberra, that no licences should be granted there, and that no alcoholic liquors should be manufactured i h the Federal Capital Territory. Mr Mauger, on behalf of the temperance bodies, opposed the motion, and said that it was preferable that power to issue ordinances in connection with the matter should rest with the Government. I disagree with that. I also disagree with the suggestion that this is a matter for the Canberra residents to determine. It is an Australian question, and this Parliament should decide it . 1 submit that, as this bill deals with the administration of the Federal Capital Territory, it would be quite in order for us to set out in it our liquor policy there. I am quite prepared to take f u l l responsibility for anything I may say or do in connection with this question. As a member of the House Committee and chairman of the Publio Works Committee, I had. something to do with providing a bar in the provisional parliament house. We have had six or seven years' exfperience of the present ordinance, and I consider that we should not allow the existing conditions to continue. A few people in Queanbeyan have made fortunes through this dry ordinance; and large quantities of liquor have been surreptitiously sent into the Territory. In my opinion this Parliament should at once determine its policy in connection with this matter. I favour granting licences to the government hostels, but not to ordinary hotels. Parliament should not attempt to evade this issue, but should settle it . Every honourable member has had dozens of letters and pamphlets from people of all shades of opinion on the liquor question. I am not prepared to shirk my responsibilit y in a matter that should be settled once and for all. Personally, I am. alarmed at the extra cost of building that the nation w ill have to bear in the construction of the new capital. We are now being provided with progressive examples of increased costs that were never expected. The high price of the houses at Canberra, of course, is largely due to the adoption of responsibility in this direction. a programme of rapid construction. Whenever a government lays down a programme of huge expenditure w it h in a limited time, the economic and financial position is disturbed to such an extent that costs are forced up to an inordinate degree. The agitation that has commenced among the public servants who must go to Canberra w ill never cease u n t i l the cost of housing has been reduced to a figure proportionate to their salaries and wages. I cannot let this bill pass without expressing the opinion that the Government must now face the responsibility of either increasing their allowances or writin g down the value of their houses to a reasonable sum. I am not advocating the adoption of either course at the present moment; but I regret that the expenditure of huge",52,Setup
25,Mr Rodgers (Wannon) [10.10],"amounts of public money, and the dislocation of ordinary economic conditions consequent upon the adoption of a rushed programme, has inflated building costs to such a serious extent as has been indicated. This is due to calling suddenly upon a great army of men to do work in a short time that ought to be spread over a considerable period. The matter cannot be allowed to remain as it stands. The problem will be much more difficult to deal with than it now is, i i the Seat of that it has created. Many members of Government is removed to Canberra without our having properly adjusted matters between the public servants and the Government that requires their attendance at the new capital. I hope that the Minister has some definite statement to make regarding the Government's proposals. It cannot suddenly call upon a great body of public servants to incur the high capital cost of housing at Canberra, and expect them to break up their present homes, unless it is prepared either to give them an allowance to compensate them for the increased cost of living at Canberra, or to write down the cost of houses there to a reasonable figure. I regard it as a criminal waste to spend public money and write down the value of the asset immediately it has been created. But whatever may be the conditions that the Government, through the Eederal Capital Commission, has created, the fact remains that the cost of building is much higher at Canberra than elsewhere. stances this would not be the ease, since the only additional cost should be the extra railway freight on materials required. We should not, by reason of having created a special tribunal at Canberra for the regulation of wages and conditions there, set up a standard of wages higher than those obtaining in any other part of Australia. paid in Canberra are lower than those in Victoria. formed recently by a representative of the commission that it has to pay higher rates for labour at Canberra than are charged in both Melbourne and Sydney. the position. will never again see low wages paid in Australia. that aspect of the matter, but am merely dealing with the comparative costs of labour at Canberra and in other parts of the Commonwealth. I am not specially pleading on behalf of the public servants; I am merely drawing the Government's attention to the position the Service are unable to make the large capital outlay that housing at Canberra will involve. The proposed weekly rental is beyond their means, and the Government must face the situation sooner or later. do so it will have hundreds of dissatisfied public servants to deal with when they are resident at Canberra and Parliament is sitting there. I know that representations have been made to the Government by the Public Service, and Ministers have no doubt had time to consider the matter. ter) [10.17] -The bill has evoked discussion along lines that one did not contemplate. The advisability of the Seat of Government being transferred to Canberra, and the wisdom of selecting it as the site of the new capital, has been discussed ; but the time has long passed when that matter need be considered at all. In ordinary circumRightly or wrongly, this Parliament is faced with the position that it must provide for the establishment of the Seat of Government at the site selected by a previous Parliament. The work of preparing for the transfer has been proceeding for years. During the debate several honourable members have stated that huge sums of money have been figuratively thrown into the sink-that millions have been wasted. My reply to that statement is that it shows how little they know about the matter before the House and about the return that is being received to-day, and' that will be received in the near future, from the money that has been, and will be, expended. Statements such as those about wasted millions and excessive grants of public funds, that we have heard in this chamber, have been made also in the press of Melbourne and the other capital cities.",53,Setup

33,Mr Marr (Parkes,"Honorary MinisThe honourable member for Ballarat( Mr McGrath) was the first to say in this debate that many millions of pounds had been wasted, and that, if the people had an opportunity to vote on the question of transferring the capital to Canberra, they would vote against the transfer. they would do so. and I now say again, that people in Melbourne imagine that, when they climb the post office tower, they can see tbe whole of Australia. That is the parochial view of the people and the press of Melbourne; but I am glad that there are persons in Australia, and honourable members in this House, who take a broader view than that. Those criti cisms prove that the selection of Canberra was wise. The same influences that are at work in this city would probably be intensified if the capital were now in Sydney. Several honourable members said that cottages could be built in South Australia for £700 or £800. I have seen houses which the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Stewart), when he was Minister for Works and Railways, had built at Canberra at a cost of £300 each. When considering price one must also consider quality. Sixty cottages which will cost from £1,600 to £2,200 each, are being built to designs drawn by. a Melbourne firm of architects, which won the competition for house designs,'and if any honourable member can build a cottage in Sydney equal to the £2,200 cottages in Canberra, at tbe same price, I will buy it from him. I know the cost of labour and building materials in Sydney, and it is not a penny less than at Canberra. The honourable member for Dalley( Mr Mahony) said that money was being wasted in shoddy cottages with shoddy roofs, and the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr West) said the Government was wasting £500,000 on a contract for 300 cottages. No contract has been let for 300 cottages, and, therefore, £500,000 is not being wasted. The hon-, orable member for Swan( Mr Gregory) complained that some of the cottages were roofed with shingles. In the whole of the Territory there are only six cottages with shingle roofs, and in those instances the architects asked that shingles should be used to introduce variety. been let for 300 houses? posed to let one. I could take those honourable members who have complained of shingle roofs to Sydney, and prove to them that they would have to pay more in that city for a shingle than for a tile or slate roof. I do not defend the It is questionable that use of imported shingles. Regarding the I have said, statements about the use of slates from the a quarry of which one of the commissioners was a director, the facts are that one cottage was covered with slates,' because the occupant asked for slates, and one member of the commission who happened to be a director of the slate quarry from which the slates had to be obtained immediately resigned from that position. Honourable members have made unfair allegations, probably because they are not aware of all the facts. It has been said that the commission should have built these cottages more cheaply; but no one is more anxious than the commission to build cheaply. Every one who has been to Canberra knows the enthusiasm with which the commission is carrying out its task, and its anxiety to receive suggestions that may result in cheaper construction. The comparison between Adelaide, where there are facilities for obtaining cheap timber and other building materials, and Canberra, is not fair. The honourable member for Swan said that Canberra ought to be producing the ' cheapest bricks in Australia, because there is an up to-date plant there, and the necessary materials are close at hand. The commission is doing that. It is producing probably the best class of brick in Australia. I know of only one brick that can be compared with the Canberra brick, and that is produced by the Thornleigh Brick Works, New South Wales. The brick works at Canberra, like many other Government undertakings, were loaded at the outset with heavy overhead charges. One could eat one's meals in that brick yard. But when private companies undertake brickmaking, they erect a sheet metal building, with as cheap a framework as 'possible. A t Canberra, a previous Government erected a building of stout timbers, in a location where there should have been a good natural draught. The chimney, however, was kept low, and £10,000 was spent to install a system of forced draught to make the has a contract kilns burn properly. These are the overhead charges that the commission and",54,Setup
34,Mr Scullin,But,55,Setup
35,Mr Marr,"No , and it is not prothe present Government have to carry. Recently, there were 11,000,000 bricks at grass at Canberra, but, to-day, they are gone. The commission proposes to duplicate the plant, but it will not repeat the foolish action taken previously by erecting a huge building .at unnecessary cost. It should be our ambition to t r y to find tenderers to build cottages at the wonderful prices referred to by honourable members. If that could be done, the 'commission would be very pleased'. The honourable member for Ballarat referred to the architect's fee of £38,000 for the administrative block, but the present Government, which is blamed for that, had nothing to do with it . A former Public Works Committee recommended that competitive designs should be called for that building, and this House, rightly or wronglyI suggest rightly-adopte d the report, and the Government advertised for competitive designs. We' cannot have too many brains at work in evolving designs for buildings. As the committee recommended the scheme, and the House approved of it , the Government can be relieved of blame. Committee recommend the rate of payment ? the Architects Association.' The architects have their union, and there is a union rate of pay of 6 per cent, for plans, specifications, and supervision, and no architect will do work for less. my honourable friend, as a trade unionist, would not work for less than the union rate of pay. and Melbourne many huge buildings on the drawing 6 per cent. The architects for the new Government Savings Banki n Sydney, which is costing £750,000, w i ll draw about the same amount as is to be paid to Mr Jones, who won the competition for the design for the first permanent administrative building at Canberra. pocket the whole of the £38,000. will find it necessary to employ persons not only' to assist h i m in the preparation of his drawings, but also to supervise the mixing of concrete, the class of material employed in the work of construction, and so for t h . make £10,000 for himself, but surely honourable members w ill not contend that that is not a f a i r return for a man who has won a competition among the architects of Australia. The honourable member for Dalley( Mr Mahony) declared that the Government was getting away w it h thousands of pounds, and had evaded the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act. The Government has done nothing of the sort: I shall state the whole position, and leave it to honourable members to decide whether the action taken by the Government has been w it h in the provisions of that act.. A t the outset, I may say that Ministers agree with the view taken by the Public Works Committee. In its report On the proposal to erect hostels at Canberra the Public Works Committee recommended the Government to push on w it h the building of cottages as speedily as possible. Rightly or wrongly, honourable members on all sides were urging the Government to push on with the work of getting to Canberra as speedily as possible. The honourable member for Wannon( Mr Rodgers) has said that the Government should give earnest consideration to the question of transferring public servants. As a matter of fact, Ministers have had this matter in handfor years past. SubT h a t is determined by committees of Cabinet have dealt with the question, and the Canberra Commission has evolved a scheme for the transferring of officers from Melbourne to Canberra. I came into the Government Even imagining, like a lot of honourable members do, that w i th a wave of a wand one could transfer the officers to their I can point out in Sydney new quarters at Canberra, but I was very speedily awakened to a realization cost of which architects are of the difficulties of the position. By inquiries as to bow many officers are to be transferred this year, next year, and so on, over a period of five years, the commission arrived at the number of houses required this year, next year, and so on, for five years. It then told the But Mr Jones w ill not .Government that if it was decided to He open Parliament at Canberra on the 26th January next, it would be an exceedingly difficult task to accommodate the public officers who would have to be transferred by that time, but that if the opening of Parliament was postponed u n t i l the He may 9th May it could accommodate so many officers. When the Prime Minister made his statement that Parliament would not",55,Setup

37,Mr Marr,"open at Canberra until tbe 9th May, it was because if an earlier date had been decided upon, it would have been impossible to provide accommodation for the public officers who would require to be in the Territory before Parliament sat there. The commission informed the Government that in any circumstances it would be necessary to build 500 or 600 cottages. tiations the Government has been in close touch with the public Servant.

Less than an hour ago the honourable member discussed with me a deputation of members from Queensland, that is to wait upon the Prime Minister to ask him to consider the opinions of the growers, but the honourable member said not a word about that in his speech, nor did he give the slightest indication that anybody but himself is concerned in the fate of the cotton-growing industry. He is endeavouring to obtain a political advantage, and is more than justifying the statement made concerning him by the Minister for Trade and Customs a few days ago. By resorting to these tactics, the honourable member is not "" playing cricket,"" nor is he helping to create an atmosphere in this Parliament thab would be helpful to the interests of the Queensland producers or to the favourable consideration of their just claims.
