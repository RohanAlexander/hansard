Copies of the schedule are the information of honourable members, I bers, and it will be incorporated in Hansard. The document read as followsTHE SPEAKER’S SCHEDULE OF OUTSTANDING GOVERNMENT RESPONSES TO REPORTS OF HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AND JOINT COMMITTEES (also incorporating reports tabled and details of Government responses made in the period between 26 June 2008, the date of the last schedule, and 4 December 2008) 4 December 2008 TO COMMITTEE REPORTS The attached schedule lists committee reports tabled and government responses to House and joint committee reports made since the last schedule was presented on 26 June 2008. It also lists reports for which the House has not received a government response. A schedule of outstanding responses will continue to be presented at approximately six monthly intervals, generally in the last sitting weeks of the winter and spring sittings. The schedule does not include advisory reports on bills introduced into the House of Representatives unless the reports make recommendations which are wider than the provisions of the bills and which could be the subject of a government response. The Government’s response to these reports is apparent in the resumption of consideration of the relevant legislation by the House. Also not included are reports from the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, the House of Representatives Committee of Members’ Interests, the Committee of Privileges, the Publications Committee (other than reports on inquiries) and the Selection Committee. Government responses to reports of the Public Works Committee are normally reflected in motions for the approval of works after the relevant report has been presented and considered. Reports from other committees which do not include recommendations are only included when first tabled. Reports of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit primarily make administrative recommendations but may make policy recommendations. A government response is required in respect of such policy recommendations made by the committee. However, responses to administrative recommendations are made in the form of an Executive Minute provided to, and subsequently tabled by, the committee. Agencies responding to administrative recommendations are required to provide an Executive Minute within 6 months of tabling a report. The committee monitors the provision of such responses. Reports which do not contain policy recommendations are only included when first tabled.",116,Personal Explanations

317,Mr Albanese (Grayndler,"Leader ofThursday, 4 December 2008 ----Petition: Paterson Electorate Roads 1,500 constituents from the electorate of Paterson who are concerned about the current state of the Bucketts Way-one of the most significant roads in the Hunter region, connecting the rural communities of Raymond Terrace and Gloucester, Wingham and Taree. This petition, which is over 64 pages long, refers to the urgent need for the Rudd Labor government to match a coalition multimillion dollar pledge if re-elected to develop passing lanes along the Bucketts Way or risk needlessly ending the lives of countless people prematurely due to unsafe driving conditions. The coalition committed $12 million if re-elected to introduce passing lanes at various points along the Bucketts Way. These lanes would have ranged in length from 500 metres to 800 metres on both the northern and southbound lanes. Whilst in government the coalition committed to the betterment of roads in the Paterson electorate by providing invaluable assistance and I demand that the Rudd Labor government continue to keep up this legacy and ensure the well-being of Paterson residents and tourists alike. The need for passing lanes along the Bucketts Way is dire. With Christmas time fast approaching it is a poignant reminder of the stress incurred by thousands of local residents who live in close proximity to the Bucketts Way and have to cope with increased congestion on their roads. Unfortunately, most years around the holiday season there is an accident located along the Pacific Highway. Consequently the RTA management plan is often to divert traffic along the Bucketts Way-a road which in its present state is essentially a country road without any passing lanes. It is not adequately equipped to handle such heavy traffic conditions safely. Bucketts Way is a major route in the Paterson electorate and requires immediate attention. The Rudd Labor government must listen to the cries of over 1,500 constituents of the Paterson electorate and fund passing lanes along the Bucketts Way to improve driver safety, ease congestion and decrease risk-taking and possible road fatalities. The constituents who have signed this petition demand that these improvements take place on the principle that if they are not met then lives will be lost needlessly on roads that are not up to standard. The Prime Minister and the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government should quit wasting time pondering political pointscoring that may eventuate from injecting money into fixing the Bucketts Way and instead use that time productively to contribute funds to repairing one of the major transport arteries of the Paterson electorate. People die on roads, and asking for more funding is not out of line-it is my duty as a representative of the people and I will not rest until the needs of the Paterson community are served. I present the petition to the House.

Passing lanes are imperative to improve safety and save lives. A re-elected Coalition Government committed $12 million to introduce passing lams at various points on the Bucketts Way.

World AIDS Day Ms PLIBERSEK (Sydney-Minister for Housing and Minister for the Status of Women) (9.33 am)-This week was the 20th anniversary of the first World AIDS Day. HIV is an illness that is not going to go away. There are now about 10,000 people in NSW living with HIV. Of course the nature of the illness has changed a great deal in recent decades. People are living much longer and living much healthier and more productive lives thanks to many advances in medicine. Of course, even though the general experience is that people are living longer and staying healthier, not everyone with HIV has been made ‘well’ by antiretroviral drug regimes. There are still many people who experience ill health from HIV, and a lot of people also have problems with security of income, housing and staying connected to the community to combat social isolation. The theme of this year’s World AIDS Day is: ‘Enjoy life. Take control. Stop HIV/AIDS.’ As I said, while AIDS may no longer be a death sentence, there is still no known cure or vaccine. This means that it is still very important for people to be vigilant, to practise safe sex and to look after themselves. There are many organisations in my electorate that serve my constituents who are living with HIV-organisations like the Bobby Goldsmith Foundation, ACON, Positive Living and the Luncheon Club. I was very happy to note this week that the Minister for Health and Ageing, Nicola Roxon, announced $150,000 over two years to the Albion Street Centre in my electorate to coordinate a network of 30 regional World Health Organisation collaborating centres for HIV-AIDS across 10 countries in the Asia-Pacific region. It is important that, while we continue to be vigilant in Australia and to ensure that we keep new infection rates low, we also play a role in our region. We have on our doorstep countries like PNG and Indonesia where infection rates are very high, potentially reaching epidemic proportions, and it is very important for Australia to do its bit to help get the prevention message into those communities and reduce infection rates there. In New South Wales there are over 10,000 people living with HIV, and the HIV infection rate has increased by around five per cent each year. The infection rate, of course, has slowed, but it is very important to understand that new infections continue to arise in the community and that we do have a responsibility to do all we can to keep those infection rates low and also to make life as good in quality as possible for those people who live with HIV. MAIN COMMITTEE Barker Electorate: Lake Bonney graphic centre of the Riverland in South Australia, in the mighty electorate of Barker. The natural, sparkling freshwater lake is fed from the Murray River via Chambers Creek-I should say it was fed, until the Rann state Labor government stoppage of River Murray water flow into Lake Bonney in September 2007. On the lake is the township of Barmera, which has a population of approximately 4,000 people. Being a tourist town and in a major fruit-growing area, the township of Barmera depends on Lake Bonney for much of its income. The system of water allocation to date has been controlled by the states, and greed rather than common sense frequently dictated the allocation of water. Notwithstanding that South Australians are very efficient users of water-indeed, our state only uses around six per cent of the total water allocated out of the system-Lake Bonney’s and South Australia’s biggest problem is that we are at the end of the line. As a consequence of being cut off from the Murray River last year, the Lake Bonney waterline wetland has receded and become saline. Recently we saw massive amounts of fish of a number of species die off at Lake Bonney. Just last week, hundreds of golden perch, redfin, bony bream and carp were found dead on the shores of the lake, where 10 dead Murray cod have also been found. One cod, estimated to be about 25 years old, was more than 1.3 metres long. University of Adelaide studies indicate that the fish were killed by a lack of oxygen caused by reduced water flows and dying plant life. Environmental and community groups have been calling for the government to save the lake since it was cut off from the River Murray more than a year ago. The blame for allowing water in the lake to reach high salinity levels lies with state Labor governments for failing to take earlier action. In June of this year, the South Australian Murray-Darling Basin Natural Resources Management Board recommended that Lake Bonney in South Australia be provided with a water allocation of 20 gigalitres by October to prevent ecological problems. WhilstI am pleased to note that 10 gigalitres will be delivered over the next few months, it will only be a partial refill. Last year Minister Maywald said that temporary closure of Lake Bonney was necessary to ensure delivery of water to Adelaide. This is a city-centric mindset whereby natural wetlands are sacrificed to a city which draws 80 gigalitres of water from the Murray for consumption and yet, according to the government’s own figures, allows 160 gigalitres of stormwater to flow out into the Gulf of St Vincent. We can no longer afford to let precious water go out to sea. It is a waste and ecological madness. We need to ensure that Adelaide manages water effectively and, in doing so, reduces its reliance on the River Murray. This in turn will provide additional environmental flows and additional water for food producers and irrigators who rely on the river. Petition: Make Poverty History Campaign Ms HALL (Shortland) (9.39 am)-I rise to table a petition about an issue that has been raised by constituents of mine, the Baptist Church in Kotara and St Luke’s Uniting Church in Belmont, about the Make Poverty History campaign. The petition highlights issues of great importance in that campaign. Members of those churches are asking for the parliament to pledge support to reduce child mortality and improve maternal health, which are two of the eight Millennium Development Goals. They highlight the point that, in South Asia and the MAIN COMMITTEE",247,Constituency Statements

The women from the churches are very committed to the campaign. They also asked me to thank Bob McMullan, the Parliamentary Secretary for International Development Assistance, for his commitment to invest an additional $300,000 for water and sanitisation by 2010, and the Prime Minister for his commitment to lift aid to 0.5 per cent of gross national income. They would still like to see that aid lifted to 0.7 per cent by 2015, and they highlighted the fact that, in our region, there are a number of countries that are really struggling to meet the millennium goals. In countries as close as East Timor one in 600 women die in childbirth, so a lot of work needs to be done. They highlighted that, since the adoption of the millennium goals in 2000, there has been much progress, with children attending school, immunisation and children surviving past their fifth birthday. However, they would like Australia to do a bit more and contribute a bit more to help those countries that are really struggling to meet their targets. They believe that it would be very useful if we would increase our contribution to I table the concerns of my constituents and put on record that they are a fine group of women from fine churches that really care not only about their community but also about other struggling communities throughout the world. I am pleased to present the petition. Standing Committee on Petitions for its consideration. It will be accepted subject to confirmation by the committee that it conforms to the standing orders. Stirling Electorate: Nollamara Shopping Centre thing I worked very hard to achieve in my electorate of Stirling-that is, to make my electorate safer for local residents, especially elderly people and families. The week before last I was very pleased to welcome the Leader of the Opposition to the Stirling electorate and, jointly, we visited the Nollamara Shopping Centre, where, along with the Mayor of the City of Stirling, Councillor David Boothman, we had the pleasure of launching the new CCTV surveillance camera system. The CCTV camera system was installed at Nollamara shops by the City of Stirling after the federal government offered a grant from the National Communities Crime Prevention Program of $85,000, as part of the previous Howard government’s $1.5 billion national security package. I am very sorry to say the Rudd Labor government has since disbanded this very effective local law and order program. The need for increased security measures at Nollamara Shopping Centre became apparent following a vicious attack last year on a man who was using a bank ATM at the centre outside of business hours. The incident was particularly serious. This man was attacked with an axe in an absolutely unprovoked way, and urgent action was warranted to address security in the area. I was happy to join forces with the City of Stirling to lodge a funding application to the National Community Crime Prevention Program for the installation of CCTV at the shopping centre. As I just said, $85,000 was allocated from that program and that system has now been launched. Sixteen security cameras have been installed around the shopping centre precinct. That includes six additional security cameras, which is beyond the 10 initially considered to be adequate for the scope of the project. This new CCTV system will help make the NollaMAIN COMMITTEE",249,Constituency Statements

It was very important to secure this federal funding so the City of Stirling could proceed with this project. The city has done an excellent job in delivering the new security system; it does generally do an excellent job in providing for local security needs. The CCTV system aims to increase the feeling of safety at the centre and will be used to assist police. I am sure the new CCTV surveillance system at the Nollamara shops will increase the feeling of safety at the centre for the local community. Following the CCTV launch, the opposition leader and I met with local residents and shop owners, and they were very pleased about the installation of the new system and very pleased that we had taken this positive step to secure the shops and the local area. I am always pleased to work with my local government area, the City of Stirling, and to help to improve safety and security within the electorate of Stirling. This project is only one of several that we were able to fund through the previous program, and I congratulate them on their efforts. Kingsford Smith Electorate: Volunteers (9.45 am)-It is a great pleasure to rise to give due recognition to the role that volunteers play in our community, particularly in Kingsford Smith. I specifically want to note not only the efforts of the surf-lifesaving clubs and those who work in women’s refuges and sporting clubs but also, in particular, the Kooloora Community Centre, whose 20th anniversary celebration I attended earlier this year. For the last 20 years, Kooloora has played an important role in the electorate of Kingsford Smith. It is situated in Malabar and it serves some of the most disadvantaged in our community. I have had the pleasure of visiting and working with Kooloora on a number of occasions since my election. I have been greatly impressed by the commitment of the team who work at the centre. Kooloora provides a number of really useful and worthwhile programs: fitness for seniors, vacation child care, toddler playgroups, computer classes, a women’s support network, an environment group and social bus trips, to name just a few. Of particular interest to me is a service that they provide particularly for elderly people in the community, which is the provision of fresh fruit and vegetables: volunteers collect bags of fresh fruit and veg for community members to purchase for $10 over the week. Those are luxury items for many people, so this service ensures that those who need this healthy food the most can actually purchase it. Additionally, Kooloora plays a significant role in the civic life of the community. It holds ‘meet the candidates’ forums prior to federal and state elections. These forums give residents the opportunity to hear first hand from the candidates of the different political parties as well as the ability to ask them penetrating and incisive questions. You are really put on your mettle when you go to the Kooloora Community Centre. I want to make special mention of the commitment of Julie Spies, who leads the organisation and has provided untiring and unstinting effort for many years to build the Kooloora Community Centre into an organisation that plays a central and pivotal role in our community of Kingsford Smith. Additionally, volunteers such as George and Gillian Collinson serve tireMAIN COMMITTEE",250,Unicef And Other Organisations Such As Theirs

A 2006 ABS report found that the volunteer sector is worth some $42 billion. I know everyone in the parliament recognises that the contribution of volunteers to community well-being is absolutely essential. Our volunteers are at the heart of our community and I want to place on the record my appreciation for the work that is done not only by the Kooloora Community Centre but also by the many other volunteers associations in the electorate of Kingsford Smith. Finally, before my speaking time runs out, I would like to wish the Rainbow Street Child Care Centre all the best for the new premises and all the success in the coming year for the important work that they will be doing. McEwen Electorate: Fuel Prices FRAN BAILEY (McEwen) (9.48 am)-I rise in this place today to bring to the attention of the parliament a couple of matters which are of great concern to constituents in my electorate. The first of these is the disparity in the price of LPG between what my constituents pay at the local garage and what they pay for the same LPG if it is delivered to their homes for the purposes of heating and cooking. I want to place on record my appreciation of Ms Sally-Anne Scrivener for the fantastic work that she has done within the Macedon Ranges communities in collecting signatures for a petition which has in fact been lodged in this our national parliament. My local residents tell me that they actually watch trucks deliver supplies of LPG to local garages and that the same trucks then go on the rounds and deliver LPG, sourced from the same supply company, to homes. This is in the rural areas of my electorate, but it does in fact occur in the outer metropolitan areas as well. Madam Deputy Speaker Burke, I am sure that you and other members of the House would be astounded to know that the same LPG has a price differential of up to 30c a litre. Some of the most disadvantaged households within my electorate have to pay so much extra money simply to be able to do their cooking and heat their homes in the middle of winter. Let me say that the Macedon Ranges in particular get very cold in winter and we frequently have snow, especially around the Woodend area. This is a terrible inequity. I do not understand why there is that price differential. Anyone who I have sought information from cannot explain to me why there is that price differential. I pay tribute to the work that Sally-Anne has done. She has done a fantastic job in making sure that people throughout the rural areas of the McEwen electorate are aware of this. This will be an issue that I will certainly be following up in the future, not just for the people of my electorate as I am sure that this is replicated in rural areas around Australia. Fremantle Electorate: Cantonment Hill Ms PARKE (Fremantle) (9.52 am)-I rise today to speak about Cantonment Hill, a precious jewel in the historic city of Fremantle. In 1892, Cantonment Hill was gifted by the Crown to the City of Fremantle forever ‘for the purposes of a public garden’, equivalent to the public open space of Perth’s Kings Park. However, in the lead-up to World War I, Cantonment Hill was requisitioned by the Defence department and it remains in Defence’s hands today, despite having been classified for more than a decade as surplus to requirements. NotwithMAIN COMMITTEE standing almost a century of Defence control and restricted access, Cantonment Hill remains of high value to the Fremantle community. The site is significant in so many different ways: Indigenous, historical, environmental, social and cultural. It is closely associated with the development of Fremantle, with the state’s military history and with national coastal defence system development. The site has numerous heritage listings and has cultural significance for the traditional owners, the Nyoongar people, to whom it is known as Dwerda Weeardinup, or place of the Dingo Spirit. The artillery barracks house the WA Army Museum, containing the most significant collection of military items outside the Australian War Memorial. For 15 years, Cantonment Hill has been listed as a system 6 reserve-of the highest environmental significance-by the state. It has quality remnant bushland and the last mainland stands of Rottnest Island pine. The rare orange-breasted parrots and nesting sea eagles have been sighted there. Since the first inkling in 1989 that the site might be parcelled and sold, a steady groundswell of local community support has risen to pursue the cause of keeping the land in public hands for public use. In 1997 the Cantonment Hill Residents Action Group was formed and in 2000 the group mobilised to block sale of the hill and the adjacent artillery barracks to Notre Dame University. In January 2001, the previous, Howard government announced it would gift the site to the state and vest it with the City of Fremantle. However this did not happen, much to the disappointment of the Fremantle community. The defence department is now considering the City of Fremantle’s request for a concession sale. The city certainly could not afford to pay the market price of $1.6 million, nor should it have to, given that the land was originally gifted by the Crown to the people of Fremantle in perpetuity. The City of Fremantle intends to restore the land for public use, in particular to maintain Tuckfield Oval, rehabilitate the signal station for the purpose of making it into an interpretation centre and public lookout, create a safe public park and regenerate the native bushland. In September I met with John Syms and Patrick Howard of the Cantonment Hill Residents Action Group. They have been steadfast community leaders in their efforts to keep Cantonment Hill as public space and they have lobbied for this cause to many before me. It is time that this issue was put to rest. It is time that this rare earth is gifted or sold at little cost back to the City of Fremantle for the public good. I am confident that this government will ensure the right outcome for Fremantle. Forrest Electorate: Chefs Long Table Lunch Ms MARINO (Forrest) (9.54 am)-I rise to support the Chefs Long Table Lunch Voluntary Organising Committee in Bunbury in my electorate. The Chefs Long Table Lunch is an outstanding community event that has been held every February since 2004. This outstanding community event was the brainchild of Bunbury’s own national award-winning caterer Leonie Kershaw. Not only did Leonie want to provide a showcase for the south-west’s awardwinning chefs to use the mostly donated wonderful local and regional food and wines to tempt the now 500 guests who sit down to a fabulous feast under huge marquees on the foreshore in Bunbury overlooking the picturesque waterway of the Leschenault Inlet but she also wanted to contribute to the many worthwhile community charities. MAIN COMMITTEE There have been two major beneficiaries of the hard-working, dedicated and extremely energetic group of chefs long table volunteers who help Leonie. In 2008, $61,000 went to the very worthwhile South West Women’s Refuge, a non-profit organisation providing sanctuary and positive support to women and children experiencing violence in their family environment. An additional $28,000 went to smaller groups and families in need. In 2007, $46,000 was given to the Val Lishman Health Research Foundation to help fund a research project focused on youth suicide prevention in the south-west. This project launched recently in Bunbury is expected to take 18 months to complete and has been made possible by the $46,000 donated from the Chefs Long Table Lunch of 2007. The local Riding for the Disabled group also received $6,000. Silver Chain received $20,000 for a car for south-west residents in 2006. The 2004-05 donations totalling $14,000 were dedicated to the Bunbury timber jetty. The community has embraced this wonderful concept, queuing up for tickets and then bringing their absolute determination to have a great day out as they enjoy the culinary delights, premium wines, live music and dancing on offer. I hope that I have made you all want to come along and share this event. I wish to acknowledge Leonie Kershaw, the outstanding committee, the chefs who donate their time and talent as well as the veritable army of happy volunteers. Not only do they all combine to provide those attending with a special experience; their efforts and the community support ensure that very deserving local charitable organisations receive the funding they so desperately need. I was delighted to see the Chefs Long Table Lunch reach the finals of the 2008 Regional Achievement and Community Awards from a very strong field of nominees from right across regional Western Australia. I congratulate and thank everyone involved and wish the chefs long table group well for the 2009 Chefs Long Table Lunch. I am going to be there. Thorndale Foundation dertaken by the Thorndale Foundation. The Thorndale Foundation is a not-for-profit organisation that provides accommodation, community participation and employment opportunities for people with an intellectual disability. This year the Thorndale Foundation is celebrating its 50th anniversary. Thorndale was established in 1958 by a group of local families with children with intellectual disabilities. At this time the trend was for these children to be placed in an institution; however, these families chose to fight to ensure that their children were given the opportunity to grow up as active participants in our community. In 1959 Mr Clem Payne approached the Mayor of Penrith requesting that a public meeting be called to discuss the possibility of starting a school for children with an intellectual disability. Various local groups and organisations were contacted and a meeting was held. A committee was formed, headed by MrA Little, the former Headmaster of Kingswood Public School. The Ex-Naval Men’s Hall in Penrith was hired as the school’s first premises. On3 June 1959 classes commenced with two teachers and 14 students. On the first day of classes the school was presented with its first bus by the Penrith Lions Club. The school was officially opened on 29 August 1959. Twelve months after opening, the school was given the name ‘Thorndale’ in recognition of the significant contribution made by Mrs Jean Thornley and Mr Jack Daly, neither of whom had a child with an intellectual disability.

Thorndale has provided to many people with an intellectual disability the opportunity to work and be active participants in our local community. The foundation has grown from its modest beginnings as a school to now providing a range of services, including a supported employment program, accommodation facilities and centre based community programs. These services have provided the foundation’s clients with the opportunity to be active in their community, enjoy social interaction, achieve personal growth and build their own self-esteem. Earlier this year I had the opportunity to attend an open day held by the foundation and was able to see first hand some of the foundation’s important work in my electorate. More importantly, however, I was able to see the positive impact that this foundation has had on its clients and their families. I take this opportunity to acknowledge the efforts of the CEO, Helen Carter; the board of directors, Chairperson Cathy Gault, Brian Goodridge, Jan Caspers, Peter Smith and Tim Morris; and all the staff and volunteers of the foundation. The Thorndale Foundation is a wonderful example of what can be achieved when determined people have great aspirations for their loved ones and commit themselves and their energies to ensuring that these aspirations are realised. I congratulate the foundation on its 50th anniversary and wish Thorndale all the best for the future. 193 the time for constituency statements has concluded. Hon. Francis (Frank) Daniel Crean Debate resumed from 3 December, on motion by Mr Rudd: That the House record its deep regret at the death on 2 December 2008 of the Honourable Frank Crean, former Federal Treasurer and Deputy Prime Minister of the Commonwealth of Australia, and place on record its appreciation of his long public service and tender its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement. moved by the Prime Minister for the Hon. Frank Crean. I first came into contact with Frank Crean in the 1960s through my friendship with his son the late Stephen Crean, with whom I attended Melbourne High School-‘the honourable Stephen’, as we then called him in mock deference to his father’s political prominence. It was a great sadness when Stephen was lost in a blizzard. I met Frank Crean again in the course of the 1970s when I was working for Malcolm Fraser and then again in the course of the 1980s when he was appointed a member of the Australian Institute of Multicultural Affairs, of which I was director. Frank was remarkably accessible, considerate and supportive of the institute and its objectives. Malcolm Fraser, who is not an easy person to get plaudits from, described Frank Crean as ‘one of the most decent and honourable members of parliament I have ever met’. I think it is worth noting that all the senior liberal parliamentarians who watched him move through the vicissitudes of the Whitlam government held him in the highest regard for his integrity and his decency. That at the end of this troubled period he assumed the position of Deputy Leader of the Labor Party and Deputy Prime Minister of Australia attests to his qualities and to his commitment to Australia and the MAIN COMMITTEE",254,Unicef And Other Organisations Such As Theirs

My sincere condolences go to his wife, Mary, his sons, Simon and David, and to the family. am)-I of course also wish to add my voice to the condolence motion in respect of the late Hon. Frank Crean. Frank was Deputy Prime Minister in 1975 and Minister for Trade in 1974 and 1975, and prior to that was Treasurer in the Whitlam government from 1972 to 1974. He was the member for Melbourne Ports-an electorate in which I lived for 14 years-for 26 years from 1951 to 1977. Further evidence of his commitment to public service can be found in the fact that he was a member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly from 1945 to 1947, whereupon he lost the election but returned to the Legislative Assembly and served again from 1949 to 1951, when he was elected as the federal member for Melbourne Ports. Frank Crean was unquestionably one of the great Labor politicians of the 20th century. I believe Frank Crean was the embodiment of many Labor values, including the belief in fairness and justice in society, which runs through the great Labor tradition. AlthoughI met Frank on a number of occasions only over the last 10 years, in the latter period of his life, I have known his son Simon since 1985 when I happened to be in attendance at the ACTU executive meeting, which was his first upon his election as President of the ACTU. The meeting was held in Newcastle, where I now reside. All who know Frank’s family would concur with the fact that Frank and his wife, Mary, passed on to all their sons-Simon, David and Stephen-all the Labor values that are so important to our movement. In particular, they passed on a sense of personal decency and the importance of personal integrity and how one must conduct oneself. All of those values not only encompassed a general commitment to social justice but also accompanied a very practical understanding, embodied in Frank, of the nature of the Australian economy and of the importance of economic growth in the achievement of social justice. In his first speech to the House of Representatives on 26 June 1951, which I was perusing this morning, all of those Labor values and beliefs were firmly on display and placed on the record. In his first speech, Frank spoke extensively about economic issues and the importance of increasing productivity, for example, as a means to achieve social justice. He said: … it is equally important, even should that productivity be increased, to consider how the total productivity is shared among the various sections of the community. That involves a matter of social justice, of quality as well as of quantity. He went on to make observations about wages growth at the time, saying: … sections of the community are receiving a greater proportionate share of national income at the expense of the majority of the peoplethe wage earners. Frank, in his maiden speech, also articulated a very strong commitment to the machinery of the conciliation and arbitration system as a means of achieving a fairer distribution of income. Frank also understood and respected, as was observed in his conduct through his many years of service, the role of trade unions as part of the wider labour movement in pursuit of a fairer distribution of income and more just outcomes in society. Frank also made a range of observations in his first speech that I think were pertinent about the taxation system and its distributive effect. Referring to the period immediately prior to the Second World War, he said: MAIN COMMITTEE",255,Condolences
327,Mr Combet (Charlton,"Parliamentary Secretary for Defence Procurement) (10.02… the Commonwealth relied principally upon indirect methods of taxation … for its revenues. Such moneys were collected from the people, not according to their capacity to their pay, but according to their consumption of particular articles. But the most socially desirable form of taxation, because it is the most socially equitable, is the progressive income tax, which is levied on individuals according to their capacity to pay. A Labour government was the first administration in Australia to recognize that there were certain desirable social principles to be followed in the levying of taxes. A Labour government was the first administration in this country to impose income tax; and … it is possible, by the use of that taxation instrument, to redistribute the national income, taking money from people according to their capacity to pay and redistributing it according to various categories of social need. I have referred extensively to some of Frank Crean’s economic observations because his practical understanding of the economy, combined with his values and principles, is evidenced throughout his 26 years of public service as a parliamentarian in this place and in the representation of his constituents. He took that experience and belief into his time as Treasurer in the Whitlam government. That is particularly pertinent because lessons learnt from that period of time have informed Labor’s approach to economic management and the pursuit of its social justice goals since that time. Within the Labor movement today, Frank Crean is rightly recognised-and most recently by the Prime Minister in his condolence motion to the House yesterday-as one of the finest ministers in the Whitlam government and as having brought a depth of economic knowledge to that role. The records of the time clearly demonstrate Frank’s concern about the economic conditions in the first couple of years of the Whitlam government: the pressure of rapidly expanding expenditure and the importance of tighter fiscal policy to help contain inflation. The cabinet submissions sponsored by Frank Crean, which have become available under the 30-years rule, demonstrate that in 1973 expenditure was growing by around 15½ per cent and that there were significant wage pressures. It is easy to gain the impression, when perusing the reports and the records from that time, that Frank Crean was something of a lone voice. One can only imagine the pressures that he must have felt. That is consistent with the theme that I was articulating a moment ago-that is, his belief that, to achieve social equity and social justice, there needed to be sound economic management and that a strong economy can lead to a fair society. In the Labor movement I think it is fair to say that, following the Whitlam government period, the lessons and the thinking of Frank Crean as Treasurer at the time, and his thoughts in relation to that period, were subsequently enormously influential in shaping the economic approach of the Hawke and Keating governments. History demonstrates that Labor became great economic reformers in the 1980s and the 1990s and far more disciplined in economic management, cognisant of the need for market liberalisation and a more efficient allocation of resources yet retaining commitment to fair and equitable outcomes. I think that the son of Frank and Mary, Simon, embodies this approach very strongly in today’s parliament as the member for Hotham, as the Minister for Trade, as a former parliamentary leader of the Labor Party and as in fact a member of the Labor executive since 1990. I have tremendously high regard for Simon. I particularly enjoyed the time during which we worked together in leadership roles in the labour movement, he after 2001 as parliamentary leader and me as ACTU secretary. David Crean was equally influenced by the family environment and their values and the economic discourse that must have occurred around the famMAIN COMMITTEE ily. He served as a parliamentarian in the Tasmanian parliament and also as Treasurer of the state. I have a great degree of admiration for Frank Crean’s contribution to the Labor movement and I am firm in the belief, as I indicated at the outset, that he was one of the titans of the Labor movement in the 20th century. He and Mary had a partnership that extended well beyond 60 years. They experienced terrible tragedy, too, with the loss of their son Stephen in 1985. As anyone who witnesses parents who lose a child knows, it was a dreadful experience, particularly given the circumstances of that loss. I extend my condolences to Mary Crean, to Simon and David and to all of the members of the extended Crean family. Ms GEORGE (Throsby) (10.11 am)-I join with the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition to note with great sadness the passing of the Hon. Frank Crean, former Deputy Prime Minister of Australia, who, until his death, held the distinction of being the oldest former member of the House of Representatives. My connection with Frank and Mary Crean is through their son Simon, who played an instrumental role in both the National Union of Workers and the ACTU in the 1980s. In 1981, Simon Crean became vice-president of the ACTU and then its president in 1985. It was during this period that I worked closely with Simon and his very long standing and close friend Bill Kelty. Simon played a key role in negotiating several accords with the Labor government headed then by former ACTU president Bob Hawke. It was interesting to hear the reflections of the member for Charlton when he read excerpts from Frank Crean’s first speech in this House. The economic worldview held by Frank and his approach to economic growth and productivity and social justice must have played a very important role in shaping the enormous contribution that Simon made throughout that decade in trying to forge a better Australia. As I said, it was through my friendship with Simon in that period that I got to know Frank and Mary; Simon’s wife, Carole; his brother, David; and members of the extended family. Fate has it that my partner, Denis Lennen, was also a long-time friend of the Creans. He and Simon go back probably 30 years and more. It was a very tight-knit family; a genuine Labor family. Public service was at the core of the family’s beliefs. In reading and reflecting about Frank’s life, one comes to understand better the meaning of ‘like father, like son’. There is so much of Frank that continues to live through Simon and his brother, David. Born in Hamilton in Victoria in 1916, Frank Crean was struck by adversity at a very early age. I read that he spent a year in bed with rheumatic fever at age 13. Adversities like that help shape a person’s commitments and values later in life. I read-and I do not know if the story is right-that in that formative period of Frank’s life he relied very much on books provided by one of his neighbours, who just happened to be the secretary of the local ALP branch and a member of the AWU. Frank did very well at school and went on to live in Melbourne to attend the prestigious Melbourne Boys High School, as did Simon much later. He graduated with degrees in arts and commerce and a diploma in public administration. He had a lengthy association with the Labor Party, going back to his formal joining of the party in 1942. He was elected as the representative for the seat of Albert Park in the Victorian Legislative Assembly in 1945 and later for the seat of Prahran in 1949. He was a very earnest local member. I remember that, in the time when I lived in Melbourne, wherever you went Frank Crean was a very well-known local dignitary, and people remember his dedicated years MAIN COMMITTEE of service. As well as doing all that and being such a good local representative, he was alsoand I did not know this-president of the Young Labor Association, president of the Victorian Fabian Society and president of the Council of Adult Education. So he was not just serving as a local representative but also contributing to the ideas and policy formation that are so important for the Labor Party. In 1951 he contested the seat of Melbourne Ports and, amazingly, he held that seat for 26 years and through 11 federal elections. That is a distinction in its own right. When Labor won office in 1972 after 23 years in the political wilderness, Frank Crean went on to become the nation’s federal Treasurer in very difficult economic times. The member for Charlton, in his contribution, outlined the challenges that faced Frank Crean in his capacity as Treasurer. Later he became the Minister for Overseas Trade-so, again, like father like son; we see our colleague Simon Crean now carrying out that role with great distinction-and later on he became the Deputy Prime Minister of this nation until the dismissal of the Whitlam government in 1975. Frank finally retired from the federal parliament in 1977. He was also, for a lengthy period of time, a member of the executive of the federal parliamentary Labor Party, holding a position on that executive from 1955 until his retirement in 1977. It is amazing to think that, although he reached the heights of being the Deputy Prime Minister of this nation, of Frank’s 26 years in federal parliament only three were actually served in government, but, as I said earlier, contesting 11 elections, particularly in that part of Melbourne, is no mean feat. Frank married Mary Findlay in 1946. Mary was Frank’s bedrock in a marriage of 63 years. Mary’s contribution to Frank’s political career is inestimable. As well, her contribution in accepting the major responsibility of rearing three wonderful sons is something that she should take a lot of credit for-the three sons, Simon, David and Stephen, and the six wonderful grandchildren. It is no surprise that Simon and David followed in Frank’s footsteps, devoting themselves to the notion of public service. It was a great tragedy for the family to lose their son and brother Stephen in very tragic circumstances, but the family has always been a very close-knit and an inspirational one. When you see all the members of that extended family gathered at the Creans’ family home, you appreciate the strong bonds of affection and love that extend way beyond the immediate family. Frank Crean was a decent, dedicated and honourable man and a Labor man through and through, deeply committed to the party he loved and to the principle of public service. I believe he served the Labor Party with great distinction. On behalf of Denis Lennen and myself, I extend my sympathy to Mary Crean, to Simon and Carole, to David and Sue and to the extended family. Our thoughts are with you in this difficult time. is with deep regret that I too note the passing of the former Deputy Prime Minister, Treasurer and Minister for Overseas Trade, the Hon. Frank Crean, MP. Being a party man to the end it is perhaps no coincidence that Frank Crean passed away on 2 December 2008, the 36th anniversary of the election of the Whitlam government. There can be no doubt that Frank Crean was a genuine Labor legend. He was instrumental in transforming Labor into an election winning force following a long and frustrating period in opposition. We on this side of the House will never underestimate his contribution in building and rebuilding the party during some of its darkest days, culminating in his delivery in 1973 of the first Labor budget, following 23 long years in opposition. The honour of deliverMAIN COMMITTEE",256,Condolences
328,Mr Murphy (Lowe,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Trade) (10.19 am)-Iting that budget could not have been handed to a more dedicated and fiscally competent Treasurer. As Treasurer he faced very challenging international and domestic circumstances including a major oil shock, high inflation and rising unemployment. Frank Crean was a fellow of the Australian Society of Accountants. He obtained a diploma in public administration, an honours degree in arts and a bachelor of commerce. He was an authority on income tax. His qualifications alone would ensure that he was one of the outstanding figures in the Labor Party and one of the leading thinkers on how Australia could become a just, effective and competitive country under a Labor government. While the record will show that he had his disagreements with his cabinet colleagues, the record will also show he was very much respected. Frank Crean was a man with strong convictions. He was a man of passion. He was measured. He recognised that reform would only be achieved through cooperation and inclusion. Frank Crean’s considerable breadth of knowledge, depth of thinking and precision in application was not accompanied by a large ego. Indeed, as we all know, he was a truly humble man. Moreover, he was a man of quiet principle and, as many have noted, he was a very decent man. Like the majority of members on both sides of this House, Frank Crean entered parliament with an unselfish commitment to public service. He lived through two world wars and a great depression. His inspiration to redress social injustices and inequalities was no doubt stimulated by his observations of unemployment and poverty in his youth. He dedicated 30 years to parliamentary life. He pursued fundamental Labor values. He was a loyal and faithful servant of our party, the parliament and the constituents he so well represented. Despite the cynicism that can often be attached to those in parliamentary life, Frank Crean was publicly recognised as someone who did much to reaffirm the value of public service. As the Prime Minister mentioned yesterday in this place, Frank Crean was ‘deeply admired, just as he was a deeply principled man’. No one can ever doubt that he was motivated by the public interest and what was good for Australia. Those that served in this place with Frank Crean have spoken directly, personally and eloquently of his contribution. The member for Berowra has said: He was an exemplar in the way in which he carried out his own role, but he encouraged people like me, even though I was of a different political persuasion. Former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser has described Frank Crean as ‘one of the most decent and honourable members of parliament I have ever known’. The Leader of the Opposition, the honourable Malcolm Turnbull, said yesterday: In many ways it is in Frank Crean’s family that we find his greatest legacy. There can be no doubt that both David and Simon Crean grew up in a political environment, an environment imbued with policy discussions and an environment focussed on positive change for the future. It is no surprise that both Simon and David have had distinguished political careers in their own right. It is also no surprise that the unselfish values of their father have been passed on to them. I have worked very closely with Simon for many years, more recently as his Parliamentary Secretary for Trade, and observed Simon’s very considerable abilities, energy, diligence, fierce determination and devotion to faithfully serve our country-as many have said, ‘like father, like son’. Frank Crean’s intelligence, character, values and thorough decency burn MAIN COMMITTEE brightly through Simon in this place today. Indeed Simon and David both provide us with a perpetual reminder of their father’s humility, modesty and dedication to public service. On behalf of my wife, Adriana, and my staff, I extend my prayers and deepest sympathy to Mrs Mary Crean, her children, Simon and David, and their respective families. Just as they mourn the passing of a dedicated husband and father, we too mourn the passing of a dedicated Australian, a dedicated parliamentarian and a dedicated Labor Party member. May Frank Crean rest in peace. the seat that Frank Crean represented in this House for 26 years, it is an honour for me to rise in support of the motion moved by the Prime Minister and supported by the Leader of the Opposition. It would have given Frank Crean great pleasure to know that he was being farewelled in this place by a Labor Prime Minister, because he devoted his whole life to the service of the great Australian labour movement, as well as to his family and the people of Melbourne Ports. When Frank was elected as the Member for Melbourne Ports in 1951, succeeding another great Labor titan, Ted Holloway, it was a very different area to the one I now represent. It extended from Williamstown to Albert Park, and its core was the working class stronghold of Port Melbourne. It was only 20 years since the Depression and most of the people of the area had vivid memories of the unemployment, hunger and poverty they had suffered in those terrible years, brought about by the failure, as they saw it, of the capitalist system. It was Frank’s job to speak for that community here in Canberra, and he never forgot why he was here or who he represented. Other members have given an outline of Frank Crean’s career, which took him from Hamilton in the western district, where his father was a miner and a bicycle maker, to Melbourne University and then on to the office of Deputy Prime Minister. It was Frank Crean’s misfortune to be part of a generation of Labor politicians who were destined to spend most of their careers in opposition during the long rule of Sir Robert Menzies. These were the bitter years of division in the Labor movement between communists and groupers, and they often battled those groups in the Port Melbourne docks. Although Frank Crean had been preselected in 1951 as a supporter of the Left, he was always at heart a realist. He stayed loyal to the Labor Party in the great split of the 1950s, but he was never part of the outlandish ideological debates that took place in Victoria and he always supported a realistic line on issues. He was a proud graduate of Melbourne High School. I have, since 1988, continued the tradition of association with Melbourne High and the students of the VCE who have such an abiding interest in politics. Frank Crean was one of the first Labor members with a university education in economics, and he gradually steered Labor from its increasingly obsolete ideology of the Chifley era and helped lay the foundations for Gough Whitlam’s modernisation of the Labor Party in the 1960s. As many people have said, Frank was a modest and humble man. Frank and Mary Crean lived the whole of their married lives in Albert Park, and Frank was often seen riding the South Melbourne tram or shopping at the local market in Prahran. In fact, I often met him on the tram and/or at the Prahran market with my kids when they were little. He was always available to the working people of Port Melbourne, Albert Park and South Melbourne, which were not the gentrified suburbs they are today. He never thought he was better than them beMAIN COMMITTEE",259,Condolences
329,Mr Danby (Melbourne Ports) (10.26 Am),"As the present member for Melbourne Ports,cause he had a university degree or because he was an MP. In the days before MPs employed social workers in their electoral offices, Frank saw his electors himself whenever he could and did what he could to solve their problems. In 1969 the boundaries of Melbourne Ports were enlarged to include St Kilda and Elwood, which were then largely middle-class and Liberal voting areas. On the new boundaries, Melbourne Ports became a notionally Liberal seat. It is a tribute to Frank’s campaigning skills and his rapport with people that he rapidly won over these new areas for Labor and made Melbourne Ports nearly as safe as it was before. I think it is fair to say that when Frank Crean finally got to be a minister in 1972 he found the experience disappointing. Just as is happening now, the Liberals, having coasted for years on boom times, left Labor to cope with a crisis driven by overseas forces-in Frank’s case, the global recession that followed the oil shock of 1973. Frank Crean did not trust the orthodox economic advice he was getting from the Treasury but he sometimes lacked the support of his colleagues in cabinet for taking a different line. He was undermined by Jim Cairns and his supporters, and eventually Gough Whitlam shifted him from Treasury to trade. When Cairns self-destructed in the loans affair of 1975, Frank justly succeeded him as Deputy Prime Minister, an honour he fully deserved in view of his long and loyal service. After leaving politics, Frank could have retired to the Gold Coast, but he and Mary stayed in Albert Park and continued to work for the local people and for the Labor Party. He took a particular interest in the welfare of new immigrants who had moved into the area since the 1970s. He continued to go to local branch meetings and every election day-the last time was in 2001, when I think he was 85-he stood like an old soldier handing out how-to-vote cards at the Middle Park polling booth. I would see him when I was going round the booths. Frank was sustained by his strong Labor principles, his firm religious faith and the support of Mary Crean, the most loyal of partners. It was these things that gave him strength during the ordeal of their son Stephen’s death in 1985. He was very proud, and rightly so, of his sons Simon, our colleague in this House and our trade minister, and David, formerly a Labor government minister in Tasmania. The members and supporters of the Australian Labor Party in Melbourne Ports are deeply thankful for Frank Crean’s lifetime of service to them and to our cause. In their name as well as my own I extend my deepest sympathies to Mary, Simon, David and all members of the Crean family. half of all members.

331,Mr Neumann (Blair) (10.32 Am),"Names like Crean, Cameron, Cairns, Hayden-thesesustained us and were heroes to so many people, including my parents and me as a child. In government, he was a voice of reason, economic stability and prudence in a cabinet that was not necessarily renowned for strict adherence to economic issues. Frank Crean came from a Labor family, and he laboured for Labor. The third of five children, raised in a Christian household, he was a Presbyterian, a Sunday school teacher, active in the life of his church and community. The son of a mineworker and a schoolteacher, he suffered ill-health in childhood, and his experiences as a child and what he saw gave him a deep commitment to those who suffered from disadvantage and were dispossessed. Like many on our side of the House, education was the key to his success-not just a good family life but the opportunities that education gave to him. He graduated with honours from high school, was employed at what we now call the Australian Taxation Office and qualified in accountancy at 19 years of age. He went on to earn two university degrees, a BA and a Bachelor of Commerce, as well as a diploma in public administration. Frank joined the Labor Party in 1942, so he had a lifelong commitment to the ALP. A state member for two terms, from 1945 to 1947, he knew the thrill of victory in Albert Park and the despair of defeat-and there are those on this side of the House who have experienced both. He was a state member again in 1949, when he married Mary, his lifelong companion. I am privileged to have been in a relationship with the same woman for 25 years but I hope to be in a relationship with her for decades to come. The partners of politicians endure much, and Mary obviously did, but she stuck with Frank through thick and thin. They had the privilege of having children, and children really are a blessing. They had three sons, one of whom was Stephen, who died tragically in the mid-eighties. David was a cabinet minister in the Tasmanian government and served his local community well. I see much of Frank in Simon: the decency, the humility, the modesty, the amiability. Simon is a tremendous fellow. He has made a great contribution to the political life of this country and is a credit to his parents. Frank won the federal seat of Melbourne Ports in 1951 and held it for 11 terms-that is, 11 victories. It is hard to conceive. I have won once and have lost once, in 2004, but to go through election after election and make what was then a marginal seat into a fairly safe Labor seat would have been difficult. There were swings and roundabouts for him, I am sure. He was a founding member of the Parliamentary Christian Fellowship. He stands in that great tradition of Christian nonconformism in the Labor Party. There is a secular humanistic tradition in the ALP-a tradition of the Irish Catholics-but there is also another tradition, and I am happy to be in that tradition, that of the Christian nonconformists, who are influenced so much by the Christian socialists of the 19th century, and Frank was one of them. But he was not a patsy; he was an independent-minded person. He was the forerunner of the participants in the Victorian ALP who really had a big influence and whose commitment to economic responsibility and to political success drove Victorian Labor from the depths of defeat to victory. We very much see that today. For a long time, the Labor Party has been a great success for Victoria, with the Bracks and the Brumby governments. Gough Whitlam made a terrible blue with Frank: he got rid of him as the Treasurer. Frank served as the Treasurer from December 1972 until late 1974. It was a shocking mistake; Gough should never have done it. He sacked him in favour of Jim Cairns. For all of Jim Cairns’s virtues and activism-his commitment to social justice and equality of opportunity and his fervour against the Vietnam War-Jim was not the right guy to put in the Treasury. In MAIN COMMITTEE part, Gough remedied the situation by putting Bill Hayden in the Treasury position. Bill delivered a budget which the coalition government, then under Malcolm Fraser, agreed with. Bill, who was my federal member until 1988, was someone who, like Frank, believed in economic responsibility and that Labor governments could deliver economic stability as well as help those who were disadvantaged. Frank had the honour of being the Deputy Prime Minister for a short time, not just the Minister for International Trade. Simon is also the Minister for Trade. It is a great honour for both of them. Frank nearly became the Leader of the Australian Labor Party. It is not too well known these days, but he nearly did it. When Arthur Calwell failed to win the 1966 federal election, he agreed to step down on 8 February 1967. It is interesting that Frank was Arthur Calwell’s first choice. He wanted Frank to assume the leadership of the federal ALP. Nevertheless, Whitlam got 39 votes and Crean and Cairns shared the other 29 votes, so Gough won pretty comfortably. Frank set about doing his work with good humour, humility, modesty and diligence. Frank had a second tilt at the leadership of the ALP; he had a second go. After 1975, the legend goes in my part of Ipswich that Gough approached Bill to take on the leadership of the ALP. Bill said no. Bill had faced some pretty tragic circumstances and he nearly lost in 1975-I remember that as a kid. He got there by the skin of his teeth, so Bill decided not to take on the leadership of the federal ALP. Frank had another tilt at the leadership when Bill refused to stand. Whitlam beat Frank and Lionel Bowen, again pretty comfortably in the circumstances. There was a lot of affection for Gough which meant that Frank did not get it. Frank served as Treasurer for this country. He said something which I will never forget and which really influenced me. Clyde Cameron recorded these words in his book, and I will finish with this. Frank said that we raise taxes in order to buy civilisation. I have spoken on a few tax bills in the year that I have been here and I have pointed out a couple of times that it is the taxes that we raise which help us build schools, roads and hospitals-the infrastructure which our country needs. And it is a big country. But it is also taxes which help us help those in need and show compassion. That is the legacy of that very modest and humble man Frank Crean. He in his own way went about helping civilisation and helping those who were disadvantaged and dispossessed. He showed that you could do that and still be a good economic manager. Frank showed what he could do for this country in his two years as Treasurer. It is a great shame that he did not spend more time on the government benches as a cabinet minister making even a greater contribution to the welfare of this country and his local community. My sympathies go to his family, particularly to Simon, who I know well as a good man. We on this side of the House loved Frank Crean.

Senator Chris Ellison talks about being a Christian often talks about being real, which is by my reckoning another way of talking about being authentic. The great majority in this place are very authentic people. They care about the people of Australia and they care about this great country. This sitting week will see the end of the parliamentary service of Senator the Hon. Christopher Martin Ellison, a man who I am most fortunate to be able to call my friend and my colleague. There are few people in this place or in the Senate who are more authentic than Chris Ellison, and I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to him. I choose my words carefully when I talk of the parliamentary service of Chris Ellison, because the alternative is often stated as being a career in politics. I prefer the term ‘service’ because it indicates the authenticity of a commitment and devotion to the people who elected us to this place. That is what this service is really all about, whereas the term ‘career’ is indicative of a commitment to one’s own interests. SoI think it is important that, when we are being authentic, we talk about service as opposed to a political career. I would say that in the time. I have known Chris Ellison, some five years, he has always shown exemplary standards of honesty and integrity. He is utterly consistent in his personal and parliamentary standards, and I think that is why he is held in such high regard in the parliament and in Western Australia. That is also why he served as a minister in the Howard government for 10½ years, serving as the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs, Minister Assisting the Attorney-General, Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, Special Minister of State and-over six years, which as I understand it is the longest service ever in this portfolio-Minister for Justice and Customs, before being elevated to the Cabinet as the Minister for Human Services from March 2007. As I said, I first met Chris Ellison about five years ago, during the earliest days of the 2004 election campaign, when I was again running for Cowan. Over the time that I have known Chris Ellison he has always been a great source of appropriate and timely advice and guidance. In fact, I consider myself most fortunate that for two years I was able to use my background in the Army and the Federal Police as a security adviser on his staff. Whilst there, as for those who have passed through his office before me, I was certainly imbued with a lot of the standards that he provided-strong personal standards and a dedication to the people of Western Australia. I have no doubt that I talk on behalf of my colleagues at the state levelincluding Donna Faragher, who is a Western Australian minister-and, in the federal Senate, Senator Mathias Cormann, amongst others who have gone on to elected office and been selected by the people to serve. Apart from those who have worked for Chris and known him as a friend, he has been there for a lot of people in Western Australia. Again, his guidance and advice have helped many a person. Whether members of the many diverse communities within Western Australia or companies, employers and businesses, a wide range of interests have sought and received the assistance of Senator Ellison. I thank him for those over 15 years of service that he has given. I MAIN COMMITTEE",264,Condolences

I thank them for their dedication and their support of him over his time, and ultimately I thank Senator Ellison for a great effort and for being a great Australian, a great senator and a great friend. Wine Industry Ms RISHWORTH (Kingston) (10.48 am)-I rise today to talk specifically about one of the great export industries of South Australia, the wine industry. In the electorate of Kingston we have the beautiful area of McLaren Vale, which is world renowned for its shirazes but also has many other great varieties of wine. Slowly McLaren Vale is also becoming known as a place for food, whether it be olives or cheeses. It is certainly an area which I would encourage the majority of members to visit, but in South Australia we also have many other great regions. Mr Deputy Speaker Secker, you would be well aware of the number of those regions, including the Coonawarra, the Barossa, the Clare Valley and the Limestone Coast area. I think South Australia is very proud of its role in exporting wine. I was very pleased to hear the announcement on 1 December by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestries, the Hon. Tony Burke, who announced that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Stephen Smith, had overnight signed a new Australian-European Community agreement on trade in wine. This agreement, signed in conjunction with the European Union Commissioner, is a very important agreement because it really indicates that the wine of Australia has stepped up to the plate and is now internationally recognised as an incredibly great product. This agreement really advances the 1994 agreement and includes a lot of measures that ensure we have a much better opportunity to export our wine to the European market. In 2007-08 Australia exported 397 million litres of wine to the EC and we imported 18 million litres from Europe. You can see that the benefits from a wine trade agreement are particularly important for Australian wine. The benefits to Australian producers of this agreement will include European recognition of an additional 16 Australian wine making techniques, including the use of oak chips to add flavour. There will also be simpler arrangements for the approval of wine making techniques that may be developed in the future and a simplifying of the label requirements for Australian wine to be sold in European markets, as well as protection within Europe of Australia’s 112 registered geographical indicators. Australia will also be able to continue to use a number of traditional expressions such as ‘vintage’, ‘tawny’ and ‘ruby’. This agreement marks much more than the specific issues in the agreement. It is really recognition from the European Community of just how far Australian wine has come. I was lucky enough to be on a delegation to visit China recently and I was speaking with their trade department head who talked about how well recognised Australian wine is becoming. It is a new market for us in Australia. I think, from talking with people in China, there is a huge opportunity for Australian wine there. I am certainly keen to see it grow. The Chinese were talking about taking a little while to become accustomed to the dry nature of Australian wine but, MAIN COMMITTEE as we have seen in other places around the world, Australian wine is becoming particularly important. I would like also to congratulate a couple of wineries in my electorate that have recently been nominated for an Australian Export Award. They are wines I am sure many people in this place are familiar with: Fox Creek Wines and d’Arenberg wines. I wish them the best of success in the Australian Export Awards. Fox Creek Wines has also recently won some statewide export awards, so they are certainly doing their bit for the region. I would also like to congratulate the people of the McLaren Vale region who, whether they work in grapes, wine, tourism or food, always work together to really promote the brand of the region. I think they are a good example of how working together can really make a region grow. Parliamentary Year know she has been feeling poorly and I wish her well for the Christmas season. It is in that spirit of Christmas that I rise and extend my personal best wishes to all MPs from both sides of the House, to the parliamentary staff and to our families. I would like to capture the goodwill of the PM’s valedictory speech just moments ago in the House and perhaps echo the sentiments of the Leader of the Opposition about his reflections on the standards of behaviour here in the parliament, the level of interaction we can have as members of parliament and the opportunity for us to raise the level of debate. I believe we can hold each other to account without some of the animosity which sometimes trickles into debate and I think we are all lessened by those types of comments. I think that we can aspire to higher standards, and I believe that the people of Australia expect us to do better. To win their respect we will need to do better in the future. It does reflect poorly on the House when we sometimes descend into the juvenile heckling and name-calling that we have seen in the past. I guess that none of us are saints; we have all done it, but I look forward to, perhaps, a New Years resolution from all of us to aim for higher standards. As a newly elected member of parliament-this being my first year in parliament-I would like to thank the people of Gippsland for entrusting me with their vote and for honouring me with this important role that I have to carry out. In doing so, I wish all Gippslanders a very happy and safe Christmas, particularly on our roads. It is a busy time of year and I wish them all safe passage as they travel throughout our region. The holiday season in Gippsland is a very busy time, and we encourage people to just slow down and enjoy the festive season with their loved ones. I would also like to extend a personal thank you to my staff for the magnificent support that I have received in my first six months in office-in particular, Joanne Crawford, Diane Lilburne, Jenny Graham, Heather Buntine, Renae Cook, Nicole Conway, Kirsten Collins and Ruth Lucas. It may seem like there are a lot of them, but they do work in a job-sharing type arrangement. My staff have brought to my office an incredible amount of experience, developed over many years working with the former member, Peter McGauran, and having such highly-skilled staff to support me has made my transition into this high office for the people of Gippsland a far easier one. I could not have done it without them. I would also like to mention my own family and the support I have received from them during the last six months-my wife, Julie, and my four children: Morgan, Jamieson, Clancy MAIN COMMITTEE",265,Adjournment
335,Mr Chester (Gippsland) (10.54 Am),"I wish the member for Kingston good health. Iand Lachlan. The difficulties partners face when members of parliament are away for extended periods of time has been reflected upon many times today already, and I extend my best wishes to the families of all members of parliament at this time of the year. Finally, I want to reflect on a little fellow who did not quite make it to his first Christmas. Riley O’Brien was born here in Canberra on 14 September, and, despite the love of his parents, Danny and Vicky, and the dedication of hospital staff, he passed away within hours of his birth. It may have been a brief life but he touched the hearts of many. Adding to the tragedy is that Riley’s twin brother, Finn, is also facing many challenges and is in hospital as I speak. He is a seriously ill boy. Many members on this side of the House will know the boys’ father, Danny, well. Danny was an adviser to former Deputy Prime Minister Mark Vaile and a former chief of staff to the Victorian leader of the Nationals, Peter Ryan. The enormous courage that he and Vicky have displayed in the past three months has been inspirational to us all. All those who love and care for the O’Brien family send their best wishes at this time of the year. To Danny and Vicky, the love and support of National Party families is with you at this special time of the year, and we pray that you get to enjoy Finn’s company at home on Christmas Day. Regardless of our religious beliefs, Christmas is a time of great love, fellowship and sharing of good times with family and friends. It is also a chance for us to reflect on the year just past. There have been many challenges for us all on both sides of the House, and this is a good time to set our course for the future. For many of us Christmas is also, hopefully, a time to get some rest and some quiet time with our families. I look forward to returning in the New Year refreshed and ready to take on the challenges of that time. It is a great honour and privilege to serve in this parliament; to be here on behalf of this great nation. As I mentioned earlier, I would like to see us aspire to higher standards of personal interaction with each other on both sides of the House. The experience that I have had already on committees in the very short time. I have been in this place shows that there are many things that we can do by working together. I believe that the sum of us is greater when we do work together than when we descend into the heckling and name-calling that is sometimes an inglorious feature of this place. I would like to wish all a very Merry Christmas and a safe New Year. Geelong Manufacturing Industry Falcon XT has been awarded Best Large Car of 2008, as judged by the nation’s motoring clubs, is just one of several announcements over the last three weeks that have reinvigorated the Geelong manufacturing sector and, more specifically, the Ford Motor Company’s operations in the greater Geelong region. Prior to November this year, a series of announcements by Ford Australia indicated that the company would be seeking to lay-off hundreds of workers over the coming years. But all of this changed on 10 November, when the Prime Minister announced the $6.2 billion A New Car Plan for a Greener Future, designed to assist the Australian automotive industry in becoming a more economically and environmentally sustainable sector by 2020. Based on that announcement and a series of negotiations that followed, we had what was a fantastic announcement by Ford Australia’s CEO, Mr Marin Burela, a Geelong boy who got his start on the Ford shop floor in Geelong some 24 years ago. On 20 November Mr Burela declared that Ford would reverse an earlier decision to cut some 400 jobs MAIN COMMITTEE",267,Adjournment
336,Mr Marles (Corio) (10.59 Am),"The announcement on Tuesday night that the Ford FGand focus on developing a new in-line six-cylinder engine that meets Euro4 environmental standards, thanks in part to a direct contribution by this federal government of $13 million. On top of this we had Tuesday night’s announcement by the Australian Automobile Association, the nation’s peak body for the various state and territory based motoring clubs, that the Ford FG Falcon XT swept the field in the large car category, taking out the title of Australia’s Best Large Car. This is a great outcome for Ford and Geelong in a competition that is described as being the nation’s most comprehensive, independent, consumer focused vehicletesting and awards program. To suggest that Geelong is a manufacturing town really does not encapsulate the importance of the sector to the region’s prosperity. According to the Geelong Manufacturing Council, the manufacturing sector in Geelong currently employs some 14,000 people across 500 companies, equating to 41 per cent of the region’s employment, and this in turn translates into approximately $500 million in wages for the Geelong community, while the sector accounts for around 51 per cent of the region’s gross domestic product. As we now progress through the first decade of the 21st century, Geelong manufacturing is undergoing something of a renaissance. Recent announcements have included Basell Australia commissioning a $100 million plant upgrade, Blue Circle Southern Cement investing $75 million in its Geelong operations, Axiom Energy investing in a $50 million biodiesel refinery and Shell spending $220 million to increase the production of clean fuels. Also, in a major coup for the region’s information technology sector, Indian computer firm Satyam will invest $75 million in the creation of a 10-hectare research and development facility on the Deakin University’s Waurn Ponds campus-an investment, it is anticipated, that will create 2,000 jobs over the next eight years. As Geelong looks to its future, it is this type of investment and industry that can sustain us through the years and decades ahead. Smart, high-tech, highly evolved and environmentallyfriendly industry is not only Geelong’s future but also the nation’s and the world’s future. By staying ahead of the curve, by developing and producing the engines, fuels, information technologies and other products that are in demand in a more environmentally aware world, we are positioning Geelong for future growth and future success. In April 2007 the then opposition leader, Kevin Rudd, said: ... I don’t want to be Prime Minister of a country which doesn’t make things anymore. Later he went further, adding: ... I believe passionately in an activist industry policy for this country. This was an underlying commitment that the Labor Party took to the people of Australia in the 2007 election and is absolutely the mantra by which we have conducted ourselves ever since. This is no more visible than in Geelong. This government, along with state and local governments, has assisted in transitioning our region’s industry to compete in the 21st century through support for individual enterprises and by investing in critical infrastructure. This has aided in establishing Geelong, in my opinion, as the best-connected industrial city in Australia. Links to the national rail grid, the national highway system, a national airport, the Geelong Ring Road and a major industrial seaport are all infrastructure components that will help carry Geelong industry into the future. We are working to develop these further by seeking to upgrade Avalon Airport into an international gateway and creating an intermodal transport hub in the Heales Road industrial precinct. MAIN COMMITTEE Geelong absolutely has a future in the manufacturing sector. It lies in creating smart, hightech products that will meet the needs of an increasingly interconnected and environmentally conscious world and in exploiting our natural and man-made infrastructure. Geelong also has a future in developing and manufacturing automotive components and cars, and the recent announcements and successes of Ford in Geelong are an absolute testament to that. Left Right Think Tank day, because I rise to talk about an inspiring movement of young Australians dedicated to empowering all young people to contribute to public policy, an inspiring movement of young Australians seeking to go beyond the traditional left-right paradigm and embrace the marketplace of ideas. The Left Right Think Tank is Australia’s first think tank of young minds. As the House would agree, young people are increasingly passionate and we all have a responsibility to support and encourage those that represent our country’s future. As this House would agree, in essence the Left Right Think Tank wants to facilitate a relationship between the policymakers and the youth of our country. It wants to encourage these voices of young people to be heard and their ideas to be considered, and, most importantly, it wants to give them the confidence to create change. Today in the parliament we have Thom Woodroofe, who is the Executive Director. Welcome, Thom. I know that you have been spending the last two days having meetings with the leaders of our country and discussing the ideas of the Left Right Think Tank with those leaders. Left Right is a unique organisation. Australia has approximately 35 think tanks-or 36 now-but Left Right is entirely composed of young people between the ages of 15 and 25. Think tanks are one of the many largely-overlooked gifts of American thinking to the world of public policy and the consolidation of effective democracy. They are an important element of a healthy democracy and help us, as elected officials of the country, to navigate to the future. Indeed, think tanks contribute a lot to our great democracy. They can help structure the public debate. They can improve the quality of that debate through research. They can produce specific new ideas. They can do things that are too difficult or too complicated for governments or oppositions. In many ways, though, Left Right is more than a think tank. Left Right wants to not only involve young people in thinking about policy approaches; it wants to involve them in the entire public policy cycle. Accordingly, the organisation seeks to achieve its mission through seven principle areas. These are: developing policy based on sound research across the public policy spectrum; fostering discussion on the greatest challenges of our generation through the community; advocating policy ideals with various stakeholders and across government; promoting a new genre of thinking in the public policy cycle; educating young Australians through various elements and programs; motivating individuals to harness their potential in contributing to public policy debates; and empowering the next generation of leaders by providing them with unique opportunities for development. In doing so it aims to meet the following objectives over the next few years: to reach two-plus million Australians through media and publicity, raising awareness of their work; to engage 20,000-plus young Australians directly through various events, programs and initiatives; and to empower 5,000-plus young Australians through close involvement as members of volunteer staff. MAIN COMMITTEE",268,Adjournment
337,Mr Lindsay (Herbert) (11.04 Am),"I have an unusual presentation to the parliament toFor far too long the ideas debate has been framed within the context of left or of right. What excites me, and what unites the incredibly motivated young volunteers at Left Right, is a great optimism for Australia’s future. What these passionate young volunteers are looking to produce are new ideas for our nation’s future. Indeed, Left Right wishes to encourage public debate where young people can actively be drawn in and readily take part in overcoming the challenges we face as a nation in the 21st century. As they eloquently put it, the challenges we face are great, as are the solutions they have to offer with their ‘hard heads, soft hearts and young minds’. As the country’s elected representatives, we must remember the most powerful force of ideas, talent and energy is the Australian people themselves. Left Right Think Tank embodies that principle, and I certainly commend Left Right Think Tank to the House. I wish them well. I know that they will be eminently successful in what they do because they are the future of our country and they are doing it for the right reasons. Environment forward two legislative proposals for consideration to help protect the world’s rainforests. The first proposal is for the creation of a federal ‘debt for nature’ or ‘debt for carbon’ scheme, which would enable the foreign debt that a country owes to Australia to be reduced or cancelled if that country instead takes action to protect its tropical forests. The second proposal is to amend the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act to prohibit the importation of illegal or unsustainably sourced timber products and to regulate the importation of timber, palm oil and other tropical forest products from developing countries. Humane Society International points out that the proposals are not without precedents. Legislation for debt for nature swaps and for prohibitions on illegally harvested wood products is operating successfully in the United States, and the Illegally Logged Timber (Prohibition of Sale and Distribution) Bill 2007-08 was introduced to the British parliament in April. The United States’ Tropical Forest Conservation Act 1998 enables eligible developing countries to relieve the debt they owe to the United States by investing moneys to support local tropical forest conservation activities. At least 10 countries have agreements with the US under the act, which recognises both the biodiversity benefits and the carbon benefits of protecting tropical forests in developing countries. A similar act could be introduced into Australia. The Environmental Defenders Office of New South Wales states that Australia is owed more than $1.5 billion in debt by developing countries with significant reserves of tropical forests, including Papua New Guinea, the Philippines and Sri Lanka. This presents considerable opportunities for a debt for nature scheme. The proposal to ban illegally logged timber imports would be consistent with the National Strategy for Ecologically Sustainable Development of 1992, our obligations under the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity and the International Tropical Timber Agreement. The Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, in my view, is the appropriate place for the regulation of tropical forest imports. A new part could be introduced to deal with international movement of tropical forest products similar to that concerning the international movement of wildlife specimens in accordance with the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. Recently, the United States became the first jurisdiction in the world to prohibit the import, sale or trade of illegally harvested wood and wood products. Australia is, after China and JaMAIN COMMITTEE",270,Adjournment
338,Mr Kelvin Thomson (Wills) (11.09 Am),"The Humane Society International has putpan, the third biggest consumer of timber and timber products in the Asia-Pacific region, and in 2005 a Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry commissioned report found that approximately nine per cent, or $452 million, of all timber and timber products imported into Australia came from an illicit source. Clearly we need to tackle this. I note that there are other measures being taken to protect the world’s rainforests, and I welcome those measures. In particular, the Papua New Guinea-Australia Forest Carbon Partnership was announced in March this year and it is noted as part of that partnership that: Rainforests contribute to global climate stability and underpin our global ecosystem. Nearly two thirds of Papua New Guinea’s land area is forested, hosting some of the richest flora and fauna in the world and more than seven percent of the planet’s biodiversity. It was also noted that: Australia and Papua New Guinea supported the December 2007 Bali Climate Change Conference mandate that reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries should be part of a future international climate change framework.. It is noted that between 18 and 25 per cent of the entire world’s carbon emissions come from deforestation and land use changes. SoI commend the work that has been done around those issues but I also think that the proposals that have been put forward by the Humane Society International involving the potential amendment of Australian legislation could be of benefit, and I commend them for consideration to the government and the parliament. I take this opportunity to acknowledge the hard work and the contributions that have been made throughout the House of Representatives this year by colleagues and members on all sides and I wish them, their families and the parliamentary staff, who I know have been making a mighty contribution throughout the course of the past year, all the best for Christmas and for the New Year. Child Care of mine from the electorate of Ryan, Mr Matthew Preston, was in contact with the federal government and I want to raise on his behalf his concerns about the way the federal government has dealt with an issue of significant importance not only to him as a small business owner but also to this particular industry. He has not had a response from the federal government, in particular from the Deputy Prime Minister’s office-which has responsibility for the area in which this issue of deep concern occurs. Matthew Preston is co-owner and licensee of two childcare centres in Burpengary. He also owns a childcare centre called Happy Times Childcare Centre and Kindergarten. When I made contact with him following his approach to me our conversations and our exchange of emails revealed a most disturbing attitude by the Rudd Labor government and the Deputy Prime Minister’s office to dealing with the issue of child care. I think the best way I can proceed in parliament is to read his email to me, because it reflects deep concern and it really does embrace very precisely the issue that he is most concerned with-not only on his behalf but also, he suspects, on behalf of many other child-care centre owners. This is what he says: I am the joint owner and licensee of two childcare centres in Burpengary. Each of the centres are adjacent to each other (connected) however one is on Station Rd, Burpengary and the other, David St. Currently the centres are running at about 64% occupancy which means that we would have vacancies for about 54 children of all ages. On the same street (Station Rd) is an ABC Childcare centre, which has MAIN COMMITTEE",271,Adjournment
339,Mr Johnson (Ryan) (11.14 Am),"It has been some five weeks now since a constituentbeen placed on the list of ABC centres for Operational Review. There are another 3 childcare centres in the local area of Burpengary. One is an ABC centre which is on the “safe” list and the other 2 are privately owned-like ours. I know that these centres also have a number of vacancies, most likely more than us due to the good reputation we have in the local area. He then comes to the central issue: WhatI have difficulty with is the justification for the ABC centre on Station Rd being kept open with government funding when we have the places available for the children? The Government has the statistics as they collect the vacancy data from us each week. Therefore at an absolute minimum they could select which centres need to be kept open due to a lack of supply. Mr Preston now has little time for the Rudd Labor government and he makes his point very clearly by saying: I also feel that the government has, since its election, done nothing but attack the private childcare sector. This undoubtedly helped lead to the collapse of ABC, and has significantly devalued childcare centres as a direct result of the prospect of the government building centres on public land, thereby placing the industry under a very dark cloud. He talks about when he contacted the government and followed their instructions about contacting the my.child.gov website on 11 November. He says: On 11 NovemberI provided information by fax and also online to the my.child.gov website to have our centres’ details uploaded and despite asking for updates or an estimate as to when it would be uploaded, there has been no response. The only contact provided to childcare centres is the contact for the general public. SoI raise this in the parliament today and my question to the government is: what about those who are in business and who run child-care centres? I think that the lack of response from the Rudd Labor government and the Deputy Prime Minister in this case is appalling, insensitive and thoughtless. This constituent of mine is running his own business. He tells me that he has been running his child-care business since September 1995, so he clearly has more than a decade of experience. I suspect that if he has been running his business successfully since 1995 then he has earnt the goodwill and respect of all parents who have put their children into his care-and he would not be raising this if he was not very serious about it and very concerned. He has places available for some 54 children of all ages. I raise this in the parliament because I think it is a very valid point-it is a legitimate point and I just want the government to address it. I ask the Deputy Prime Minister to respond to Mr Matthew Preston, who has given me consent to mention his name and his business in the parliament today.

The Australia Day Awards are a way of recognising eminent Australians who have made a significant contribution to creating a better Australia and who are role models for us all. The Local Hero category was introduced to the Australia Day Awards in 2003. It recognises people who have made a special contribution to their local community. It acknowledges ordinary Australians who give something back to their community, which we all share.

340,Mr Adams (Lyons) (11.19 Am),"I wish to speak on the Australian of the Year awards.one of them. Layton Hodgetts lives at New Norfolk, in the Derwent Valley. He is one of the local Tasmanian finalists chosen to come to Canberra for the finals of the Australian Local Hero award for this year, which will be held on Australia Day next year. Layton has spent his life as a music teacher. He has been teaching children music in the Derwent Valley and in other areas of Tasmania. He took on the role of developing the Derwent Valley Community Band. The band has toured the world, performing in Japan, China and Europe. This year the band won a major award in the European band finals. Layton has been much honoured in Tasmania for achieving that success. I must confess that Layton is my cousin. We began with Thomas Hodgetts and Harriet Hodgetts, who came to Sydney on the Second Fleet-Thomas as a convict and Harriet as a free woman. Thomas was a blacksmith and, after some years on Norfolk Island, settled in Tasmania at Norfolk Plains. Thomas and Harriet became great citizens of our state. Layton’s grandfather and my grandmother were brother and sister. Layton built the Derwent Valley Community Band with the help of others in the Derwent Valley, but he has been its driving force. He has now been recognised for his work and has been asked to participate on a world body dealing with community bands. He is serving the state of Tasmania and the nation in this way, as well as giving enormous opportunities to so many young people and to many not-so-young people in southern Tasmania to perform in this great band, the Derwent Valley Community Band. We have the wonderful opportunity of listening to the great community band of the Derwent Valley when any occasion arises for it to perform. Layton is a great achiever. He has been well recognised as a local hero; he is a local hero. He inspires people in the Derwent Valley and in southern Tasmania through his work. I am very pleased that he has been recognised in this way, and I am sure that many other people will also feel that Layton has served his community in a tremendous way. As a local hero, he inspires many young people to work at their endeavours in the same the way that he does in serving so many in his community. He is a great role model, a great local hero. I certainly wish him well when he comes to Canberra for the national awards early next year. Mr Bill Trevor tee has just bid farewell to its long standing chair, Bill Trevor, and I commend his service to the organisation and the entire region. Bill is probably best known in his former role of mayor of the Isis shire and for the incredible leadership role he played in the tragic Childers backpacker hostel fire in 2000. Bill’s compassion, common sense and clear thinking came to the fore at that terrible time and, if he was not already, he became a rallying force for the community and a wonderful advocate for regional areas. Bill is renowned for his capacity to give back to the community, playing a pivotal role in the establishment of the Wide Bay Burnett Regional Organisation of Councils, of which he became the chair, and he has been credited with breathing life back into many chambers of commerce. Bill is also a life member of Apex and a patron of the Scouts movement and Little Athletics, and, under his leadership, the WBBACC became one of the most dynamic and proactive ACCs in Australia. MAIN COMMITTEE",273,Adjournment
341,Mr Neville (Hinkler) (11.24 Am),"The Wide Bay Burnett Area Consultative CommitBill was an exceptional candidate for the role of Chair of the WBBACC having been a farmer, sportsman, lifelong resident of the region, councillor and mayor of Isis shire. In fact, Bill only stepped down from his role as mayor at the recent local government elections. Under his leadership, the ACC delivered many millions of dollars in economic and community capacity-building projects across the entire region. Bill championed regional building projects of all shapes and sizes, from a new skate park precinct at Eidsvold through to the expansion of facilities at the Abbotsleigh Citrus orchard near Gin Gin and a community service centre at Murgon. Bill was also involved in the unique Bundaberg Futures program which I negotiated with the former Deputy Prime Minister John Anderson. It took the redundant Austoft cane harvester site in North Bundaberg and turned it into a leading manufacturing and engineering hub now employing over 250 people. For 12 years Bill gave up an enormous part of his life for the wider communitysomething all too rare these days. Last year he was one of only eight ACC chairs to be recognised with a 10-year medal. Quite simply, he has set an example of leadership which is the envy of ACCs around Australia. He displayed excellent judgement in being able to encourage and work up projects which have helped the entire Wide Bay area’s social and economic development. To have maintained such strong leadership over so long a period is as inspiring as it is remarkable, and he has set a high standard for others to follow. Of course Bill did not achieve all this single-handedly. He had the backup and support of a great team, including his Deputy Chair Donna Neilson, Syd Collins, Peter Sawyer, Roger Nunn, Nina Temperton, Cameron Bisley, Steve Dixon, Mary Walsh, Phil Ainsworth, Bruce Serisier, Ron Dyne, Julie Gee, Percy Iszlaub, Michael Nolan, Danielle Power, Beryl Spencer, Russell Stewart, Ian Williams, Kerren Smith, Ros Gregor, Gerard O’Connell and Patrice Bates. Others who have since retired from Bill’s ACC include the former executive officer, Joan Brazier, and members Bill Roberts and Joy Jensen. In his mayoral role, Bill took an innovative approach to road building, encouraged civic restoration, brought new businesses and quality urban developments into his shire and even built a stadium in conjunction with the state government which doubles as a sports venue and a high school assembly hall. Now Bill is taking a break from his public career of 23 years, he intends to take advantage of some quality time with his grandchildren, get his hands dirty again on the family farm and even squeeze in an extended holiday to Europe next year. Bill’s stewardship and vision have helped create better services, a better lifestyle and more jobs for the people of the Wide Bay Burnett area, and his presence within the organisation will be greatly missed by all. I went to Nanango in the South Burnett on Sunday night where Bill was surrounded by 40 or 50 of his colleagues and friends from the ACC. The praise and credit that was attributed to him was quite inspiring and I rate him as a friend, a colleague and an inspirational character in our district.

342,Mr Neumann (Blair) (11.29 Am),"TodayI rise to congratulate the community ofraised that money themselves. It is a small community. It is the equivalent of about two suburbs in Ipswich, and they raised that money locally. It is a great tribute to people like Sel Pfeffer. Sel and his wife have contributed tens of thousands of dollars for the project themselves. They have been a great inspiration for many others. It was not just them but also the Rotary Club and Ray Squire; people like Kevin McDonald, who is Chair of the Boonah Hydrotherapy Pool Committee and his very committed wife Natalie, who has also worked very hard; the Red Cross; Apex; the Lions Club; the Rotary Club; and many others. I cannot forget Ray Squire, who is the real genius behind so much of the technology which will be used in terms of renewables that will limit the use of electricity and other forms of energy in the complex. This is a tourism magnet, not just something for the rehabilitation of many people in what has become an area with an ageing population. This will be a great project for the local community. It is the sort of project which we have talked about in our new Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program. On 17 December, the Parliamentary Secretary for Regional Development and Northern Australia, the Hon. Gary Gray, came to Boonah and met members of the local committee and also the council, including the Deputy Mayor Dave Coburn and the Mayor John Brent and many of the civic leaders in the local area. He stressed to them the fact that we are committed to local government and that this was the kind of project that is in line with the federal government’s commitment to local infrastructure. We had a great meeting that particular day. I am pleased to say that the money was allocated the next day. Boonah received $667,000. I should say the Scenic Rim received that money. I have the old Boonah section. I apologise to my comrade the member for Forde-he has the rest of the Scenic Rim. But he has not been left out, because I understand that this week, at a special meeting of the Scenic Rim Regional Council, they have not left out the federal electorate of Forde. They have decided to allocate $30,000 to Tamborine Mountain for a project and $200,000 for work on the Zamia Theatre at Mount Tamborine. So the residents of Forde have not missed out. I am pleased to say that they have allocated, dollar for dollar, $480,000 to Boonah, and that is in keeping with the commitment of the local people, who have raised money in all kinds of ways, through raffles and cake stalls, including at the very successful Spa Festival. They have produced books and sold them in the local area. I have rarely seen a project with such community support and dedication. The local people are to be commended. They have worked tirelessly for this project. I can just imagine the Brisbane Lions AFL team and the Brisbane Broncos going there. I think it would probably do the Brisbane Broncos good to go to Boonah and spend the weekend at the hydrotherapy complex after a hard game. I am a Brisbane Broncos supporter-a great fan. Living in Ipswich with Alf Langer and the Walters brothers, you cannot help but be a supporter of the Broncos. They could go there and spend the weekend in Boonah and enjoy themselves. The hydrotherapy pool project is a great project. I commend the local community and the council, including Mayor John Brent and Deputy Mayor David Coburn. The foresight shown by the committee and the council is to be commended. I will work successfully with them in the future on other projects, including the House of Living Water project, which is another great project that recognises the Christian heritage of the area. It is being run by the Moogerah Passion Play Association. Congratulations to the local community. MAIN COMMITTEE Fuel Prices ticularly the contrast between the cost of petrol and the cost of diesel today. People in the bush, and indeed across Australia, have seen record high prices for fuel. Thankfully we are now starting to see in some urban fuel outlets a rapid decrease in prices, in fact petrol prices have fallen to below a dollar per litre. Certainly, that is good news for families and drivers, particularly as we travel across the country at this time of year at Christmas, when families come together to meet with friends and, of course, celebrate the spirit of Christmas. But the affordability of fuel pricing comes only with healthy competition-we all agree with thatand for many in rural and remote Australia competitive prices are simply not available. Yet for the people of the bush the affordability of fuel is perhaps even more important than for those in the cities. Out in the bush, there is no subsidised urban transport-no subsidised urban buses or subsidised urban trains. I acknowledge the need to subsidise and bring down the cost of public transport in urban situations to ease congestion on the urban road systems, but I say to the Main Committee that people out in the bush do not have that same optionthey have to use their motor vehicles to commute and to take their children to school. In fact the great freight task of this nation is carried on the back of trucks, and particularly in my electorate where we have type 2 road trains hauling cattle to market. We have type 2 road trains-that is, three trailers behind one large prime mover-taking dry goods as far north as Darwin, coming out of Brisbane and the southern capital cities. They of course all use diesel as well. So for people out in rural areas, whether it is for a family or whether it is for a business person, the price of fuel is a huge issue for the family or the business budget. On the disparity in price today between diesel and petrol, I do not believe I or any of us in this place have had a satisfactory answer as to why diesel can be 20c or 30c per litre more expensive at the bowser, even in urban situations, than petrol is. As the committee would be aware, the Liberal-Nationals have always had a focus on the importance of keeping fuel costs as low as possible. In fact, in 2000 and 2001 in government we actually reduced the excise on fuel by a total of 8.2c a litre-and, importantly, we also abolished the automatic indexation of fuel, which was a legacy of the Labor era of Hawke and Keating. Had we not done that, fuel would be some 17.7c a litre dearer than it is today. Whether it is the price of petrol in the city or whether it is the price of diesel in the city, that is the fact of the matter. By abolishing that automatic indexation, fuel today is-whether it is diesel or petrol-17.7c a litre cheaper than it would otherwise have been under a Labor policy. We know that the minister was trying to introduce that into the trucking sector again, but, thanks to our senators in the upper house, we were able to block that move by the minister, who wanted to reintroduce the automatic indexation of fuel excise in the trucking sector without coming back to parliament for approval. I have had this raised with me on a number of occasions, particularly in my own electorate. As we travel around and as we come up to Christmas it is becoming a bigger and bigger issue with the tighter economic situation that many families are confronting this Christmas. I just want to quote from a letter I received from a constituent out in the west of my electorate: … Diesel versus petrol pricing-as diesel is a lesser refined product, it would mean a lower cost of manufacturing. Why is it then that the cost of diesel exceeds petrol by roughly $0.30 /lt? He goes on to say: MAIN COMMITTEE",275,Adjournment
343,Mr Bruce Scott (Maranoa) (11.34 Am),"I rise to talk about the cost of petrol, parThere is little option to the man in the street to voice concern over this matter which is why I am putting forth my issue to you. As their federal representative, I bring this issue to the Main Committee. This is a serious issue and I call on the Petrol Commissioner to say what he is doing about it. Is he doing anything or is he just watching the price disparity between diesel and petrol? This is something for the Petrol Commissioner and also something for the ACCC to look at. We do not want them to be toothless tigers. They must do something about the price disparity between diesel and petrol. (Time expired) Dobell Electorate: Water as to the progress that is not being made on a promise of the Rudd government regarding a pipeline on the Central Coast. The lack of progress is not of course the problem of the Rudd government, who quite promptly handed over the $80.3 million that we promised at election time. We have at the moment a problem with one of the local councils, which continually prevaricates about where this pipeline is going to go. In a sense, it is understandable that it is a little slow now, because we have had council elections and a changeover; 70 per cent of the council turned over. I am urging the council to move as quickly as possible to confirm the route of the pipeline so that work can begin and the water supply of the Central Coast can be guaranteed. The Central Coast experienced the effects of the drought as badly as did any area in Australia. Our water supply dropped to a little under 12 per cent. We were down to 12 per cent of the water supply and, were the drought to continue, it looked very much like we were going to run out of water on the Central Coast. The Gosford/Wyong Councils Water Authority provides water to over 300,000 residents, and we were down to just less than 12 per cent. The Rudd government promised $80.3 million to build a pipeline between two dams, one of which is in the catchment area. It is a very small dam but it is always collecting water because it is where the rain actually falls. From this, there would be a pipeline up to a large storage dam, which has largely been close to empty for many, many years. This bit of vital infrastructure is something that the local council or state or federal government over the last 10 to 15 years should have acted on. We should not have been in the situation where our water supply was perilously close to empty, as it actually was. Thankfully, the Rudd government made good its promise. The money was given to the two local councils and the joint water authority for the pipeline to proceed. The pipeline route has been recommended by experts. It goes through the private land of various people, and there has been extensive consultation over that. The joint water authority has recommended a route to both councils but both councils have to approve it. Unfortunately, the Wyong Shire Council has said that-despite our going through an almost 12-month period of consultation with the community-because it is a new council, it wants to again open up the issue and go out and walk the route. This of course has the potential to cause major delays. There is a council meeting next Wednesday. If this issue is not resolved by then, it will not have the chance to be resolved by the local council until the council’s February meeting. Of course, this would put back this vital bit of infrastructure, because until it is approved the pipeline cannot commence. MAIN COMMITTEE",277,Adjournment
344,Mr Craig Thomson (Dobell) (11.39 Am),"I rise to speak about and express concernThis is vital infrastructure for the Central Coast. It is estimated that, once the pipeline has been built, within five years the water supply, on average rainfall, will lift our dam levels to 80 per cent. We were at less than 12 per cent. With the pipeline being built and with just average rainfall, we would go to 80 per cent within five years. If the worse of the drought conditions were to continue, if there were to be maximum drought conditions-and factoring in the expected 75,000 more people who will be moving into the area-then within five years we would still see an increase from around 12 per cent to 55 per cent. You can see just how vital this pipeline is-just how necessary it is. We need the local council to move as quickly as possible to approve it. Perhaps what we really need to consider in relation to this is making sure that the water authority on the Central Coast is an independent water authority, rather than one in a bureaucratic structure where we have to go back to councils even after the water authority has made recommendations based on solid scientific evidence and solid consultation with the community. It is vital that the building of this pipeline start. We need the Wyong council to approve the route of the pipeline, and we need it to be done immediately so that this pipeline can go ahead and the water supply of the Central Coast can be assured. Mackellar Electorate: Mona Vale Hospital Hospital, in my electorate of Mackellar. It is a vital institution for the people who live there, particularly for those in the north of Mona Vale but also for the electorate at large. I rise to speak on this for two reasons. The state of health in New South Wales is just appalling. I think we have all become aware of the way in which public hospitals have become run down, but in New South Wales it is worse. There has been an attempt by the Labor government in New South Wales to close Mona Vale Hospital and Manly Hospital, take their land, sell it off and supposedly build a new hospital at Frenchs Forest. The proposed hospital at Frenchs Forest has now been cancelled. They wished to knock our hospitals down and sell off that land a long time before they even planned to build the new one, and we as a community have fought to make sure that our Mona Vale Hospital, which is in my electorate, remains exactly where it is. We have a huge influx of people as visitors to our electorate through the summer season. As we come into that period, we know how important that hospital is. There are people who swim in the surf and are not as skilled as they ought to be, and lifesavers save them. If they are in need of a hospital, Mona Vale Hospital is, of course, where they go straight away. The stories of people who live in the electorate and who owe their lives to that hospital are legion. When we first had our big rally, back in 2002, I wrote to the people in the electorate and 7,000 people turned up. We have had many more rallies where there have been 1,500 or 3,000 people. Whenever we were threatened with something-for example, that the intensive care unit would go-the people would turn out. For that reason, that hospital is still there and functioning. The care and the dedication of the staff are absolutely fantastic. We are a community that say: ‘We are prepared to do our bit.’ Four years ago, when we badgered the state government into finally building a new emergency ward, it had no new equipment. I hosted a dinner with the hospital auxiliary-women who work fantastically hard-and we raised $90,000 to buy all the new equipment for emergencies. Again, just recently, the hospital needed equipment. It needed new humidicribs. It needed a very expensive MAIN COMMITTEE",278,Adjournment
345,Mrs Bronwyn Bishop (Mackellar) (11.45 Am),"I rise to speak about Mona Valepiece of equipment, $19,000 worth. Humidicribs are $15,000 each. We needed a whole range of other equipment-again, $90,000 worth. Two weeks ago I hosted another dinner, a community dinner, with the hospital auxiliary. I thought that, in this climate, we would be doing very well if we got half that amount. And yet these wonderful people-including the IGA grocers at Belrose; the Rotary Club of Brookvale; Richard Rowe; the Brennans of Avalon; the Blackmore Foundation; the Master Builders Association; Roy Mustaca, who owns the Warriewood theatre and who donated the premises and all the food; and the Bayfield family, who provided all the drinks and refreshments-raised a staggering $107,000 at that function, and it may even top that yet. The community are prepared to put in and buy what is needed but we need the state government to make money available to us, a Liberal electorate where the state government seems so reluctant to give us anything at all. We need money to come into that hospital. I was in there several times in the last week visiting people and watching the paint peel off the walls. The dedication of the staff is there and we can get the equipment in there, but the hospital needs an upgrade. It needs the state government to do its bit and furnish the hospital with everything it needs so that it can go on and serve the community. As I said, the proposed Frenchs Forest hospital is gone. They have just put out a report and they talk about closing the emergency ward of Manly Hospital. They are saying Mona Vale is needed. But it is no good having that report and having people saying they are prepared to support it unless the state government comes to the party. We need this federal government to say to that state government, ‘Give that money to Mona Vale Hospital to allow the staff to do the things they do so well, to preserve the lives that it saves and to build its reputation so that people know that the dedication of the community and the staff together produce a fantastic outcome.’ Death Penalty volving Australian citizens, and I do so particularly in the aftermath of the execution in Indonesia of the Bali bombers. I am concerned that we as a parliament should do all we can to save the lives of three young Australian citizens now on death row in Bali. I speak not just in pursuit of what I regard as a genuine human rights issue but also as a parent who holds the view that, regardless of what our children do, nothing extinguishes the love and the care we have for our kids. It is as a parent that I empathise with Lee and Christine Rush. As members are aware, I have previously received a number of letters from their son Scott, who is one of the three young Australians on death row in Kerobokan Prison in Bali. Soon after the execution of the Bali bombers, I received a further letter from Scott, dated 16 November 2008. I would like to share with members what he wrote to me: Dear Mr HayesI am writing to you again a week after the execution of the Bali bombers. Things are very tense here. Nobody really knows what is going to happen. We found out about the executions last Sunday morning. The words went around the Prison like a bush fire. Everyone knows now that Indonesia is serious about executing prisoners. Everybody on death row is just that much closer to death. My opinion is irrelevant but if you ask me is the world a better place because the bombers are dead? I don’t think so. AnywayI don’t care much for Amrozi and the other bombers, but now there is a danger they could become heroes. Inside the death tower we are very nervous. MAIN COMMITTEE",279,Adjournment
346,Mr Hayes (Werriwa) (11.49 Am),"I rise to speak again in respect of the death penalty inI’m trying to keep myself strong by exercising and keeping my body fit. I want you to know how much we all really appreciate what you and your colleagues are doing for us. I really hope when your motion in Parliament gets debated how much it may help other stupid people like me in the future, also to save much pain for their parents. There is not much I can share with you from here but there is a passage in Galatians that we read often. It is about receiving and sharing the gifts of the spirit. We will read this tonight and share the gifts of the spirit with you. That’s about it from here. Please remember me to your wife Bernadette and to your family. Yours sincerely Scott Rush P.S I am really trying to stay strong. I share this letter because it reflects Scott’s efforts to show good behaviour and his rehabilitation. RecentlyI became aware of comments attributed to the Indonesian Deputy Attorney General in the aftermath of the Bali bombings. Some reports indicate that foreigners who have extinguished all their legal review procedures will be executed soon. I hasten to add that Scott and the other two Australians on death row have not extinguished all their avenues of legal review. I urge the Australian Attorney-General to seek assurances from his Indonesian counterpart that these three young Australians will be given full opportunity and time to prepare and file their motions for reconsideration in the Supreme Court. Consistent with my notice of motion in the Notice Paper, I urge the government to make all appropriate representations to advance one of the key recommendations of the Indonesian Constitutional Court in its judgement of 30 October 2007, in respect to the Indonesian criminal law. If its recommendations were to be adopted, it would allow a change to the mandatory implementation of the death penalty by providing an option of a probation period of ten years. Where a prisoner could show good behaviour, the death sentence could be commuted to life imprisonment or imprisonment for 20 years. If adopted by the Indonesian authorities within the next 12 months, it could well assist in securing the life of Scott Rush and the other Australians now on death row at Kerobokan Prison. Finally, I urge the government to move to implement the Second Optional Protocol to the International Convention of Civil and Political Rights in Australia’s domestic law for the reasons I indicated in my notice of motion. You will recall, Madam Deputy Speaker, in that notice of motion I have advocated strongly that the government take this stance so that it not only demonstrates a prohibition on the death penalty here in Australia to all its states and territories but firmly establishes, in front of the world at large, its credentials as an abolitionist country and, as such, plays a significant leadership role in that respect. I honestly believe that Australia and the Republic of Indonesia, in partnership, can show great leadership in advocating human rights not simply through our region but through the world. Given what I now see as a change in the political context in Indonesia that has occurred since the execution of the Bali bombers, I believe this becomes particularly urgent. I encourage all members of parliament to do what they can to advocate for the abolition of the death penalty, and keep these three prisoners in their prayers over Christmas. MAIN COMMITTEE Murray-Darling Basin FRAN BAILEY (McEwen) (11.55 am)-I rise on what perhaps will be the last opportunity to raise an issue which I feel passionately about, as do the people of my electorate-one that I think that anyone who cares about the future of the Murray-Darling Basin, anyone throughout the country, would feel passionate about. I rise on this opportunity to speak because it probably will be my last opportunity before the parliament rises for the end of the year. Let me begin, Madam Deputy Speaker, by describing this to you. A couple of weeks ago I was driving from the township of Yea in my electorate of McEwen down to Healesville. This is an area that both of the government members in the chamber at the moment would know well because they participated in the Pollie Pedal. They rode up the Melba Highway, so they will be very familiar with this part of my electorate that I want to describe to you. I noticed several police cars on the side of the road and a number of four-wheel drive vehicles. Guessing that it had something to do with the north-south pipeline that is being constructed, almost running parallel for virtually all of the Melba Highway from Yea right down to Yarra Glen in my electorate, I pulled over to the side of the road. I know the local police-I know them all very well-and I said, ‘What’s going on here?’ To my utter dismay what was being perpetrated was-and it was being perpetrated by Melbourne Water officials, of whom, by the way, one of the police in attendance said to me, ‘They have more power in Victoria today than the Victoria Police’-that these Melbourne Water officials were dragging drilling equipment and heavy vehicles, without firstly doing the biosecurity checks on those vehicles, onto private property. This farmer had had his pastures locked up to make hay. The only opportunity he has to earn money over the summer months is from the hay that he makes that he can sell and, of course, use on his property. But Melbourne Water would not wait another couple of days to enable this farmer to make his hay. I asked the Melbourne Water official on the spot, ‘Would you please ring your boss and just get permission; wait another couple of days.’ ‘Oh,’ he said, ‘mobile phones don’t work here’. I said, ‘Well, actually, mine does; use mine.’ He rang his boss at Melbourne Water and the ruling came back: ‘We are on a deadline here; you have to continue work.’ This is the sort of activity that is happening the length and breadth of the Melba Highway in my electorate: Melbourne Water officials are gaining access to private propertyFRAN BAILEY-I have, believe it or not, my constituents being arrested on their own property for trying to defend their own properties. I sometimes have to stop and say: ‘Well, what is it? Isn’t this Australia?Is this really Australia that these grossly undemocratic actions are taking place in?’ This is of terrible concern to my constituents, but this of course is also of national concern. It is good that the member for Mayo is sitting here in the chamber with me today, because it affects the people in his electorate and the people of South Australia, because the purpose of this pipeline is to take unaudited water, saved, which is meant to be going into the Living Murray initiative for the benefit of all Australians. It is being taken, by the rogue action of the Victorian government, and sent down this pipeline to the Sugarloaf dam. It is just so difficult to try to convey the degree of hurt that my constituents are experiencing. But a MAIN COMMITTEE",280,Adjournment
347,Mr Briggs,"You’re joking.much bigger issue is the degree of hurt that all Australians are going to feel as a result of these absolutely rogue actions by Premier Brumby and the Victorian Labor government. Universal Declaration of Human Rights versary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights on 10 December. I wholeheartedly support the motion moved by the Prime Minister on Tuesday and debated yesterday. Today, I wish to reiterate the significance of the 30 rights enshrined in the universal declaration by the UN General Assembly. The President of the UN General Assembly in 1948, the former High Court judge and federal parliamentary Labor leader, Dr HV Evatt, concisely summed up its importance, saying that the declaration was: …the first occasion on which the organised community of nations had made a declaration of human rights and fundamental freedoms. That document was backed by the authority of the body of opinion of the United Nations as a whole and millions of people, men, women and children all over the world, would turn to it for help, guidance and inspiration. One merely has to look at the text of the universal declaration to admire the powerful messages contained within its simple and elegant prose. The articles of the declaration have become the ideological bedrock in the development of human rights instruments such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights when they were introduced, after 18 years of negotiation, in December 1966. As Dr Evatt envisaged on 10 December 60 years ago, the men, women and children of the world still look to the universal declaration for guidance today. While war and violence still grip many corners of our world, the universal declaration remains as the inalienable right of all. Sixty years on, it has been translated into more than 360 languages and is cited by the United Nations as its most translated document. A quick check on the UN’s website notes that it has been translated from Abkhaz-a language from Georgia, the Ukraine and Turkey-to Zulu. We should also take this time to remember the labours of individuals such as Dr Evatt, the Canadian jurist John Peters Humphrey, Rene Cassin and Eleanor Roosevelt, who chaired the inaugural commission of human rights which drafted the declaration. The former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, the Canadian Louise Arbour, had this to say about the declaration: It is difficult to imagine today just what a fundamental shift the Universal Declaration of Human Rights represented when it was adopted sixty years ago. In a post-war world scarred by the Holocaust, divided by colonialism and wracked by inequality, a charter setting out the first global and solemn commitment to the inherent dignity and equality of all human beings, regardless of colour, creed or origin, was a bold and daring undertaking. It is worth remembering that just 10 years earlier, at the intergovernmental Evian Conference on refugees, held in July 1938 to formulate a response to refugees fleeing from the horrors of the Nazi oppression in Europe, the Australian representative, Lieutenant-Colonel TW White, infamously said, as a response from Australia: It will no doubt be appreciated also that, as we have no real racial problems, we are not desirous of importing one by encouraging any scheme of large-scale foreign migration. MAIN COMMITTEE",282,Adjournment
348,Mr Dreyfus (Isaacs) (12.00 Pm),"I want to take this opportunity to note the 60th anniThat in 1948, after the horrors of the Holocaust and the Second World War, Australian representatives could play a crucial role in the formulation of the universal declaration is a fine example of the ‘fundamental shift’ that Louise Arbour described. I look forward to further progress in the protection of human rights in this country, which I hope will come from the consultation process that is a commitment of the Rudd Labor government. That process will actively engage with the Australian people about the potential for a national charter of rights. I hope that it will lead to such a charter, building on the charters of rights and responsibilities that have already been introduced in the Australian Capital Territory and in Victoria. I hope that, if the consultation does produce the outcome that this parliament is invited to legislate in relation to a charter of rights and responsibilities, the kind of language we will see in the charter uses, as closely as possible, the fine words of the universal declaration. Fadden Electorate: Economy time when we remember our Christian heritage as a nation, going back through our roots in Britain, and of course a time when we remember the meaning of Christmas, a celebration of the birth of Jesus Christ. In a celebration of Christmas, I sent out Christmas cards to all of my constituents to wish them all the very best for this wonderful season, and I included a magnet that had a list of emergency phone numbers so that if, in dreadful and dire circumstances, one of my constituents needed to know a range of key emergency numbers, the magnet would have them. Because it is Christmas and we are leading into the new year, a time when people make new year’s resolutions, we should, before we make the next set of resolutions, reflect upon the past year. Looking at the past year in my electorate, the news has not been particularly good. The government’s funding cuts to Regional Partnerships has meant that the application for the Oxenford and Coomera youth centre was not assessed and not passed. Fadden is the fastestgrowing electorate in the nation. It has grown 31.6 per cent between the 2001 and the 2006 census details. The library believes that within 3½ years my electorate will be 19.8 per cent oversubscribed. It is by far the fastest-growing electorate of any in the House. That growth is in the north of my electorate. There is only one community centre, the Oxenford and Coomera youth centre, whose AGM is in two weeks time, and funding has been cut from it because the Regional Partnerships program has been cut as well. We cannot get a roof for Riding for the Disabled, because Regional Partnerships has been cut. Businesses were also left in the lurch when the $700 million Commercial Ready program was cut. We recently had storms lashing the coast, affecting many residents, especially in the suburb of Labrador. If we keep reflecting on the last 12 months and the impact it has had on my electorate, if we look at the KC-the ‘Kevin financial crisis’-and the adverse effects, it is ironic that we are the only nation in the world whose government’s decisions have made us worse off. The bungled bank guarantee saw massive distortion of the market. Thirteen out of the top 20 cash and property management funds froze redemptions. Over 270,000 Australians have had redemptions frozen, and when I met with ING a few days ago they said they believe that is a very conservative number. I have spoken to many of my constituents who cannot get access to their own funds because of the distortion of the market caused by this government. MAIN COMMITTEE",283,Adjournment
349,Mr Robert (Fadden) (12.05 Pm),"Christmas, the Yuletide season, is upon us. It is aI look at the state of our health system, our hospitals. In Queensland there are 36,000 people on waiting lists for elective surgery, and there are 159,000 waiting to get on the waiting list. At the Gold Coast Hospital, where all of my constituents go, 48 per cent of people will spend over eight hours waiting in the emergency department. It is the busiest emergency department of any hospital in Queensland. The Australasian College for Emergency Medicine believes that, if you spend longer than eight hours waiting in an emergency department, you have a 30 per cent higher chance of a higher morbidity or mortality rate. You have a 30 per cent chance, or more, of dying by waiting over eight hours in the Gold Coast accident and emergency department. I look at how Queensland state Labor debt is ballooning and at how they hide the debt in government owned corporations so that it does not appear in the balance sheet. Then, yesterday, I saw that the ‘Kevlani’ bank is about to be launched, as this Prime Minister does exactly the same thing that Queensland state Labor are trying to do. The concept of a Kevlani bank is of a state owned bank that can borrow in a vain attempt to keep that debt off the government’s balance sheet, so that the government does not have to report to the nation that, within 12 months, it has gone into deficit. That is the sole reason for a Kevlani bank. Governments can borrow for whatever they need. There is no issue with governments borrowing money as in the mechanism of borrowing. We contend in the opposition that is there is no need to go into debt when growth is still strong, and we will not give the government a leave pass. But to generate a Kevlani bank, to go and trace petrodollars in such a Whitlamesque move simply to keep a deficit from the balance sheet of the federal government, is simply and utterly outrageous. So the reflection on the 12 months is not good. It took us 12 years to get out of Labor’s last debt and to actually amass a surplus, and it has taken this government 12 months to spend it and go back into deficit. As I look forward to the next 12 months, I simply ask the government, I plead with them, I challenge them: can you simply do better? You cannot do any worse, but for the sake of my constituents of Fadden, can you simply do better? Rudd Government Newcastle Electorate Ms GRIERSON (Newcastle) (12.10 pm)-I would also like to reflect on the first 12 months of the Rudd Labor government. For the people of Newcastle, I am very proud to say that we have been able to deliver on all our election commitments. We have seen $10 million for our stadium, the Energy Australia Stadium. The government has certainly delivered that. The construction has commenced and the building of the new western grandstand, with the cooperation of the state government, is also underway. We have seen the completion of the $51.8 million Weakleys Drive overpass. I was delighted to attend the opening of that overpass to traffic in October. I acknowledge that that was a project that began with the support of Mr Baldwin, the member for Paterson, prior to my taking over that area of his seat in the redistribution. It has been a good relationship with RTA-one that has delivered a very much needed traffic solution, particularly for the people in the Thornton area of my electorate. Health has been an outstanding achievement over the first 12 months of the Rudd Labor government for the people of Newcastle. The government not only provided a Medicare liMAIN COMMITTEE cence for the Mater hospital PET scanner; we also gave $2.2 million to improve and upgrade the scanning equipment and the facilities. I must thank Minister Roxon. It was on her visit to those facilities where she observed first hand the need for them to be upgraded. We are very lucky that people who are suffering from cancer, in particular, are now able to have the benefit of the PET scanner, which makes very good diagnoses for treatment and prognoses. We have also delivered to the people of Newcastle 50 new mental health nursing places at Newcastle university. Being a regional city, we provide services to the whole region for mental health. There is a critical workforce shortage in this area, and those 50 new mental health nursing places will be well received. We also delivered on an election promise that we would fund the completion of the Hunter Dementia and Memory Resource Centre. We provided $200,000 to complete that facility, and I congratulate Alzheimer’s Australia for working so well with us in the region and also the community who helped to fund that very much needed centre. We have also made sure that the GP Access After Hours service is assured of three years funding. Tenders have been called for a Medicare licence for one MRI machine in the Newcastle-Hunter-Maitland region. The Mater hospital in my electorate is the biggest deliverer of oncology services in the state and I am sure its tender will be competitive. We have also delivered an education revolution. I know that Newcastle university were pleased to receive $13.7 million to improve infrastructure and student amenities. Our stage 1 computer roll-out saw 2,500 computers allocated to my electorate. We have also started scoping for the new early learning centre that will be built in the Hamilton-Merewether area. I look forward to a further announcement about that before the end of the year, making sure that that is delivered. On the front of fighting climate change, we are a carbon dependent economy and for two years now the community, industry and I have worked very hard together to shape our economy in the future direction of sustainability and clean energy. There was $25 million for clean coal research at CSIRO Newcastle as delivered in the May budget. Scoping is almost complete for the National Solar Institute, which will have its headquarters at CSIRO, Newcastle. And we have tendered for the Clean Energy Enterprise Connect Centre-something I would very much like to see located in the Newcastle electorate to give the critical mass to that direction of our economy. So, overall, not only have we delivered wonderful outcomes to the people of Newcastle but also they have also been recognised in some wonderful ways. I thank the Prime Minister for the community cabinet coming to Newcastle. I also thank him for being part of Andrew Johns’s walk, the Joey Johns walk to Sydney to draw attention to mental illness and to bipolar disorder earlier this year. I also congratulate three people in particular: Newcastle’s teacher of the year, who won the national teacher of the year, Carolyn Hayden; Dr John Wright, who was awarded the lifetime achievement medal by CSIRO; and the young Master Builders Australia national apprentice of the year, Andrew George. A wonderful year for Newcastle. Mr Keith Payne really an Australian hero. The man I would like to tell the parliament about today is a Queenslander. He is a man I have come to know well and a man I call a friend. In my view, he is a brave and inspirational Queenslander and certainly an inspiration to many young people in MAIN COMMITTEE",284,Adjournment
350,Mrs May (Mcpherson) (12.15 Pm),"TodayI rise to speak about someone who I believe isthis country. However, he is more than that. Apart from being an Australian hero, he is a man from a time when the word ‘hero’ meant so much more than it does today. Keith Payne grew up in Ingham in North Queensland and he now calls Mackay his home when he is not travelling. Keith recently celebrated his 75th birthday, which is a milestone in anyone’s life. Keith started his working life as an apprentice cabinetmaker, but spending his life as a tradesman really wasn’t what Keith wanted to do. In August 1951 he joined the Army and was posted to the 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, in September of 1952. He served with his unit in Korea between April 1952 and March 1953. Back in Brisbane on a training course Keith met a young member of the Women’s Royal Australian Army Corps, Florence Plaw. They were married in December 1954 and this year they celebrate 54 years of marriage. Keith then served with the 3rd Battalion in Malaya, followed by a posting to Papua New Guinea, before being sent to fight in Vietnam. In May 1969, Keith was commanding the 212th company of the 1st Mobile Strike Force Battalion when it was attacked by a North Vietnamese force. His company was surrounded on three sides. He was wounded in the hands and arms whilst under heavy fire, but this did not prevent him from providing coverage to his troops as they withdrew and organised into a defensive perimeter. With his troops in position, Keith, wounded himself, spent three hours searching for any wounded soldiers whilst somehow also managing to avoid the enemy’s relentless and heavy fire. Keith found 40 wounded men. With tenacity and bravery under fire, Keith brought in some of his wounded men by himself; some of them he organised to be rescued. Many years later Keith was asked whether he had been afraid. His response was honest: ‘My God yes. Yes, I was.’ Keith Payne’s remarkable and courageous actions on that day earned him the Victoria Cross, which he later received from Queen Elizabeth aboard the Britannia while it was berthed in Brisbane. Keith also received the Distinguished Service Cross and the Silver Star from the United States and the Republic of Vietnam awarded him the Cross of Gallantry with Bronze Star. Keith holds the honour of being the last Australian awarded the Victoria Cross. He is one of only two living Australian recipients of the Victoria Cross. The other is Ted Kenna, from Hamilton, in Victoria, who turned 89 in July. Keith suffered from post-traumatic stress after his return from Vietnam. Any member in this chamber who has met a veteran suffering from post-traumatic stress knows the intense fear they go through, their sense of helplessness and the overwhelming horror they suffer from the time they spent serving our country. But Keith decided he could help those veterans who had come home, those who needed assistance, and he began working with them to sort through their problems, even though he was having his own, undertaking a welfare course with the Department of Veterans’ Affairs so he could be of assistance to those people who came home and needed that extra assistance. Today Keith continues to work closely with veterans and their issues. He certainly represents their issues to us in this House and works with our cadets throughout Australia. He travels throughout Australia talking to veterans and young people about the service he gave to his country and what young people can do for their country. He is often a visitor to the Gold Coast. He and Flo visit us regularly. They are there for ANZAC Day and other commemorative occasions that veterans get involved in. TodayI want to pay tribute not only to Keith but also to our other service men and women who we know are MAIN COMMITTEE serving our country overseas. As we approach Christmas I pay tribute to all our service men and women and extend to them our sincere thanks on behalf of our parliament and our country for the service they give to each and every one of us. Moreton Electorate: Sherwood Community Street Festival cessful communities are those that regularly come together. We all live busy, often isolated, lives, so it is important that we have opportunities to meet our neighbours and those in surrounding streets. Community events are a tried and true way to bring people together and build community spirit. They are great fun in the good times and a bulwark against the bad times. They bring schools, sports clubs, churches, community and social groups, businesses and individuals together and provide an opportunity for people to meet, build friendships and create a greater sense of belonging. Last Friday night I was thrilled to attend such an event in my electorate, the Sherwood Community Street Festival. The festival is held every year in November in the Sherwood shopping precinct on Sherwood Road, where they block off the street and pedestrians take over the area. Sherwood is a beautiful, leafy part of Brisbane, nestled between the Brisbane River and Oxley Creek Common. Over the last 13 years this festival has become a community institution. It is a great way to build social capital, foster community spirit, showcase local talent and culture and, more importantly, to give our younger kids an early taste of Santa Claus. It has everything you would expect of a great festival: entertainment, food, music, stage acts, community arts, street acts, crafts, gifts, government stalls and-my son Stan’s favourite-a jumping castle. It was very hard to get him off! All of the stalls express the diverse and friendly nature of my local community of Sherwood. The event receives some funding from the Brisbane City Council-and I thank them for this great use of ratepayer dollars-but it is coordinated by local volunteers doing their bit for the local community. I would like to make special mention of the organising committee which gives so much of their own time, energy and skills, with many challenges, for their community: the committee president, Vivian Rodgers; the vice-president and stall convenor, Jan Oliver; the secretary, Carmel Cole, who deserves special mention; the technical coordinator, Frank Thomson; and entertainment convenor, Kelly Smith. I am sure there are many other people who also did extra work. But I cannot go through all of the names; it would take too long. I thank all of you for your great work on behalf of the wider community. Thanks also to the many local businesses that sponsor the event. Many do so anonymously year after year. However, I would particularly like to thank my friend Cameron Miller and his company for their very significant contribution. The Sherwood Community Street Festival started back in 1995 when the local veterinarian at the time, Dr Malcolm Mackenzie, suggested the idea at a local traders dinner. Dr Mackenzie invited local business and community leaders to be involved, formed a committee and it quickly grew to become a thriving community festival, attracting thousands of people from all over Brisbane every year. So a particular thank you to Dr Malcolm Mackenzie. The event received the lord mayor’s 2008 Australia Day Community Event of the Year Award. I am the first to acknowledge that on occasion our Liberal lord mayor really gets it MAIN COMMITTEE",286,Adjournment
351,Mr Perrett (Moreton) (12.20 Pm),"Madam Deputy Speaker, as you well know, sucright. Congratulations to the Sherwood community and the organising committee for the fine work that they did in ensuring that all of the people in the Sherwood community got to experience Christmas early. I was particularly impressed by the nativity scene where they had real camels, real animals parading through the street. It was a real treat for the younger kids. Also, the singers were fantastic. North Sydney Electorate: Community Organisations community organisations which work so hard, usually on the back of the efforts of volunteers, to make our places, our community and our areas a better place to live. Today in this parliament I want to acknowledge the contribution of two organisations in my electorate that have celebrated significant milestones this year. This Saturday the North Shore Historical Society will be marking its 50th anniversary. I look forward to being at the lunch where we will do just that-celebrate the North Shore Historical Society’s 50th anniversary. My electorate has been shaped both by its physical environs, particularly Sydney Harbour, and also by the many heritage places that go towards making North Sydney a rich tapestry of both the old and the new. These heritage places are often significant because of their aesthetic qualities. More importantly, they are treasured because of the story they tell about human endeavour, both locally and nationally. In North Sydney that includes Indigenous archaeological sites in places like Balls Head and Berry Island that date back centuries and longer. And our European heritage is very much integral to the development of Sydney as one of the world’s greatest cities. My constituents understandably feel passionately about the preservation of this heritage and time and again they have mustered in force when that heritage has been threatened. In my time as member for North SydneyI think particularly of the battle to save Nutcote and, more recently, the fight-which is ongoing-to save the historic Graythwaite estate. For the last 50 years one organisation that stands out in fighting for the preservation of our heritage and promoting a greater understanding of both the physical and human aspects of our society has been the North Shore Historical Society. The society was founded in 1958 in response to plans to demolish the historic house Bellvue on Blues Point to make way for Harry Seidler’s Blues Point Tower. While they may have failed to stop that tower, it was through community agitation that plans to demolish much of McMahons Point for similar developments were thwarted. Since then the society has had many successes-for example, saving Don Bank Cottage in the heart of North Sydney-but just as importantly it has adopted as one of its core roles the education of local residents about the heritage that surrounds them. Its journal is perhaps the most significant record of North Sydney’s history and through various school prizes it has promoted a greater understanding of heritage values among younger residents. It is to be congratulated for all that it has done to keep the history and heritage of the North Shore alive and I particularly acknowledge its long standing president, Brian Evesson. I also want to pay tribute to another organisation that has marked a significant milestone this year. All of us in this place are familiar with the absolutely extraordinary contribution that Rotary makes to our community-not just in Australia but around the world. One of the oldest Rotary clubs in Australia is the North Sydney club, which turned 80 this year. As a member of North Sydney RotaryI am perhaps biased, but I think by any objective measure this club is one of the best. In addition to the fellowship that it provides to its members, the Rotary Club MAIN COMMITTEE",288,Adjournment
352,Mr Hockey (North Sydney) (12.24 Pm),"All of our electorates are strengthened by theof North Sydney has made a significant contribution to our local community through its community outreach program. The breadth of its program far outweighs what one could reasonably expect of a club of its size. Some of those activities have included raising funds for a men’s shed, its lunches for local seniors, its work for the disabled-particularly through the saleability program-its support for young people and also its work in promoting health awareness. Internationally it has helped to fund the construction of a new school in China and just this year has given considerably to one of our local youth organisations, Phoenix House. The Rotary Club of North Sydney has been blessed with outstanding members and outstanding leaders-too many to mention in this place tonight-but I want to acknowledge its current president, Gary Long, and also its president-elect, Jenny Thomas, who, in particular, has led the club’s community fundraising programs. My electorate is all the richer for being home to both the North Shore Historical Society and the Rotary Club of North Sydney. Newcastle Electorate Ms GRIERSON (Newcastle) (12.29 pm)-I am delighted to stand and speak further to my previous speech about the achievements of this first year of the Rudd government and extend it to the future agenda for the electorate of Newcastle. I would like to lay out some of the areas we have succeeded in and where we will be building on our strengths in the future. One of the good things that Newcastle has done-and fortunately I have been able to work with our stakeholders for the last seven years very successfully-has been to build the knowledge base of our economy. Manufacturers were some of the first people to take on quality standards and to position themselves as a knowledge based industry. Of course, the challenge for them in the future, as in the whole nation, is to increase exports. That is an area I look forward to working on with them in my electorate. We have certainly built a knowledge base around clean energy at CSIRO Newcastle, the energy flagship in the Energy Division, and at Newcastle University. Since we started a couple of years ago working towards a more sustainable economy, we certainly have seen CSIRO strengthened with the National Solar Institute to be put there, and Newcastle University has set up a clean energy research centre. BHP, unfortunately, has closed its technology centre, but we are negotiating as hard as we can to see if there is a possibility to keep them involved in the clean energy research sector in Newcastle, and I hope that those talks can progress satisfactorily. It is important now that we have our research entities in Newcastle working so well that we do attract more partnerships with national, regional and international corporations. In the field of medical research, we are very hopeful that Hunter Medical Research Institute will receive the infrastructure funding it does need in the future. We know there are competing needs, but it is a well-established medical research institute, it is a collaboration between Newcastle University and the Hunter New England Area Health Service, and through that partnership they make changes through research to clinical practice. For example, its discoveries in asthma research in Newcastle have led to millions of dollars per annum savings on the PBS. Its work on stroke and the handling of stroke patients has seen a reduction in bed days for patients, so it is important that our medical research area be funded and embedded into our community. MAIN COMMITTEE We also do want to continue to showcase innovation, and I pay tribute to Neville Sawyer particularly, who guided the very successful Newcastle innovation festival this year around clean energy and the work we are doing there. Neville was also one of the people who set up the Hunter Founders Forum to showcase new companies and to link with financial institutions for venture capital opportunities. Another area of research in our region that we are very proud of is the work of the Hunter Valley Research Foundation. It recently gave a presentation at a breakfast where the speaker was Wayne Swan, the Treasurer, and it emphasised that one of the things holding back our region is our retention rates. Although many of our young students continue on to a TAFE place, a training place or into work, unfortunately our take-up of tertiary education, higher education places at university, is not high enough. That is certainly an area in which I look forward to working with the Hunter Valley Research Foundation and our education institutions to see what we can do as part of the education revolution to bring our most needy students up to the level we want them to be and certainly to have the take-up of university places increased. I think the policies that were announced by the Deputy Prime Minister are going to be very much central to that. The next challenge for our city is its sustainability as an economic entity, a social entity and a survivable entity. Having gone through the June storms in 2007 and seeing Queensland suffering the same sort of extreme weather event, I think we are accepting that these events are going to continue more regularly and that there has to be some review of our cities under the Major Cities unit. Part of that will be not only the way cities function but the way they survive some of the challenges thrown to us by climate change in the future. Part of that challenge for the sustainability of the economy of the city of Newcastle is building up its service sector, and I look forward to a Federal Court building being constructed in our area. We are the next cab off the rank, so for the city of Newcastle there is a great future. I think the forward planning and projections are excellent. Pensions and Benefits Local Government Elections mum pass through’ in relation to interest rate reductions from the Reserve Bank and their cash rate reductions being fully transferred on to account holders of and borrowers from our banks. There is another maximum pass through though that does not seem to have attracted quite the same attention, and that is the maximum pass through that part pensioners in my electorate expect from the Rudd government in relation to the reductions in deeming rates. I think two tests need to be applied. Maximum pass through needs to be evaluated in terms of the total pass through and also the timeliness. I have had some analysis done on the delays in seeing interest rate movements pass through in changes to deeming rates and there are plenty of reasons why part pensioners would feel they are not quite getting the support that they would expect from the Rudd government. The delay in seeing these interest rate reductions reflected in reduced deeming rates, and therefore in many cases in improved eligibility for a part pension, is very important for part pensioners in the Dunkley electorate. It is particularly important when you think that many of them have had their investments frozen. I have been approached by part pensioners. There is a case in particular that is very MAIN COMMITTEE",289,Adjournment
353,Mr Billson (Dunkley) (12.34 Pm),"There has been much said about the term ‘maxivivid in my mind where a part pensioner, who is very thoughtful in her budgeting and in her planning of her cash flow for the year, recognises that around Christmas the demands of the season are not the main and sole drain on her resources. It is a time when insurance needs to be paid; it is a time when other major outlays are required of her. She ordinarily would draw those funds from her investments, but this year she is confronted with the trauma and very significant dilemma of not being able to access those funds that would normally be available from her investments to make those significant once-a-year payments over and above her normal day-to-day expenses. She has approached me looking for some assistance. I have pursued this with Centrelink, which has said that there are really two options available to her. One is to have Centrelink identify her investments as non-performing-which, as a former veterans affairs minister, is something we used to do from time to time when a person had no prospect of those funds being available and certainly no prospect of them earning an income. In this case the income is still thought to be available; the problem is accessing the capital-the initial deposit-that should be available in the normal course of events but, as a result of the way the banking guarantee has been applied by the Rudd government, is not available. She is faced with this dilemma and Centrelink advised me that it is highly improbable that investments of this kind would be recognised as non-performing and therefore excluded from the assets and income test. The other option was to take out a loan, either privately or through Centrelink by some advance payments. Both of those prospects are not adequate in the eyes of my part pensioner, firstly, because the Centrelink loan vehicle is not sufficient to cover the cost and, secondly, she is concerned about going into further debt at a time when we are encouraging people to reflect on their level of indebtedness-and particularly when she has resources available but she just cannot get to them. This is one of the dilemmas we face and I would encourage the government to take this seriously and respond to the maximum pass through both in total and in timeliness for part pensioners by adjustments in the deeming rate. Another area I would like to briefly touch on in the time available is the local government elections. I would like to thank all of the councillors from the city of Frankston and Mornington Peninsula Shire Council who have chosen not to continue their municipal careers or those who, through the process of the ballot box, have had that decision made for them. I would like to acknowledge and recognise all candidates who contested the elections. That also is a nourishment for our democratic process. Particularly, I would like to congratulate those councillors who have been elected and I look forward to collaborating with them and the newly formed councils. I would encourage the new councillors to embrace the energy, the insights and the advice of local community organisations, the many selfless civic leaders that give of their time generously, and of the council officers, who have much to offer. Finally, I would like to close by extending my sincere best wishes for a happy Christmas New Year season. My greetings to all of the Dunkley residents and the many which, hopefully, will come visiting the Mornington Peninsula over the summer break. That includes an encouragement to be thoughtful and mindful of the impact of celebration on those around them. I would particularly like to extend my love and devotion to my delightful wife, Kate, and to Alex, Zoe and Maddie. This will be Maddie’s first Christmas and it is great that Alex MAIN COMMITTEE and Zoe are helping to inform her how to liaise with Santa at this important time of year. (Time expired). Shortland Electorate: Christmas Ms HALL (Shortland) (12.39 pm)-I take this opportunity to wish all members all the best for the Christmas season and a very happy new year. It is a time when we all spend a little bit of time with our family and we can be back in our electorates doing things that we do not get time to do at other times of the year. Christmas is very much a family time, very much a time you spend with your friends and your family. That brings me to the point that there are many people in each and every one of our electorates who do not always have the luxury of enjoying Christmas in the way that we do. There are people in each and every one of our electorates who do not have family and friends and they do not have the support that they need at Christmas. For those people it can be a very sad and sorry time. Many people in our electorates cannot afford Christmas dinner and the presents they need for their children. That is why each year in my electorate I have a Smith Family Christmas tree. In addition, my office is a drop-off point for people in the electorate who would like to leave some Christmas goodies. On the Monday before Christmas, my electorate staff and I go out and distribute those goods to people in the community or to organisations in the community. One of the places I always like to give donations to is the Merrigum Centre at Windale. That is an organisation that operates under the Anglican Church. They do fantastic work in the community at Windale and are a role model for any organisation that is prepared to operate in the community. As a church, it gives support to those people in most need. I would like to put a call out to all local businesses and to all residents in the Shortland electorate to dig deep and to give freely, to drop some food items off at my office so that they can be included in the hamper that I deliver to the Merrigum Centre, the Samaritans and St Vincent de Paul within the local area. In addition, I would like to encourage people who drop a present in to take one of the little tags from the Christmas tree that I have in my office that identifies the appropriate age and sex of recipients of presents put under the tree. Then we will deliver those presents to the Smith Family. I know I am not the only member in the House who does this. I think one of the roles of a member of parliament is to ensure that we support our communities, and one way of supporting our communities is to make sure that at Christmas time we can help those who need it. AndI know there are some members who actually go out and help cook Christmas dinner in the community. I encourage people if they have got any spare capacity to support those who may be lonely at Christmas time. I come back to where I started, and that is thanking people for the work that they have done in the community. I emphasise my thanks to the Prime Minister for the way he has led the government this year. There have been some major changes in Australia and changes that have been for the better. I think that Australia at the end of 2008 is a very different place from the Australia that existed at the time of the election. It is a much more inclusive, more caring society, one in which every person is valued. By donating at Christmas time we are really linking into that theme of inclusiveness and community. I thank all those involved. (Time expired) MAIN COMMITTEE Murray-Darling River System from the Darling Downs to the mouth of the Murray, 3½ thousand kilometres through the Murray-Darling Basin. On the way I met with farmers and irrigators, people from the street, environmental groups and those concerned with the health of this magnificent area, but in no place was I more affected than at Yelta Fresh Vineyards in Mildura. In particular, I visited the home of Darren and Christine Argiro. What they said to me was very powerful, and I will quote from Christine’s subsequent follow-up letter: I am the fourth generation here in the Sunraysia area. I am married and with my husband we run 100 acres of table grapes and winery. Our future looked very bright for our four children and ourselves until the drought hit or the mismanagement of the Murray to be more to the point. What she told me was very simple. Her family was desperate, small block farmers were desperate, and I promised to Christine that I would not forget and that I would take her issue up. What we have just done today is to give the federal government an opportunity and no excuses to make sure that they help farmers such as Christine with direct funding for assisting with water efficiency. Six-hundred billion litres of water savings are available to be shared between the Murray and the farmers if, finally, the $5.8 billion of rural re-plumbing money is unfrozen by Senator Wong. That money is vital to farming families such as Darren and Christine Argiro. If they can get that funding, if they can get the support, then their children will have an opportunity, and I made that pledge to Christine that we would fight for that money. As of today, with the passage of the federal water bill with our support, there is no excuse for the federal government to deny that money. Unfreeze the $5.8 billion, help re-plumb rural Australia, Senator Wong, and above all else give Christine Argiro and her husband, Darren, a future for their children. (Time expired) Parliamentary Year ders, for allowing me to stand up. The year 2008 has been an historic year for our nation. This year we have seen starkly what we have created with our increasingly interconnected world. The global financial crisis started in the United States but had an immediate impact on markets around the world. I have spoken twice on this matter in parliament this year and still maintain that we need to act in genuine bipartisanship. Beijing’s successful hosting of the Olympic Games in August symbolised the rise in the prominence of the Asian giant. The world order is changing. This year has been significant for me as my first year in parliament. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the members on my side of the House for the support that they have given me during the year and also the members on the other side who have put forward their hand in friendship, helped me, spoken to me and encouraged me along the way. My staff in the East Victoria Park electorate office have worked exceptionally hard. I would like to also thank my head office manager, Karen McGrath, for the excellent work that she has done for me during the year. My constituents have been particularly affected by the housing affordability crisis this year, and we have often used Centrelink and people from the Department of Immigration and Citizenship to help them as well, so I thank the people in those two areas.

355,Mr Irons (Swan) (12.47 Pm),"I would like to thank my colleague, the member for FlinDuring my maiden speech, I spoke about how important family is, and I would also like to mention my son Jarrad, who lives with me. I am a single father, and he has understood the time we have spent apart during this year and the reason I have to travel. I would like to thank him for his patience and say that I do miss him while I am away. I would also like to mention that my niece Rosie Massey is in the House today. She has been up here for work experience for the week and has been of tremendous assistance to me. It is great to have a family member here. I did not spend time with her when she was growing up, but it is great to see she has turned into a lovely young lady and she has been of assistance this week, so I hope to see more of her in the future. I would also like to thank the Liberal Party-Chris Ellison particularly, who retired this week. During the campaign he was of much assistance to me, guiding me in certain ways that helped me win the seat, and I congratulate him and wish him all the best in the future. Parliamentary Year very important week for all of us in the class of 2007-and I know that my colleague the member for Swan is one of the class of 2007. There were 42 new members elected to the House in 2007 and, if you consider those elected to the Senate as well, it was quite a large intake. It has been a huge honour for me to represent the people of Forde. Looking back on what has been a very fast moving year, the achievements we have made as a government and the work that we have collectively done as new and existing members on both sides of the House, it has been a good year for the parliament on both sides of the House. I would like to thank the Speaker, the Deputy Speaker and the Speaker’s panel for all their work and support and the mentoring we have had in learning about the processes of parliament. I thank the clerks and the clerk assistants for their work as well. I have been learning about and trying to understand the internal machinations of parliament and how this place works, with the support of everyone involved. The Prime Minister recently visited my electorate. He is one of a number of ministers we have recently had through the electorate. I would like to thank him for his support for members of parliament generally and for visiting my electorate and Beenleigh High School. It was a commitment he made early in the year and he has certainly taken that on board. It was great to see him in my electorate. Our Treasurer, Wayne Swan, has spent time in my electorate and continues to have a commitment to the region I represent. Minister Albanese, Minister Burke, Minister Plibersek, Minister Ferguson, Minister Elliot and Attorney-General McClelland have all visited the electorate of Forde. I put up a challenge early in the year that they should come and have a look at the beautiful region of Forde. One of the clerks here today would know that I talk a lot about Duck Creek Road. It is good for people to come and experience the enjoyment of the electorate of Forde and get to understand the complexities of the electorate I represent. I thank Parliamentary Secretaries Kelly and Shorten, who have also visited the electorate, and there are five other ministers who have made a commitment to come and have a look and learn a bit about the electorate of Forde. I look forward to continuing that involvement and I look forward to their support. MAIN COMMITTEE",294,Adjournment
356,Mr Raguse (Forde) (12.49 Pm),"This is the end of my first year in parliament and it is aI would like to thank the members of my staff. Members of parliament rely very heavily on their staff. They put in a huge number of hours and they are just as excited as members are about getting the work done. I have immensely appreciated the involvement of my staff over the last 12 months. I would like to mention the people involved: Maarten Sherrington, who leads the team in my office; Stuart Fenech; Annette Curry; Jason Whitlock; and Colin Foot and Jim Dennis, regular helpers who come and help out in my office. I appreciate the work that everyone collectively has done. I would like to mention the committee work that we have all been involved in and those who have been on some of the international tours we do as part of our parliamentary duty. I would like to thank the Parliamentary Education Office and, in particular, Roberta Molson, who was a delegation secretary just recently on a trip which Deputy Speaker Kelvin Thomson was also involved in. The work that these people do to support us as members of parliament is very important. I would like to pay special tribute to my friends and family. We do not do this alone, and our staff are certainly a big part of it. I would like to thank my four children-Aaron, Matthew, Hannah and Emma. They have been a great support, certainly during the election campaign, when all families get involved. My sons are in their 20s and my daughters are teenagers. It has been quite a time for them, but they have worked well to keep us all together as a family. I would like to make particular mention of Marlene, my partner, for her love and support. It is an amazing feat for our partners to be there for us and weather the storm during the time we are away, and I greatly appreciate it. Human Trafficking Ms LEY (Farrer) (12.54 pm)-I appreciate the opportunity to speak on the very important subject of human trafficking, particularly for sex slavery. My attention was drawn to two articles in the Daily Telegraph yesterday. In fact, the story on the front page, ‘Brothel Slave Case Collapses’, disturbed me greatly. It concerned a long investigation by the Australian Federal Police into sex trafficking, and, at the final hurdle, the DPP was unable to go ahead and prosecute the case. I want to highlight the good work that the AFP does in this area, leading on from a coalition commitment in 2003 to fight this most heinous crime. People trafficking is not the same as people smuggling. Traffickers use a variety of methods to recruit their victims. They target vulnerable individuals, mainly from South-East Asia, by placing advertisements for comparatively well-paid employment positions in destination countries-for example, as dancers, waitresses or domestic workers. But, once the individuals arrive, they find that they have been deceived about the work they are required to do. Traffickers have a number of ways of preventing their victims from escaping-amongst them are debt, bondage, threats and violence, detention and the withholding of personal documents. They threaten to hurt or kill a victim’s children or family in their home country. Further uncertainty about their migration status and fear of being detained or deported makes victims reluctant to seek help. The second article in yesterday’s Daily Telegraph suggested that some women who come to this country and find themselves described as ‘sex workers who have been trafficked’ are in fact telling lies and using their position to get a migration outcome. This article describes one such case. I cannot comment on that case because I do not know about it. But, no doubt, these things have taken place. However, I think it is most important that we recognise that this is MAIN COMMITTEE not a problem of anyone’s imagination. The Joint Committee on the Australian Crime Commission conducted an inquiry into the trafficking of women for sexual servitude in 2004, and it did indeed find that most of the women trafficked into Australia are recruited from South East Asia and China for the sex industry. Traffickers facilitate the women’s entry to Australia, providing them false passports, funds and visas. They are then sent to brothels around the country, where their movements are restricted. It is not unknown for women to be forced to repay debts of up to $40,000. In October 2003 the Australian government announced a $20 million package of additional anti-trafficking measures, including a new AFP unit-the Transnational Sexual Exploitation and Trafficking Team-new visa arrangements for trafficking victims; and victim support measures, including counselling and legal and medical support, to be administered by the Office for the Status of Women. Following the highlighting of this issue in the press this week, I would like the government to recommit to this package. I would like the government to recognise that, although it is not necessarily a frequent crime, it is an extremely serious one. In the case that I mentioned-against the Sydney brothel madam Kwang Suk Ra, which collapsed yesterday-apparently, the evidence did not amount to ‘exploitation involving threat, force or deception’. That decision by the DPP followed on from a previous decision, handed down in late August, regarding a Melbourne brothel owner-and that redefined what is and is not exploitation. We need the laws to change so that, where a young woman is trafficked into Australia for the purposes of sex and held against her will, denied her documents and denied access to medical, legal and personal help-in fact, trapped in a condition of modern-day slavery-she is actually able to get help and that the laws of this country are amended to provide that help. It is not uncommon that, as judgments take place, amendments to laws have to follow. We clearly cannot let the work of our AFP team of tireless workers, in what is a horrendous working environment, come to nought. It is simply not good enough. AndI want to pay tribute to the AFP for their hours of investigation, the telephone intercepts and their hard work on behalf of the most defenceless women in the world today. This serious crime of people trafficking needs to be prevented in Australia, because we are a civilised country. We would not let our own citizens be treated in this manner overseas and we have absolutely every obligation to prevent foreign citizens who come to this country from experiencing what these young girls are currently experiencing.
