8,Mr Mahon,"I hope that I am sufgrounds, that the facts on which Mr with the acquisition of land, nor authorized Clarke relies should be fully stated. AlthoughI have not had recent recourse to the departmental files, my recollection of the case is quite clear, and I think my statement of it will be found to be substantially accurate. Mr Clarke was the owner of a piece of land in aTea about the size of this chamber, located near the General Post office, and approachable by a lane which emerges into Little Bourke-street. Some time in 1908 a fire demolished a warehouse which stood upon the land, leaving only a portion of the outer walls standing. Shortly after the fire, as Mr formed appears to have become known to Clarke was unable to rebuild, the Victorian Deputy Postmaster-General discovered that this land would be of great utility to the Department in connection with some extensions then contemplated. He authorized an official tp inspect the land and make a valuation, which was done, the value being set down at £2,000. Correspondence ensued, and I believe that this official did make what was tantamount to an offer of ,£2,000 for the land. At any rate, Mr Clarke treated it as an offer, and I was shown a letter from a former legal member of this House and an exCabinet Minister, in which the opinion was expressed that this was as far as the Government could go in making a bargain until Parliament ratified the purchase by passing the item on the Estimates. The £2,000 duly appeared on the Estimates as presented to the House by the then Deakin Administration; and Mr Clarke, evidently well pleased with the terms, regarded the bargain as practically clinched, and merely wanting a cheque from the Treasurer to complete it. This was the stage at which the case had arrived when it came before me. .1 found, first of all, that the Inspector General of Works had reported against the purchase of this allotment as entirely unnecessary. But the Postal Department resented a Home Affairs official constituting himself a judge of what was'or was not necessary for the proper conduct of postal business; and though I referred the papers back twice for reconsideration, the Postmaster-General adhered to his deputy's view that the land must be acquired. That left me no. option. But I had then to consider the extraordinary action of a subordinate postal official, not an expert in city land values, not connected with the Department charged Mr Mahon. in any way by that Department, in attempting to commit the Government to the payment of £2,000 for this pocket-handkerchief allotment. My comments on this aspect of the case will be found endorsed on the papers, and need not be repeated here. When the Department of Home Affairs was forced to make this purchase, I decided to make a personal inspection of the land, and did so in company with the Inspector-General of Public Works. The visit satisfied me that the postal official's valuation was excessive, and ought to be entirely discarded. The opinion which I Mr Clarke and his agent, and apparently gave them a great deal of concern, for they haunted the offices of the Department almost daily. As the negotiations proceeded, I discovered -that Mr Clarke and his agent had very influential friends, some, of whom found time to call on me, and others to write in his behalf. The agent was a gentleman named Fraser, who contended with some vehemence that the action of the postal official placed the Government under a legal obligation to pay the full amount. I disputed that position, and eventually forwarded the papers to the Crown Solicitor, who supported my contention that there was no legal, obligation on the Government to pay the £2,000, as originally agreed by the postal official j and therefore I refused to pay it. In order, however, that no injustice should be done, either to the Government or Mr Clarke, I asked two firms of valuators of high repute' in Melbourne to make a special and independent valuation of the land. They did so, and both fixed upon valuations considerably below that of the postal official. At this time Mr Clarke was representing that he was being pressed by the banks, and I dealt with, him with far more consideration than I should have done in other circumstances. . Guided by the independent valuations of the two firms to which I have referred, I offered him £1,400 for the block. Mr Clarke, however, continued to negotiate' for a higher price, and eventually I agreed that if he removed the remains of the standing walls, and cleared the ground entirely of debris, I would give him .£1,500, an offer which he promptly accepted. The net result of my interference was that the Government saved £500 on the transaction. Some time after the sale had taken place, and when I thought that the transaction was concluded, a most extraordinary claim was made upon the Department by the agent, whose contention was distinctly original. He urged that, since the Government had paid for the land only £ 1 , 5 0 0 , instead of ,£2,000, the price fixed by the postal official, it should give him commission on the ,£500 which it had saved. As a business propositionapart altogether from the well-known legal principle that an agent is not entitled to a commission from a buyer and seller in respect of the same transactionI was unable to accept that view, and rejected the claim. I believe that the agent 'has since been in active pursuit of a more sympathetic Minister, with what result I do not know.

Suppose that yesterday a motion had been moved for the postponement of the debate until next Sundayshave been put. could not refuse to put it= Mr J. H . CATTS A point of order could have been raised. have been sustained. The motion to postpone further consideration to anothef day gives the' only Opportunity which the House has to protest against that very insidious procedure*-the defeat of business by process of delay. curred yesterday. I rose to protest against the postponement as defeating the purpose which the honourable member had in view, and submitted tliat the debate could not take place On any other occasion. Were a member to protest during a second-reading debate that the measure was not being proceeded with as it should be, and that the member in charge of it, although appearing to try to push it through, was really defeating it by permitting tedious de-. lays not in order in casting reflections on the honourable member for Brisbane. so. pursuing a line of conduct which is not permissible. He is reflecting on the honourable member for Brisbane, and suggesting that the honourable member is not in earnest regarding his motion, but is endeavouring j by repeated postponements to defeat it by i member for Parramatta not to do that. not ask me not to do it, sir, because I am not doing it, and I do not intend to do it. I am putting a purely supposititious case, without reference to the honourable member for Brisbane. I submit, however, that I may refer to what happened yesterday, and my action then. against the postponement of the motion of the honourable member for Brisbane. It was' that whicli caused your intervention, Mr Speaker, with a ruling to the effect that the-motion for fixing the further consideration for a future day could not be debated. The honourable member moved a certain motion some time ago. ber may not discuss that. trouble has arisen because of that motion. May I iiot traverse the motion which has brought about the present position? ber must deal with the point before the Chair. is that it is oniy on a motion for postponement that we can protest against the defeat of a proposal by delay. A relevant discussion on the point could not take place ort any other motion. WereI to try to disThat is what occuss such a point on the second reading of a Bill, my remarks would be declared irrelevant, as having nothing to do with the principles of the measure. WereI to raise such a question during the discussion of any other Order of the Day or motion, they would be similarly irrelevant. I defy any one to point out another occasion than a motion for adjournment to a certain day on which this question can be debated. Should the Standing Orders Committee consider the matter, it might be able to form a rule to deal with the case, but at present there is no opportunity other than is given by a motion for postponement for discussing and protesting against the most insidious process of defeating a proposal by repeatedly postponing its consideration until it drops off the business-paper at the end of the session. The procedure to which I object has been' followed from time immemorial, it being a common thing for a proposal to be defeated by repeated postponements.

Mr J. H . CATTS -The honourable member for Parramatta has carefully brought in the motion of the honourable member for Brisbane by very cunning political tactics. Mv.

The honourable member for Cook has moved as an amendement the addition of these wordsAnd further, the decision of the Speaker that should remain in abeyance until it is .debate could not take place on the proposal of the honourable member for Brisbane that an Order of the Day be postponed until a future day. We cannot decide the point that has arisen by dealing with the motion and amendment which I have read. on a motion to provide for the discussion of a ruling, an amendment cannot be moved bringing in a new question. This is not of any party interest, but affects the privileges of the House as a whole. Therefore, any rule that we may adopt, or any decision ithat we may approve, should be carefully considered, because it will bind all honourable members. The suggestion made by the honourable member for Parramatta should not be agreed to. I believe that the honourable member for Hume agrees that the other matter referred to by Mr Speaker should be decided on its merits apart from the question which he raised. Obviously there can be no objection to a Minister or a private member in charge of a motion or a Bill moving to fix the day upon which the adjourned debate shall be resumed. The only question is whether that motion to fix the date is open to debate and to amendment. I appeal to honourable members to allow the matter to stand over now. A suitable opportunity will be given to both sides to have the question brought before the House. main question involved in the motion moved by the honourable member for Brisbane?

I have already said, on behalf of the Government, that private members having motions on the business paper will be afforded an opportunity to have them discussed and decided before the end of the session. I support the proposal made by the Prime Minister, and do not think that it is quite fair to ask you, Mr Speaker, to come to a decision upon a matter affecting the rights and privileges of the House which can be more satisfactorily dealt with by the Standing Orders Committee itself. Instead of suggesting, as the Prime Minister did, that the point raised again native suggestion. the Standing Orders Committee to deal with the matter at once, so as to avoid a 1 submit that, recurrence of the difficulty. With regard to the main point involved, it seems to be perfectly clear that under the Standing Orders the honourable member for Riverina had a right to rise in his place to continue the debate. Standing order 289 provides thatThe member, upon whose motion any debate shall be adjourned by the House, shall be entitled to pre-audience on the resumption of the debate. It is perfectly clear the honourable member for Riverina, having obtained the adjournment, had a right to continue the debate. It was known, however, that there was very little time available for private members' business, and it was therefore desired that honourable members should have an opportunity to move to postpone the consideration of motions standing in their names. Under the practice which has always prevailed, you were right, Mr Speaker, in allowing the honourable member for Brisbane to mention the date to which he desired his motion to be postponed. He named a date, and the question then arose as to whether the House had the right to discuss the date proposed to be fixed for the resumption of the debate.

131,Mr Mcwilliams,"No; the sugIn justice to the honourable member for Brisbane, I have to say that he did me the courtesy to consult me as to the date, before he asked the House for the postponement. that fact. in this House is without precedent or warrant, and contains such an element of danger that an alteration of the Standing Orders is necessary. The Standing Orders simply deal with the adjournment of a debate, and do not apply to the fixing of the date when the debate shall be resumed. Once a motion is submitted, it becomes the property of the House, and, in the case of an adjournment of the debate, it passes into the immediate charge of the honourable member who moved the adjournment. To that honourable member it must be left to suggest the date for its resumption; but, of course, he would, in order to meet the demands of courtesy, consult the mover on the subject. The Standing Orders should be so framed and amended that the honourable member who moves the adjournment of the debate shall fix the date. is there under which any one could interfere with an honourable member in that position? Yesterday I had charge of the motion at the particular time member's right expired at half-past 3 0' clock have been quite possible for me to ask leave to resume my remarks at a particular date; just as it would be possible for me to ask leave to resume my present remarks to-morrow. ject. pointing out that the arrival of half-past 3 o'clock would not debar me altogether. There must be sequence in the business, and in the natural order of things no honourable member would attempt to take advantage of such circumstances as arose yesterday: member claim that he had a right to fix the date of the adjournment? for the House. HadI been called on yesterday to resume the debate, I could, after consultation with the original mover, have asked the House to agree to a date I mentioned. arose through the Prime Minister interrupting, and taking charge of private business. know the Prime Minister did attempt to . make provision for the resumption of debate on this and other motions on a particular date, but was prevented by the objection of one honourable member. With all respect, I do hot think the decision given yesterday is in keeping with the Standing Orders. There is a clear difference between the adjournment of a debate and the fixing of a date for the resumption of the debate; and I hope the Standing Orders Committee will deal with the matter, so that honourable members may know their exact position. not necessary, in my opinion, to have new Standing Orders. It strikes me that the Standing Orders which we have already have' only to be viewed with common sense in order to insure the course suggested by the honourable member for Parramatta being followed. The Speaker is charged with responsibilities, not only towards individual members, but towards the .House as a whole; not only is he bound to consider the rights of speech of individual members, but also the right of the whole House to proceed with its business. In other words, the Speaker has to hold the scales of justice evenly, as between the rights of individuals and the undoubted rights of the whole House. The Speaker's ruling, I think, in this case has been arrived at by a too keen anxiety for those rights. He has, apparently, said to himself, "" If I allow the debate to take place as to the day to which the debate shall be adjourned, obstructive debate may ensue by persons moving amendment after amendment, naming each of the 364 remaining days of the year."" If the Speaker held such a view, as a natural corollary he would take the action complained of, to prevent any such amendments being moved. But, in doing so, he would overlook a very vital fact in connection with the Standing Orders. The rights of the House are safeguarded against the intrusion of individuals by the standthe honourable ing order relating to the closure. The latter has been deliberately introduced in order to prevent any individual, or set of individuals, abusing the forms of the House and the liberty of speech, so as to unduly protract debate, and prevent other business",26,Smith Th E Honourable Called Upon Mr Speaker Agrees With

155,Mr Higgs (Capricornia) [12.15],"to fix the date for the resumption of the discussion of the matter which he has brought forward, and that private members' time should not be taken up with obstructive debates on motions for fixing the dates of adjournment. Buti f dissent is not made from your ruling yesterday, Mr Speaker, honourable members will have no right to discuss the motion of the Prime Minister for fixing the date of the resumption of the discussion of an Order of the Day. The action of the honourable member for Brisbane in moving that the resumption of the debate on his motion take place on 22nd September was similar to that of the Prime Minister in moving at the commencement of the session that the House shall meet on certain days at certain hours, and transact its business in a certain order. honourable member refers are moved after notice has been given. those motions are passed without discussion, though debate can take place upon them. They are similar to the motion of a private member to fix a future date for the resumption of the discussion of a motion of which he has charge. While it seems right to prevent a debate, or any long debate, on private members' motions, it would be wrong to curtail debate on the Government motion to which I have referred. The Standing Orders are framed, not in the interest of the majority, which can always make its will felt, but for the protection of the minority. of business. 257 allows a member to speak on any question, but that right is limited by a number of other standing orders, which provide that certain motions may not be debated. The motion for the resumption of a discussion on a future date is not mentioned. Therefore it is necessary that the Standing Orders Committee should take the matter into consideration and make a recommendation to the House. amendment now, because there is already an amendment before the Chair which prevents it from being moved. think that it is obvious that the best thing to do would be to withdraw both motion and amendment, on the understanding that the subject would be considered by the Standing Orders Conunittee. ThisParliament, although it has been in existence for nearly ten years, has not yet adopted permanent standing orders. It istime that we did so, and if an opportunitywere afforded, we could deal with this matter among others. The motion and. amendment do not meet the case, and it would be unfortunate to have them put to the House, because they cannot bring about an expression of opinion that will settlethe main point at issue. There was a certain amount of misunderstanding yesterday. No doubt the desire of the Prime Minister to allow those who had privatebusiness on the paper to postpone its consideration led to the honourable member for Riverina not being called on to speak. Had he been called on, and asked leave tocontinue his remarks, there would have been no opportunity for the moving of an amendment. The Prime Minister stated, at the conclusion of Wednesday's sitting, that he would move the adjournment of the House until 3 p.m. yesterday, in orderto give to private members half-ari-hour for the postponement and adjustment of their business. was made, but no understanding was cometo. deal of unfairness in the suggestion that, die honourable member in charge of the motion which is the cause of all this discussion desires to delay its consideration.. Since Federation took place it has been, the practice to leave to the mover of a motion the fixing of the date for the resumption of its adjourned discussion. Themotion that the debate be adjourned to a certain date is always put to the House by Mr Speaker, and the House can refuse to agree to it, though that has never happened, nor is it likely to happen. The Government does not ask the House to decide when its business shall be dealt with, but were the House to decide that businessshould be taken in a certain order, or on acertain date, against the will of Ministers, that would determine the fate of the Government. A private member should have the same control of his business as Ministers have of theirs. If a private memberis not allowed to fix the date for the resumption of the discussion on the motionwhich he has moved, he is prevented from fixing a suitable date, and may find his business blocked by other business.

163,Mr Spence,"There has been a good,course, the House has the final decision on all these questions. We must assume that every private member is in earnest in bringing forward motions. It has been suggested that it is necessary to guard ourselves against attempts to prevent the discussion of questions by the moving of motions and the indefinite postponement of them, and that is a point which the Standing Orders Committee might well consider before submitting recommendations to the House. I think that the fixing of the date for the resumption of the discussion of private business must ordinarily be left in the hands of its mover, otherwise the opponents of a proposal, or members who did not wish to vote aye or nay on it, could combine and fix a date when the congestion of the business-paper would prevent further discussion. points are entitled to consideration. So far, the principle upon which we have acted has worked satisfactorily, but the matter is one with which the Standing Orders Committee should deal. I hope that the honourable member for Hume and the honourable member for Parramatta will agree to withdraw their motion and amendment, upon the understanding that the matter, will be dealt with by the Standing Orders Committee. It is unnecessary to submit a formal motion referring it to the Committee. There are other phases of this question that might reasonably be touched upon, but as I do not wish to prolong the debate I shall not refer to them. think it is perfectly clear that the honourable member for Riverina yesterday had the right either to resume the debate on the principal motion, or to ask leave to continue his remarks at a later date. The honourable member for Brisbane moved to fix the date on which the adjourned debate should be resumed, and it has been the invariable practice in this House for the Presiding Officer to refer to the mover of a motion to determine the date to which it should be adjourned. It is likewise clear that under the Standing Orders there can be no discussion on a motion for the adjournment of a debate. We have a standing order governing that point, and it seems to me that to allow a discussion on a motion to fix the date upon which a debate shall be resumed would be to stultify that standing order. It is reasonable to assume that an honourable member who gives notice of a motion does so in all sincerity, and that he ' is the best judge of the date on which the debate upon it ought to be resumed. -he proposes is not suitable to the honourable member who has secured the adjournment. who had secured the adjournment of the debate could not complain. Every honourable member has in that respect to take acertain risk. I am inclined to think that your ruling, Mr Speaker, that there canbe no discussion on the motion to fix the date upon which an adjourned debate may be resumed is clearly consistent with the standing order, which provides that there shall be no debate on a motion for the adjournment of a debate. Some of the arguments advanced by the honourable member for Grey are quite reactionary, and suggest a course of procedure quite out of consonance with the true purpose of a deliberative assembly. The fullest opportunity should be givenat all times for the consideration of every question submitted to the House. The honourable member, however, seems to be under the impression that the purposes of Democracy can be best served by "" gagging "" honourable members. He said that the object of the standing order which prohibits a discussion on a motion to adjourn a debate would be nullified if that principle were not observed in respect of a motion to fix the date of the resumption of the adjourned debate. Obviously, the two matters are entirely distinct. A motion for the adjournment of a debate is a matter upon which every honourable member can straight away make up his mind. No amount of persuasion is likely to affect his judgment in that regard, nor is he any wiser at the end of a two-hours' debate on the question than he was when the motion was originally proposed. Therefore, it is clearly logical and reasonable that there should be no discussion on a motion for the adjournment of a debate. The other question, however, is: essentially different. The honourable member for Brisbane selected a date on which he desired the consideration of his motion to be resumed. That, however, was not a matter entirely for the honourable member himself to determine. Certainly his wishes ought to be regarded, because, presumably, having studied the business-paper, he knows the date most favorable for carrying the question to a division. But",29,Smith Th E Honourable Called Upon Mr Speaker Agrees With

It might be inconvenient to half-a-dozen honourable members j and it is more in keeping with the true purpose of Parliament that the interests of six or eight honourable members, rather than the convenience of one, should be consulted. There is no reason why we should depart from the procedure hitherto followed in this House, under which honourable members generally have the right to consider whether the date fixed by the mover of a motion for its further consideranearly nine years tion is suitable. We ought not to surrender lightly any of our privileges. however, to observe in this new Parliament a tendency on the part of the Chair to unduly restrict honourable members; to anticipate what they are going to say, and to assume that they are going to violate the Standing Orders. know where I am in this Parliament. member ought to be called to order more frequently than he is. He takes up more of the time of the House than does any other honourable member. member undoubtedly gives the House at times very valuable information, and is always entertaining-especiall y when he lets himself goI do not think he can complain of not having been allowed due latitude. I repeat that instead of narrowing down our rights and privileges, the authority of the Chair should be exercised to maintain them in all their original force. disrespect to the Chair, that we ought to adhere to the practice that has hitherto prevailed in this House, which allows honourable members generally to consider, when a question of this kind is proposed, whether the date named by the mover of the motion for its further consideration, is suitable. Surely that is the proper course to follow. No individual member of the House should be privileged to bring up a question at a time that is unsuitable to the House generally. I have only to add that there seems to be springing up a new departure in regard to Mr Speaker occasionally leaving the Chair. I have not noticed such a practice in previous Parliaments in similar circumstances, and while I have no objection leave the Chair, and the Deputy Speaker takes his place, the fact should be recorded in Hansard, or in our Votes and Proceedings. A decision might' be given by the Chair, and honourable members, in reading that decision in Hansard later on, would have no means of ascertaining whether it had been given by Mr Speaker or his deputy. When Mr Speaker leaves the Chair, as he has a right to do, and is succeeded by the Deputy Speaker-al though such a thing did not take place under like conditions in this House for I regret, to a point of order. The honourable member is not in order in debating what is an entirely new subject. the honourable member to raise that point of order, for I have finished. My suggestion is that when Mr Speaker leaves the Chair, and his place is filled by the Deputy Speaker, a record of the change should be made. -As has already been pointed out, there is reason to believe that you, Mr Speaker; were under some misapprehension last night; but whether that is so or not, the fact remains that I was not allowed to speak. You now agree with me that I should have been allowed to do so. The other question at issue is somewhat different. I do not think the question of the date to which business is to be adjourned is one that need be discussed at any length. But I know to my cost that Speaker Holder, on one or two occasions, when we were dealing with the Tariff, held I think, without any that such a question might be debated, and that the honourable member for Parramatta took full advantage of that ruling. It is very injudicious to curb the privileges of the House by a slavish regard for precedent, and that is one reason why I took exception to your ruling. I do not wish to waste time, and I shall certainly vote against the motion moved by the honourable member for Brisbane; but the point that I wish to make is that, unless a privilege is abused, it ought not to be unnecessarily curtailed.

The honourable member for Coolgardie said that a practice has been growing up in this House, of which he gave an instance, of the Speaker occasionally leaving the chair, and asking the Deputy Speaker to preside in his absence. This, the honourable member If it be decided that the said, he had never before seen done in this House. I may point out that the Standing Orders provide for a Deputy Speaker, and when I was Chairman of Committees, I repeatedly acted for Sir Frederick Holder, and since I became Speaker, I have twice, I think, asked the Deputy Speaker to act for me. When the If opportunity Prime Minister decided, through the House, that we should sit from half-past 10 o'clock in the morning, I felt that it would be physically impossible for me to remain here for twelve hours. I might be able to do so for one or two weeks, but, ultimately, I should find myself unable to continue. Under the circumstances, I acton, with the fact that, for two or three hours on each of the long days, I should call upon him to take my place, and that practice I intend to follow so long as the present hours of sitting are observed. The honourable member for Coolgardie urged that some reference to the vacation of the chair by the Speaker should be made in Hansard, but I have to point out that that is always done. When I acted temporarily for Sir Frederick Holder-and , I believe, tl ough I am not sure, that I similarly acted for the honourable member for Laanecoorie, when he was Speaker-Hansard always used the words "" Mr Deputy Speaker"" when reporting any statement from, or decision by, the Chair. I am sorry to have to refer to these matters, but I felt their reference to be, though I do not know that it was so intended, a personal reflection on myself, and I thought it well to clear up the matter.

The preference to unionists clause in the Conciliation and: Arbitration Bill was considerably modified in Committee, but the Government are now proposing to place financial shackles on the energetic and industrious who desire to improve their condition. must prevail. Surely the Government will realize what a great future there is in store for us. The Labour party ought to be the first to hold out their arms to men and women from the other side, when they know that there are in one State alone 60,000,000 acres available for settlement. Victoria is far more densely settled than any of the other States, and will bring in more revenue from land taxation if the Bill be passed as introduced than the whole of New Zealand does to-day. The Prime Minister was told the other day that the revenue derived from Collins-street properties alone under this Bill would amount to ,£40,000 per annum. party's legislation will make the poor poorer and the rich richer. I do not wish to see that brought about. In a country like Australia there should be no class hatred, and class taxation should not be introduced by a Democratic Governmenta Government supposed to be representative of the masses. I am an Australian, and believe in and love Australia. I have seen most countries, but am proud to say that I have never visited another land which offers the same opportunities for labour. But labour and capital must work in harmony. We must not pass legislation calculated to create ill-feeling, and to cause people to button up their gress. I appeal to the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General to consider carefully the representations made by the deputation which interviewed them a day or two ago. I can vouch for the statements that were then submitted to them. In many of the instances referred to I have seen the balance-sheets on which reliance was placed, and have some of them in my possession at the present time.

295,Mr Chanter,"In many cases. I believe that the administration is now as honest as we could hope it to be. But those who know the history of land legislation in New South Wales are aware that the administration of the Lands Department was at one time rotten to the core, officers, and even Ministers, being in league with those who were filching the lands from the people. ment doing? I understand that the honourable member was in the State Parlia-' ment for a great many years. Why did he not draw attention to this state of affairs? member will refer to the State Hansard, he will find that there was no greater champion than I of the rights of the people to the land of the country. I have given my life to that cause. It is for that reason that I have earned the undying hostility in Riverina of the class which, monopolizes the lands. BeforeI left the State Parliament, I had obtained for the people all the Crown land availah'e in my electorate. But I have never attempted to do injustice. In some cases, land was acquired from the Crown improperly; though those who now hold it should be dealt with justly. The late Sir John Robertson, whose name has only to be mentioned to secure the respect of even oolitical opponents, passed what he thought a most liberal Aot, to assist persons without means to take up land. Had that Act been administered as he intended, it ""would have been one of the best in Australia. now say that we on this side are passing class legislation so manipulated the administration as to defeat the objects of that legislation, and deprive poor persons of ths opportunity to get land. The Act provided for the taking up of land in blocks, each of which was divided into four sections. acre had to be paid in respect to one of these sections, and nothing more for three years, when payment of 5 per cent, could be made, to continue indefinitely, or the land could be purchased outright at the maximum price of JQT. per acre. The remaining three sections were reserved, so that the holder could take them when he had complied with the conditions on the first section. The Canadian and American land laws, and I believe those of Western Australia, contain somewhat similar provisions. The one section was said to be free selected, and in regard to the remaining three the selector had what was termed [164] a pre-emptive lease. But the land monopolists, by virtue of volunteer land orders, and LLP . orders-the letters standing for the words "" I intend to improve""acquired possession of land here and there, .and in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred made the position of the selectors untenable.' The law was defeated in another way. At the present time applications for was Parlialand may be lodged at any time, and are dealt with after a reasonable interval; but at one time they could be lodged only om Thursdays after gazettal, while Wednesday was the day set apart for auctions of Crown lands. The result was that often if land was applied for on a Thursday, it would be bought at auction on the following Wednesday, before the application for selection could be dealt with. Let me mention what happened at Perricoota station. I am not afraid to mention names, though, as I said before, my remarks do not concern the present holders of the land. who will have to pay the land tax. to do so, as I shall prove. I am dealing with these matters to show that we on this side are right in fighting in the' interests of the people. I had been a resident of the Riverina for only a few years when the events which I am about to relate occurred. On Perricoota station 16,000 acres were gazetted as available for selection on a certain Thursday. The holders of the station ascertained how many bond -fide applicants But members of the class who there would be for the land, and then brought by special train from Victoria men whom they had collected all over the State, to whom they gave the deposit money with which to lodge dummy applications, so that tliere were ten or twelve dummies for every bond fide applicant. I am speaking of what I know, because I saw what took An application fee of 5s. per place. I wondered at the reason for the sudden access of population to the town of Moama, and noticed that the men brought up by the special train were taken to a hotel, and next morning marched like soldiers to the Lands Office. The Lands officer was in league with those who wished to rob the people of their lands, and would have succeeded had it not been for my subsequent action. I charged him with it at the time. I went with the crowd to the Lands Office. Usually the door was opened at 10 o'clock for the transaction of business, and the law gave precedence to applications in the order in which they were; received.

On the Victorian side of the river, where class legislation was broken down to a large extent some years ago, and an opportunity given to the small man to get on the land, the country has developed. A small man on the Victorian side of the river is obtaining from 100 acres as much as a man on the other side is securing from 10,000 acres. The small man has irrigated his land, while the other has not. Let us settle the people on the beautiful lands^long the Murray, where irrigation may be resorted to, and the productivity of the country will bs largely increased. Mr \VJ;ST -And population will increase. orable member for Grampians falls into the error so common amongst his party of urging that we have no right to impose land taxation, since that is a function properly belonging to the States. Have not the people been crying out for the last thirty years for an opportunity to get on the land, and have they not been prevented from settling upon it by the action of a certain class in the Legislative Council? What was attempted in this State? One section of the State Parliament approved of a measure designed to increase settlement, whilst the other section disapproved of it, and made it impossible for land to be resumed. almost every State? What has enhanced tbe value of the land but the expenditure of the people's money. At the present time in New South Wales millions are being expended oh the Barren Jack and other great water schemes, the channels connected with which will run, not through Crown lands, but through land that has already been alienated and given to people, some of whom sit in the Legislative Council, and defy any one to interfere with them. And yet we are told by our opponents that this is class legislation. Would the Labour party ever dream of putting their hands into the pockets of the people and distributing millions for the benefit of one or two? Our.desire is to benefit the whole community. All these great national works should be for the benefit of the community, and not a shilling should have been spent in connection with them before every surrounding acre affected by them had been' resumed. Reference has been made by the honourable member [104]2 for Grampians to the Western District of Victoria, where, I am informed, there is some of the finest agricultural land to be found in Australia. The railways in the district, however, are not paying, because the owners of those rich lands are devoting them to sheep farming when they should be closely settled. creased there within the last thirty years. apply to many counties in Victoria and New South Wales. The original settlers on the best land between the Murrumbidgee and the Murray were driven off like dingoes. They were treated as the aboriginals were by the very class who how hurl against us the charge that we are engaging in class legislation. Is it our duty to think only of ourselves? No; we must if need be sacrifice ourselves. Our duty is not to the few, but to the many. Our duty is to go into the slums of our great cities, and to endeavour to elevate the degraded lives that we find there. We must remove them to a better atmosphere, and where should we take, them but into the country where healthy conditions prevail ? At the present time we cannot do that, because the man with the large estate says, "" Hands off I This belongs to me, and you must not trespass upon it . "" Yet we are denounced because on behalf of the people we dare to say in reply, ""You have acquired this land Is not that the case in honestly or dishonestly, and since you are holding more than your fair share of God's gift to the whole of the people you must pay more, in the shape of taxation."" There can be no other conclusion. There are vested interests in properties of various kinds. There is the property accumulated by individual effort and energy, and there is wealth accumulated by speculation in mining on the Stock Exchange, and so forth. If there is any justification I do not say there is-for a person being allowed to hold propertv without interference, it is in the case where it ha'; been created by his own individual energy We cannot apply that argument to land, because land is the gift of God Almighty to every living thing. Everything born into the world has the right to sustenance from the land; arid if we allow a monopoly of it we transgress God's law, as well as the law of man..

I know that in some cases the land-owner enters into an arrangement with tlie poor man who has been unsuccessful at the ballot, to bring his horses and plant, plough the land, sow the seed, and reap it, and in return for the use of the land, take half the profit. To my own knowledge, in many'cases, that half pront has amounted to oyer 30s. an acre. The average yield of wheat for the last thirty odd years in the Riverina has been 13 bushels per .acre, and, notwithstanding what the honourable member for Grampians says, there are people growing wheat successfully 50 miles from the railway. I notice that no one seems to have the courage to deny any of the statements I am making. With the further application of .vater the lands in the Riverina could almost treble their production. The honourable member for Wimmera knows how hundreds of miles of this land is held. ihe land in the Wimmera is held and cultivated by farmers who were formerly labourers. of the Wimmera, but appealing to my friend's knowledge of the Riverina, where hundreds of miles of beautiful land by the Murray is devoted to sheep.

Chinamen pay a rental of ^30 an acre to grow cabbages, and make a profit. that the land in the Riverina is being put to its best use, but, putting the River Murray out of consideration, and depending entirely on the natural rainfall, there is .land there which, with modern scientific methods, could be made to yield a profit of £ 2 ios. .to £ 3 an acre. If the owners of the lands there, by means of this tax, can be made to uss their holdings more profitably, and obtain a return of from 50 per cent, to 100 per cent., we shall be doing good to them, and to the people at large.
