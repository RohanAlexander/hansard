In order to avoid use of departmental resources on applications which have no chance of succeeding, and to give people an early answer as to whether they are likely to satisfy migration policy requirements, enquirers are asked to complete a simple enquiry form. This form is generally made available to the enquirer in order to make a preliminary assessment of eligibility. At present, however, there is no requirement for posts to use this form in a uniform manner. The Department is endeavouring to achieve a standard practice at all posts with regard to this procedure. On the basis of information from the preliminary enquiry form, people are then advised whether formal application is warranted. The figures reported by some posts include preliminary enquiry forms as well as formal applications relating to the same applicants. These figures are collected as a means of providing general information on the workload of individual posts: they have not been collected or used as an objective measure of interest in migration. (b) The figures shown for the first 9 months of the 1983-84 year are preliminary and subject to revision; based on data available at 15.5.84. Because of varying and sometimes considerable time delays between the different processing stages, it is not possible to calculate valid success or failure rates by comparing application and visa rates within any given period.
