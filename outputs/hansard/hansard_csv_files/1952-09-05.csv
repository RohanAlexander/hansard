I understand that it covers the immigration into Australia of 10,000 Germans. I ask the Minister whether that is the correct figure, and, if it is not, to indicate the correct figure. Are the German immigrants to be brought to Australia to be additional to, or part of, the estimated 80,000 immigrants which the Government has already announced will be the intake next year? has been signed by the Minister for Immigration, mentions no number. The figure of 10,000 which has heen repeatedly stated in the press is false. figure ? figure. The number of West Germans to arrive in Australia will depend entirely upon Australia's needs from time to time. The number of. immigrants to come to Australia under the agreement is intended to form part of the reduced programme of 80,000 for next year.' Mr J. R.

Will the Minister also ensure that the people of Queensland are made aware of the schema in the hope that they will prevail on the Queensland Government not to deprive them of the benefits enjoyed by other Australians. be able to say that the State governments wbich have agreed to participate in the hospital benefit scheme are already themselves undertaking substantial publicity in connection with the matter. It has been, despite enormous improvements in transpointed out to me, however, that a great deal of doubt exists about the identities of altering the permissible expenditure by the organizations that are approved and will be associated with the scheme, and I am in process of preparing an advertisement, which will be published in every State, which will indicate clearly and exactly the names and addresses of tbe approved organizations and the measures necessary to insure under the scheme. I hope that that will, by a process of exclutbe rules that should operate at elections. sion, keep otber undesirable organizations out. Tbere are practically 200,000 people in Queensland wbo are insured members of various organizations and as they are enjoying in intermediate wards of public hospitals and also in private hospitals throughout Queensland the benefits of the Government's hospitals plans, I shall undoubtedly carry out an intensive publicity campaign in Queensland. to the Minister for Health. Will persons wbo join hospital insurance societies under the Government's new scheme and. subsequently become unemployed be obliged to continue to pay their subscriptions to such societies while they are unemployed, or will the Government pay their subscriptions on their behalf during snch periods? Alternatively, will the agreement with the States provide that probers of hospital insurance societies, when they are unemployed, be admitted to hospitals free of charge? that quite liberal conditions have been made to permit sucb people being carried for a certain time.

The position is that the Labour Government promulgated certain textile labelling regulations, which required the declaration on every article of its content of virgin wool, re-processed wool, or re-used wool. The Government's technical and scientific the Government advisers are of opinion that it would not be possible to identify these three different, types of wool in fabricated wool. advice when the regulations were promulgated. advice those officers offered to the Labour Government at that time; I am informing the House of the opinion they hold now.

It is not prepared to bring the law into disrepute by making such an attempt, and it will not be a party to bringing about the ludicrous situation of having one standard of textile labelling in respect of imported goods and a difTerent standard in respect of locally manufactured woollen goods. The Government has been in constant consultation with the appropriate State authorities, and it has also consulted with the Australian Wool Board with a view to reaching agreement with the State authorities for the establishment of a uniform standard of textile labelling.

I wish to make it quite clear that the House is the absolute master of its own business, hut I put it to honourable members that the incorporation of this statement, unread, in Hansard, which is the record of parliamentary debates, will mean that we shall have in Hansard a statement that honourable members have not had the opportunity to hear, but on which, apparently, a debate will ensue at a later date. I am uot, under any circumstances, challenging the good faith of the Minister, whom £ have known for a very long time, hut there may arise circumstances in which the House may give leave for the incorporation of unread matters in somewhat similar circumstances and afterwards have cause to regret it. The House has given leave on this occasion for the incorporation of the matter, but I hope that there will be an understanding that this, is not to be regarded as a precedent for the future. I recognize that the House has the right to make precedents and to follow precedents, but when it makes a precedent, it should be fully aware of the implications inherent in its own act. Statement by the Right Honourable ll. G. Casey, Minister for External Affairs-by leave-incorporated, unread: 8TH AUGUST, 1952. I want to report briefly to the Howe on the lirst meeting of the ANZUS Council established under the terms of thc three-power treaty between Australia, New Zealand and. ths United States of America. The meeting took place at thc Kaneohe MarineA i r Base, 20 miles from Honolulu on the 4th to 6th August. The United States of America was represented Acheson, the Secretary of State, whose advisers take up the appointment of head of the Ausincluded Admiral Arthur W. Radford (United States Commander-in-Chief, Pacifie), Ambassador Philip Jessup, Mr Acheson's special adviser, and two Assistant Secretaries of State, Mr Perkins and Mr Allison. New Zealand was represented by Mr Clifton Webb, its Minister for External Affairs, who had with him Washington, Mr Munro, the New Zealand Chief of the General Staff, Major-Coneral Gentry, and senior officers of his department. I had with me, the Australian Ambassador at Washington, the permanent, heads of the Departments of External Affairs and of Defence, and otlier appropriate officers of t h f two departments. The council's first task wa« to set up its machinery and to decide on the procedures t r govern its meetings in the future. It wae decided that the machinery should be a simple as possible, and that maximum useshould be made of existing: channels and agencies. The intention is that the fnlf council should meet once a year, with thethree Foreign Ministers present. In principle., meetings are to rotate among the threecapitals, on the basis of one year in the United States of America and the alternate year in either Australia or New Zealand. However, it was recognized that practical considerations might make it necessary to vary thc date and place of the annual meetings. In addition to the regular annual meetings, provision is made for meetings of deputies tn be held in Washington as and when required. A t these meetings the three countries will be represented iby the United States Under Secretary of State and the Amhass-adors in Washington of Australia and of New Ze.aland'. It wa« agreed that the council's secretariat should be confined to a working arrangement among designated officers of the State Department and of the Australian and New Zealand Embassies in Washington. Becords and other formal council documents are to be kept to a minimum. It is not intended that the council shou'd supersede normal diplomatic inter course between thc t h r f c Governments. On the military side it was agreed that each country would nominate a military representative to be accredited . to thc council. These Tcnresentntives w ill meet periodically as required, either independently of thc council itself, or in conjunction with regular council meetings. It is likelv that arrangements will lie made to establish permanent military liaison between the throe countries by the mutval assignment of officers to Pearl Ha'hour, Melbourne and Wellimrton.. The first meeting on the military side w ill take place at Pearl Harbour on the 22nd September. The Minister for Defence hap nominated as Australian representative at this 5 initial meeting the Chief of the General Staff (Lieutenant-Cencral Rowell), who is chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee. He w ill be accompanied by senior planning officers of each of the three fighting services, and A i r by Mr .Dean Commodore A. L . Walters, who will shortly tralian Joint Service Staff in Washington. The New Zealand representative at the forthcoming meeting will be Major-General W. C. Gentry, Chief of the New Zealand General Staff. Admiral Radford will bo the United States military representative. The House w ill recollect that Article8 of the New Zealand Ambassador in the treaty deals w i th the relationship to be established between the council and'I quotethe words of the article"" States, regional organizations, associations of States or other authorities in the Pacific area in a position tofurther the purposes of this Treaty and tocontribute to the security of that ' area"". Here we were in something of a dilemma. We nil had in mind the intimate and special relationship between Australia and New Zealand andother members of the British Commonwealth, particularly the United Kingdom. It was obvious to all of us that in view of this special relationship, which assumes tangible form iri the present close co-operation among Cammonwealth countries Malaya and in military planning generally, the United Kingdom add in particular must be kept in close touch with council matters. We liad also to take account of the special treaty from Communist aggression. In this regard I'uliitionships between tire United States and ihe Philippines, and between thc United States and Japan; and of the direct interest of France and other countries in the broad fabric of mutual co-operation in the Pacific area. At the ANZUS Council meetiug held in Honolulu, however, we came to the conclusion that the difficulties, including that of discriminating among the claims of various countries for some form of association with the c-oiiiicil, were such as to outweigh the advanSecretary of State, Mr Dean Acheson, gave tages; aiid that at that very early stage of the a week to this conference out of a very busy hud not even begun to Work, it would have iieoii premature to t r y to establish formal relationships with other States or regional organizations. We felt that the first task was lit concentrate on making thc treaty work witli its original limited membership. After all, the United States of America, Australia and New Zealand do not claim any exclusive responsibility for settling the affairs of thc Pacific. This responsibility could only devolve upon a much more broadly based organization, which can only be a gradual creation, I need scarcely assure the House that we w ill keep under continuous review the question of relationships, between tlie ANZUS Council and ofcher States and organizations-particularl y relationships w i th the United Kingdom. Honourable members will remember that this the Pacifio area-the others being thtj United States-Philippines Treaty, which is very -similar in its aims and in its phraseology to the ANZUS Treaty-and the Security Treaty between the United States and Japan. In each nf these three treaties, the United States of America is a meniber, and of course by far the most powerful member. This fact means that the United States of America has a special position in respect of Pacific defence. So much for the machinery. I come now i« the most significant and valuable part of the Honolulu meeting-the opportunity that it gave for an intimate and unfettered survey bf a very wide range of cm-rent matters. We covered not only the whole Paeific and adjacent areas, but also situations elsewhere in the world which inevitably impinge in one way or another on the Ps,cific. It was of the greatest value in particular to learn the views of the United States Government, and to have nn opportunty of commenting freely on them. Naturally, a large part of our discussions was f-micertion With the dark threat from Communist imperialism in the Pacific and else where As honourable members know, thc treaty calls for consultation between the three parties whenever there is a threat to security. As1 have said at the council meeting, there is clearly a threat now existing-in that we are all helping to cope with open aggression in Korea and Communist forces are militant and active in other Asian countries. in Korea and Coming closest to home, I am glad to be able to aay that there was complete agreement on the importance of South-East Asia and on the need for every possible effort to save it I am satisned that what I have said about' South-East Asia during the past year does not need any modification as a result of what passed at the ANZUS Council meeting. I should like to end by expressing my appreciation and gratitude for the hospitality given to us by our American hosts, and for the great care and trouble they took to ensure that this meeting would be a success. In particular the Australian Government is mosi appreciative of the fact that the American life, which was a measure of the importance that tlie United States of America places on this treaty. Our grateful thanks are also due to Admiral Radford, who throughout our time in Honolulu made himself available at all times for discussion. The Governor of Honolulu and his oflicials, and the officers and men of the Marine air base at Kaneohe, showed us all possible courtesy and assistance. This treaty helps substantially to close what has been a gap in the regional machinery for mutual defence in an important area of the world. I believe that it has got off to a good start-and that the security of a large uren including Australia is much enhanced. This treaty had already established a sub stuntially improved working relationship between the three countries concerned which it will be our aim to maintain and develop to the advantage of all the free countries in this part of the world.

59,Mr Bryson (Wilis) [11.7],"I wish already in use to full capacity. Someis finding his means of livelihood gradually slipping away from him. My attention has been directed to another case which concerns an existing subscriber who wishes to have his telephone transferred. He has been a subscriber for year3. There is cable available, but there is no exchange equipment, although the exchange concerned has been built for leas than three years. The equipment is available in stores, but the department is not installing it. I am not blaming the employees of the Postal Department, because I know that, over the years, thiti huge undertaking has been most efficient. 1 do know, however, that in accordance with the Government's decision last yeai -to dismiss10,000 Oommonwealth ser vants. approximately 4,500 employees of the Postal Department lost their jobs. The officials of the department had no 3ay in whether those men should be dismissed or not. They were merely instructed, "" Y o u will sack so many thousand men. You must reduce your staffs "". Included in the 4,500 men dismissed were a large number of linemen and technicians, who, up to that time, had heen engaged on the installation of telephone services. Because those men were sacked, this important work has now been held up. I place the responsibility for that, not upon the shoulders of the permanent departmental officials, but on the shoulders of the Government. It is time that the Government investigated this matter and took steps to ensure that the Postal Department, which is proably the biggest business undertaking in the Commonwealth, shall be given an opportunity to do its job efficiently. That will necessitate the provision of sufficient delivery of letters is cut out altogether funds to employ an adequate skilled staff. The telephone branch is a revenue producer for the Commonwealth. Equipment is available for installation. It has been paid for, but is lying idle while it could be earning money. Responsibility for that rests upon this Government. ' By ordering a reduction of postal staffs by 4.500, tlie Government has deliberately prevented the Postal Department from carrying out its duties in the efficient; manner expected hy the general public. I shall also refer briefly to mail services. Eor many years the Postal DepartPostal Department. In some areas the ment boasted about the promptness of its mail deliveries. Unfortunately, owing to staff reductions, that boast can no longer be made and unless steps are taken to restore the efficiency of the Mail Services by providing adequate staffs the deterioration will continue. I was an employee of the Postal Department for many years and I know how efficiently the department was managed. I have had personal experience of postal deliveries. At one time, there was a rule in the department that the first letter delivery in the suburban areas of capital cities should be completed by 10.30 a.m. If it was not completed by that time, inquiries were made, and, if necessary, action was taken to ensure that no delay would occur in future. The service has now deteriorated to such a degree that the first delivery of letters in some suburban areas of capital cities is frequently not completed until 3 o'clock or 4 o'clock in the afternoon. that? shortage of staff due to the Government's decision to reduce the Public Service hy 10,000 employees. Men were sacked regardless of whether they were performing useful work or not. That is the chief reason for the deterioration of postal services generally. In the suburb in which I live, there are supposed to be about eighteen postmen, but the staff is continuously below strength. Sometimes a portman is called upon to do his own round ancl then another round in addition. I know, too, although the department will not admit it, that frequently the second cm certain days. That is due, not to the inefficiency of the employees, but to the fact that staffs are as much as 50 per cent, below their proper strength. That is the situation in one suburb. I have no doubt that a similar position exists in other suburbs throughout Melbourne. Officials who are responsible for mail delivery services in Melbourne are endeavouring constantly to obtain sufficient staff to carry out their work. Because of staff shortages and the resulting conditions of employment, men and women are leaving the",21,Broadcasting Services

We are hack to normal times. ILabour is available and the administrative officials of the Postal Department should be permitted to employ it. The Government's decision to reduce the Public Service hy J0,000 was merely a grandiose gesture. It has destroyed the efficiency of the Postal Department. Possibly some other Commonwealth departments are overstaffed hut the Postal Department is not overstaffed. Even a superficial investigation would reveal very quickly that this big business organization is hopelessly understaffed, and eannot do its job efficiently. I pay a tribute to the employees of the department who are carrying out. their duties under such adverse conditions, and I appeal to the Government to have the employment situation in the department investigated at the earliest possible moment so that this undertaking which is one of the most efficient business organizations in the Commonwealth, may be brought back to full strength. Skilled men are available for that purpose. Telephoneequipment is on hand but no attempt has been made to use it. Large stocks of equipment held in store should have heen installed twelve months ago. When I questioned the Postmaster General on this matter sometime ago the honourable gentleman attempted to explain his failure to use it by the lame excuse that the whole of the equipment necessary to construct exchanges was not available and that no good purpose would be served by installing only a part of it.

I received, very encouraging replies from the. Minister for Commerce Minister for Territories ( Mr Hasluck). This important, rail link should be constructed immediately in order to avoid heavy losses of stock in the Northern Territory during drought periods. Every Australian is aware of the vast numbers of cattle that were lost in the recent disastrous, drought. Those who hav.e witnessed the misery of drought'Stricken cattle must be deeply moved. If this rail link were constructed countless thousands, of beef cattle would be saved in drought periods to the benefit, of one of our principal primary industries.

Honourable members will, perhaps, agree that the Northern Territory is the, beat cattle-breeding area in Australia and that Queensland contains our best fattening pastures.

64,Mr George Lawson (Brisbane),"occasions I have advocated the construction of a new General Post Office in Brisbane. Indeed, for a number of years that was considered to be a hardy annual with me. I have raised this matter on every budget that has been presented for very many years past, and in doing so I have had the backing of the people of Brisbane as a whole, particularly the business community in that city. The existing General Post Office in Bribsane is a disgrace to any capital city. In the past, hoth Labour and. non-Labour governments promised that they would put in hand immediately the construction of a new General Post Office. On many occasions. I have inspected conditions at the existing building, and I have marvelled how employees havo worked under them without suffering impairment of their health. The parcels post office is in an old building that was once used as I should like the Minister who is acting stah'es when it was the practice to deliver for the Postmaster-General to inform me telegrams on horseback. under which employees work in that section of the building are intolerable, parwork. ticularly during the . summer months. Conditions in other parts of the huilding are almost as bad. When the Curtin and Ohifley Labour Governments were in office, certain improvements were effected and various amenities were provided for employees in order to give them a measure of immediate relief. When Mr Speaker was Postmaster-General in 1939, he inspected the Brisbane General Post Office, find he agreed that the building was a disgrace to any capital city, apart from the fact that it was totally out of keeping with the magnificent structures that adjoin it. We also asreed that the employees should be provided with amenities to enable them to carry out their work in reasonable comfort. Estimates for 1939-40 included the provision of £50,000 for the construction of . the first section of a new Brisbane General Post Office. It was intended to demolish the old building, known as the parcels post office, very fine cafe was installed, which to which I have already referred. However, this work was not proceeded with. Of course, as honourable memhers know, following the outbreak of World War II. in 1939 it became necessary for the Government to abandon projected public works of this nature. Mr George Lawson. I understand that the Estimates for 1946-47 included a vote of £170,000 for the construction of the first section of the proposed new building, and the then Postmaster-General stated that an immediate commencement would be made. However, I regret to say that a start has not yet been made. I wonder whether the Government has forgotten all about the matter, or whether it has decided to abandon the project? At least three sets of plans were drawn up. I understand that the plans that were prepared in 193S or 1939 were approved by the then Government, and that they are still in existence. I cannot see why the work should not be proceeded with. New post offices have been built in other capital cities and in many of our country towns. The provision of a new General Post Office in Brisbane is an urgent necessity. Conditions whether provision has been made in the proposed vote for the carrying out of this In 1949 or 1950 the Postmaster General's Department purchased Denham's Building in Roma-street, Brisbane, with the intention to transfer to it a section of the work from the existing General Post Oflice, so as to enable work to be commenced on the proposed new building. But a start has still not been made. Conditions are vastly different now from those that existed during the war and in the immediate post-war period. Plenty of man-power and materials are available, and there appears to be no earthly reason why a commencement should not he made with this essential project. As I have said The before, it stands to the credit of former Labour governments that considerable improvements have been effected to the interior of the existing huilding. The modernized sections will ultimately he incorporated in the new structure. A has proved a boon to, and is much appreciated by, the postal employees. During the last twenty years I have consistently urged the erection of a new General Post Office in Brisbane. The existing building cannot cone with the tremendous growth of postal business in Brisbane, and it is not in keeping with the modern buildings of that city. The citizens of Brisbane, particularly the business community, consider that the provision of a new General Post Office in that city is long overdue. The honourable member for ""Wills( Mr has been estimated that the building will Bryson) has voiced a complaint ahout mail deliveries. I remind the committee that, as a result of the dismissal of many postal employees, the conditions that the honourable member has mentioned are common to all States. The greater proportion of the 10,000 public servants who were dismissed by the present Government were employees-chiefl y temporary employees--o £ the Postal Department. The majority of postmen are temporary employees. general public can not now receive as high a standard of service as was provided when the department was fully staffed. Although there is still plenty of room for improvement and extension of the telephone service in Queensland, on the whole I consider that the department is doing a good job under difficulties. As I mentioned during the debate on the Estimates last year, neither I nor the people whom I represent have very much to complain about iu relation to other postal facilities. I take this opportunity to pay tribute with the operating frequencies of the to employees of the Postal Department service by local and international stations. in Queensland.

It cost approximately £1,000,000. The project will be investigated by the Public Works Committee as soon as plans have been prepared. The new building will house the new city telephone exchange and other associated equipment. During question time, I promised the honourable member for Darling( Mr Clark) that I would give him some information about radio-telephone services in outback areas.

During the comprehensive trials of the new radio equipment, a number of operational difficulties have been encountered, such as interruptions caused by difficult atmospheric conditions and interference The major operational difficulties that radio base station equipment, including additional receivers, with a view to ex-",24,Broadcasting Services

The honorahle member for Wills( Mr page "" section, or, more properly, as the Bryson) has suggested that the efficiency of the Postal Department has diminished, but, as the honorahle member for Brisbane has said, its efficiency is still very high. The department has earned the gratitude of every one in Australia for the job tliat it is doing. During the last two and a half years, substantial progress has been made with the development of services. During that period, a record was achieved when 164,866 telephone subscribers' lines were added, compared with 114,531 in the corresponding period prior to December, 1949, and with 57,619 in the two and a half years prior to the war. The addition of 66,298 country subscribers since December, 1949, is easily an all-time record. Since 1949, the Postal Department has also reduced the number of persons awaiting services from 125,114 to fewer than 80,000; installed 224 rural automatic exchanges, or 44 more than the total number previously in operation; increased hours of service at, 408 manual telephone exchanges; provided channels; opened 543 new post offices; established 236 new road mail services, increased the frequency of 120, and extended the area served in 544 cases; installed 2,474 public telephones; and introduced a more liberal basis for the provision of country telephone services, t n view of the difficulties with which the department has heen confronted during the last twelve or eighteen months in connection with finance, labour and materials, that is an extraordinarily creditable record.. the estimates for the Postmaster-General's Department, provision is made for expenditure upon the printing of postage stamps, postal notes, postal guides and telephone directories. I note that the proposed appropriation for that purpose this year is approximately 20 per cent, greater than the sum that was voted for it last year. I want to raise a matter which I raised sometime ago and which is, as it were, in a state of suspended animation. In June, 1951,1 made some allegations about excessive charges by advertising contractors for the insertion of advertisements in the section of a telephone directory which is colloquially known as the "" pink classified section. I shall repeat the allegations that I made then, because I have not received a satisfactory reply to them and this racket continues t.o operate, to the detriment of advertisers principally and, indirectly, of persons who buy articles that are advertised in a classified section. For the benefit of honourable members who were not present when I made my charges some time ago, let me summarize what I said then. I supplied substantiated data about charges for advertisements in the classified section which indicated that publicity agents were receiving an enormous revenue from those advertisements, and I asked the Postmaster-General( Mr Anthony) to inform me of the revenue that the Postal Department derived from them. To refresh the minds of honourable members, I direct attention to a page that I have taken at random from the classified section of a telephone directory. It con1,481 additional trunk-line tains approximately 296 advertisements in small print, fourteen -£-in. advertisements and seven J-in. advertisements. On the information that was supplied to me by the Postmaster-General himself, I have estimated that, in respect of that one page alone, the revenue to the advertising contractors is at least £1,650. That is a very modest estimate. If we multiply £1,650 by the number of pages in the classified sections of the telephone directories for Sydney and Melbourne, we find that the revenue to the publicity agents in respect of those pases is astonishingly large-abou t £600.000 in Sydney and ahout £560,000 in Melbourne. If we add to those sums the revenue that private publicity agents receive from the classified sections of telephone directories for the other cam'tal cities of the Commonwealth, we find that, on a conservative estimate, the aggregate revenue is over £1,000.000. Thft return to the department from the publicity agents for the right tosolicit advertisements for the classified section aggregates only £143 500 >",26,Broadcasting Services
66,Mr Cremean (Hoddle) [11.55],"I nwhich is derived from the various States as follows:-Ne w South Wales, £65,OC0; Victoria, £55,000; Queensland, £11,000; South Australia, £7,000; Western Australia, £5,000; Tasmania, £500. That seems to be a most inadequate return when compared with the enormous revenue received by the agents who solicit advertisements throughout the Commonwealth. To the sum of more than £1,000,000 to which I have referred may be added the cost of the "" scatter "" advertisements on the pages of the official section of the directory. I consider that all this points to the fact that a terrific imposition is being levied on the advertising public and, in the final analysis, on the general public which pays, in the price of the articles and services that it buys, the cost of the advertisements. The Postmaster-General's Department is either innocently or directly conniving at this vast imposition. One of a series of questions which I asked the Postmaster General some time ago was whether he would produce the relevant file in the House. I asked it because my statements on this matter hadnot been successfully controverted and because the Postmaster General had replied to a previous question about those charges by stating that they were deemed to be reasonable. As well as asking him to produce the file I asked him whether he would favour me with information about the method of computation on which his department had based the claim that the charges were moderate and that the return to the department was reasonable. He told me that no good purpose would be served by the production of the file. I wish to be fair in relation to the matter, and I admit that the departsection of its own so that telephone ment's practice, which, amounts to conniving at a racket, has been followed, not only during this Government's regime bnt also during the term of office of previous governments. I challenge the Postmaster-General, who is not at present in the chamber because departmental matters have taken him abroad, to produce the 'departmental file in which it is stated that the return to the department was deemed to be reasonable. I again ask him, or the Minister who represents him, whether he will favour me with information about the method of computation on which -the department based its opinion that that return was reasonable. I also ask any honorahle member to make calculations, based on whatever principles he may devise, and if he does not agree with me that the charges, which are £4 4s. a half year for small advertisements and £6 6s. a half year for larger advertisements in black type, are extortionate, then I do not understand what extortion is. It is significant that in 1950 the prevailing charges for those entries were increased by 100 per cent. I wish to point out a fact of which honourable members may -perhaps not be aware, and which might shed a little light on the matter. That is that the Postmaster-General's Department itself prints telephone directories, including the classified section, so that the advertising agencies are merely the vehicle which receives the advertisements, collates and classifies them, and then submits them to the Postmaster-General's Department. contract priees recently. charges imposed on the advertisers were doubled. When one realizes that the ^classified section of the Melbourne directory is .almost equal in size to the official section of the directory, and when the value of the advertisements on each page is computed, it is easy to understand what a marvellous thing this is for the advertising contractors. Other honourable members share my opinion that the department should establish an advertising subscribers the government that the honourable memher supported when it was in office adjust this matter? anything to ask why we did not do it v/heri we were in office. If a racket is exposed in the Parliament it does not matter what government has allowed it to flourish in the past, the point is that the government of the day, having had its attention directed to an evil, has the duty to abolish that evil.

I suggest, with great sincerity, that the Postmasterable because the rate of obsolescence of General should seriously consider the establishment of an advertising section. Advertisers who desire their names to be included in the advertising section as well as in the official directory could pay for the latter privilege. I am confident that, in such circumstances, if these charges were properly based they would be much less than they are to-day. I repeat that no adequate reply has been given to the questions that I asked on a former occasion, and although I am an ordinary member of the Opposition I challenge the Postmaster-General, or the Minister representing him, to lay on the table of the House the departmental file which shows the method of calculation on which was based the Minister's reply to my first allegation, in which he said that the charges were not unduly disproportionate. I believe that, if the Department handled its own classified advertising these estimates woi'ld be lower. The Order! The honourable member's time has expired. During the debate on the Postmaster General's Estimates last year, I spoke on the subject of television and advocated an early decision in regard to its inaugurfoundries and in mills for the control of ation in Australia. I do so again, not besmoke from chimneys, for the remote cause I am over-enthusiastic about the programme possibilities that it might have, but simplv because I regard television as a short cut to a deeper know-ledge of the principles of electronics that underlie modern defence methods and believe that this young and isolated country cannot afford to be left behind in this defence field of electronic science. Nothing has happened in the period since I raised the matter to limit in any way the views that I then expressed, but a good deal has happened to pin-point the urgency of the need to act along the lines that I indicated. One of the matters to which attention has recently been directed in this chamber is the fact that employment in the Australian radio industry has heen reduced by one-third in comparison with its previous total. It may be said, as indeed it has been said in this chamber, that the radio industry should be assisted by defence orders. That is not practicdefence equipment in the electronic field is such that tremendous wastage would be involved if we were to follow that plan. The important objective, I believe, is that we should maintain this industry in a position from which it can readily he converted to the production of defence electronic equipment. There is, of course, always .the great danger that, in a community which reads only the magazine sections of Sunday newspapers and other similar literature, television will be regarded merely as another amenity for the general public, and that the close affinity between television and the defence application of electronic principles will be completely overlooked as indeed will be the influence of television on industry. When the eminent American physicist, Dr. Zworykin, whose name will always be remembered in connection with the invention and development of the camera tube, the heart and core of television, visited Australia recently, he said that he vision in the education and industrial fields. He regarded television broadcasting as only a minor use of the television principle. Throughout America to-day television has many industrial applications. It is being used in steel operation of all kinds of production equipment, for the supervision of entire manufacturing plants, and' of certain processes involved in the atomic energy programme. We should also bear in mind the fact, that, in time of war, television and electronics generally will enjoy a high priority. As aircraft become more complex and their speeds rise, so the powers of the pilot to operate them alone diminish. It is quite safe to say that, to-day no high speed military",28,Broadcasting Services
71,Mr Fairhall (Paterson) [12.9],"aircraft can leave the ground without its full complement of electronic aids, and all of these exist and. operate in the same field as does television. It is interesting to note that the modern fighter aircraft uses, in its electronic equipment, approxiaspects of television, I believe that we mately 250 radio valves whereas the modern bomber may well employ 2,000 or 2,500 radio valves in its basic operating equipment. In a recent statement, the vice-chairman of the TJnited States Defence Research Development Board pointed out that, whereas in 1937 a destroyer of the Americanfleetused about 60 radio valves in its entire equipment, by 1944 that figure had risen to 840, and by 1952 no less than 3,200 valves were necessary to operate the control, navigation, signalling and general defence equipment of those vessels. Already television principles are so closely allied to defence that we cannot have adequate defence without widespread use of them. I do not think that we in this country dare contemplate a situation in which we would be. forced to undertake the kind of defence to which we almost certainly shall be committed, without widespread knowledge of the electronic arts of defence. It would cost millions of pounds and occupy considerable time of which we should certainly not have a surplus in an emergency, to train the broad pool of skilled artisans that would be needed to design, manufacture, install, service, and even operate the electronic equipment that our defences would need. This is not mere theory. It is the result of practical experience during ""World War IT. Only the wide civil application of electronic principles can possibly provide for this country the pool of skilled 'techwere' known to be in progress here. The nicians that we urgently need. Recently, we had a distinguished visitor from overseas in the person of Sir Edward Appleton who, for many years, was Chief of the British counterpart of our Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization. Opening a conference in Sydney, he offered the opinion that Britain's progressive move in the development of monochrome television on ultra-short waves before the war had been a very important factor in conditioning the British radioindustry for the vital task of manufacturing entirely new radar equipment before and during the second world war. No one who has read the records of that war can have any doubt about the decisive role that was played by radar. However, looking beyond the entertainment and defence must have regard to the level of scientific development that is going on in Australia. It should be the responsibility of this Government, and of succeeding administrations, to ensure that no obstacle shall be placed in the way of our more advanced sciences. Australia has every right to be proud of its scientists in the radio and electronic fields. To-day, radio meteorology is playing an important part in the conduct of this country's affairs. In Sydney and at various other places, very advanced work is being carried out in the field of radio astronomy, again with our own engineers and technicians in charge. The process of ionospheric recording whereby it is possible to predict what conditions will operate in telecommunications circuits as far as three months in advance, is a field in which our engineers are well to the fore. Sir Edward Appleton has also said that Australia's record of discovery in the field of radio science is a brilliant one, and that our scientists are well known abroad. Addressing the International Scientific Radio Union Conference in Sydney recently, Sir Edward said that the conference was being held in this country to express the union's admiration of the fine work that bad been done in Australia during the last quarter of a century in the radio field, and to give memhers of the union a chance to see the many researches that people who are conducting those researches are the ones to whom we should have to look in the event of an emergency in which the rapid production of electronic tools of defence would be required. Unfortunately, at the very time when our need for these people and their services is greatest, the membership of the scientific institution which represents the hard core of this industry and of this science-the Institute of Radio Engineers of Australia-: s static and has been static for many years. Surely that fact tells its own story of limitation of opportunities for people who would otherwise enter thia important scientific field. If ber last, the Government decided to diswe are to deny to our Australian pense with the services of 10,000 emscientists the right of entry to the field ployees in the Commonwealth Public of advanced electronics we shall he doing Service.

If the Government dismisses employees and at the same time lets contracts for government works to outside contractors who have to engage large staffs, it cannot claim that it has effectively reduced the number of government employees. When the contract system, was originally introduced it immediately became evident that conduit and line-laying work could not he performed as efficiently and expeditiously by private tract 3,ystem, the department foots the bill contractors as by efficient and skilled departmental employees. Many unsatisfactory feaures of contract work were revealed. The work performed was often not up to departmental standards, and tbe wages, and conditions enjoyed hy the employees were.not comparable with those observed by the Postal Department. Further, a great deal of contract work was found to have teen unsatisfactorily carried out and the department was involved in unnecessarily high maintenance costs. Conduit laying hy the department under the day-labour system is the subject of an award of the Commonwealth Public Service Arbitrator which includes provisions for wages aud sick and longservice leave that are more liberal than are those applicable to the employees of outside organizations. Strong protests against the re-introduction of the contract system were made to the department by the Amalgamated Postal Workers Union. The reply hy the Postmaster-General, and senior departmental oflicers indicated that the Government, in deciding to re-introduce the contract system was actuated by two motives. First, it was said that the system had been introduced in order to gain experience of its use for conduit work, so that a comparison could be made with normal departmental methods, and, secondly, that extensive installation and British postal authorities had been carried out by contract with highly satisfactory results. The first reason given for the change seems to me to be a very strange one. To-day, the honourable member for Brisbane( Mr going to extremes in pushing its policy of George Lawson) and the Minister representing the Postmaster-General both paid a high tribute to the standard of efficiency exhibited by the Postal Departtelegraph equipment. The contract, system was discarded in the past because the department learned that postal works could be most efficiently and expe^ ditiously carried out by its own employees. At a time when the need for economy is being preached by government spokesmen it is strange that a more costly system for carrying out postal works should be instituted. Under the conin respect of not only the cost of labour and material, but also depreciation of the machinery that is used. In addition, it commits itself to an expenditure that ineiiudes a substantial profit for the contractor. At the same time, it has no guarantee that the contractor will observe employment conditions and pay wages identical with those that it applies in respect of its employees who are engaged on similar work. The contention that the Postal Department is justified' in adopting certain methods merely because the British postal authorities have adopted similar methods does not conform to the department's practice in the past. In any event, the British authorities are confronted with conditions which differ in many respects from those that exist in Australia. For'instance, the numerical strength of the staff of the British Postal Department has been pegged for many years by the British Treasury. Consequently, it has not heen the practice of the British authorities to carry out work that is done by the Postal Department in this country. However, even in this respect, the British authorities recently changed their methods. Engineering Department Letter No. 7-50, issued by the British postal authorities, prescribed that certain classes of conduit work previously carried out by contract,, must he done by the department itself. Apparently, the British postal authorities underground work for the found, as a result of experience, that it was more economical and satisfactory to do certain classes of conduit laying themselves instead of by contract. In this instance, the Government is supporting private enterprise. Governments, in the great majority of countries, recognize that the provision and conduct of postal, telephonic and telegraphic facilities is a governmental responsibility and, consequently, they retain complete control of such services. The experience that the Postal Department in Australia has had of the day-labour system over many years has enabled it not only to train specialists, but also to impart to its employees the "" know-how "" to enable them to meet departmental requirements efficiently and expeditiously. We shall not be acting in the best interests of Australia if . we permit the contract system, with its many disturbing characteristics, to be re-introDajarra, I think he was, perhaps, duced into the Postal Department. Can any one, who has had experience in respect of the contract system, particularly in relation to the construction of buildings for governmental purposes, say that it has always proved to be satisfactory? At one time, I was a memher of the Council of the University of Melbourne and I know that from 1936 to 193S that body was obliged to expend thousands of pounds in remedying the constructional faults in a building that had heen built hy contract in 1928. By the time the faults became apparent the contractor had gone out of business and could not be traced. One of the worse features of the contract system is that, owing to the desire of the contractor to make as much profit as possible,much of the work is skimped. Consequently, in many instances, those employed on the job are not allowed to perform their work to the best of their ability. Maintenance costs are increased and-, very often, extensive alterations have to he made because contractors do not carry out their work properly. I sincerely trust the Government will not encourage the contract system in respect of Postal Department work, hut will give every consideration to the representations that have been made to it and decide that, in future, conduit work and similar work shall he carried out by day labour. Territories) [12.35] I wish to refer briefly to some remarks that were made by the honourable member for Griffith( Mr Berry) in respect of the development of railway transport in the northern part of Australia. Honourable members are familiar with his constant advocacy of this particular development and also of the interests of Queensland, in which State his electorate is situated. I believe that honourable members generally appreciate the service that he has done in directing attention to these matters. I shall make only one comment regarding the substance of what he said, and that is that whilst I agree completely with his advocacy of the construction of a railway from Birdum to the Queensland border and thence to influenced by his keenness for Queensland interests rather to belittle other elements in railway development which also require attention. He went so far as to suggest that a railway from Alice Springs north to Newcastle Waters would not be of much value. I dispute that contention. When we think of railway development in the north we cannot think of a single line; rather, we must think of a system. And when we are thinking of a railway system for the north and centre of Australia we have to think in terms not of a particular State, or even of a particular Commonwealth territory, but of northern development in the most comprehensive sense. The boundary lines between the Northern Territory, Western Australia, South Australia and Queensland are artificial, and have no basis in geography at all. The natural regions of that area extend across those artificial boundaries. When we think of the development of a railway system in that area we should think of the needs of the area as a whole and not stop at the boundaries of a particular jurisdiction. We must think of a railway as a part of a system that will serve the whole of the north. Honourable members are aware that for some months past the Government has been investigating the possibilities of northern railway development. Last year, I set up a body which assembled a good deal of information that already existed and made fresh inquiries, and presented to the Government a mass of information regarding the practical aspects of the constructional and economic problems involved. The Government has before it comprehensive",31,Deputy Chaieman Paid Greater Attention To The Use Of Tele
73,Mr Hasluck (Curtin,"Minister formaterial on the subject. It has also available to it the advice of its experts. given attention to the related problemThus, it will be enabled to make a clear determination on the matter. However, before we can say that a particular railberth in that port. way should be built, we have to keep our feet on the earth. We have to realize that railways clo not materialize simply because we wish them to do so; they can be constructed only when it is possible for us to find the requisite labour, finance, timber and steel. That is the key to railway development. Although one might criticize the previous Government for having failed to give attention to this problem, I believe that, in fairness, we must recognize that that Government could not have done anything in that direction even if it had heen disposed to take such action. It was not until this Government had brought about a new situation with respect to the supply of steel, and had accomplished some of the tasks which had prior claims on available timber supplies, and in addition, had brought about a different, attitude towards the employment of labour and its continuation of immigra-r tion had given it some prospect of obtaining labour for such big construction jobs, that it was enabled to face the real problem of railway development in the north. Because of the changes in those respects we are now in a much happier position in which to tackle the problem of the development of our railways. Apart from assembling material resources, however, we cannot go ahead with railway development until !3everal decisions in relation to principle have been made. Important considerations in relation to gauge must be resolved in co-operation with the States concerned. The different gauges of the existing railway systems are one of the biggest obstacles that will have to be overcome in the north, if we are to bring about the maximum development of our northern areas. These matters are receiving attention. The Government is giving attention also to other forms of transport in our northern areas. There has been an amazing improvement of stock routes, particularly in the Northern Territory during the last two years. It is now possible to move stock from those areas to the markets with much greater facility than formerly. We have also 1 of Darwin Harbour, with the object of providing immediately at least one safe The proposed vote for the Commonwealth Bailways, Division No. 46, includes the provision of £1,257,000 fnr the Central Australia Railway, and £260,000 for the North Australia Railway. These amounts are far greater than amounts that have been provided for those railways in recent years. They will be expended principally in the purchase of new rolling stock. My colleague, the Minister for Shipping and Transport (Senator McLeay), has recently announced the intention of his department to purchase new rolling stock and locomotives for these railways, in order to improve the service. I assure the committee that this Government is fully conscious of the importance of transport in the development of the northern parts of Australia. We believe that development should continue, not on the basis of only a single track, but of a railway system. We shall continue to give this matter very close attention. want to say a. few words about the excessive delay in the provision of private telephones. There are more than 42,000 applications for telephones in New South Wales outstanding. Ahout2 per cent, of the applicants have been waiting for installations for longer than seven years. In view of the large number of complaints that I have received ahout this delay, it seems to me that the majority of the applicants comprising that 2 per cent, reside in my electorate. It appears that they have little prospect of receiving telephones for some considerable time to come. Mr Eiuc J.

(Ordered to he considered together.) Mr J. R. FRASER (Australian Capital Territory) [2.15] I shall direct my remarks to that portion of the Estimates that relates to the Australian Capital Territory, in particular to cultural and. community activities and grants in aid of social services. There is a need for the establishment in this capital city of community centres in the best sense of those words. Canberra is vastly different from any other community in Australia. It is a planned community. It is not a community which grew because of usual economic reasons. Had there not heen a decision to establish the National Capital of the. Commonwealth here, there would never have been a city in this place. It. is: doubtful whether therewould ever have, been more than a small hamlet or village. Becanse it.is a planned city, and because it has not. had the natural growth of other communities of this, size, in Australia, the, differences. centre which would compensate for he.fewe.en, it and them have been, perpetuated. For example, Canberra's populace has been brought from the various cities of the Commonwealth. People have been transferred here only for the reason that they were to be employed here. This, city has not the ordinary day-byday activities of other cities of its size. Here there is no buying or selling of land. There is here no buying and selling of stock. No farmers bring in produce to sell to the community. There are not in this city the ordinary day-by-day contacts of commerce and community interest that exist in a town which has grown gradually from economic necessity. Consequently, there is not the same community of interest among the people of tliis capital city that is found in other towns. Most of its people came from suburban homes to this area and this is the first time that many of them have lived in what might he regarded as a There is no common ground on which the people of the capital city can meet and exchange their views apart from the clubs and sporting bodies that have heen established, and the departmental activities that bring many of them together. There is no main street in Canberra. There are shopping centres-planne d shopping centres, sited where the administration of the day decided that shopping centres should be. It has not a main street, developed according to the needs of the community. Consequently there is a lack of common ground on which people can meet to discuss day-by-day affairs because there is a lack of the business activity which occupies the ordinary town of this size. There are here no shire and municipal councils. There is no pastures protection hoard and no grazier's association or farmers, and settlers' association. Tn other words, there are none of those usual country town activities that bring people together and give to them a common interest. An interrelationship develops among the people of the average country town which is surrounded hy a farming or grazing hinterland. It . has been suggested, over the years, that the Government, should undertake the. establishment of a Canberra'si lack of a main, street.. Some; two years ago the Australian Capital Territory Advisory Council suggested that at least two large community centres should be established, one on each side of the river, in order to take the place of a main street and provide the common ground on which people, whether departmental employees, employees of private enterprise, or men who were working temporarily in the Territory, could meet and come to know each other and develop that community of interest which alone can make a city great. The Australian Capital Territory Advisory Council suggested that each of these centres should have a large hall with a good dance floor and stage and that provision should be made for the amplifying of music, either from records or radio, so that there would always be facilities for dancing. Any organization that organizeda dance there could hire an orchestra if it desired to have one. It was suggested that each centre should also have a milk bar and cafeteria, a reading room, a well-stocked popular library, a billiard room, a table tennis room, a badminton court, a wide glassed-in verandah with tables and chairs, and a band ro tunda and promenade with lawns. ""When the suggestion was made, the then Minister for the Interior, who is now the Minister for Advisory Council statingThe requirements of individual community centres may differ according Jo the interests of the residents, but most of the features mentioned in the council's resolution are those which would commonly be regarded as essentia] or desirable portions of any scheme. So, although the scheme was ambitious, the Government recognized that these features should be provided. In this city of about 23,000 people, 23.5 per cent., according to the figures of the Department of the Interior for 1951, live in hotels, hostels or guest houses. They have not the same opportunities for community life as have people who live in houses. From time to time ministers of religion and others have expressed concern regarding conditions which they believe exist in hostels in this Territory. E have lived in a hostel here for at least two and a half years and I have found no evidence that would substantiate the fears that have been expressed to me by these reverend gentlemen and others. But I believe that a proper opportunity should be provided, not only for young people in hostels, but also for new-comers into this community, to foregather and develop those friendships that should bt developed in order to make life as full as it can be. I believe that community centres would he revenue-producing, if not profit-making. In most country towns after the evening meal, people can walk down the main street and go to the school of arts for mental relaxation or to a cafe for a cup of tea, hut these opportunities for getting together do not exist in Canberra. Community centres wpuld provide the meeting ground which the city at present lacks and I hope that they will be established. I turn now to the subject of assistance for the old people of this community. ""When I spoke during the debate on the Estimates last week I mentioned the very fine work that the Government had done in caring for the children of this territory. I spoke with warm appreciation of the work that had been done in the kindergarten centres for children of pre-school age. Those centres are truly magnificent, and the school facilities provided in Canberra for the primary and secondary education of children are also excellent. However, the children upon whom such great care is lavished ultimately face the problem of growing old, and in Canberra the Government provides no facilities for the care of aged people. From time to time the Twilight Homes Committee and other public organizations have propounded schemes designed to provide homes for aged people, not of the institution type, but cottage homes that will provide for all their accommodation needs. So fatit has heen found not possible to provide such accommodation, although the need is more pressing than, ever before. When I spoke previously of the facilities for the care of pre-school age children and school children, I omitted to mention the excellent work that is being done by the citizens of Canberra wh« support those institutions. That work is extensive and valuable, and I believe that the citizens of our community are jus.t as eager to help to finance and maintain homes for old people as they are to help in the education of the children.",34,Deputy Chaieman Paid Greater Attention To The Use Of Tele
76,"Defence ( Mr Mcbride), Wrote To The","Honourable members who do not see much of Canberra should, on some occasion, travel by car to RussellH ill or to the camp to the east of Duntroon, or to Westlake, where they can see how some old people of this community are forced by economic circumstances to live. I believe that the Government should do everything possible to make homes available for the aged, and I am sure that the community will give to the Government every possible support if it will only take the initial step. A start could be made by setting aside from the next group of cottages that becomes available for allocation to tenants, one, two or perhaps three houses for aged people. Members of the National Council of Women in the Australian Capital Territory have devoted much time to sponsoring and fostering an appeal for homes for old people. They have also performed a magnificent task in supporting the old people's own organization, the ""Thursday Club. The women members of the National Council of Women, with the assistance of the members of other organizations in Canberra, will rally to the support of the Government once it takes the initial step to help old people. They will do their best to maintain the homes allotted to old people and will continue their care of the aged. heen said too frequently that the main problems to be solved in the development of the Northern Territory are lack of water and inadequate transport. Whilst that is true to a degree, the real difficulty to he faced in developing the territory is its isolation from the rest of the community. There are about 12,000 people in the Northern Territory, and in the remaining part of Australia about 8,500,000. The people of the territory know the problems that they have to face but they hope to achieve much more progress in the next few years than has been achieved in the territory since the Commonwealth assumed responsibility for it. It is true to say that the Northern Territory at present needs not so much an examination of detail by the Parliament, and not so much an examination of high policy, but rather a completely new approach. I tioned in in this ask honourable members to consider the economical and geographical facts of the whole problem of the' development of the territory. The territory itself is about 523,000 square miles larger than the combined areas of New South Wales and Victoria. The territory is capable of immense development, but it is the part of our continent that is closest to the 1,000,000,000 people to our near north. Those northern peoples are both land hungry and food hungry, and it is significant that the northern part of the Northern Territory offers immense possibilities for the production of vast quantities of food. The territory as a whole has great mineral resources, but for years there has been little, if any, development of its huge area. In that connection I desire to quote from an article that appeared in the Commonwealth Tear-Book of 1931. It is headed "" Production, Agriculture "", and readsUp to the present agriculture has made little progress in the Territory although it hae been proved that rice, tobacco, coconuts, mangoes, bananas, cotton, various fibre plants and peanuts can be successfully grown. Expensive harvesting ie at present an obstacle to the economic production of rice, and until labour saving machinery is procured it cannot he produced with profit. The present position of agriculture in the territory is little different from its position in 193.1. It is true that the main problems that face any scheme to increase agricultural production are lack of water and transport, but if we consider the territory from the viewpoint that its development, is essential, not only to the few people living there but also to the future security of Australia, then the problem of water supply will not appear to be so difficult of solution as has been frequently suggested. In the northern part of the Northern Territory there is no lack of water, although, in order to distribute the water to the land, engineering and irrigation problems must be solved. In the southern part of the territory much more can be done to conserve the water that flows down many of the rivers for from two to four months of the rainy season, and to develop bore water supplies. Tim necessity for increased transport facilities the territory has been menchamber on occasions. I therefore do not want to mention it in",36,Capital Territory Country Town
77,Mr Davis (Deakin) [2.27],"It hasdetail and shall merely say that the difficulty can be overcome by the supply of men, machinery and labour. Since all Government expenditure must be accompanied by a weighing of the importance of the projects upon which the money is to he expended and their relation to the general demands of the community, I am optimistic that in the fairly near future the cost of supplying transport to the territory will not loom so largely as it has done in our consideration. It has been a matter for debate wJiether, if the railways system of the territory is to be enlarged, a railway should be built from Darwin to Birdum and then to Alice Springs, or the Queensland railways system should be linked with the Channel country through Dajarra and Camooweal. I have not sufficient technical knowledge to be able to say which of those suggestions is the better, but I believe that hoth systems of railways are necessary for the full development of the territory. I am sure that, considering what has been done to the present, we can look forward with confidence in the near future to some sort of progress along the lines that I have mentioned. Another matter that has not heen referred to so frequently is not connected with the natural features of the territory; it is concerned with its administration. It is the problem that has arisen because of the difficulty of administering a huge territory that lies 2,000 miles or 2,500 miles from Canberra. I do not suggest that any government has endeavoured to delay the development of the territory or to restrict the activities resumed for agricultural purposes under of its residents. It is a self-evident fact that, because of the great distance that senarates the territory from Canberra, where its administrators work, its people have not received the sympathetic understanding that they should receive. Fortunately, there is evidence of an improvement in this direction. 1 hope thc realistic outlook that has been adopted by the present Minister for Territories ("" Mr Hasluck) will set a new standard for the public servants who are responsible for the affairs of the territory. The ultimate responsibility for the development of the ""Northern Territory, of course, lies with this Parliament. Pastoral development has been in the forefront of the many subjects that have spasmodically occupied the attention of ihose who have been interested in the territory over the last 40 years. The present Minister is to be congratulated on the practical approach that he has made tc tjie problems of land settlement and pastoral development. It is easy to generalize and be dogmatic on this subject, but it is extremely difficult to frame a po icy that will meet the needs of the ; residents of such a large area, in which conditions vary so considerably. I congratulate the Minister on the way in which he has encouraged resident ownership of stock property. Many cattle holdings in Northern Australia, cover an area of 5.000 square miles. One of them exceeds 10,000 square miles. These are enormous areas by comparison with holdings in the southern part of the continent. It is an outstanding fa.ct that, in the main, resident, owners have done a far better joh and have accepted a far greater degree of responsibility to the Government that has made the land available to them than have the managers who work for absentee landlords. There are exceptions, but that is generally true. One of the chief problems of administration is that of making laws that encourage the useful and hard working land-holders without being unduly lenient towards those who are not doing a good job. I hope that, the Mmister will give some consideration to the possibility of promoting further agricultural development in some of the areas that are now under pastoral lease. Provision should be made in the terms of the leases for areas to he reasonable conditions. I understand that, proposals for the extension of railways in the Northern Territory have already bec:i under investigation. I hope that, when new rail services are provided, consideration will be given to the fact that thf values of leasehold areas served by the new lines will be enormously enhanced. The vital factor in all plans for the development of the Northern Territory is cost, and we must realize that the funds must he provided by the millions of people who live in the other parts of Australia. Therefore, we must endeavour to enlist the sympathetic interest of thosepeople'. No government can develop tlie Northern Territory without the sup1 port' of the people generally. Therefore, all. honourable members who have any knowledge of the territory should do their bes't t'o infereM the electors in the r.;isk 6f opening' up ffia't potentially rich we belong"". We cannot evade responarea. The Commonwealth Scientific and [n'dustrial Eesearch Organization is engaged in research work that is of the first importance to the Northern Territory. Its work on fodder conservation and the development of grasses of types that are suitable to the Northern Territory is of inestimable value. This research at Katherine, I understand, is being sadly hampered by the lack of finance. Its importance is so great that false economy cannot he excused. It is not applicable in many ways to the more closely settled areas of the south, hut it may have a vital bearing on the future prosperity of the Northern Territory. Therefore, the Government should make sure that the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Eesearch Organization shall not be forced to curtail its programme at Katherine. The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN -Order!

A grave responsibility rests upon this Parliament and the Crown to ensure that pastoral and farming areas shall be improved to such a degree that settlers will have a reasonable hope of success from the beginning. If such a policy be adopted, a farmer who takes a virgin block can succeed. If that policy be not adopted, only wealthy people will be able to settle on the land. It is freely stated to-day that a person, before he can hope to succeed on the land in the Northern Territory, must have a capital of £30,000. How many persons who have a knowledge of land conditions are prepared to invest such a sum in order that they may settle in the territory? Yet there are thousands of young men in this country, some of whom hold degrees from the Hawkesbury Agricultural College drovers, station managers, and the like-wh o would be prepared to settle on and work the land, provided they had some hope of succeeding from the beginning. If this country seriously desires to increase food production and people the north, finance should not be an impediment. The best settlers, of course, are our own Australian people. We know from practical experience gained in a recent survey of the Northern Territory that many absentee companies are doing as two honorahle members have suggested in newspaper articles, namely merely mining and destroying the territory. I travelled for some hundreds of miles across one area and the only stock I saw were scrub bulls. I was informed that no fewer than 17,000 scrub bulls had been shot in three years. there could have been, and should have been, 17,000 bullocks or 17,000 carcasses of beef for export to Great Britain. Such strengthened our export trade and earned valuable sterling for Australia. because of the policy of laisser-faire. to which the honourable member for Macarthur ( Mr Jeff Bate) referred, in accordance with which the development of the territory has heen left to private enterprise, such a state of affairs has been permitted. Mr Luchetti. In the limited time at my disposal, I must deal hurriedly with the other matters that I wish to discuss. I regard gold-mining as the sick industry of the territory. It is even more sick than is the pastoral industry. Gold-mining is in the doldrums because this Parliament, this Government and this nation have not done enough to encourage it. I shall not lay blame specifically on the Minister for Territories or the Administrator, but I consider that more batteries should be operating so that the small prospectors and gougers can have their ore treated. At Tennant Creek we found that one battery had been dismantled, another was not working and the third had been completely destroyed in removal. That state of Very few indeed! affairs is scandalous and should be corrected without delay. There is room for further activity in wolfram production. In the tin area, because there is only one battery and a treatment plant that is incapable of treating the ore efficiently, the men who are engaged in gouging tin are working only the very richest section of the lode, and even then they can arrange for battery treatment, only once in two, three or four months. Some enterprising young men liave decided to get timber in their spare time. The Maranboy tin area offers the greatest possibility of earning money and savingimports, but development is being delayed. The men are mining only the best of the lode and then they find that the treatment plant loses from 45 to 50 per cent, of the concentrates that pass through it. The mining situation in that area badly needs reviewing. The DEPUTY CHAIEMAN -Order! The honorahle member's time has Actually, expired.

Previous speakers in the debate, including the honourable memher for Macquarie ( Mr Luchetti), the honorahle member for Deakin( Mr Davis) and the honourable member for Evans( Mr Osborne), have referred properly to the problems that.",39,Capital Territory Country Town
81,Mr Davidson (Dawson) [2.57],"are involved in the development of the Northern Territory. I propose to address myself to an equally important problem -the development of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea. Honourable members may recall that yesterday f applied myself to the defence aspect of tliis matter. I make no apology now for addressing my remarks to another problem of the territory because it is desirable that the work shall be advanced rhere and Australia has a duty to ensure that the development shall be conducted urgently and properly. attention to the problem is highly desirable, first, because of Australia's honorand technical, so that the rapid developable commitments to the native population, and secondly, because we have solemn commitments under the mandate that we hold from tbe United Nations organization. The necessity for dealing with the problem urgently is emphasized by the value that such development could have in the near future and by its importance in the overall plan for the defence of Australia and its territory. One of the principal factors that is involved in the development of Papua and New Guinea is the great need for agricultural development. I realize fully that the prime responsibility for such agricultural development rests with the administration of the territory, but I regard the matter in so far as it applies to the Australian Government, as comparable with the problem that the Government faces in dealing with the development of the Australian States. We are rapidly approaching a point in the history of the Commonwealth where the Territory of Papua and New Guinea must be regarded as the seventh State of Australia. The time is not far distant, and I hope that we shall reach it soon, when the territory will be given the status of the We should concentrate on fostering agriseventh State. If the matter is approached from that angle, the problem does not involve simply the determination of a basic policy on agricultural and other developments. It calls, also, for assistance and New Guinea for a considerable time, to the administration that is already carrying out that task. I shall approach the subject from that point of view. In fonnation that I obtained during a recent visit to the territory convinced me that the Department of Agriculture in the territory is already doing valuable work in developing to the full thc agricultural potentialities of the area. But I was also convinced that a great and urgent need exists for the utmost assistance to be given to that department by the Government. Under the leadership of the Director, Mr Dwyer, the Department of Agriculture in the territory is performing fine work, but it is hampered by the lack of adequate finance and sufficient technical assistance to deal adequately with the problems that exist. I wish to direct the Immediate attention of the committee to the urgent need for further assistance, both financial ment of agriculture in the territory may be accomplished. The territory can play an important role in tlie overall development of Australia in the spere of argriculture. Timber and mining must be considered also, but agriculture offers a field that is ready for development now. With regard to technical assistance it might be possible to second the services of competent men who are at present working with the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Eesearch Organization in Australia, or to provide technical staff for the investigation of agricultural problems. In order to drive home the claim that I am making for this additional assistance, I propose to deal with some of the avenues along which the agricultural development of the territroy could be furthered and some of the problems that are facing-the agri cui tuial industry. It is not enough to make a general statement ahout the need to help in the development of the territory. We should make some concrete suggestions as to how the Commonwealth can render material assistance. cultural production, particularly of such commodities as rubber, cocoa, copra, coffee, tea, rice and kenaf. Rubber has been produced in the Territory of Papua but an appreciable percentage of the rubber trees have now passed beyond the stage of maximum production, and are due for replacement. It cannot be claimed that rubber production from the areas at present planted is really satisfactory. In fact, production per acre is at least 25 per cent, lower than in Malaya, chiefly because an inferior variety of rubber tree has been planted. The Malayan Eesearch Institute found that, by a process of selecting clones as they are called, from the best young plants, the In some of the islands, the elephant standard of productivity could be raised. These selected plants are developed in an isolated area, and by their means rubber production has been materially increased. Before the last war, the rubber conduct experiments in order to make planters of Malaya applied much the same policy in regard to rubber trees as we have applied in regard to Merino rams. They refused to make available the best plants and the latest information to the planters of Papua and New Guinea. That policy has now been reversed, and the latest information is available, but it can be applied only with the help of a staff of technicians, who would be qualified to perform budding operations on the trees. The administration has acquired a large area in which to carry out experiments with a view to improving the strain of rubber trees, and I suggest that this Government can help by making available additional technicians. The number at present in the territory is not sufficient. Cocoa has been produced in Papua and New Guinea to a limited extent for some time past. The price is at present about £300 a ton, and the income derived from the sale of this product is a valuable adjunct to the economy of the territory. All sorts of technical problems are involved in the production of cocoa, such as the development of the best varieties of plants, and the discovery of methods to deal with' pests. Here, again, the best technical assistance should be afforded to the planters if the industry, which could be worth millions of pounds a yeaT, is to be fully developed. For many years past, copra has been the most valuable product of Papua and New Guinea. The crop is at present worth about £6,000,000 a year, hut production is only 75 per cent, of what it was to be a great success. I believe that all before the war. One reason for the decline is to be found in the ravages of a ""wog"" known as the elephant beetle, which attacks tbe trees. One planter told me that the industry had ""been losing about 10,000 trees a year partly because Mr Davidson. older trees are going out of production, and partly because the new plantings are being attacked and destroyed by the elephant beetle. So far, no effective method of control has been discovered. beetle has been attacked by a wasp, and planters believe that it might be possible to introduce the wasp to New Guinea. However, it would first be necessary to sure that the wasp would not itself become a pest. Eesearch of that kind is beyond the present capacity of the administration, and here is another direction in which the Government could help. The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN -Order! The honourable member's time has expired. | 3.32] -Al l honourable members who have discussed the Northern Territory have agreed that its effective development depends upon the evolution of a satisfactory government policy for the immediate and distant future. I make no apology for directing the attention of honourable members to the fact that such a policy has been lacking in the past. If there has been.any sort of policy in the past, it has heen spasmodic and disjointed. Hitherto, governments have always held the view, it would seem, that money expended in the Northern Territory has been money thrown down the drain. Their attitude has heen that the territory is a white elephant, and a burden to the rest of Australia. However, what do we find to-day? Recent developments .in the discovery and use of minerals, and in agriculture, have altered the prospects of the territory. Visits by ""members of this Parliament have made them acutely aware of the need to develop the area. So much is evident from, the speeches that they have made in the Parliament since their return. Not long ago, a delegation of members of the Parliament visited the territory by courtesy of the Minister for Territories ( Mr Hasluck), and the visit has proved honourable members should avail themselves of the opportunity to visit the Northern Territory so that they might become convinced of the part that it is destined to play in the future of Australia.",41,Capital Territory Country Town

85,Mr Hamilton,"I am not an apeIn my opinion, Darwin and Alice Springs are the two centres that speak for the territory. Despite the activities of this Government and other governments in investigating the potentialities of the Northern Territory and in seeking to expand work that is being done there, I believe that the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr problem is being attacked from the wrong angle. There are no real means of entrance to or exit from the territory. I believe that the kernel of the problem is Darwin harbour. Over the years, all kinds of suggestions have been made for improving the harbour, but so far nothing has really been done. honourable gentleman why; but, unfortunately, he would not understand. Darwin harbour facilities are in such a condition that it is almost impossible for ships to use them. Something is being done to improve the position, but recently a few more feet of what is called the Neptunia jetty disappeared into the water. At the present time, I arwin is served hy sma^l ships from Western Australia-Kabbarli and Dorrigo, which are vessels of 2,500 tons; Koolinda, which is somewhat larger; and Culcairn, a vessel of between 4,000 and 4,500 tons. They are the largest vessels that can be taken into Darwin harbour in its present condition, and the passage into the jetties is dangerous even for them, in some instances. The existing timber jetty is being repaired, and I must say that a really good poh is being made of it. will be ready for use at the end of October or some time in November. But, unfortunately, provision is being made for a head only 300 feet long. That would barely accommodate one of the very small ships from Western Australia, and even a ship of that size would have to he moved continually to permit cargo to be unloaded from its various holds. A jetty, to serve the port of Darwin adequately, should have a head at least 1,000 feet long, extending from the Boom jetty to the Neptunia jetty, or the Town jetty, as it is commonly called. That latter jetty must be destroyed eventually, and the sooner it is destroyed the better it will be for the safety of shipping that uses the harbour. Mr Clyde Cameron interjecting, Clyde Cameron) if he does not know it already, that the present unsatisfactory state of affairs in Darwin harbour is due to maladministration by the previous Government.

I could tell the The Chair is quite capable of dealing with the honourable gentleman if that becomes necessary. arc shaped, with two hills behind it. If those hills were razed and the earth were pushed into the water, the area between the jetties could he reclaimed, and a proper sea wall could be built. That would give Darwin a semblance of permanency, and would be in accord with the desire of the people of this country that it shall progress. the honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Nelson) agrees with me. At the moment, we are dealing with the problem piece-meal. The various interested parties must get down to brass tacks, and some authority must he charged with the task of going ahead with the necesI t is expected that the jetty sary work. The jetty in the harbour requires a much longer head, as I have said. I think every honourable, member would desire that, in the years ahead of us, vessels from overseas shall load and unload cargo in the north of Australia. If we wish to expand the mining, agricultural and pastoral industries of the Northern Territory, suitable transport facilities must be provided to bring into the territory the things that those industries need and to take their products out. The first matter that must, he settled is the plan for the port of Darwin. When I was a young man, the",45,Capital Territory Country Town

91,Mr Hamilton,"I am glad thatMinister for Eailways in the Western Australian Government decided that trams should run over what was known as the Horseshoe bridge in Perth. Immediately, there was an outcry. It was said that the trams would crack the foundations of the bridge, and would fall through it, that people would be killed, and that there would be a terrible calamity. But he stuck to his guns, and eventually trams ran across the bridge. Tliey are still doing sO, and the foundations of the bridge have not cracked. That gentleman went ahead with his plan. Similarly, we need to invest somebody with power to proceed with improvements of the port of Parwin. I ' turn now to the handling of cargo in Darwin. The lumpers there belong to the waterside workers' section of the North Australian Workers Union. The section has an arrangement with the Australian Stevedoring Industry Board and the ship-owners that waterside workers shall be made available ro handle cargo when a ship enters the port. Not many ships ply to Darwin. Culcairn, makes a trip to Darwin about once a month, and there is one ship from Western Australia roughly every fortnight. At certain times of the year there may be about three ships every month or five weeks. While those men are not working on the ships they are drawing £3 12s. a week appearance money, which is paid, I believe, by the Australian Stevedoring Industry Board. When a ship comes into port waterside workers ai-e engaged at the hourly rate applicable to their trade. I suppose most of them are married and have families and it is only common sense for them to take the opportunity to make each job last as long as possible. able member believe that they deliberately go slow on the job?' common sense to expect the men to make each job last as long as they possibly can, because they will then draw the higher rate of pay for a longer period. In the long run, however, they suffer because the increased costs of loading and unloading vessels are reflected in the cost of living, nothing. The effect of that is that the gang theirs as well as everybody elses, and they are actually worse off than they would be if they worked harder. Truck drivers who carry freight to and from ships are not paid on a hourly basis, as the honourable member for Northern Territory knows, but are paid out of a pool which is fixed in relation to the cost of moving the cargo. The money available is divided among truck-owners, irrespective of the size of the truck they are operating. The whole position seems to be wrong, right from the beginning. I had an opportunity to discuss the matter with the Minister for Shipping and Transport (Senator McLeay), who informed me that some discussions on it had taken place. I asked a wharf labourer at Darwin how much he earned a year in actual .wages and appearance money. These men have an arrangement under which they do not take any other job although, in fact,'I believe that there are not many other jobs available that they couid do in their idle time. The waterside worker told me that he received £750 a year. I suggested that he would he much better off if he were guaranteed a wage of that amount and he agreed with me. If we could devise a scheme under which those men would receive a regular weekly wage similar to the amount they now earn from wages and appearance money combined, it is obvious that they would work harder so as to have more idle time for which they would be paid. The rate of loading and unloading ships would thereby be increased. That would be of benefit to the whole community, and would reduce the cost of the subsidy paid to the Western Australian Government for trading to Darwin. By guaranteeing them a certain income a year we should overcome this natural tendency, for which neither I nor any one else could blame them, to make a job last as long as possible so that they will earn the 15s. hourly rate for a longer period instead of going back to the daily rate of 12s. It is not uncomI say it is only mon to see a gang of eight men who are supposed to he working on a ship taking turns to work four at a time. Half of them work while the other half are idle. Then they change over, and the four men who have not been working as they should have been, work while the other four do",46,Capital Territory Country Town

93,Mr Hamilton,"is working only an effective four hours in an eight-hour day, although it is paid for working an eight-hour day. Neither the men nor other people are contented, because the cost of living in Darwin is increased by this stupid arrangement. Perhaps the position cannot be altered, but if it can be, then the Government should give serious consideration to an alteration of it. I rose to mention Darwin harbour only because I consider that conditions there are responsible, to a great degree for so many of the problems of the Northern Territory. I was in the Northern Territory two years ago when an inaugural meeting of citizens was held in order to establish a body to foster civic pride in Darwin. I recently visited the town again, during convalescence from an illness, and found it transformed. I pay a tribute to the people of Darwin for their achievements in that direction. since the election of the new honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr on the job. Heavy costs do occur, but Nelson). since the election of this Government. on it. cerity that Darwin has undergone a transformation, and I found it a pleasure to be in the town, especially when I compared present conditions with the conditions that I saw there in war-time and again two years ago last July when I visited Darwin while I was carrying out some work for the then Minister for the people of Darwin continue with this good work. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN .gentleman's time has expired. [3.42] I welcome this opportunity to -speak, even if only for a short period, -on that portion of the Estimates which relates to territories. My strong belief is that the greatest difficulty that is -experienced in the territories, particularly the Northern Territory, is lack of proper 'transport. remedied if a far-seeing government were to seize the opportunity that now presents itself. However, before dealing with that matter I shall refer to a statement made -by the honourable member for Canning( Mr Hamilton) about the allegedly slow rate of discharging ships in the port of Darwin. I agree with him that the port facilities of Darwin are inadequate. Some ships visit there only once in three months and yet, as a result of bad timetabling, frequently ships arrive in Darwin at the same time as other ships. Some of those ships have to wait round before being able to discharge their cargoes. I do not accept the view that waterside workers deliberately go slow on the job, because I understand that a captain of a vessel which frequently visits Darwin has said openly that the rate of discharge there is as good as it is at any other port in Australia. His statement answei's the allegation frequently made that the heavy costs of comhas happened modities in the Northern Territory is the result of waterside workers going slowthey are the result of the inadequate port facilities that the honourable member for Canning has mentioned. I had an opportunity to visit Darwin during the war, shortly after the town had been damaged by bombing. I visited it again some years -I say in all sinlater and found that no progress had been made since my previous visit in the direction of remedying the deficiencies of the port. As a person who has been associated with the workers for a long time. I have a strong objection to people continually alleging that the costs at any port are high because of go-slow tactics by workers, when it is well known that a big factor in high costs is a lack of enterprise on the part of people who have goods to unload. I do not believe that any waterside worker deliberately endeavours to waste time on the job, and I consider that any suggestion of that kind that comes from the other side of the chamber should be on a much more moderate tone. Perhaps we all are prone to believe press reports that emanate from inspired quarters.

They have stated their views. One need not agree with ail that they have said but, at least notice has been attracted to the Northern Territory. The territory is now news. Centres such as Alice Springs are growing rapidly. I first visited Alice Springs in 1928 when only 70 people lived there. That was before the railway line was built. Having seen what a fine town it is to-day I say that the development that has been carried out is a credit to overy one concerned. I hope that honourable members from both sides of the chamber will take the earliest possible opportunity to acquaint themselves with the disabilities that the Northern Territory suffers, particularly in relation to administration through having constantly to refer to Canberra. The inademission, presided over by Judge Wolfe, quacy of the Legislative Council for the Northern Territory has been criticized in this chamber. It may not be ail that r:ould be desired, but at least it is a step whether the standard gauge railway line in the direction of local government, and we should make every effort to improve upon it. One honourable member has suggested that the honourable member for the Northern Territory in this chamber should be a member of the Legislative Council for the Northern Territory. I do not know whether that would he constitutionally possible, but at least t h i proposal should be examined. I do not know of any one who would be of more value to the council than the present honourable member for the Northern Territory, who has an intimate knowledge of territory affairs. While I was Minister for Air and Minister for Civil Aviation, I had some association with the development of air services in the Northern Territory. Mr Cone'lan of Conellan Airways Proprietary Limited has done a splendid job by providing air transport services in areas where no other form of transport is possible."" These services have greatly improved living conditions, particularly for women and children. Eesidents of remote Northern Territory communities are now able to enjoy such essential foods as fresh fruit and vegetables. The establishment of air services in the Northern Mr Drakeford. Territory was possible only with the assistance of a government subsidy. Most honourable members will recall also that Mr Nelson Lemmon introduced a scheme for the development of the Northern Territory when he was Minister for Works and Housing. Unfortunately we were not able to implement that scheme because of the swing in Australian public opinion, but we may have an opportunity to do so at a later date. Possibly the present Minister for Territories may be able to do something. AlthoughI do not share his political outlook, I wish him weil in his efforts to make the Northern Territory not only an attractive gateway to this country, but also a valuable and well populated area of the Commonwealth. By now the Government is probably in possession of the report of the royal comwhich inquired into the differences of opinion between the Commonwealth and South Australia on the question of that is to be built to Leigh Creek, and, I hope, further north still, should go through Stirling or Quorn. As a railway man who knows something of the conditions under which men work on outback railways in this oountry, I believe that it s'hould not go through Quorn. By going through Stirling-the route which I believe the royal commission's report will recommend-the grades will be easier and the tonnage that the locomotives will be able to haul will be correspondingly greater. The line will also be .going to a coal-field where it will be possible to load coal straight onto the locomotives as well as the trucks. I have not seen the royal commission's report, but I am most eager to obtain a copy of it. I hope that when the line to Leigh Creek has been completed, the labour and equipment that have been assembled will be used, as the honourable member for the Northern Territory has suggested, to extend the standard gauge line to Alice Springs. I have heen over the present line both with the engine crews and as a passenger, and I know the high maintenance costs that are involved. In pertain regions, prevailing winds continually blow sand across the line. For 25 years the clearing of this sand in the region of Incapatana, on the Alice Springs line, to enable trains to pass has been a constant job. There is something radically wrong there. A new line could eliminate that high expense. Strangely enough, the 3-ft. 6-in. railway now in use is paying operating costs. It is extraordinary indeed that two railway lines operating in remote parts of this continent, where population is sparse, are paying operating expenses, while lines in the more closely settled parts of the Commonwealth are losing money heavily. The report of the Commonwealth Eailways Commissioner for 1950-53 points out that, in that year, the central Australian railway showed a surplus, exclusive of interest, over operatgarded as a national transport undering expenses, and the Minister for Shipping and Transport (Senator McLeay) has announced through the press recently that the profit on the Trans-Australian line in the.first six months of this year was £151,000, compared with a deficit of more than £152,000 in the corresponding period of last year. But for the long railway strike in Western Australia, the profit on the Trans-Australian line would have been considerably more. Those figures show that the Commonwealth Eailways Commissioner and his staff are doing a very fine job. The commissioner has done much to make the conditions of railway employees more bearable. I hope that if it is decided that Port Augusta and not Quorn shall be the head-quarters of the new railway line that is to run into the Northern Territory, the men who have been at Quorn for many years will -be compensated and provided with accommodation at the new location. Such adjustments have been made many times in the United States of America, although Australian railway authorities have not been very enthusiastic about the idea. I believe that the introduction of diesel locomotives would have beneficial effects on operating costs on the central Australian line in spite of the fact that there is a coal-field at Leigh Creek; but a properly constructed permanent way will be required. We should then have a Standard gauge line to Alice Springs, and I hope that, before long, it would be carried to Birdum and ultimately to Darwin. Much has been said about the mineral resources of central Australia. I agree with the Minister for Supply( Mr Beale), who said yesterday that we should not make too much of our discoveries. The value of the mineral deposits have not yet been proven. However, if there is to be a quick influx of population into the Northern Territory, transport facilities will have to be improved considerably. I wish to refer briefly in the few minutes that still remain to me to "" air beef""-the transport of beef carcasses from Glenroy to Wyndham. This may not be retaking in the ordinary sense, but while I was Minister for AirI was asked whether the Commonwealth would supplj an aircraft for this work. It did so and the service was inaugurated by the MacEobertson Miller Aviation Company Proprietary Limited. I am glad to say that it has been successful. Activities of that kind should be subsidized by the Government. still being subsidized. require a subsidy for a considerable time to come. Services of that kind should he extended as a means of developing our export beef trade. At present, these f=ervices are being conducted more or less on an experimental basis, but because of their importance every effort should he made to extend them, if necessary, by payment of subsidies. Great credit is due to those who instituted them. But for the assistance of Conellan Airways Proprietary Limited and the MacEobertson Miller Aviation Company Proprietary Limited, these services would not have been provided. Honourable members opposite who are the great protagonists of private enterprise are well aware that private enterprise is not willing to risk its capital in ventures of this kind unless it receives the backing by the Government.

I. understand that investigations along those lines are already being made. It may be possible to discover a virus for the eradication of dingoes that would be equally as effective as myxomatosis in rabbits. If it is possible to do so, millions of pounds will be saved to the graziers of this country. One of the undesirable features of the spread of myxomatosis in rabbits in Queensland is that it has resulted in foxes being denied the rabbit as their natural food and transferring to sheep and lambs. Provision should he made for experiments in the biological control of these pests, and in view of the seriousness of their depredations immediate action should be taken. shall direct my remarks to the proposed vote for the Territory of Papua and New Guinea. The Minister for Territories ( Mr Hasluck), who was recently responsible for arranging for a delegation for members of Parliament to visit the territory will, perhaps, be interested to hear some comments from members of that delegation in regard to the Territory of Papua and New Guinea and the islands included in, the itinerary. I shall discuss the agricultural development of the territory. I am aware that Australia faces an enormous problem iu that regard. That'is the Government's responsibility. There can be no doubt about the fertility of the territory."" I believe that under proper guidance it will achieve economic independence within a comparatively short period. Many factors will tend to help it to do so. When other honourable memhers and I visited the territory recently, we found ourselves in a somewhat unusual position for parliamentarians in that we had to do the listening not the talking and we did so in good measure because the people took full opportunity of our presence to inform us of conditions in the territory. As a farmer, I was forcibly struck by the fact that in spite of the fertility of the soil, the territory imports most of its foodstuffs from Australia. There are very few dairy farms, even near Port Moresby. Under local labour ordinances, the natives must be provided with a certain quantity of meat. The territory is importing its requirements of tinned meat and tinned butter and all kinds of provisions. I believe that if it were developed properly it could he enabled to show a favorable trade balance with Australia within a few years. I am aware, as I have no doubt the Minister himself is, that lack of transport facilities is the great obstacle to production. Many young men are prepared to settle permanently in the .territory and to plough back any profits that they may make. The Government should foster the settlement of men of that type. In the course of my visit, I met a young man who had been employed in a trade in Port Moresby but who, owing to i ll health, had decided to establish a dairy farm. It was apparent that, he had the initiative and was prepared to risk substantial capital in the venture. He told me that he purchased six dairy cows from a district near Sydney for £45, but that when they were landed at Port Moresby their cost amounted to £150 each. to the territory by air? Minister to have a look at matters of that kind. That young man ran the risk that some of the cows might have died or been fatally injured in transit. The Government should set up a stud farm in the territory with the. object of making available well-bred cattle for sale to local settlers. The Government could do much immediately to foster dairying by instituting a system of freight rebates in respect of the carriage of well-bred stock and various requisites. A system of freight concessions similar to that which operates in Victoria, should he applied to the Territory of Papua and New Guinea. We wish to develop the territory, and many men are prepared to settle there permanently",51,Capital Territory Country Town

However, when I made that suggestion to a young man whom I met in the course of my visit he replied, "" Oh, no! We would then have to pay taxes "". I replied that if a system of freight rebates were instituted, settlers in the territory would probably receive greater monetary benefits under it than they would be obliged to pay in taxation. Most of the provisions that are required by settlers in the Bulolo Valley have to be flown in. A lady who is engaged in growing coffee in that area told me that she had to pay £.12 air freight for a 4 gallon tin of weedicide. I am aware, of course, that coffee at present is bringing a high price. However, that is indicative of freight rates which, perhaps, represent the largest proportion of costs of production. Mr Leahy, a settler in the Bulolo Valley told me that that area is suitable for cattle-raising. He said that one beast that he had killed weighed 900 lb. established there? breeds as we have in Australia. I emphasize that transport is the great obstacle incurred hy each individual amounts to to increasing production in the territory. The terrain, in many instances, makes the construction of roads difficult and; settlers must rely upon air transport for the time being. We flew over the Ramu Valley, which is a magnificent tract of fertile chocolate soil that would gladden the heart of any farmer. One has only to see the products of native gardens to realize the fertility of the soil. Cattle are also being raised in the Baiyer River district. A lad there told me that the soil was most suitable for the growing of oats. He complained that he had heen supplied with only nine bushels of seed. Naturally, I replied that he was lucky to get that quantity owing to the high freight charges. I was also informed that Romney Marsh sheep had developed worms after they had been landed in the territory. Having regard to the class of soil, the elimination of that pest presents a serious problem. sites are probably of local origin. Kwata mission station in the tropics, I was surprised to see several sheep there. The officer in charge told me that during the war there were two or three sheep and a ram there, but when the American troops visited, that area theyreceived permission to remove a gland from the ram. Subsequently the ram died. Upon inquiry I was informed that the sheep had been at the mission since before the war. The natives had tried to shear one, but the others had not been shorn for about six years. I had difficulty in up-ending one of the sheep. It was in perfect condition and its wool was thickly matted. Obviously the parasite I have mentioned was not indigenous to that part of the world. There is something lacking in the soil there-probabl y a trace element. Sheep could he in good condition there until after lambing. Perhaps there is a lack of calcium in the feed. I consider that the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization should establish observation posts in those areas, and introduce corrective methods to obviate mistakes in future. The loss a considerable loss in terms of the national economy. About four years ago there was a severe shortage of jute in Australia. The primary producers were afraid that they would he unable to obtain sufficient sacks for their requirements. In the past, the fibre of the Kenaf grass has been sent to the mainland from the Territory of Papua and New Guinea, and it has been successfully treated. The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN ( Mr Bowden) -Order!

The field officers and patrol officers have not received sufficient tralian governments administered the credit for the very valuable service they have rendered in the territory. They work in most primative conditions. I pay tribute, also, to the War Graves Commission. I had an opportunity to visit the war cemeteries at Bomana, Lae, and Bitapaki. The members of the fighting forces who are buried there are certainly resting in beautiful surroundings. The War Graves Commission is doing a splendid job. The proposed vote includes the provision of £5,634,700 for ordinary services for the Territory of Papua and New Guinea, and. £38,000 for capital works and services. I com?ider that the proposed votes are inadequate. However, if the Government cannot see its way clear to increase the amounts, the money should be expended wisely. According to the report to the General Assembly of the United Nations on the Administration of the Territory of New Guinea for the year 1950-51, the expenditure out of revenue during that year amounted to £620.123. There was an extraordinarily high expenditure on contingencies. For instance, the salaries paid to the Government Secretary and his staff amounted to £11,973, and the expenditure on contingencies was £8,536. diture of £35,524 on the salaries of police, and £1S2,937 on contingencies. The committee should be informed explicitly of the nature of the contingencies. The present conditions in the Territory of Panua and New Guinea are probably similar to those that existed on the mainland of Australia 75 years ago. In the main, the territory is primitive and undeveloped. On looking through records relating to the Territory of Papua and New GuineaI found that the Commonwealth had not made a special grant to New Guinea prior to 1947. Up till 1940, when the Civil Administration ceased, the Commonwealth had granted only £42,500 yearly to the territory of Papua. This is one of the reasons why it has not been developed to a greater extent. Tn this connection I am pleased to be able to say that the territory was not administered by Labour governments for an appreciable time prior to 1941. Had previous Austerritory as it should have been administered when unemployment was rife in this country, I am sure that greater headway would have been made. The honourable member for Dawson( Mr Davidson) has stated that in time the Territory of Papua and New Guinea sliould become the seventh State of the Commonwealth. I believe that the people living in the territory are looking forward to that time. Although my friend the honourable member for Wannon( Mr McLeod) has stated that some people who live in the Territory of Papua and New Guinea are opposed to direct taxes being imposed on them by the Commonwealth, I believe that people who are prepared to make their permanent homes there are quite willing to submit to taxation provided the Commonwealth gives them the services that they need. I consider that we should expend far greater amounts on the development of the territory than we have done to date. I agree with the honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr Luchetti), and the honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Nelson) that we should develop the Northern Territory. However, if we do not protect and look after the Territory of Papua and New Guinea, possibly in time we shall not have the. Northern Territory to There was an expendevelop. Australia is responsible for the development of about 1,000,000 square miles of country in the Territory of Papua and New Guinea. One has to fly over the territory, as I did, in order to realize its vastness. In addition, there are about 600 islands adjacent to the territory, and I believe that it would be quite possible for long-range submarines to operate in the contiguous waters undetected. If honourable members remember what happened in Babaul during the war they will realize what to expect from an enemy in the future. Additional finance must be provided for the development and rehabilitation of Babaul. Along the coast from Babaul the Japanese built an almost impregnable system of tunnels where they landed from deep-sea landing craft and barges and put them under the mountains for land. I do not believe that the land protection. That system of tunnels and should be taken from the natives. It suhways should be destroyed, because it should be used on a co-operative basis would, be a potential danger in the event by soldier settlers and the natives. of a future invasion.

Mr .HASLUCK (CiiTtiin-Minister for 'tWritories) [4.33]] I .think that this debate ihas heen quite remarkable inasmuch as it has demonstrated the value of .the recent visit to the Territory of Papua and New Guinea and the Northern Territory by the two joint parliamentary delegations. The honourable members who made the most notable contributions to this debate were members of those parties. Many interesting and, for the most part, valid comments have heen made from both sides of the chamber. I do not propose, in the slhort time left to me, to deal generally encouraging local initiative. with each of those comments in detail, but [ assure the honourable memhers who have contributed to the debate that I shall study the Hansard report of these proceedings carefully, examine each point in turn, and let them have the information that they have requested by way of a circulated memorandum. There is one general comment which I sshould like to make because it seems to me that those who have spoken have overlooked a most important fact. The really effective -work to develop the territories is being done by those Australians who are living and working in the territories. We should recognize that fact as basic to everything that we may say or do. All the wishes and hopes that may be expressed in this Parliament, or all the money voted by this Parliament, will be of no account unless we have, engaged day by day in faithful service on behalf of the Government or on their own account, young and vigorous Australians who by their own energy and the work of their own hands will carry out the task of development both in the Northern Territory and in Papua and New Guinea. I desire now to say something about the administration of the territories. I pay a public tribute to the devoted and valuable service that is being rendered to Australia by the administrators of the territories and their omcers. My own interpretation of the function of a Minister for Territories is that as far as possible he should encourage the local administrators of the territories to do as much as they can on the spot. There are certain constitutional limitations to their power, hut, subject only to such [35] restrictions, I believe that ""the whole trend of -oiutr policy should he to «ncourage Ae local officeirs to do more and more on theiiown initiative. With that fend in view the present Government has concentr-aited a .good deal, -in a painstaking and routine way, to try to bring about two or three simple results. We have atteampted tb raise administrative efficiency in the territories by new recruitment to the services, by improving the conditions of officers and by We have also taken measures to ensure that Australia shall get value for the money voted by this Parliament. When the Australian Parliament votes money for the territories, it must be assured that it will get full value for the money expended from those votes. We are trying to make conditions in the territory more congenial and acceptable to those who are serving there. Another of our major responsibilities is to ensure that the development of the territories shall bring good social results in its train. I am not speaking of social benefits that may be received by individuals; I am concerned that the kind of community that will be built up in these territories will he one that will be happy in itself and useful to Australia. A very wise remark was made by one of the honourable members who contributed to this debate. He said: "" It is the Community in the territory that really does matter It is not until we make people want to establish their homes and live in the territories that we shall he able to see any real and satisfactory development of these areas. There are various reasons for which people go to our territories, whether it be the Northern Territory or New Guinea. One reason is simply to exploit the country. Some people are prepared to undergo wretched conditions for a few years in order to make a large amount of money. It is possible for people to go to our territories with a sense of exile and come back and enjoy the results of their exile. This Government does not think that that motive alone will lead to good results in the territory. The end to which this Government will direct its activities is .to establish in these territories a well grounded, happy and stable condition of living that will conform with the best standards of Australian society. No matter what development may take place and what riches may be taken out of the territories, unless are making their own very solid contributhe result of our efforts is the establishment of a happy community of Australians in the territories, living a life satisfactory to themselves and condevelopment of the Northern Territory: forming to the best standards of Australia, our efforts will be of no value. When we put that ideal before ourselves we must recognize that an economic basis is required to sustain a local community. Various contributors to the debate have indicated the possibilities of mining, of the pastoral industry and of agriculture, and have mentioned some of the advantages and disadvantages which are attendant on each of these industries. I remind honourable members, hecause it may have been overlooked in the debate, that at present our Australian territories number four. There is the Northern Territory, which is a part of the mainland of Australia; Norfolk Island, which is one of the most ancient outposts of Australia; Papua and New Guinea, which joins in an administrative union a possession and a trust territory; and finally, Nauru. In Norfolk Island and Nauru there are only small communities, and the territories themselves are isolated. However, they are important enough to be taken into the general pucture of our Australian territories. In this debate, most honourable members have spoken of the Northern Territory and Papua and New Guinea. In speaking of the future, some honourable members have spoken, perhaps optimistically, of t.he creation of a seventh State of the Commonwealth. I believe that that is a realistic hope when it is applied to the Northern Territory. We can perceive quite clearly that if the Northern Territory develops in the way in which we hope it will develop, and if the population increases sufficiently, it will become another State of the Commonwealth. Honourable members usually think of the population of the Northern Territory, both coloured and white, as having common destinies. In the future, the two races will merge with one another, they will have the same future and will enjoy the same conditions. Even at the present time, when we talk of 15,000 or 10,000 people in the Northern Territory, WR must not overlook the fact that there are also 12,000 native people there who tion to thb winning of the territory's wealth. It is not solely the European population that is concerned with the the native population also has great significance. In time the Northern Territory will no doubt develop as a single community and become another State of the Commonwealth. However, when we consider Papua aud New Guinea, I do not think that we can look forward to its future inclusion in the Commonwealth. At present approximately 1,500,000 natives in Papua-New Guinea occupy their own land, and a minority of approximately 10,000 Europeans also live there. The European settlement will increase, and development of that territory will he mainly the result of European enterprise in the years immediately ahead. Nevertheless, we cannot foresee a future in which the territory will be populated by one single community. In Papua and New Guinea there will always be two communities-the indigenous peoples and the immigrant Australian population. The problem in that land is not one of the Europeans absorbing the natives or of the natives absorbing the Europeans; it is the problem of finding a way in. which the native inhabitants and the European immigrants will be able to live side hy side to their mutual advantage in a happy relationship. We cannot consider together the futures of the Northern Territory and Papua and New Guinea because their futures although linked closely with Western Australia, must, of necessity, be quite difierent. With the permission of the Chair, I should like to refer to some remarks made on an earlier division of the Estimates, hy the honourable memher for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) concerning the Legislative Council for the Northern Territory. I do so because other honourable members have referred to the same suhject tu-day. The suggestion behind the remarks of the honourable memher for Mackellar was t h a t t h e L e g is t l a t i ve C o u n c i l for the No r t h e r n T e r r it o r y should not be t u r n e d in to an in s t r u m e n t of d i c t a to r s h i p by a n y government at a n y t i m e .

I m portant public organizations, including trade unions, are directing attention to the necessity for restricting immigration in view of the seriousness of the employment situation. But the Minister for Immigration ( Mr Holt) is now overseas arranging new immigration agreements! According to the Minister acting for the Minister for Immigration ( Mr Beale), the Government intends to bring rural workers to Australia under these agreements. Already it has in its immigrant camps, and registered with the employment service, large numbers of new Australians who are experienced rural workers and many others who are capable of undertaking farm work but cannot be provided with such jobs. I am convinced that it is endeavouring to bolster the immigration programme by misrepresenting the position to unfortunate workers overseas who are led to believe that they can improve their lot by coming to this country.

W ill he make a statement elucidating the position with respect to German migration? able member's questions are as follows:1. . If the honourable menfber is referring to the -resumption, following the cessation of 1939-45 hostilities, of migration from Germany under any Gommonwealth assisted scheme, I would remind him that there has neither been nor is there any such scheme. The admission of German nationals is oonfined to those who are personally nominated and can comply with certain other conditions of the landing ermi.t procedure. Snch migrants, of course, ave no connection with migrant camps. Early in 1951,when the displaced persons' scheme wag .at its .peak, country newspapers reported that several former -displaced persons at a reception centre had in their possession articles such .as those mentioned. revealed that these were merely kept by their owners .as souvenirs, whilst others had been purchased as curios at such .ports as .Aden and Port Said on the voyage to Australia. 2. I am not .aware that government officials have found it necessary on occasions to seize Germany army bayonets, knives and leather whips. It is known, however, that as a result of customs ^examination of -baggage upon (arrival there have been such items in th* ipossession of a iew migrants, who brought them in as souvenirs.

A-ny cases 'would be considered on t'heir merits. 5. I have not .seen the f u l l text of the statement in question, but in press reports of the 1st November, 1950, Sir John Storey was quoted as having said, tlie previous evening, that 'exminers of the Nazi party should jiot necessarily he excluded in the .selection of migrants from Germany.

124,Mr Ward Asked 'The Minister Acting,"6. If so, what stage has been reached in the Italy for assisted migration do not specify deliberations and, in view of the employment situation in Australia, is it intended to proceed to finality? honourable member's questions are as follows:1. The Government has completed migration agreements with the Governments ot four countries-the United Kingdom, Malta, the Netherlands and Italy. 2. United Kingdom -The intake under the free and assisted passage schemes, which are the subject of our agreement with the United Kingdom Government, is comprised almost entirely of ( a ) persons nominated by their friends and relatives resident in Australia; aud (6) persons selected iu accordance with group nominations submitted by State government instrumentalities and semi-governmental and private undertakings. The sniall remaining portion of the intake has been the result of the Commonwealth nomination scheme, which was designed to obtain wcrkers with special skills and provide, at the same time, some opportunity for intending migrants who were unable to arrange personal nomination or to secure selection under State group nominations. Under this scheme the Commonwealth provides hostel accommodation for selected migrants so long as they remain in the type cf employment for which they were selected. Present indications are that during 1953 only very small numbers-mainl y highly skilled tradesmen and their families-wil l be recruited as Commonwealth nominees. number of migrants introduced, therefore, under the United Kingdom Agreement depends almost wholly cn the rate at which personal and State group nominations are lodged in Australia. In each instance the nominator is responsible for arranging employment and accommodation for his nominees, and it can reasonably be expected that the rate of. intake will be subject to variation in conditions of eligibility, which require that the light cf changes in the economic and employment situation in Australia. assisted passage agreement has currently been renewed until the 31st March, 1954. The free passage scheme, by reason of its particular conditions of eligibility which require that application shall be made within two years of the subject's release from the Forces provided that such re'ease was on or before 31st December, 1948, has already virtually ceased to function. Malta -The entire intake under the Australia-Malta assisted passage agreement is on the basis of personal nominations submitted by friends or relatives already in Australia. The principles involved and the conclusions reached are similar to those referred to in connection with the United Kingdom assisted passage agreement. The agreement provides for extension for two-yearly periods. The most recent extension expires on the 30th June, 1953. The Netherlands and Italy -The agreements between the Commonwealth Government and the Governments of the. Netherlands and actual numbers of migrants to be received but provide that selection will be in accordance with Australia's stated requirements, which generally are to be advised from time to time. In the case of Italy, the agreement specifically provides that close estimates of our requirements in respect of each twelve months are to be supplied six mouths in advance. It also provides that detailed group nominations are to be lodged with the Italian Goverument three months before it is desired that the workers specified should leave Italy. Kach agreement provides thut the scheme shall operate for a period of five years, commencing upou a date to be fixed, and that it may be continued thereafter by mutual agreement. The operative date in respect of the Netherlands is the 1st April, 1951, and in respect of Italy, the 1st August, 1951. 3. Yes. 4. Apart from amendments and minor additions to the terms of the agreements witb the United Kingdom aud Malta at the time cf their renewal, uo action has been taken to repeal or amend the terms of any of these agreements. 5 and 0. Yes. As I stated in this House on the 19th August, negotiations are proceeding for a migration agreement with the West German Government. In the event of an agreement being finalized, emphasis will be placed on securing skilled tradesmen, in the metal and engineering groups, who are still in short supply in Australia, and rural workers, together w it h their families. for the Minister for Immigration, upon notice-*\. What number of immigrants, assisted or otherwise, has contracted tuberculosis each year since the inception of mass immigration? 2. How many have been admitted to hospital? 3. How many reports have been received by the Minister concerning this problem and its prevention? 4. Who made the reports and when did he The receive them? 5. What action has been taken in regard to these reports? able member's questions are as follows:The information asked for by the honourable member is not available in the form required, as in general the State authorities, who are responsible for the treatment and control of tuberculosis, have not distinguished j n their records between new Australians and the nativeborn population. The importance of such statistics is recognized, however, and the Commonwealth Department of Health is at present examining a scheme whereby reliable information conferring tuberculosis sufferers amongst the resident immigrant population will be available by liaison throush the Commonwealth Deputy-Director of Tuberculosis in each State and the State authorities. It is intended that in the first instance this information w ill be based on records in each State",60,Immigration

126,The Mr Galvin Asked The Minister Acting,,61,Immigration
127,Mr Beale,"The answers to the honordating from the 1st January, 1952, aud that these statistics will ue kept current by an amendment to the monthly returns at present furnished to Canberra by each State Director of Tuberculosis. Representations in regard to tuberculosis amongst the immigrant population have been received from interested persons and organizations ia Australia, who liave shown n keen appreciation of the difficulties involved. Jiach report or suggestion has been fully examined by oflicers of the Department of Immigration with the omcers of thc Commonwealth Department of Health. Action which can be taken on prevention of the tuberculosis problem amongst impiigrants must, however, necessarily be directed towards effective screening in the immigrant's country of origin to ensure that only those whose health is clear are approved for admission. For this reason, since the inception of post-war immigration, special precautions have been taken tu ensure thut prospective immigrants arc examined in their country of origin for any sign of lung abnormality, before they have been permitted to proceed to Australia under Commonwealth immigration schemes. These precautions, especially in the cose of former displaced persons whose way of life in the immediately preceding years was such that an unusually high incidence of tuberculosis might reasonably have been expected, were followed by'a further clinical examination ' and lung radiography immediately after the immigrant's arrival in Australia. The results of these post-arrival examinations have been a tribute to the effectiveness of Australia's overseas screening methods. The limited number of active or doubtful cases, which have comc to notice in this way, have been almost entirely amongst former displaced persona. As that scheme, which was based largely on humanitarian grounds ns Australia's contribution towards the solution of a world problem, has now terminated, it can be assumed that the possibility of tuberculosis suspects being included in future immigrant intakes will be at an absolute minimum. From the records of postarrival examinations and information of admissions to Commonwealth institutions, the Department of Health made, in 1940, an analysis in respect ol the immigrant intake under the displaced persons scheme from November, 1947, to September, 1950. Of the 139,507 displaced persons who arrived during this period, it was found that 410 had received or were receiving hospital treatment for tuberculosis. Whilst no subsequent surveys of this kind have bi.'en made, it could be expected tliat a similar analysis in respect of later arrivals under the same scheme would have disclosed a lower incidence following improvements in screening technique as a result of earlier experience. immigrants who are free of infection at the time of their examination overseas may subsequently contract tuberculosis after they have become established in the Australian community. However effective the screening methods arc, these cases must be expected and it is their incidence _ rate which will be recorded in the statistics which I have referred to earlier in this reply. for thc Postmaster-General, upon notice1. Have discussions been proceeding between representatives ol certain overseas interests und himself concerning the ownership and control of radio station 2GB and some other radio stations? 2.
