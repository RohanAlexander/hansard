The program was designed to be delivered to all prepubescent school children. In the budget papers, the government stated: Vaccinations are normally delivered to adolescents through GPs and health clinics. The level of coverage of the target group would be expected to be low if these were the only delivery mechanisms used as adolescents do not use these services frequently. This measure provides specific funding for the delivery of HBV in the school setting, which is expected to result in better rates of immunisation. It will involve the Commonwealth working with the states ... and the states being responsible for the delivery programme as well as the provision of additional funding. That is what they told us they were going to do, and then the federal Minister for Health (Dr Wooldridge) bathed in the publicity about his new immunisation program. The Victorian state government has advertised the scheme as being available in all schools. They even had glossy letters and leaflets and a web page to tell us about the scheme and how wonderful the government was. It is a shame they could not find the money to pay for the injections for the kids. What the state government did was to pass the cost on to local councils. The councils had to go to the schools to immunise the kids but they were not given enough money to run the scheme. Staff at the city of Casey, for example, claim that they have been unable to secure sufficient funding to vaccinate kids at their schools. I have been informed that the council was going to.be short-changed $27,000 by the state and federal governments if it implemented the scheme the way the governments wanted it to be done. Casey claims it does not have that amount of money just lying around. So, there are now 2,000 kids whose only option is to attend the Casey Council after school hours health centre to get the three shots they need to be protected against hepatitis B. That delivery mechanism was rejected by the federal government. They even say in their budget papers that it is not good enough. School based immunisation is the only place where you get a high enough level of immunisation. But it is not just the 2,000 kids in Casey who will suffer, it is the whole immunisation program. The government has told us it is committed to getting immunisation rates to 90 per cent. This is another empty promise. When it has come to the crunch, Dr Wooldridge has failed to find the money to deliver on his promises to the kids of Australia. The Municipal Association of Australia and the Australian Local Government Association have informed me that there is growing disquiet amongst many councils about the way governments are funding immunisation programs. Councils are being forced to carry the high cost of federal and state government programs of immunisation. Victoria is the first state to implement the hepatitis B immunisation of school children program. I sincerely hope that the other states are not facing the same sorts of funding problems as Victoria is facing. RE;PRESENTATIVES MAIN COMMITTEE",118,Pairs Seats The New Candidates Are Lalor Julia

The University of the Third Age provides an opportunity for older people to learn new skills and to learn in a motivated environment. The people who were there seemed to have an incredible new lease of life. They were older members of our community and they had an incredible hunger to learn and a desire to be there. It was just wonderful to be enriched by their motivation and their high spirits. Whether it is astrology, the Internet or needlework, the members and those who participate in these courses were passionate about this self-help approach to learning. They have taken to this concept with both hands and are using their retirement as a kick-start to learn new skills, and many of them have rejuvenated former skills. For example, the Internet is now not seen as confusing or too teGhnical for older people but rather it is seen as a very interactive learning tool, and many of them have embraced it wholeheartedly. The first University of the Third Age was founded in Toulouse, France, in 1972, and the first campus in Australia was established in Melbourne in 1984. The University of the Third Age in Redc1iffe was founded by a remarkable woman, Olive McKee, way back in 1987, and it was incorporated in 1988. Some 500 people are enrolled in courses at the University at the moment and members of the Redcliffe U3A come from a number of areas in Brisbane, including the suburbs of Bracken Ridge, Sandgate, Deagon, Brighton, Lawnton, places like Deception Bay, Burpengary and in fact from all over the Redc1iffe Peninsula. Each University of the Third Age determines its own curriculum and its demand in the use of its skill. It uses a great number of unpaid tutors and they come from all walks of life. They provide tutorials, seminars and workshops for the members of the university. In fact it is not uncommon for a teacher in one class to be a student in another. I had the pleasure of meeting people from some outstanding academic backgrounds the other day. One of the qualities of the Redcliffe University of the Third Age is that it does not rest on its laurels. It is particularly grateful for the support given by the Redcliffe Library, local newspapers and the local radio station 99FM and it also contributes and provides valuable assistance to the local cardiac rehabilitation unit. With the slogan of 'Learning for the joy of learning', the members have the right frame of mind and join together to share experiences, skills and learning. I was greatly honoured to be with the executive and the members of the University of the Third Age and I particularly was pleased to join them for their celebrations last Saturday. I wish them great success and I wish them well for all their endeavours in the future.

It is worth noting the questions they raised about the way in which various providers were told in advance that they would be successful, a process demoralising for other companies. As I say, it is a three-page indictment. I want to raise another issue from that period, that is, the government's preoccupation with certain ideological requirements rather than good practice and good government. That is the question of adult migrant English in this country. In New South Wales we had it tendered out in five separate regions. What has occurred is that this 50-year-old organisation-with a record in regard to curriculum development; with a record in the provision of counselling to refugees and humanitarian entrants to this country; and with a reputation for having trained psychologists and teachers to help these people-has disappeared in three of the New South Wales regions. Quite frankly this government talks about choice; it says it is widening choice for people. The fact of life is that in most of Sydney now you have to travel 20 kilometres for an alternative. There is no alternative in Western Sydney to the recently established private provider, which to my knowledge has no trained teachers. Quite frankly the bottom line here is the government's desire to reduce 60 to 65 per cent of funding in this area. Unemployment, particularly in the municipality of my electorate, far exceeds the national average because of the reality that people are recent arrivals and lack English. This organisation that has provided this service over five decades is basically going to collapse. I put on record the effort by the local community from people of all political persuasions two years ago. There were massive public meetings and council resolutions, et cetera against this decision. I want to note the efforts of the Fairfield Migrant Inter-Agency Association. The points they make about the collapse of this organisation include the failure to recognise long-term knowledge and understanding of migrants, a committed and extensive service working with DIMA clients, bilingual assistance, responsiveness to client needs and the ability to provide flexible programs. All these things are going out the door. All these people that depend on the free provision of English in this country for their job success in the future are being told that there is only one alternative now, a newcomer on the block with no previous experience, and that they have to travel 20 kilometres if they want to get an alternative to that option. Shipton, Mr Roger Francis and speak about the late Roger Shipton. would join with me this morning in paying a tribute to Roger, who was a parliamentary colleague of yours for a number of years. Roger was first elected to the federal parliament in 1975 and retired in 1990. During that period, I had met him in the Northern Territory a number of times. He was a frequent visitor to the Northern Territory. He was a great bloke. He also took his work in parliament very seriously.

That gave me the opportunity of meeting Roger. He was a frequent visitor. The last time. I saw him in the Northern Territory was at a function in August last year with his wife, Susie. He looked in very good health. I then had the good fortune of seeing him again in Melbourne in November. I was quite surprised when he was tragically taken in January of this year. Roger was awarded a medal of the Order of Australia in 1991 for his services to politics. As you move around the federal parliament and ask people whether they knew Roger Shipton, everybody will say he really was a good bloke. The honourable member for Fisher( Mr Slipper) interjected at the beginning of my remarks to say what a nice bloke he was. His wife, Susie and his son, James, and his daughter, Kate, will certainly miss him. I would also like to say that the people that he worked with at Philip Morris will certainly miss him as well because they enjoyed the spirit of cooperation that he had with them. I often used to bump into him in the corridors of the parliament here and, from time to time, we had the opportunity of having a cup of coffee. He will be sadly missed. He was a great bloke. I would like to say once more Ioffer my condolences to his wife, Susie, and to his family. Territory for associating me with his remarks about my friend, the late Roger Shipton. Industrial Relations the deplorable climate of industrial relations which is beginning to engulf this nation. There is an undeniable climate of fear, intimidation, confrontation, division and harassment being actively promoted by this government. This government, through its workplace relations legislation, is harbouring bosses who want to mug workers. The workplace relations legislation actively works against the workers and the trade unions workers choose to represent their interests. On MondayI outlined a dispute at the New South Wales grain cooperative pivot facility at Port Kembla in some detail. I do not propose to repeat those remarks, except to say that the rock solid guarantee legislation has failed them. I also raised an allegation that a woman had appeared at the picket line on numerous occasions during the six-week dispute. She was involved in the video and other surveillance of activities there. This mystery woman has boasted about her history as a private detective. She boasted about stalking claimants for workers compensation. She boasted about having been involved in the video surveillance of activities at the Hunter Valley Rio Tinto No. 1 mine picket. She also claimed to have been engaged in a contract with a government department to spy on people who were legitimately protesting their inexcusable sacking by a ruthless picket management. The Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business( Mr Reith), in response to a question from me in question time on Tuesday, demanded of me that I apologise to the Office of the Employment Advocate. I do not express regret for raising this issue with the minister. This is an important matter. It cannot be brushed aside. .

She must explain why she boasted about having been engaged in a contract to undertake video surveillance of picketers by a government department. She must also explain what she intended to do with this video surveillance. She must explain how much taxpayers' money she has been paid, by whom, by which government department and for what purpose. The whole issue has a rather putrid smell about it. I strongly suspect that this is the Illawarra's own Dubai scandal. There are questions I have put on the record and there are questions I expect answers to. In two years, this government has turned a century of industrial relations on its head. The only thing I deeply regret is that 1998 is appearing no different from 1898. It is a scandal and I will pursue this. Superannuation disheartening plight faced by many in our veterans community, particularly the Vietnam veterans. A number of them have gone through what they have described to me as their biggest battle: working with the Department of Veterans' Affairs to secure TPI benefits. Having done that, they then approach their insurance companies and, under the terms of their superannuation policies-the death and disability provisions-they make an application to see whether that disability payment can be made. I remind those members present that, in most insurance companies, the disability provisions relate to an 'incapacity to such an extent as to render the person unlikely to ever engage in or work for reward in any occupation or work for which he is reasonably qualified.' That sits alongside the TPI definition, which is very similar but talks about an incapacity, because of war caused injury or disease, that prevents a person from continuing to undertake remunerative work that he or she was undertaking, thus suffering loss of salary and the like. The definitions are very similar but, in practice, the experience of the veterans is quite different. After going through the process with the Department of Veterans' Affairs to exhaustively examine their eligibility for a TPI entitlement, they then approach their superannuation fund. A superannuation fund or insurer arbitrarily makes a decision, often having only ever inspected or assessed the veteran for one 40-minute interview, that the veteran is capable of working, thus denying the veteran access to that disability element under their superannuation policy. It is extraordinarily disheartening for veterans, having gone through the exhaustive DV A processes, to have an insurance company engage psychiatrists or doctors to assess them, at one interview, and tell them that all the assessments that the Department of Veterans' Affairs have arrived at are wrong, that they are indeed capable of working, and that the DVA conclusion is inaccurate. I would hasten to suggest that this may have more to do with the insurer or superannuation company being a little less prepared to payout on the superannuation policies held by the veterans than with a wo;ry genuine assessment of their physical condition. I call upon the government to work with the ISC, the Insurance and Superannuation Commission, to reconcile the definitions of a person's incapacity to work; so that the veteran knows that, once they have gone through the Department of Veterans' Affairs process, it is almost automatic that the superannuation companies will take account of that exhaustive assessment and indeed share the conclusion that the person is incapable of continuing to work, thus granting them the disability payment under their superannuation insurance policy.",123,Representatives Main Commitiee

Second Reading Debate resumed from 5 March, on motion by Mr Williams: That the bill be now read a second time. ( Mr Melham), I will go ahead of hini. He may well arrive before this debate is concluded. The Legislative Instruments Bill 1996 [No.2] is a very important piece of government legislation. The government has a clear mandate for the changes introduced and included in the bill, as it was part of coalition policy prior to the last election. In our policies on law and justice and a new deal for small business, we said that the government would introduce these provisions. Consequently, this bill has a clear and unequivocal mandate from the Australian people. I The bill seeks to reform the processes for making, publication, scrutiny and, most importantly, sunsetting of Commonwealth legislation. The bill acts in a gatekeeper role by preventing the unchecked proliferation of delegated legislation. We all know, as members of parliament, how frustrating it is for our constituents when they come to us, time and time again, complaining about regulations which are out<!ated and yet which remain in force and effective. This bill has a long history, going all the way back to 1994 to the time of the former Labor government. The former government introduced what was then called the Legislative Instruments Bill 1994 and, owing to the election in 1996, it simply did not pass. It lapsed and consequently this government has introduced this later piece of legislation. I am pleased the honourable member for Banks has arrived, because he was the chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. I can see Ms Middlebrook next to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and she was the secretary of the committee at that time. Our committee was privileged to have referred to it the Legislative Instruments Bill 1994 for consideration. We looked at it very closely, as a committee; we believed that it was important; and I think it is sad and tragic that the Labor Party-and the Democrats-in the other place, represented in this place by the honourable member for Banks, have decided to overturn what was strong support for the principles outlined in this bill. As I said, the chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutioqal Affairs in the last parliament was the honourable member for Banks, and I must say that he was a particularly good chairman at that time. The recommendations that the committee brought forward in its report are largely those included in this legislation, and included amongst those recommendations is one that there should be a sunset provision on all new regulations.

297,Mr Slipper (Fisher) (10.58 A.m.),"In the absence of the honourable member for Banks1212 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 12 March 1998 This is the same bill that was introduced into the House of Representatives on 24 June 1996 and passed by that House on 11 September 1996. This bill was introduced into the Senate on 8 October 1996 and, notwithstanding the strong general support of the Senate for the bill, finally passed on 25 September 1997 with 18 government and 35 other amendments. A large number of the non-government amendments emasculated the stringent consultation principles and processes and removed the sunsetting regime. The House subsequently considered the Senate amendments and returned the bill, accepting the government amendments and rejecting the others, and some additional government amendments were added by the government in the House of Representatives. On5 December last year the Senate reconsidered the bill and insisted on its previous amendments-most regrettably. The government is therefore reintroducing this important bill for consideration by the House of Representatives. I would like to make a couple of comments about the attitude of the Labor Party in relation to this piece of legislation. They really are indicating yet again how completely and totally out of touch they are with the Australian people. We have a clear mandate. The Labor Party ought to recognise that they were reduced to 49 seats in the House of Representatives at the election two years ago. We had 76 Liberal Party members and 18 National Party members elected, a government majority of 94 to 49 which is a strong mandate for this policy announced prior to the election; it was clear we would be introducing a bill into the parliament. a bill before the House. In effect, we are aiming to reduce unnecessary regulation. We believe regulations should be sunsetted, and so the honourable member for Banks ought to backflip again. He should support the recommendations of his own committee, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in the last parliament, and he should back the position taken by the Attorney-General in this bill. in the Labor Party that they ought to support this bill. The honourable member for Banks is often heard to say in the parliament that the Attorney-General is rolled in the cabinet. The Attorney-General is a very effective Attorney-General and I believe that, largely, the cabinet would support his recommendations. In this matter my colleague opposite has been rolled by the troglodytes in the Labor Party. The Labor Party is not actually representing the personal views of the honourable member for Banks who, I believe, would want to see his party support this particular legislation. Mr Melham interjectingspeaking now, but he was late. He is not speaking now, so he should be quiet. government has broad support from the parliament for this bill and backing from the Australian community. Regrettably some people in the Labor Party think it is appropriate that small business should be entangled and enmeshed forever in regulations which are never removed from the statute bookS. I believe that the parliament ought to be a cooperative place. Where legislation that is fair, reasonable and sensible is introduced, it is vital that both sides of the parliament support it.

It seems as though the opposition is determined simply not to recognise our mandate, and in the other place to frustrate sensible and fair reform. Both houses have, in principle, passed the legislation. They have considered it, but they have been unable to agree on the actual clauses to be finally included. This is a classic case of the Senate playing politics. This is a classic case of the Labor Party seeking to frustrate the very effective work of the Attorney-General and the government. There are many other matters where the Labor Party has taken the same approach, and this is eminently regrettable. I do not want to digress from the billfor Banks ought to have supported the government's determination to restore certainty and fairness for pastoralists and the general community, as well as for our indigenous Australians. To go back to the Legislative Instruments Bill-I know you will be pleased, Mr Deputy Speaker, that I am continuing to do that-the hypocrisy, backflips and inconsistency shown by Labor, and in particular by the honourable member for Banks, are absolutely amazing. One would think that the honourable member for Banks is one of the fittest members in the chamber: the backflip that we have seen in relation to this legislation is outstanding and quite regrettable. ' The sunsetting of delegated legislation is a very important part of the government's policy on regulation review. It will ensure that business regulation is reduced to the minimum necessary for effective accountability and control. The member for Banks has no sympathy for small business, he has no empathy with small business and his actions in this place are undermining the capacity of small business to be run without unnecessary red tape and regulation. force. I believe that, had the member been more persuasive, had he been a better advocate in the Labor Party, then the Labor Party would have been supporting this bill. Those opposite, Mr Deputy Speaker, as you personally know, do not care at all about small business. Their actions on this bill and on other bills are proof positive of the fact that they have lost touch not only with the Australian community but also with the Australian small business proprietor, who supplies so much employment to Australians. This bill, in accordance with government policy, will ensure that all new regulations are subject to a five-year sunset clause. This is an important policy that the government cannot and will not back away from. We have a clear mandate. This bill has been considered by the parliament over a period of five years. It has received general bipartisan support. In opposition we supported what the Labor Party was doing with respect to this matter, but now we find that they are seeking to undermine the effect of this bill. The amendments moved in the Senate by the Labor Party and the Democrats amount to legislative terrorism. They have really lost the plot and are playing a very base level of politics. They are completely, utterly and totally pathetic.",126,Representatives Main Committee

308,Mr Slipper,"The member ought to keep quiet; the member ought to support this bill.1214 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 12 March 1998 We make no apologies for reintroducing this legislation to this place. This is a good bill, it is fair legislation and it is legislation which received the strong mandate of the Australian people at the last election. It is not too late for the Labor Party to do yet another backflip and support this bill so that the very worthwhile reforms contained in the Legislative Instruments Bill can become part of the law of this land. I commend the bill to the Main Committee. and the Main Committee for coming late. I had my times mixed up. I should have known better. A couple of things that the honourable member for Fisher( Mr Slipper) said need explanation. True it was that in the last parliament, when I was chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, we did an inquiry into the Legislative Instruments Bill 1994 and we brought down a number of recommendations. But what is also true is that not all of those recommendations have been picked up to the letter. Arising from that committee report, it became obvious to me that there were also different views within the various departments-within the Attorney-General's Department, within Prime Minister and Cabinet and within other bureaucracies-as to what the appropriate legislation should be. There is no doubt that this bill has a chequered and long history, and there has been a lot of consultation. But this bill has been the victim of politics within the bureaucracy, within Prime Minister and Cabinet, Treasury and Finance, because I know that those bureaucracies have a different view from various offices, for instance, within the Attorney-General's Department. That is all a matter of record, and it is a matter of knowledge as to what happens behind the scenes; that is all part of the process. What it means is that there is no idealistic view, there is no one right view. You have got people on all sides acting in good faith as to what they believe is the best way forward. In relation to the Legislative Instruments Bill 1996 [No.2], this second bill that has been returned to the House, it is in substantially the same form as the first bill that was introduced by the government last year. But it is also once again worthy of note that the government has refused to accept a single one of the amendments proposed by the Senate. For us that is extremely disappointing, because the Senate does have a role to play and individual Senators have a role to play-members of the Democrats, the Greens and, indeed, Senator Harradine. There are a number of problems with this bill that the Senate's amendments sought to remedy. In particular, the government's proposals for sun setting seek to fundamentally alter the relationship between the executive and the Senate, to the executive's benefit and for no good reason. That is the view of the Senate. Despite this genuine concern, a concern that has been clearly unacceptable to the Senate, the government has made no attempt at this stage to address either this or any of the other matters in contention. This includes the seemingly innocuous requirement that legislative instruments not be written in sexist language. With even a modicum of goodwill on the part of the government, these issues could, and can still, be resolved to everyone's satisfaction. In this regard, I note that discussions are continuing between the government and the opposition in relation to this bill. For the record, I note the opposition's willingness, as it has had all along, to compromise on this bill, provided our genuine concerns are met.

Yet despite meetings having occurred, and whilst the office of the Attorney General( Mr Williams) has made some positive noises, the opposition and other players in the Senate are still yet to see any substantive offer of compromise from the Attorney's office on any issue. That is what I have been informed, that there have been some positive overtures. I say to the Attorney and his office that the opposition, and I would also take that to mean other senators, are looking to see what is back on the table. I say to the Attorney and the government that the concerns that the opposition, the minor parties in the Senate and Senator Harradine hold are genuine and should not be ignored. The Labor Party will not be walking away from them, nor, as I understand it, will the minor parties and Senator Harradine in the Senate. These issues can be addressed, we believe, in ways that are consistent with the government's policy objectives. What we ask is that the government shows some goodwill in these discussions. If the government wants a train wreck on what is ultimately a non-contentious piece of legislation, then so be it. If the government wants to explain to the Australian people why we are having a $60 million double dissolution on these issues, then I, for one, look forward to the campaign. The nonsense that the member for Fisher was spruiking earlier about this being a mandate for this government as a result of the last electionelection. The government does not have a mandate in relation to this specific issue. There are many parts of this bill that are non-contentious and are agreed with by all sides of the parliament, and with a modicum of goodwill we will get there. The government's lack of commitment to accountable and responsible government will be exposed if they continue down this path. ' If they are genuine about getting the legislation through, then I suggest to the Attorney and his office that they come forward with some proposed amendments and the opposition will look at them. I have not been the negotiator between the government and other players. I am the spokesman in this House for the shadow Attorney-General. One of the reasons that I do not have my fingerprints all over this is that this is not within my portfolio. I have not been involved in the negotiations, and I put that on the record. I am here as the spokesman for Senator Bolkus who has carriage of the matter in the other place. As an indication of our dissatisfaction with the current bill, I can indicate that we will be voting against it on its second reading in the House today. I hope that we will be in a position to support an amended bill in the Senate. I repeat, I have been advised that at the Attorney's office there have been discussions behind the scenes. The opposition are waiting to see if there is room for compromise with goodwill and whether that can be done. The trouble is this is not a bill that will receive high priority in the Senate. It really should not be part of a double dissolution trigger. But the opposition for our part will not be intimidated into capitulating with a threat that we will have a double dissolution on this issue.

I, for one, believe in the separation of powers. I believe in the role of parliament as a check on the executive. I believe in scrutiny of the public service by the parliament and I am sure the Attorney does, as well. We are not the only ones on this side. These are principles that are espoused by us all. This is a complex piece of legislation. I do not believe that the government needs to be as intransigent as it is. The debate in the Senate occurred last time, and I am not going to go through those issues. I am advised that there are genuine concerns by members of the minor parties and Senator Harradine in relation to this, and I do not believe that those concerns can be swept under the carpet. With a modicum of goodwill, and if people go away and exchange notes on this, then I think we will get through. We will not get through if the government is not willing to come to the table in good faith. I am not saying that they have not at the moment. I am not saying that there has not been good faith. I have not had the minute carriage of this matter from day one, so I cannot speak on behalf of others. I have been advised that the opposition is wHling, once they see some proposals coming from the Attorney's office, to talk through this with the government and with the other players so that we can have a piece of legislation that enjoys a broad support of the parliament. The last thing we want is a legislative instruments bill getting through the Senate one way or the other by one vote---one vote for the government's position, or one vote for the combined opposition position. It is just absurd. I will leave it there, but I indicate that we will be dividing on the second reading of this matter. There are no amendments that we will be putting forward because the government has got the numbers in the House of Representatives. I can see that. It reminds me of going to the New South Wales ALP conferences in my early days, as I continue to do now what I did then in being a warrior against the NSW Right. They did not worry about the arguments; they had the numbers; they could pass whatever resolutions they wanted. That did not make it good policy, no were they necessarily good resolutions. The Senate is a different ball game in relation to this. That is where the debate will occur. The government is not the repository of all wisdom. The minor parties and the Independent Senator Brian Harradine, have got a role to play. Their genuine concerns should be met. A lot of this, maybe, is perception. Maybe the government has met their genuine concerns, but not yet explained it well enough for them to show that their genuine concerns have been met. I do not know. That is a debate for a later day. time since this bill, the Legislative Instruments Bill 1996 [No.2], or its predecessor, was first put on the table of this parliament and it is an extremely disappointing situation that we are in at the moment. We have just had a speech from the spokesman for the opposition, the member for Banks( Mr Melham), as to the opposition's position on the bill. He mentioned two points of substance in relation to the bill: the first related to sunsetting and the second to sexist language. He did not indicate in any way what the problems are that the opposition has with the bill, except to say that the sunsetting regime empowers the executive as against the Senate. He did not say what the opposition would like to see in the bill. He did not propose any amendments. He did not really speak to the bill at all, he just called on the government to exercise goodwill. The government has a capacity. to exercise goodwill but in this case this",129,Representatives Main Committee
315,Mr Williams (Tangney,"Attorney-General) (10.20 a.m.)-in reply-It is a very longThursday, 12 March 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1217 bill went up to the Senate and 35 non-government amendments were made, emasculating the bill and eliminating the sunsetting provisions. There was no discussion with the government prior to the debate in the Senate as to what was proposed. There were actually amendments made on the floor of the Senate at the whim of the individual senators. This bill has been around since late 1993, I think, and certainly since early 1994. It has been the subject of intense scrutiny by a committee chaired by the member for Banks-something he seemed to gloss over-and has been strongly supported by both sides of politics. The 1994 bill was introduced by the previous government. We have now got the situation where the opposition is going to vote against the bill, a bill that in broad terms it supports, a bill that in the previous parliament it actually introduced. The situation really exposes the opposition as being simply obstructive. If there is a genuine belief that the sunsetting provisions are of such a drastic nature as to generate opposition to the bill as a whole, one would have thought that there could have been an amendment of some sort suggested, but there has been none. The member for Banks, not at all to his credit-and not at all to the credit of the opposition-said, in effect, the debate will not be had in the House of Representatives, the debate will only be had in the Senate. This is something that has increasingly been occurring. Certainly, in relation to bills in my portfolio it has been occurring virtually every time there is any suggestion of opposition to a bill or when seeking an amendment. The amendment is not moved in the House of Representatives, it is often not even foreshadowed in the House of Representatives, it is only dealt with in the Senate. This represents, in my humble opinion, an abdication of responsibility· on the part of those members of the House of Representatives who are in opposition. They are saying, 'We're not in a position to do anything, we haven't got the numbers, so we're not going to bother, we'll leave it to the senators to do the work.' That means that the job that they were elected to do is not being done. The member for Banks is in a very difficult position. I suspect he probably supports the bill but his caucus or his shadow minister has instructed him to oppose it. It really is quite incredible. He is not even prepared to stay and listen to my response to his contribution. The member for Banks focused to a considerable extent on calling on the government to exercise goodwill. How can the government exercise goodwill when we have not heard the criticisms? The sunsetting provision is the principle one he mentioned. In the Senate the sun setting provisions were entirely removed. It was not a case of discussion about how they could be improved, they were just eliminated. This is something that the committee, chaired by· the member for Banks, recommended should, in due course, be done. In the 1994 bill it was only going to be partly done. In this bill, it has been extended. It was supported on a unanimous basis, by the members of the House of Representatives committee at the time; I notice the secretary of the committee is sitting beside you, Mr Deputy Speaker. It is not only extremely disappointing; I think it is an exposure of crass hypocrisy on the part of the opposition. It is an exposure of an abdication of responsibility on the part of the opposition members to treat the bill in this way. Let me just say something about the bill itself. When I re-introduced it, I indicated that the government wanted to get this fundamental reform of the delegated legislation process enacted. We want to make it law. There is substantial agreement, both in this House and in the other place, that this bill would represent a marked imprQvement on parliament's control of subordinate legislation. That view transcends party politics. The bill and its forerunner by the 1218 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 12 March 1998 previous government had been considered by a number of parliamentary committees and reflect a large number of suggestions for improvement made by those committees. I The inclusion of a definition of legislative instrument has provided greater certainty to the ambit of coverage. The definition has brought within the capacity of parliament scrutiny of a large range of instruments that have not previously been subject to scrutiny. The registration provisions ensure that persons and bodies affected by delegated legislation have the capacity to access that legislation before it applies to them. The tying of enforceability to registration ensures that no more important documents, retained in bottom drawers of public servants without publicity, can be used against unsuspecting citizens. The requirement for mandatory consultation for instruments should· ensure that any future delegated legislation is necessary and is relevant. The sun setting provisions, which would in general terms mean that regulations have a life of only five years, ensure that unnecessary delegated legislation is removed from the need for compliance at the earliest possible time. The consultation process is now proposed to be uniform and not limited simply to laws affecting business. Everybody will know what is required and the public will have a proper chance of making views known to the mUltiplicity of different procedures that breed public confusion and a reluctance for many of the public to comment on proposals. The procedures adopted are those agreed several years ago by COAG and are used for intergovernmental schemes and by many of the states for their own domestic purposes. I understand that there are provisions similar to those proposed here already in operation in four states. I know certainly that the House of Representatives committee in its 1994-95 study looked closely at the New South Wales and Victorian provisions. From memory, there was a dramatic impact on regulations in those states. I think, just from memory, that in Victoria something like 80 per cent of regulations were removed through the scheme. In New South Wales, something like 50,000 pages of regulations ceased to exist as a result of the legislation in those places. The changes suggested by the Senate would create difficulties for inter-governmental schemes and would require reconsideration by COAG of their processes. That issue will arise in the review of the policy and operation of the bill under clause 72 of the bill and is really a matter for the future. The parliament's powers to scrutinise delegated legislation have been considerably enhanced. Instruments are to be lodged with parliament much sooner, within six sitting days of being made, as distinct from the 15 sitting days which is the present requirement. The explanatory statement to be lodged with every instrument will provide a vast amount of additional material that has not previously been available for consideration by the parliament. Instead of reliance on undertakings to amend provisions, which the parliament finds unsatisfactory and which are frequently not properly satisfied, the bill provides for short deferral of disallowed unsatisfactory instruments to enable the rule maker to correct and identify deficiency. ' The drafting concerns raised in the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs' report Clearer Commonwealth law are met by the provisions of the bill. Thursday, 12 March 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1219 This bill has been up and back between the Houses on a number of occasions. Changes have been made ;along the way. The bill we are putting is the bill that the government in the exercise of its executive responsibilities wants to enact. We do not want a double dissolution on the legislative instruments bill, as has been noted by many speakers. While it is important, it is not sexy. Nonetheless, it is important that the parliament recognise that the government has been advised that the bill complies with the requirements of section 57 of the constitution in its first stage, this being the second stage we are in at the moment. The bill has had amendments made in the Senate which are not acceptable to the government and not acceptable to the House. The bill has been laid aside by the House. It is being reintroduced after three. months. If necessary, the constitutional processes for resolving deadlocks will be relied upon. The Legislative Instruments Bill 1996 [No.2] is a significant reform which should be welcomed by the parliament and by the people. I personally have taken a close interest in it for a number of years. I call on the opposition to support the bill when it moves through the parliament once again and not to abdicate responsibility and exercise the hypocrisy that we heard from the member from Banks. I commend the bill to the House. Question unresolved. further questions to be considered in relation to this bill, in accordance with standing order 277, the bill will be returned to the House for further consideration. Second Reading Debate resumed from 26 November, on motion by Mrs Sullivan: That the bill be now read a second time. Amendment Bill 1997 does have the support of the opposition. As with many similar international processes, the process has been tortuous. It is fair to say, and I think it is accepted by both sides of politics, that Australia, its minister and its departments did playa fairly crucial and active role in regards to this chemical weapons convention. The multilateral negotiations having been completed in September 1992, Australia was active enough by 6 May 1994 to deposit its ratification, thus becoming the sixth country internationally to ratify. It is worth noting that Australia has been in the forefront of the group of 30 countries established in June 1985 to discourage and impede the proliferation by harmonising national export controls, chemical weapons and precursor chemicals, and by sharing information and seeking other ways to curb the use. It is fair to say that Australia has played quite a significant role in this matter. We are talking about ratification. The convention has had difficulties because of conflict in the Middle East. Despite Algeria, Morocco and a few countries being heavily involved early, a significant number of Middle East and Arab countries still refuse to sign because of problems with Israel. At this stage, it is worth noting on the parallel issue of the whole Middle East and weapons that this House did recently unanimously carry a resolution which referred to resolution 687 and the need to reduce weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East. I do not think we can give too much credit in the area of efforts by this government in regards to the Middle East peace process and the attempt to bring Israel to the negotiating",130,Representatives Main Committee

317,Mr Laurie Ferguson (Reid) (10.31 A.m.),"The Chemical Weapons (Prohibition)1220 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 12 March 1998 table. That is one area where there have been difficulties. In the United States, the Republican Party did choose at various stages to thwart the process of America moving towards agreement. In Russia, the military industrial complex and nationalist elements have also been fairly active in making sure that there are problems. This bill today obviously represents an understandable outcome from consultation by the government department, and more particularly, the chemical weapons convention office on the practicalities of the legislation and the convention and attempting to make sure it is effective and useful. A survey of 3,000 companies by this section of the Department of Foreign Affairs found that apparently 100 companies or organisations were identified as having had declarable activities. I note the comments by the member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Sercombe) about a survey which he did say was not fantastically tight but which did show a disturbing lack of knowledge by senior management on the import of this legislation. Obviously, there is a need for more work to be done on that front. I want to say that I do not broadly disagree with the need to reduce red tape, et cetera, nor with the government not having too severe regulation. I am not criticising any of the initiatives of this legislation, but I think we have to be, in this particular area, very mindful that we are dealing with corporations that do not always have the greatest ethics in the international community. In the past fortnight, we have seen a British court case where the supposed suicide of a UK defence writer in Chile has now been put down to murder at the behest of a Chilean arms corporation. They attempted to indicate that he had suicided in a Santiago hotel. As I say, in the past fortnight, a British court has indicated that the defence writer was murdered because of revelations he was going to make in regard to a Chilean arms company's adaptation and sale of helicopters to Iraq. Similarly-and I have referred to this matter earlier-there was in the United Kingdom the Matrix Churchill scandal, where the Iraqis penetrated UK corporations, and some of those companies with no Iraqi involvement whatsoever willingly cooperated in aiding the Iraqi chemical weapons and nuclear areas. It is worth noting that in July 1993, in the journal Parliamentary Affairs, Mark Phythian did an analysis of what had happened in Britain, and he said: Parliament proved ineffective for a number of reasons, among them governmental information superiority, the inherent weakness of the Opposition in the defence field and the use of procedures which favour the executive branch. Throughout ministers and their civil servants were economical with the actuality relating to opaque language, half truths and on occasions outright untruths. Further, the Guardian on 18 February 1995, in regard .to this matter, noted: The judge is certain to criticise Whitehall's prevailing culture of secrecy, dissembling and cynicism. He will criticise the way ministers, supported by civil servants, adopt a patronising attitude towards Parliament. He will criticise Customs officers and the Attorney-General, for the way they mishandled the Matrix Churchill prosecution; ministers, for trying to suppress evidence crucial to the defence; Government lawyers, for-interfering in prosecution witness statements; civil servants, for misleading the court; officials, for ignoring key intelligence reports; ministers, for not asking for intelligence reports; and the intelligence agencies, for not ensuring their reports go to the right people. What we had there was, as I say, the way in which British companies collaborated behind the scenes in providing this assistance to the Iraqi regime. There was a failure-because of, I guess, the fear of public questioning-and essentially a cover-up by the bureaucracy and the political system, to make sure that that collaboration was not revealed. Thursday, 12 March 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1221 WhilstI am totally supportive of the measures in this bill, they do seem in their variety to go to very obvious problems with the previous convention requirements. They are, for instance, to make automatic the annual permit procedures over a five-year period; to simplify compliance obligations and thereby to minimise the possibility of inadvertent breaches; to clarify which industrial plants are subject to the declaration inspection; to refine secrecy measures; to allow electronic lodgement to become possible; and to provide tighter definitions of production, processing and consumption. I do not think any of those things are to be questioned; they seem to relate to very proper analysis and experience of what has occurred. But, as I say, I do not think we should have a preoccupation in this field with the reduction of government oversight-with the activity of the organisation, the office, to make sure that we essentially abide. It is worth noting, in regard to self-interest in this field, that in America this debate did become very political. I refer to an article by Zanders, Eckstein and Hart, Chemical and biological weapon developments and arms control, wherein they note: Both the· National Federation of Independent Business and senior military officers and high-ranking members of the Reagan and Bush administrations expressed serious doubts about the ewe. There we have at the helm very active companies that had a commercial interest in this field. I am not at all saying that they have a desire to basically get involved and to avoid the measures. But we have to have on the agenda, in a very real way, a corporate, commercial interest in making sure that government oversight is minimised. In conclusion, the measures in this legislation are supported by the opposition. Australia has had a commendable level of activity with regard to getting to this convention. It is pleasing to see that it has been supported in this country by both sides of politics. We have seen, in recent months, a degree of concern regarding Iraq about this and other mass destruction weapon fields. We have seen, as I noted earlier, the continuing refusal of a number of Middle Eastern states to ratify because of their concerns with Israel. Ensuring that we try, by a variety of measures, to get these countries to the table is a measure about which this government obviously needs to be far more active. Ms GAMBARO (Petrie) (10.41 a.m.)-I am very glad to hear that the member for Reid( Mr Laurie Ferguson) is supportive of most of the amendments in the Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Amendment Bill 1997 engaged in espionage, criminal activities and safety and security issues. It is very important that we do speak about those areas, particularly under the Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Amendment Bill 1997 because the bill does cover issues of national security, safety and protection for the whole of the Australian community. We have to be really thankful that we live in a country that, throughout its brief history, has had relatively little civil strife. This government is fully aware of its commitment to preserving Australia's national security and is prepared to provide the necessary leadership in defence issues. Furthermore, the government acknowledges its place in the world and has been a very strong voice in global moves towards the crackdown on the production of chemical and biological weapons, antilandmines initiatives, and the winding back of nuclear powered weapons as a comprehensive program to enhance our national security.",133,Representatives Main Committee

I agree that we have a considerable way to go in the Middle East and we are ensuring that we will work towards a favourable outcome there. The world now awaits. These issues have been very important and they must not escalate. A diplomatic solution must always be reached. Australia signed the chemical weapons convention on 30 January 1992 and ratified it on 6 May 1994. It was implemented by passing the Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Act 1994. The chemical weapons convention was important as it was the first comprehensively verifiable multilateral treaty that banned an entire class of weapons. The convention also serves as an important deterrent to the spread of chemical weapons in our region. The determination from the convention is that it prohibits all aspects of chemical weapon development including production, acquisition, possession, transfer and use, and provides for the destruction of existing stocks and production facilities. The significance of the chemical weapons convention can be seen by the number of countries that are party to it: 165 countries signed this, and the majority have ratified since the convention was open for signature in 1993. These countries include China, the Republic of Korea and the United States. The legislation under debate today is another piece in the government's strong stance in national security policy. That includes the government's strong stance on issues such as antipersonnellandmines. With issues regarding the environment, safety, health and welfare, our role and decisions have had a marked impact on future generations. I would like to speak about some of the amendments. In real terms, the chemical weapons act provides the establishment of service permits and notifications to collect information from chemical facility operators in Australia. Many commercial products are chemical compounds which are used in the make-up of these weapons. It has been outlined that the chemical production of sulfur mustard involves the process of condensation and chlorination. Although certain chemical companies may not produce legitimate commercial products in a way which may be used in the manufacture of chemical and biological weapons, many of these companies have the capability to do so. Therefore, these plants need to be monitored under the chemical weapons convention. For Australia, activities in the three main areas are the subject of chemical weapons convention monitoring and verification requirements. There are activities which involve chemicals in the chemical weapons convention schedules and which require a permit under the act, activities which produce certain organic chemicals and which require notification under the act, and export and import licensing for chemicals in the chemical weapons convention schedule. The Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Amendment Bill 1997 arises from initial declarations which are found within the chemical weapons act, but there are areas which need refinement and areas which need to minimise administration requirements. Similarly, there are other issues which need to be dealt with to ensure that Australia's commitments under the chemical weapons convention are fulfilled. There are a number of technical aspects included in this bill, and these issues deal with the automation of annual permit renewal processes within the Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Act 1994 and the simplification of compliance requirements. The bill recognises and clarifies a number of issues which have been raised as a result of the regulation which exists in the act. Under item 4 of the bill, allowance is made for the Thursday, 12 March 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1223 replacement of lodging approved forms, by allowing companies to submit electronically. This is for the purpose of submitting information required for the declaration of past years' activities or for periodical special reports. As well, an automatic renewal process is inserted in the legislation,ensuring a one-year permit has validity for up to five years. Further amendments in the bill deal with the inspections carried out by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and deal specifically with compliance and the role of inspectors, as well as privileges and immunity. This is. an issue of national security. It is an issue of international obligation and of ensuring the security of the Australian people. It is also an issl:1e that ensures the stability of the environment and our region. It is an issue which needs the support of industry, and the government has worked diligently with industry to ensure that the amendments, which are being debated here today, have come about only after full consultation and discussion. I think all members would agree that, when it comes to technical guidelines concerning the prohibition of chemical weapons, the government has certain obligations which have been met by these amendments that we speak of here today. Australia is well recognised throughout the world as a leader in national security measures, and incorporating this bill will continue Australia's pace on the world scene. Amendment Bill 1997 is to implement amendments to the Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Act 1994, to improve the administration of this act and to thus allow Australia to better fulfil its obligations under the chemical weapons convention. In fact, this act is Australia's legislative response upon becoming a signatory to the chemical weapons convention in January 1993 and ratifying it on 6 May 1994. The chemical weapons convention expresses a high level of concern shared by many nations to completely ban an entire class of weapons. It puts into practice an intention, by way of a verifiable multilateral treaty, to prevent all aspects of chemical weapon development. Its provisions cover production, acquisition, possession, transfer and use, and the destruction of existing stocks and production facilities. Australia signed the convention as part of our abhorrence of this horrendous form of warfare and, in so doing, clearly established our commitment to the Australian people and to the people of the world by the creation of a national authority, known as the Chemical Weapons Convention Office. Unlike other nations, Australia does not have chemical weapons facilities or any stocks of chemical weapons, but it is the role of the Chemical Weapons Convention Office to closely monitor our commercial chemical industry, because history has shown that sections of this industry in other countries have been significantly involved in the production of chemical warfare. During World War I, the horrendous effect upon human beings caused by chemical weapons like mustard gas sickened and repulsed the people of the world. These new horror weapons have been manufactured from chlorine, phosgene and mustard gas agents which were supplied by factories engaged in the business of commercial dyes for industrial purposes. It is the concern of the convention to monitor closely the activities of chemical industries in all nations of the world, because the chemical processes that are used to create legitimate chemicals for lawful commercial purposes are also the same processes that can produce chemical weapons of mass destruction.

320,Mrs Vale (Hughes) (10.48 A.m.),"The purpose of the Chemical Weapons (Prohibition)1224 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 12 March 1998 Mr V ALE-The monitoring process of the chemical industry in Australia is a two-part process. One part is the declaration by chemical companies of activities involving specific chemicals and the quantities involved, and the second part is an inspection procedure to verify that a company's activities are consistent with its declarations and that its facilities are not used for any purposes prohibited under the convention, such as the production of chemicals which could be used. as weapons. This amendment will streamline the operation of the Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Act by reducing the administrative burden on those companies and organisations directly affected by the legislation. Administrative improvements made by this act include five-year permits instead of annual permit renewals; approved information forms which may now be electronically submitted for greater efficiency; and the requirement that only certain classes of notifiers have to provide reports. Australia believes that the chemical weapon convention is a valuable component in the building of regional security and that it provides the basis for ensuring that these inhumane weapons do not spread to our region. Of the 167 signatories to the convention, 106 states have now ratified the convention. However, it is only the United States, Russia, Iraq and India that have admitted that they possess chemical and biological weapons, although Iraq has continued to claim that its chemical agents and munitions were destroyed in the 1991 Gulf War. While it may be encouraging to note that the majority of the world's industrial chemical producers are now covered by the convention, ratification in our own part of the world is patchy to say the least. Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, Burma and Thailand are yet to ratify, despite Australia's active encouragement to do so. It is of further concern that the protocol of the conventions is that the declarations lodged by signatory nations be treated as confidential. I believe that only when such information is open for the full scrutiny of the people of all nations will the world be able to feel a safer place. We should all be able to ascertain which nations are continuing this lethal activity, because it is the civilian populations who are the most vulnerable to this type of warfare. Publication of such information would also serve to expose those nations to the censure of the rest of the world for their activities. When we recall that such lethal weapons are comparatively cheap to produce compared to the more traditional form of munitions warfare, we understand why chemical and biological weapons are greatly attractive to developing nations of the Third World. While we are discussing the prevention of chemical weapons, it is well to note that biological warfare is also a fearful concern. The biological weapons convention entered into force in 1975. Its signatories undertook never to develop, produce, stockpile or otherwise keep biological weapons. On March2 of this year, the Minister for Foreign Affairs( Mr Downer) announced an initiative aimed at fast-tracking the negotiations for a verification system for the biological weapons convention. He called for urgent political commitment to establish a national advisory group to create an appropriate verification regime and an effective protocol to contain the spread of such weapons of mass destruction through effective and verifiable means. The existence of weapons of chemical and biological warfare presents a real and present danger to all the people of the planet. In recent weeks, the eyes of the world were focused on the nation of Iraq and its suspected activities in the production and stockpiling of agents of chemical and biological warfare. As Thursday, 12 March 1998 MAIN COMMI1TEE 1225 Iraq had refused entry to the inspectors of the United Nations to inspect presidential sites which were thought to contain chemical weapons, the United States, determined to force compliance by Iraq, prepared a military attack on that country. This attack was averted only by the diplomacy of the United Nations Secretary-General, Mr Kofi Annan. However, full compliance with the diplomatic commitment gained from Iraq by Mr Annan has yet to be put into practice. The world still holds its breath. The President of Iraq, Saddam Hussein, has a certain reputation for duplicity and deception, especially where the West is concerned. His record in the use of such warfare is appalling. In the 1991 Gulf War, Saddam Hussein deployed large quantities of anthrax and other biological weapons in Kuwait and southern Iraq for use against allied soldiers. Despite the convention, there are many countries which have chemical and biological weapon programs. China is reported to be in a position in the near future to have the expertise and delivery capability to integrate chemical weapons into its traditional arsenal. Reports from the Pentagon indicate that North Korea also has an extensive chemical warfare program, as do the Middle Eastern countries of Iran, Syria and Libya. Israel is widely suspected of having a very real capacity to produce chemical and biological weapons at any time. The destruction in human terms by weapons such as these is awesome. The Minister for Foreign Affairs said that Iraq has enough VX nerve gas to kill every living soul on the planet, while a mere ounce of anthrax spores passed through the air conditioning system of a sports stadium could kill upwards of 70,000 people. A special report from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, derived from a special commission report from the United Nations, has revealed that a number of weapons and raw materials in Iraq are still unaccounted for. These include 4,000 tonnes of raw materials for chemical weapons, 31,000 chemical weapon munitions, 600 tonnes of raw material for the deadly VX nerve gas and 17 tonnes of growth mediums for biological weaponry. On 21 February this year, the Age newspaper noted that biological and chemical weapon build-up in Iraq presented the prospect of doomsday to the world. Iraq has acknowledged producing 2,265 gallons of anthrax which is thought to be capable of killing billions of people. Its spores first cause flu-like symptoms and fatigue, followed by severe chest congestion. It can lie dormant for several days and in its second phase it assaults the kidneys, liver and lungs. It is fatal in 80 per cent of cases. It is thought that 3,117 US gallons of botulinum toxin is held in storage in Iraq. This could wipe out the world's population several times over. This toxin is found in contaminated food and it produces a highly toxic substance which causes blurred vision, a dry mouth, difficulty in swallowing and speaking, and weakness. Paralysis, respiratory failure and death follow in 30 per cent of cases of people affected by this toxin. The bacterium clostridium perfringens was produced by Iraq in hundreds of litres at the Al Hakum centre and was destroyed by the United States during inspections in 1996. The United Nations says that this bacterium, a common source of food poisoning, forms spores that can live in soil and can cause gas gangrene in open wounds. Gas gangrene produces pain and swelling as the infected area swells with gas; and shock, jaundice and death soon follow. VX is a highly toxic nerve gas produced in Iraq and used with mustard gas in 1988 against the Kurds in Halabja, in Iraqi Kurdistan, in a nightmare of attempted genocide by Saddam Hussein against this ancient nomadic people. Since the 1980s, Iraq is believed to have stockpiled quantities of agent 15, which is a,mental incapacitant. Its effects upon human beings 1226 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 12 March 1998 are weakness, dizziness, disorientation and loss of coordination, before death. If that is not enough, the United Nations reports that Iraq used its Daura foot-and-mouth disease facility south of Baghdad to study the deadly virus camelpox, haemogenic conjunctivitis-which causes bleeding of the eyes-and human rotavirus, which is the most common form of severe diarrhoea amongst young children. The recent military preparations by the United States and Australia against an intransigent Iraq make it clear to the world that this kind of chemical and biological activity will not be tolerated by the West-and neither should it be. Despite the diplomatic agreement patiently forged by the United Nations Secretary-General, the world waits and watches Iraq for its compliance with that agreement. Saddam Hussein should now be well aware that any further provocation at this point will be met with ali immediate military response. This is an alarming situation for the whole world, but it is one from which we cannot resile if we want our world to be a safer place for all of us. No nation should be able to refuse inspection protocols with impunity. Any nation that dares to do so threatens the security of all of us and should be aware that it courts immediate hostility from all nations. _ How greatly it would enhance world safety if the mandatory declarations of the chemical weapons convention were not kept confidential but could be open for all the world to see, because only that would make it a greatly safer place! But, by this amendment, Australia is sending out strong messages of peace and cooperation to the rest of the world. We stand with open palms on the issue of these weapons, which not only have the capacity to cause horrific suffering to thousands of human beings but also could literally cause the destruction of life on earth as we know it. I commend the legislation to the House. committee, I certainly will not be taking my full 20 minutes in the debate on the Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Amendment Bill 1997. I would like to commend the honourable member for Hughes( Mrs Vale) on her speech. I think she outlined in a very chilling way the dangers posed by chemical weapons throughout the world and, also, the importance of the mission to ensure that Iraq does not continue to have and produce weapons of mass destruction. The purpose of the bill before the committee is to amend the Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Act 1994 and to rectify certain problems identified during its initial implementation. It is one of those happy bills which enjoy the support of both sides of the parliament. It is only rarely that I commend the former government, but I was particularly pleased that the former government was one of the first to ratify this convention. I think we were the sixth country to ratify, and almost the whole world has now signed this convention. If this convention can be properly implemented throughout the world, clearly our globe will be a much safer place-not only for us but also for future generations. For Australia, which does not have chemical weapon facilities or stocks to destroy, the main focus of the CWC verification is related to the production and use of chemicals listed in the convention. Historically, parts of the chemical industry have played a major role in chemical warfare production programs. I am told that industrial dye production factories supplied chlorine, phosgene and mustard gas agents used during World War 1. More recently, Iraq's chemical warfare production used equipment originally intended for a blander purpose-that is, the production of commercial pesticides. That is why it is important for all countries to be",137,Representatives Main Committee
321,Mr Slipper (Fisher) (11.18 P.m.),"Because of other events that have delayed theThursday, 12 March 1998 MAIN COMMIITEE 1227 vigilant to ensure that chemical companies do not in fact use a product that is intended for commercial purposes for the purposes of producing chemical weapons. The honourable member for Hughes outlined the horrendous possibilities with respect to what could happen if the Iraqi chemical weapons program is allowed to continue unabated. At this stage, I would like to congratulate the Minister for Foreign Affairs( Mr Downer) and also the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Beazley) for supporting the position of the government in backing the very strong action by the United States in implementing the United Nations resolution passed by the Security Council some time ago. There have been compliments extended to the United Nations Secretary-General, Kofi Annan. But he himself has said that it would not have been possible to cut the deal with President Saddam Hussein of Iraq, had it not been for the deterrent force that was being built up by President Clinton and the allied countries. It is very important that Iraq be reined in. It is vital that weapons and chemicals which remain unaccounted for are in fact located. As a nation, it is essential that we play our part. Therefore, this legislation seeks to amend our own acts to better enable Australia to implement its obligations under the convention. As I said, this is a bill which enjoys very broad support not only in the parliament but in the widespread community. I am pleased that it is being backed by the opposition. Many of the things I was going to say have been said by earlier speakers, so I will not detain the committee by repeating them. I do, however, believe that we hold this world in trust for future generations: we really only rent our time in this planet. The environment of the world is absolutely important and the eradication of weapons of mass destruction and, particularly, chemical and biological weapons should be a prime aim of any civilised country. I am very pleased that both sides of parliament and, indeed, the general community have made a very firm statement that Australia is one of those civilised countries. I support this bill very strongly. I would also like to commend the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs( Mrs Sullivan), who is in the chamber, on her second reading speech. It set out very clearly why this bill ought to be implemented and why it ought to be passed as soon as possible. Dr SOUTHCOTT (Boothby) (11.23 a.m.)-It is a great pleasure to be able to speak on the Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Amendment Bill 1997, which will help implement some of the provisions of the chemicals weapons convention. The chemical weapons convention, which was signed by Australia in 1993 and ratified in 1994, should help to counter the current proliferation in chemical weapons that we see around the world today. It should also help to reduce the number of states that have a chemical warfare capacity. The declarations will be confidential under the convention unless a state releases its declaration. Having the convention should make it much more difficult for states to conceal illegal programs or to maintain their stockpiles. Under the provisions of the chemical weapons convention, any accused state must allow a thorough investigation. If it denies inspectors access, it will have to face sanctions. An article in the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, September-October 1997, produced a chemical weapons atlas. It pointed out that there are only four states in the world that have actually admitted that they have chemical weapons-that is, the United States, Russia, Iraq, and now, recently, India; the United States has started to destroy its stockpile-but it then went on to 1228 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 12 March 1998 point out that there are a number of countries that have had a chemical weapons capacity in the past and some that have actually used chemical weapons. For example, Egypt, according to an intelligence estimate, actually employed phosgene and mustard agent against Yemeni royalist agents in the mid-1960s. There are reports that Israel, Syria and Iran maintain a chemical warfare testing capacity. Of course Iran used chemical weapons during the Iran-Iraq war, and Iraq was using them as well. Most famously, Iraq is the gold medallist in developing chemical weapons and in evading inspections, and then there are Libya and Saudi Arabia. In Asia, the article mentioned North Korea, which has been mentioned a number of times for developing chemical weapons, and also India, Pakistan, China, Taiwan, Burma and perhaps Vietnam. In Europe, it mentioned Yugoslavia, Romania, former Czechoslovakia and France, and it also noted that Britain produced large quantities of chemical weapons during World War II but that they were all disposed of, incinerated, in the 1950s. Australia has played a leading role in international disarmament relating to weapons of mass destruction, chemical weapons, and in eliminating anti-personnellandmines. Australia salvaged the comprehensive test ban treaty two years ago and, in September 1996, had it voted for overwhelmingly at the United Nations General Assembly .. Of course Richard Butler, an Australian, is the head of UNSCOM. Australia was the sixth nation to ratify the chemical weapons convention in 1994. One of Australia's great strengths in foreign policy is the lead that it takes in forming likeminded coalitions based on issues in a multilateral fashion. Examples of that are the Cairns Group of agricultural free trading nations and the role Australia played in completing the comprehensive test ban treaty. They show how effective Australia, as a medium-sized power, can be in building a coalition based on issues. The spread and manufacture of weapons of mass destruction must be limited and the chemical weapons convention, which Australia signed in January 1993, provides a rules based system to limit chemical weapons. Industrial chemists have been closely associated with the production of chemical weapons. For example, in World War I, factories dedicated to producing industrial dye were able to supply chlorine, phosgene and mustard gas. Some of the precursors for Iraq's chemical weapons have come from pesticides. Many chemical plants have the capacity to produce chemical weapons-and, as I will demonstrate, Iraq has used this capacity of dual use to try to evade international inspections and to try to hide how widespread their chemical weapons program is. The Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Act 1994 should affect about 100 Australian companies in the chemical and textile industries as well as bodies like DSTO. It is extremely unlikely that Australia would ever be challenged under the chemical weapons convention, and it is extremely unlikely that we would ever have inspectors come to investigate a breach of the convention. The bill is designed to simplify the administration of the act, and it makes the permit simpler. Chemical weapons still remain a threat today. Thousands of Kurds and Iranians were killed by the chemical weapons that Saddam Hussein unleashed in the 1980s. Iraq has declared that it has destroyed its stockpiles, but it has admitted that it had supplies of anthrax, botulinum toxin, aflatoxin, ricin, gas gangrene-they are all biological weapons-and chemical weapons such as VX, sarin-the one used in the Tokyo subway in 1995-and mustard gas. Thursday, 12 March 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1229 According to the Washington Post, it is believed that Iraq has warheads and aerial bombs filled with biological agents, aerosol spray tanks for aircraft, and warheads filled with chemicals. Presently unaccounted for are 15,000 to 25,000 rockets, 2,000 aerial bombs and 15,000 artillery shells which would all have the potential to deliver biological or chemical agents. It is worth reflecting that, had Israel not acted promptly in June 1981 by launching an air strike on the Osirak reactor, it is likely that Iraq would now have a nuclear weapons program as well. gas. There is no evidence of that. There are 4,000 tonnes of chemical weapons precursor which cannot be found; and 31,000 chemical weapons delivery systems, 600 tonnes of raw material for VX and 17 tonnes of growth media-which can be used for the production of biological agents like anthrax, botulinum toxin and so on-which are all unaccounted for. .Iraq used the mustard agent tabun and sarin repeatedly during the Iran-Iraq war, and in 1988 used mustard and nerve gas on the Kurdish town of Halabja. Chemical weapons are not localised to the places where they are produced. As the Tokyo subway attack with sarin showed in 1995, chemical weapons can be released anywhere. To date, UNSCOM has destroyed 480,000 litres of chemical weapons agents-83 per cent was mustard gas, 17 per cent nerve agent-1.8 million litres of precursor chemicals, 48 operational missiles and 30 missile warheads. The sheer numbers of those are horrific. As the member for Hughes( Mrs Vale) said, there is enough VX, enough anthrax, enough botulinum toxin to wipe out the global population. But still there is a lot more that is unaccounted for. In April 1996, the Office of the United States Secretary of Defense, in its report Proliferation: threat and response, showed how Iraq had evaded the inspections of the international bodies that try to patrol the use of weapons of mass destruction. The report stated that Iraq misled foreign suppliers and governments regarding the .end users of purchases, that it gained controlling interests in Western companies to place orders and that it used front companies to facilitate covert acquisition activities to funnel dual-use technologies. It sent Iraqi students to Western universities: the woman who is in charge of the biological weapons program and who has been profiled in some of the press was educated at a British university. The report describes the nuclear program of Iraq as a textbook case of how many avenues a country can use to develop a nuclear program and also to evade organisations like the IAEA. It is reported also that the Iraqi nuclear program was largely disrupted by, firstly, the 1981 strike by Israel and, secondly, Desert Storm. This was the subject of a motion that was considered by the House and it was good to see the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Beazley) so promptly support the possible use of force against Iraq. It is worth remembering that in the 1980s, when Labor did have some problems with some of the issues that it faced-for example, the United States joint defence facilities and also the mining of uranium-Bill Hayden and others were able to get the Left of Labor on side by saying that the United States joint defence facilities actually promoted peace. I would have thought that there was a good case for the Left of Labor, rather than being opposed to military action against Iraq, actually to support it. It is worth reflecting that in the whole 53 years that the United Nations, which has passed 1,000 resolutions, has existed, only twice has the United Nations Security Council authorised force. The first time was in the Korean War, when the Soviet Union was absent for a while, 1230 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 12 March 1998 and the second was during the Gulf War over 40 years later, when the Soviet Union actually supported the use of force, I think, under article 7 of the charter. For the whole period in between there was an impasse whereby use of the veto by one or other superpower meant that the United Nations was never able to act as a body. So it is all right for elements of the ALP to say that we need more diplomacy. There is a real question as to whether Hussein would ever have come to the negotiating table without the demonstration of force that was made by the United States, along with countries like Australia. He has shown repeatedly that he is prepared to develop chemical, biological and nuclear weapons capabilities and he will do anything to evade international inspection. The chemical weapons convention is a step forward in terms of eliminating proliferation and reducing the number of countries which have chemical weapons capabilities. I commend the bill. (11.35 a.m.)-in reply-I will open by thanking all the participants in this debate on the Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Amendment Bill 1997. The list of acts which relate to the foreign affairs portfolio is quite a short one, when you compare it with the list for virtually every other portfolio. Therefore members do not get much opportunity to debate foreign affairs legislation. All who have-a significant list of members on this occasion-made a very worthwhile contribution. I thank them for their contributions. Naturally, the member for Kingsford-Smith( Mr Brereton), as the shadow foreign minister, responded. But I also acknowledge the contributions of the members for Dickson( Mr Tony Smith), Maribyrnong ( Mr Sercombe), Groom( Mr Taylor), Reid( Mr Laurie Ferguson), Petrie (Ms Gambaro), Hughes( Mrs Vale), Fisher( Mr Slipper) and Boothby (Dr Southcott). I thank them all for their thoughtful contributions. When this bill was introduced last year, the world from our point of view was a relatively tranquil place. Since then, of course, we have had the matter of heightened tensions in the Gulf and that has given a very particular point to this legislation. The bill was not one that attracted much public attention at the time; it probably will not attract much public attention now. But the issues that it covers are ones that have attracted very intense public attention in recent times for the reason that I have just referred to. The prospect of chemical or biological warfare as a reality in our world has been one that has presented itself to us very forcefully via the mass media. Many Australians would also have looked askance at the news reports, emanating from the United States, of a suggestion that some citizens there had the ability to wreak havoc with anthrax on the population of the United States of America. As it turns out, that apparently was not to be. Nevertheless, I am sure we were all paying very close attention to that, and Australians would have been appalled at the thought that this could happen in a civilised society and out of a war situation. It is therefore all the more reassuring to know that we do have in place in this country very good legislation which protects the interests of citizens, as well as protecting Australia's international reputation in terms of adherence to its international obligations and treaty commitments. This bill is to amend our earlier legislative response to our treaty obligation and to, in effect, tidy up that legislation. Its now having been in effect for a little while-the act being of 1994-we have had the opportunity, after consultation with industry, to identify those areas that needed some tidying up or tightening.",140,Representatives Main Committee
322,Mrs Sullivan (Moncrieff,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs)Thursday, 12 March 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1231 The debate has been essentially supportive. There was some minor criticism which I shall refer to. The member for Kingsford-Smith criticised the Howard government's actions in relation to the Canberra Commission. That is a criticism that the government entirely rejects. I thank the member for Groom for the reference he made to that criticism in his speech, and for his personal initiative in going to the comprehensive test ban treaty office in Vienna to see what is happening there and how it impacts on our commitment in this area. I thank the member for Groom for that input and I recommend to the member for Kingsford-Smith that he might pursue that course of action. There was another criticism, made by the member for Maribyrnong, in relation to industry consultation. My recollection, in summary, of what he said was that a member of his staff had contacted a number of firms on his behalf and that the response was vague in terms of knowledge of the bill's requirements. I want to assure the parliament that industry consultation is an important part of the government's administration of this act. Negotiation of the convention, the initial implementation of the act, and the changes in this bill, have all been the subject of very comprehensive consultation with industry. I refer the member for Maribyrnong to my second reading speech-I am sure he has read it-in which I particularly thanked the Australian chemical industry for their input and, in that context, I made a very particular acknowledgment of the contribution made by the.Plastics and Chemicals Industry Association. In fact, the government was in close consultation and invited input from all firms in the industry, all had the opportunity to make an input and the industry's own association made a significant input. Only in the last three years, the Chemical Weapons Convention Office has made approximately 5,000 contacts with chemical companies and industry associations. Two thousand CWCO industry guides have been circulated and articles have been placed in industry journals. As the member for Groom noted in his speech on this subject, there is ample information available from the department's Internet web site. The member for Maribyrnong said that his office had contacted some major chemical companies on a random basis in a short time. He observed that those contacted did not display a high degree of knowledge of the act. I can assure the parliament that the CWCO has appropriate contacts with the companies mentioned. These contacts are with specific company officials and are structured so as to minimise disruption to the company's operations and administration. Since his speech, the department has identified the companies that he contacted, and I have a quite detailed brief from the department on all of those companies. The member for Maribyrnong indicated that calls had been made to certain companies, namely: Orica, Wesfarmers, Du Pont, and Albright and Wilson. Each of these companies is quite a large organisation. Orica-formerly ICI-and Wesfarmers are both made up of multiple business units. In its initial industry surveys in 1995-96, CWCO approached all of these companies, both at head office level and at business unit level. Contact has been ongoing with those elements of the companies directly affected by the CWC, with most recent contacts being within the last two months at the level of, for example, plant manager. So the contact is recent. I have other information that I am not going to place on the record because it could impinge on the issue of commercial confidentiality in relation to the companies' structures. But I assure the House that, from the description given to me of the actual units of each one of those firms involved, the relevant people are being constantly kept up to date. The message from all of that is that the member for Maribyrnong, or a staff member; in making those random contacts 1232 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 12 March 1998 per telephone, would have some difficulty in identifying just whom he should be speaking to in those very large firms. It is not surprising that he would get what he thought were some fairly vague sorts of responses, because he could not very easily identify the person he should speak to, the person who needs to know about the act. HoweverI shall make a particular reference in the case of Albright and Wilson, one of the companies he referred to. Albright and Wilson has major sites in Sydney and Melbourne, one of which is affected by the CWC and which was visited by the CWCO in early 1997. Dr Richard Thwaites of Albright and Wilson has been involved in advising on the CWC's impact on industry for some years and has provided detailed comments on the proposals which led to the drafting of the current bill. I say that to illustrate that in one of the companies that the member referred to, the key person there, in fact, has been extremely active in the drafting of the bill and would be one of Australia's authorities on it. I doubt that the member for Maribyrnong's researcher would have known that Dr Richard Thwaites was the person he needed to talk to in that particular company. From CWCO's observations, Australian CWC industry declarations are amongst the best and most complete of any chemical weapons conventions declarations, a result which must rely on good communication with industry. The fact that Australia has been amongst the first countries to receive OPCW inspections in industry facilities is also regarded as indicative of the appreciation by that organisation that Australia is one of the best prepared in this area and represents a useful training ground in these early stages of the convention's implementation. Turning to the international aspects of the bill, the definition of a facility agreement will be clarified, bringing it into line with that used in the Chemical Weapons Convention. Certain provisions dealing with the conduct of on-site inspections by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons will be recast to ensure full legislative backing for treaty mandated inspections and to make clear the roles of Australian international inspectors. Australia views the Chemical Weapons Convention as important to the success of international disarmament and non-proliferation efforts. Its verificlltion machinery, which this bill addresses, is vital to its effectiveness. Australia played a pivotal role in bringing the Chemical Weapons Convention to fruition. As the government announced on 2 March 1998, Australian diplomatic efforts will now be turned towards strengthening the Biological Weapons Convention through fast tracking negotiations on a verification system. We need to take this step because, as Iraq's development of a large-scale biological weapons program shows, a legal norm in itself is insufficient to ensure compliance. Comprehensive support from members in their comments for the Howard government's Biological Weapons Convention initiative is appreciated and bodes well for a strong Australian input into achieving the desired international outcome. Initial experience with the Chemical Weapons Convention has demonstrated the strength that verification machinery addresses to an arms control treaty. By improving its own national measures, Australia can encourage others to adopt best practice in implementing the Chemical Weapons Convention. In conclusion, I wish to convey the apologies of the Minister for Foreign Affairs for his inability to take passage of this bill personally. That is one of the hazards of being a foreign minister, with an international role, of course. As a final postscript, I should like to give my personal thanks to those officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade who have worked hard on this legislation-and who have worked hard on advising me on what I needed Thursday, 12 March 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1233 to know about it. I also thank all members for their very useful contributions to this very important debate. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Hon. J.A. Crosio)-If no member wishes to consider the bill in detail, I will put the report question forthwith. The question is that the bill be reported to the House without amendment. Question resolved in the affirmative. Cognate bills: Second Reading Debate resumed from 5 March, on motion by Mr Miles: That the bill be now read a second time. Commonwealth Places (Mirror Taxes) Bill 1998 and the cognate bills. The mirror taxes legislation package is not about taxes on mirrors, as some may imagine, but in fact it seeks to deal with the issues raised in the 1996 High Court decision in Allders International Pty Ltd v. Commissioner of State Revenue (Victoria). This case held that a state's stamp duty on a lease covering part of a Commonwealth placethat is to say, Commonwealth land or Commonwealth building-was constitutionally invalid. The reasoning employed in that case means that it follows logically that other state taxes concerning Commonwealth places may also be invalid. Apparently, the Commonwealth has been advised that as well as the various types of stamp duty which are levied by the states, some of the other taxes raised at the state level such as payroll tax, financial institutions duty and debits taxes may also be constitutionally invalid. Clearly, this situation poses a threat to the revenue base of the states and, unsurprisingly, these other governments have accordingly requested the Commonwealth to enact this legislation. The threat to the states involves both future revenue streams and the more significant issue of the compulsory refunding of all taxes previously collected concerning Commonwealth' places. Accordingly, under this package of legislation the Commonwealth will impose mirror taxes, that is to say, identical taxes, on Commonwealth places, to those that would prevail if the Commonwealth places were not owned by ,the Commonwealth. The revenue from these mirror taxes, payroll tax, stamp duties, financial institutions duties and debits taxes will be passed on to the relevant states. Even though the Commonwealth will be raising the revenue, there is a commitment that all of the revenue raised will be for the financial benefit of the states. That is, in our view, a fair and workable solution to the constitutional issues raised in the Allsop decision and will not be opposed by Labor.",144,Representatives Main Committee
323,Mr Kelvin Thomson (Wills) (11.48 A.m.),"I rise today to speak on the1234 MAIN COMMIITEE Thursday, 12 March 1998 The second important point to recognise about the mirror taxes regime is the extent of the regime. At the moment the legislation, which is specifically schedule 1 of the Commonwealth Places (Mirror Taxes) Bill 1998, applies to only those state taxes which are individually listed. Provision is also made to extend the scope of the mirror taxes regime by regulation should the need arise. This is achieved by the definition of 'state taxing law' in clause 3 of the Commonwealth Places (Mirror Taxes) Bill 1998 including any tax which is prescribed in regulations to the bill. At present, there are no such regulations. However, Labor is happy to support this situation as it will mean that, if any state does introduce such a tax in the future, then its addition to this package of legislation will be able to be achieved quickly and efficiently without the need for the passage of further specific legislation. Of course, this regulation will be disallowable by either House, as it should be, and therefore does not represent an unreasonable delegation of what is really a technical revenue issue. The third major issue covered by these bills is the question of windfall refunds. Where the courts hold that taxes are constitutionally imposed, all of the collections of the taxes must be refunded to the relevant taxpayers. This means that all of the stamp duty considered in all such cases ever collected from taxpayers relating to Commonwealth places must be refunded to the registered taxpayers. The problems with refunds of this type are twofold. First, the cost to the various state governments of making tax refunds will necessarily impact on the level of resources available to the states for services such as health, education, law and order, community services and other essential services. We do not know what the potential scope of the refunds would be if this legislation is not passed. But I assume that the figure could well be of the order of tens of millions of dollars across all of the states. Secondly, the refunds will flow to the legal taxpayer. Normally, businesses which pay taxes pass the economic effects of the tax onto their customers through their pricing structure. Accordingly, if those taxes were then refunded to the taxpayer, that would represent a windfall to those businesses because they have already passed on the tax to consumers. This legislation is fair, both for users of state services and to avoid an unfair windfall being handed to some taxpayers. To protect the states from having to refund or pass tax collections relating to Commonwealth places, a 100 per cent windfall tax is imposed by the Commonwealth on all such refunds. This is achieved by the state deducting the windfall tax at the rate of 100 per cent from the refund before it is paid. The taxpayer is notified in the refund notice that the windfall has been deducted; the refund tax is then remitted to the Commonwealth. The liability to make this payment to the Commonwealth creates a liability in the Commonwealth to pay an equal amount to the state. Although it is a somewhat complex process, it does ensure that no windfall gains accrue to taxpayers at the expense of the states. A similar windfall tax model was implemented to overcome the High Court decision in the Ha and Lim and Walter Hammond cases, which members may recall invalidated the business franchise fees collected by the states on tobacco, alcohol and so on. Accordingly, for those reasons I have just detailed, the opposition will not be opposing this package of legislation. This is an example of government acting to fix problems concerning Commonwealth-state legislation. It is relevant because we are having a debate at the moment about our tax system and whether our tax system is broken or not. It is evidenced that, although there are problems from time to time in Commonwealth-state financial relations, these problems are not beyond being fixed. It is regrettable that the government has been endeavouring to mislead the Thursday, 12 March 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1235 Australian public by essentially taking the position that the tax system is beyond repair and that, therefore, we need to have a GST and there is no alternative. Frankly, it is time for the government to come clean with its model concerning tax reform and to explain to the Australian people exactly what it intends. At present we are having a phoney debate concerning GST and tax reform. We do not have any indication of the amounts proposed or of whether the level is to be 10 per cent, 12V2 per cent, 15 per cent or some other figure. We do not have any indication of what the exemptions might be, or whether financial services, health, education and food are to be exempted. We do not have any indication of how money collected through a GST might come back to taxpayers in the form of reduced taxes of other kinds, nor of just how the government intends to make use of this money. It is at present a phoney debate; and, frankly, the Australian people are being treated with contempt. They are entitled to better. They are entitled to know what the details of the government's tax model are and to not be put in a situation where the government announces a model and then says, 'We're going off to the polls in three or four weeks,' and the community, the opposition and other interested parties are given just a few weeks to scrutinise the government's model before the electorate is expected to pass judgment on it. I think that displays a contempt for the Australian people, and I do not think that is acceptable. There needs to be far more pressure applied than has been applied to this government, to make it come up with its tax model in time for the public to give it appropriate consideration. There are some furphies around concerning the tax debate: for example, that Labor has backflipped on the GST since 1985. It ought to be pointed out that since 1985, some 12 years ago now, when the Labor government considered but did not proceed with a proposal to introduce a consumption tax, the debate really has moved on, and that Labor made significant changes to the tax system, thus making a GST unnecessary. . In 1985 it was argued that a GST was needed because the income tax base had become too narrow. However, instead of introducing a GST, we attacked the root of the problem by broadening the income tax base. For example, we introduced a capital gains tax to ensure that people who received income in the form of capital gains paid their fair share; we brought in fringe benefits tax to prevent high income earners avoiding their fair share of tax by taking their salary in such perks as school fees, cars, bank loans and the like; we properly taxed, for the first time, income earned overseas; and we significantly rationalised the then wholesale sales tax regime. So the debate really has moved on from where it was back in 1985. When it comes to backflips on the GST, none is more spectacular than Prime Minister Howard's own effort. After resuming the leadership of his party, he said: There's no way a GST will ever be part of our policy ... Never ever. That was said at a Tweed Heads Civic Centre doorstop on 2 May 1995. moved to broaden the income tax-",147,Representatives Main Commlitee

Other members will have the right, during the debate. changes to capital gains tax and fringe benefits tax, and through the taxing of overseas income, we were able to broaden the income tax base. This is always the task of governments when holes arise in the income tax base. Holes do arise, because there are people with a vested interest in finding and developing them, and it is the task of government to close those holes. The present Treasurer ( Mr Costello) has abandoned that task. He knows that a lot of tax is escaping through the use of trusts. He has not cracked down on that form of tax avoidance and, as a result, there are holes in the income tax regime; but it is for the government to fix those properly and directly, rather than to say, 'The system is broke and, therefore, we have to move to a GST.' Prime Minister Howard also said, when he was opposition leader, in a press release on 2 May 1995: A GST or anything resembling it is no longer Coalition policy. Nor will it be policy at any time in the future. It is completely off the political agenda. They must have been non-core promises. Dr Southcott interjectingDr Southcott interjectingMadam DEPUTY SPEAKER-I call you to order. You have the right to put your name down for the debate. If you do not wish to participate, you will remain silent. it is the facts about a GST which are scary. We simply cannot see how a GST can be fairly imposed or maintained on low and middle income earners. A GSTwould have a horrendous impact on small business, the very people whom this government promised they would reduce the red tape for by some 50 per cent. There is no evidence from Europe, or from anywhere else, that it addresses the black economy. Indeed, it is the reverse: people avoid reporting transactions in order to avoid paying GST on them. Above all, there is no evidence of any correlation between a GST and lower unemployment. The government is going to have to come up with much better answers than it has done so far if it is to persuade anyone that this latest attempt to divert attention from its unemployment performance-its lack of performance-has any substance. There has been a lot of breathless overstatement about the supposedly derelict state of the Australian tax system. When people say that the system is broke, as distinct from requiring ongoing repair, they usually mean two related things: the tax mix between income and other taxes is out of kilter, and that income taxes are becoming more and more intolerably burdensome. which does deal with some state taxes, payroll taxes and so on; but it certainly does not deal with the whole tax system. I would refer the member back to the bill that is in front of us. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-I do not think it is a point of order. Given all of the bills that we are taking as cognate legislation, it is a very· wide ranging debate. There is no point of order.",149,Representatives Main Committee

332,Dr Southcott,"I rise on a point of order. Madam Deputy Speaker, we are discussing a billThursday, 12 March 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1237 does create a number of financial challenges in the delivery of public services to Australian citizens, and the set of bills that we are discussing endeavours to address that. They demonstrate that where problems arise in relation to the tax system it is for the government to address these directly, as the government is doing with this legislation, rather than saying, 'The tax system broke and, therefore, we've got to introduce a GST.' When it comes to taxes on goods and services as a proportion of the overall national tax take, Australia is more or less equal to the average of advanced industrial countries. Our percentage is 30 per cent, whereas the OECD percentage is 32 per cent. On income tax, Australia has a much lower proportion of income tax in the national tax take: Australia has 54 per cent; the OECD average is 61 per cent, taking into account social security payments, which make up 25.9 per cent of the OECD average. At the Commonwealth level, the collection of income tax as a proportion of all Commonwealth taxes has been relatively stable: income tax in fact represents 74 per cent of Commonwealth taxes now compared with 72 per cent back in 1974-75. If we in Australia have a marginally greater emphasis on income tax, that is a legitimate choice. Properly administered income taxes are the fairest taxes of all. Concerning the income tax burden, the facts are that the average personal tax paid by households is the same now as the average over the past 20 years: 16 per cent. The facts are that workers on average earnings now pay the same average rate of tax as 20 years ago: some 24 per cent. The marginal tax rate· for average workers is below the OECD average. For Australia, it is 35.5 per cent; that is, 34 and the 1Y2 per cent Medicare levy. The OECD average is 41.4 per cent. That is the marginal tax rate for average workers. Mr Howard has repeatedly claimed that tax reform is needed because we now pay the top marginal rate at lower earnings than 20 years ago. lower now because the Hawke and Keating governments cut John Howard's top tax rate from 60 per cent to 47 per cent. That is why it is lower now. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-Order! AgainI will remind the members on the government benches that they may participate in the debate; they only have to place their names on the Notice Paper. Australians pay the top rate at $50,000, significantly higher than the average weekly ordinary time earnings, which are now at $36,000, and much higher than average weekly earnings, which are now at $30,000. Sixty-five per cent of all employees earn less than the average weekly ordinary time earnings. It is wrong to imply that Australia is now a high tax country. In fact, compared with like economies, we are a low tax country. Our level of taxation is 8V2 per cent of GDP lower than the average of comparable countries, and we pay some $40 billion less than we would if we were taxed at the average levels of other OECD countries. A GST is not necessary to deal with bracket creep; it is something that every government has to respond to sooner or later. Bracket creep is aproblem which is a feature of every tax system, and it is one which we addressed",150,Representatives Main Committee

336,Mr Anthony,Everyone is in it; everyone pays it.,151,Representatives Main Committee
337,Mr Kelvin Thomson,"In response to the interjections, it ought to be pointed out that1238 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 12 March 1998 when we were in government through the delivery of seven different rounds of tax cuts. If the tax scales today were the same as the ones that we inherited from the coalition in 1983, the government would be collecting around $30 billion more annually. There are challenges in the tax debate. There are challenges in the area of income tax; there are challenges in the area of business taxes; and there are challenges in the area of Commonwealth-state financial relations, to which this bill relates. But we are not prepared to be party to changes which will be overwhelmingly regressive for the majority of Australians and which will set this country back. We believe that a GST is fundamentally unfair to the Australian community, that it will not address the real issues facing Australia-jobs and job security. Let me go through a number of these problems in a little more detail. First, you have the fundamental equity problem. Imposing tax on all items of consumption is inherently regressive. It is common ground, even by the proponents of a GST, that the extension of the consumption tax base to a flat rate GST across all goods and services is, of itself, regressive. It is regressive because the same tax rate is paid by all people on their total consumption-rich as well as poor. In fact, lower income people have a higher proportion of tax burden because they consume a greater proportion of their income than do higher income people. In addition, much of what is currently consumed by lower income people is currently free of sales tax-for example, most rent, food. clothing and utility charges-so a high level of GST is going to be even more unfair. If you are trying to replace all the existing indirect taxes, including payroll tax but excluding fuel taxes, you need a rate of around 15 per cent; if you want to replace all indirect taxes, including the fuel taxes, you have to go up to 20 per cent; and if you want to go to a 10 per cent personal income tax cut as well, that means a rate of over 25 per cent-the higher the GST rate, the worse the impact on low income earners. Indeed, a flat rate GST is unfair. The existing wholesale sales tax is a mUltiple rate tax, so you have luxury goods like furs and jewellery being taxed at a higher rate of 32 per cent and luxury cars, the genuinely imported cars, being taxed at the highest rate of 45 per cent. This means that the luxury goods currently being heavily taxed under the existing wholesale sales tax regime can be expected to come down in price while the necessities of life are going to go up in price. So a GST will provide an unjustified benefit to the well off who purchase luxuries. Let me give some examples of the ordinary services which, under a GST, will go up in price: funeral costs; child-care costs; visits to the hairdresser; taking your pet to the vet; going to the movies; going to the football; and getting repairs to the washing machine, the toilet, the television or the car. That is how it is going to work: fur coats come down in price; school uniforms go up in price. The second problem is what is described as the compensation now problem. No-one can be guaranteed that he or she will not be worse off at the outset. Most proponents of a GST acknowledge that, to offset the regressive elements of a GST, it is necessary to compensate low income earners by increasing social security pensions and benefits and by altering the income tax scale for those within the tax system. However, designing an effective compensation scheme to ensure that no low or middle income people are made worse off by the introduction of a GST is extraordinarily difficult and, in my view, probably impossible. Thursday, 12 March 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1239 The third problem is referred to as the compensation in the future problem. No-one can be guaranteed that he or she will not be worse off further down the track. It is not possible to guarantee the integrity of a compensation package over time. Future governments-as we have seen, for example, in New Zealand-may cut back the compensation directly or increase the rate of GST without providing additional compensation. This then delivers a regressive outcome. The fourth problem is increasing rates and decreasing coverage. The international experience of the GST is that, despite assurances to the contrary, the initial rate at which a GST is introduced is inevitably increased over time. Of the 27 OECD member countries which have a GST, 21 have already increased the standard rate of tax from its initial level. In the UK, for example, V AT was initially 10 per cent; now it is 17Y2 per cent. In New Zealand, GST was initially 10 per cent; now it is 12Y2 per cent. So much for the idea of the Treasurer ( Mr Costello) that· this is going to be set in concrete. In addition, over time, governments tend to reduce or eliminate the concessions on certain goods and services which are initially introduced. GST is an easy way for governments to increase the burden of taxation on a community. A small increase in rates will result in a significant increase in revenue. History shows that indirect taxes, once imposed, are rarely, if ever, repealed. Next we have two problems of GST for small business. The first is of becoming an unpaid tax collector. Wholesale sales tax is a relatively easy system to administer and to comply with. There are only around 75,000 registered tax collection points at the moment. Most small businesses are not registered, as they are not wholesalers. Accordingly, they do not need to collect and to remit the wholesale sales tax to the tax office. A GST will require a million additional taxpayers to register and remit the GST on a regular basis. These small businesses are not going to be paid for this tax collecting role. The second problem for small business is high compliance costs. They are going to have initial or transitional compliance costs-and I know that some of them have expressed alarm to me about what this will actually entail-but they will also have ongoing compliance costs. An OECD study called Taxing consumption 1988 found that the smaller firms have costs, in proportion to turnover, more than 30 times those of the biggest. So you will see a comparative disadvantage being suffered by small business. The initial costs include self-education, new equipment, new business systems and any related professional advice. They will vary considerably between businesses, but will inevitably involve considerable time and expense. Examples include new hardware such as cash registers with a GST tax capacity, computer software such as accounting software, new sales dockets and forms to include provision for GST. This is on top of the time that small businesses will need to spend to learn how a GST works and to register with the tax office. The ongoing compliance costs include the time taken for the GST paperwork, other costs of compliance including professional advice, the costs of record keeping for possible GST audits and the costs of being audited. There may also be a cash flow penalty on small business. All of the above costs apply for a GST with few exemptions. The costs of complying with a GST increase further as the number of exemptions increases. In addition, making an error over whether a particular transaction is exempt or not may place the small business in a position of committing an offence and being liable for penalties. 1240 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 12 March 1998 The next area I want to deal with is the black economy. A GST does not fix it. It is difficult to make precise estimates of the size of the black economy, but such estimates as there are show that there is absolutely no correlation between a country having a GST and having a smaller black economy. A lot of the black economy involves trade in personal services-home maintenance and the like-as well as the classic evasive activity such as drug dealing. Currently, the income from these services escapes income tax, through non-declaration. Introducing a GST on such services would actually increase the incentive for non-declaration, because you are then evading not only income tax but GST as well. By their nature, many of these services use minimal inputs, so little tax will be raised by a GST on inputs. While it is true that some spending of this income will involve GST being paid, some tax is already paid on this spending through the existing wholesale sales tax and excise systems. The next issue relates to jobs and saving. A GST is not a solution to unemployment. Internationally, there is simply no relationship between consumption taxes and unemployment rates. The United States, for example, does not have a GST but does have one of the lowest levels of unemployment. The United States has an unemployment rate of around five per cent. On the other hand, European Union countries, such as Germany, France, Spain and Italy, all have high rates of unemployment, averaging around 12 per cent, despite having GSTs. Canada introduced a GST in 1991 but its unemployment rate remains high, at 9.1 per cent. improving national saving. There is a wide variation in household savings rates amongst those countries that have consumption taxes. For example, the Netherlands and Belgium have consumption taxes, but while Belgium has the highest household savings rate of the major OECD countries-16Y2 per cent-the Netherlands has the lowest household savings rate-just 0.2 per cent. One of the final couple of points that I want to mention on this subject is the inflation problem. There would be a very painful transition. The introduction of, for example, a 15 per cent GST would generate an inflationary surge of around five per cent, increasing the current inflation rate from one per cent to six per cent. Interest rates, in tum, would increase and this would have a very adverse effect on family budgets. And there is no guarantee that inflation would fall quickly to its pre-GST level. There is also the competitiveness problem for small business. Almost all small businesses are currently exempt from payroll tax. If you abolish payroll tax, this has some benefit for big business but no benefit for small business. As I indicated before, the compliance costs for a GST as a proportion of small business costs are much higher than those for big business. Together, this would be a double whammy, worsening the competitive position of small business against big business. . For all those reasons, GST is a nightmare best avoided. We have a situation where there is a responsibility on governments to protect the tax base. The government is moving in this case to protect the tax base, and the opposition supports this legislation. It is not the job of governments to throw their hands up in the air in despair and say, 'Look, there is nothing we can do about it; therefore we're going to have to slug you all with a GST.'",151,Representatives Main Committee

A GST is not the answer toThursday, 12 March 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1241 Dr SOUTHCOTT (Boothby) (12.18 p.m.}-I was very interested to hear the comments from the member for Wills( Mr Kelvin Thomson). In fact, I was surprised when he said he was going to be spending half a hour speaking on the Commonwealth Places (Mirror Taxes) Bill 1998. It is a very interesting bill which relates to a High Court decision brought down in 1996-and I would like to talk on that later. But there are some comments that he made in this debate that I would like to respond to. To start off, the member for Wills mentioned the fact that this is not a tax on mirrors. That is true-it is not a tax on mirrors. But the tax on mirrors is levied at 22 per cent. When you look at the taxes on items in the bathroom, there is a 22 per cent wholesale sales tax which is levied on cosmetics, shampoo, soap, deodorant, toothpaste, toilet paper, non-medicated mouthwash and spa baths. Mirrors would be taxed at 22 per cent. He says that that is a reasonable system. Constituents in his electorate of Wills could get all those things cheaper. Handbasins, baths, toilets and towels are taxed at about 12 per cent. If you want to find something tax free, you can find a toothbrush and medicated mouthwash. This is the fantastic tax system that we inherited from the Labor Party. Apparently, there are no inconsistencies there at all. The member for Wills also mentioned GST. I thought I was almost in the time tunnel going back to 1993. At present, the coalition is examining options for reform of the tax system which include looking at the option of a broad based indirect tax. But I might ask the member for Wills where was he in 1985 when we had the tax cart and Keating was getting everyone on the tax cart? We had the famous option C to be considered at the tax summit. OptionC was a 12Y2 per cent consumption tax. That was the tax being pushed by the then Treasurer, Paul Keating. When we look at Paul Kelly's The End of Certainty, which tells the whole story of politics in the 1980s, you find something very interesting. The only supporters in cabinet for option C were Paul Keating, Bob Hawke, Kim Beazley, Gareth Evans and Susan Ryan. So the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Beazley) and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Gareth Evans) were both supporting a consumption tax. Was the member for Hotham( Mr Crean), who was involved in the ACTU in the mid-1980s, any purer? According to John Edwards's biography of Paul Keating, Crean and Kelty both agreed with the Treasurer's diagnosis and felt there was no other way to go than a broad based consumption tax. That was back in 1985. The wholesale sales tax was brought in in 1930 to combat the Great Depression. The differential rate was introduced by Artie Fadden in World War IT so that they could tax luxuries which were non-essential items in World War II. In November 1940, Artie Fadden said: In commending the bill to the favourable reception of honourable members, I would urge that in their consideration of the individual items comprising the respective schedules, they do not lose sight of the fact that what would be a proposal not to be contemplated in times of peace becomes an inescapable necessity in time of war. The member for Wills mentioned fur coats. I am not in favour of fur being used, but what he did not mention are some of the things that are tax free. You can go and buy aRussell Drysdale painting for $800,000 at the latest auction. That is tax free. You can go and buy an antique and that is tax free. The sorts of things that we are talking about are things that were luxuries during World War IT. 1242 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 12 March 1998 How many of our constituents would have televisions? How many would have cameras? These are the things that are taxed at the lUxury rate. The luxury rate of 32 per cent for wholesale sales tax taxes things like video recorders. Almost every household has got a video recorder, televisions, cameras, watches, jewellery-luxury goods. Those are the sorts of thing we are talking about. There are higher levels for things like cars. Every car is taxed at 22 per cent. That is a particular issue in my electorate, which contains Mitsubishi. We manufacture a lot of the cars. Some of them are going overseas; others are remaining within Australia. It is true that our present average weekly earners are only paying 34c in the dollar at the marginal tax rate. Next year they are moving to the second top tax rate. Next year they are moving to 43c. In fact, to be in the top marginal tax rate in the year 2000, you will only have to be on 1.2 average weekly earnings. The burden of our tax system falls heavily on the average weekly earners. I mentioned before the differential rates and the sorts of problems that that has created. You have got court cases all the time which are working out the proper classification of things like cotton buds and cling wrap, toilet paper, facial tissues, frozen yoghurt, mouthwash, model aeroplanes, paint brushes, trade catalogues, safes, scaffolding, power boards, transformers, telephone exchange equipment, pizza dough mixers, take-away foods and beverages. These are the subject of court cases all the time to decide where they fit in terms of the differential rate. The member for Wills mentioned that this was a good decision. What it related to was section 52(i) of the constitution, and the Full Bench of the High Court, with Dawson and Toohey dissenting, said: ... the Stamps Act so far as it operated to charge the lease with stamp duty was invalid because s 52(i) of the Constitution gave the Commonwealth exclusive legislative power with respect to Commonwealth places ... It is similar to, but also different from, the August 1997 decision of the High Court, which used, when it was legislated for by the Commonwealth, section 51(ii) as its head of power which allows for taxation but not so as 'to discriminate between States or parts of States'. Section 52(i) does give the Commonwealth exclusive power to make laws with respect to Commonwealth places which have been acquired by the Commonwealth. In addressing the comments made by the previous speaker, the member for Wills said that this was quite a sensible thing, to actually have things like stamp duty, payroll tax, financial institutions duty and debits tax levied by the Commonwealth and then reimbursed to the states, and we can do that at differential rates. But he thought that was addressing the issue of Commonwealth-state imbalance. It is not. In fact, before the August 1997 decision of the High Court which removed the power of the states to tax excise on petrol, alcohol and tobacco, Australia was the most centralised federation in the world in terms of raising revenue. In fact, it even has a worse degree of vertical fiscal imbalance than centralised states like France. Australia is more centralised in the way it raises revenue in that 80 per cent of all tax revenue is raised by the Commonwealth. Over 46 per cent of state and territory revenue actually comes from state and territory grants from the Commonwealth. Vertical fiscal imbalance began in 1942. It is the brief of the government's Treasury task force and also the government members consultative task force to look at the issue of vertical fiscal imbalance. Labor members do not have any answer to it. They do not have any answer Thursday, 12 March 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1243 to the wholesale sales tax system. They believe the current sales tax system is quite adequate. You would find people in Labor electorates and people in Liberal electorates who are buying televisions, radios, video recorders and cameras. These are things that are taxed at 32 per cent. There is no difference between people on higher incomes or lower incomes when it comes to the tax rate applying to buying luxury items. It used to be 30 per cent but it went up in the 1993 budget Remember that budget? Remember that budget when Labor said it was not going to increase taxes and subsequently it increased all the taxes. I will conclude my remarks and allow the Parliamentary Secretary [Cabinet] to the Prime Minister( Mr Miles) to respond. p.m.)-in reply-I will try to be very, very brief because I have only got a couple of minutes in summing up. I \\""ould like to say that this package of four bills will implement a safety net for each state government in respect of revenues from stamp duty, payroll tax, financial institutions duty and bank accounts debit tax in relation to Commo.nwealth places in their state. The safety net is necessary following the High Court's Allders decision. The Commonwealth has worked hard with the states to put this package together. I welcome the opposition's statement that it will not be opposing this package of bills. I know it has been a wide-ranging debate on general taxation issues, but summing it up, the Labor Party is talking about the past. What we are doing as a government is talking about the future in regard to taxation. Labor members are always going back to what happened in the past; they are not looking forward to the future, not giving any clear directions to the Australian people about the future. That is what this government is about in regard to taxation reform. I would like to thank the member for Boothby (Dr Southcott) and the member for Wills( Mr Kelvin Thomson) for their contribution to the debate today and I commend all four bills to the House.

The sad fact about AMES is that the federal government has cut funding to ·the New South Wales service by 60 per cent to 65 per cent. The department has now divided New South Wales into five regions, each of which was separately tendered for. AMES was granted preferred provider status in only two of the five regions, which is a disgrace when one considers the accumulated knowledge and experience of the present 500 teaching staff. AMES has provided this magnificent service to refugees and migrants throughout New South Wales for over 50 years and this government, with its ideological push to sell off everything that moves, has shown scant regard for the enormous tradition and service given by these many staff over this period of time.

Apparently not at all. AMES will no longer be able to operate in Auburn, Bankstown, Blacktown, Cabramatta, Campbelltown, Campsie, Fairfield, Liverpool, Parramatta, Rockdale and Wollongong. Of all of these important areas where refugees and migrants go to live, only one is not covered by an ALP federal member. What an indictment that is on the thinking of the government. The decision is destroying a highly regarded state-wide public institution-and for what? It is simply to satisfy the loony tunes of the coalition. A serious matter that has not been properly addressed by the government is the awarding of the tender to the Australian Centre for Languages. It clearly leaves itself wide open to question. When the former head of the service conducted an inquiry into whether the service should be privatised, he recommended it should. La and behold, who is the new director of the successful tenderer? Newly arrived migrants and refugees will no longer have access to highly trained and highly qualified teaching services previously enjoyed in New South Wales. Not one extra migrant or refugee will be eligible for English tuition through privatisation; not one extra hour of English will be available for eligible migrants through privatisation. Why did the government do it? The answers, to date, from the government do not seem to add up in any way. All it appears to me is that the government feels the need to give all government work to private enterprise and to ensure that they act on recommendations that are premeditated, as in this case. Clearly this is all about smaller government, a call that we heard many times from them when they were in opposition. In government, they have increased their ministry, sacked the Public Service and privati sed large slabs of the department to lessen their responsibility. These concerns being raised by us are genuine. Private monopoly is not necessarily the best way to deliver a public service. The moment we raise the involvement of private providers, the debate becomes one about money and profit. The debate should be about people and education. The bean counters of Treasury should be relegated out of the whole debate. But, of course, this mean-spirited government is about money and profit. The government seems not to have any real feeling for the people they are hurting but are claiming to be helping. Crimmings, Mr Joseph spent most of his life living in my electorate: Joe Crimmings.

349,Mr Hockey (North Sydney) (12.35 P.m.),"I rise today to pay tribute to a man who has1246 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 12 March 1998 he has become an icon of Sydney's lower North Shore. Joe has good working-class, historic traditions. Joe has lived a life that may seem very distant, to today's generation. From his earliest days when, at the age of eight, when he took a tumble from the footboard of a cable car in Williams Street through to the publication of his autobiography-which, amazingly, he wrote at the age of 94-like many Australians of his era, Joe has had a deep and abiding love for the colour of life and the intricate parts of life. Of all my discussions, either through the mail or on the occasion that I had the opportunity to meet with Joe, there has always been left with me one line of his that aptly sums up his life: he got on with life and made the best of things throughout those days. It may interest the Labor party members of this house to know that Joe Crimmings was born in Surry Hills to Joseph Patrick Crimmings and Isabel Marion Crimmings, nee Caton-which seems to be pretty good Irish Australian stock. His family moved to Willoughby in the early part of this century. Interestingly, as Joe recounts in his memoirs, at that time a large part of the district consisted of Chinese market gardens, and there was a Chinese temple in Chatswood. Chatswood today has one of the largest Chinese communities in Australia, and I am very proud to represent it in this House. Joe records in his memoirs his fond recollection of the trams terminating at Willoughby, and the fact that a current site of the Channel Nine studios was formerly a dairy and that the entrance to Grace Bros in Chats wood was once a roller skating rink. Joe has worked hard throughout his life-the story of many successful Australians. Like so many of his era, he started work at the very early age of 13 to support his family. At the age of 14, he joined a Pitt Street publishing company and then Goodall and Co., where he worked for 50 years until his retirement in 1962. His memoirs and his contribution to our community will surely not be taken for granted. As Phillip Adams wrote in the preface to Joe's memoirs: I only wish that more elderly Australians would follow Joe's example and commit their memories to paper. Or perhaps to tape or video. Because it is only in this way that their memories will be preserved for the rest of us. Particularly for their families and friends. Stoic of character and never short of a strong opinion, Joe has been an avid writer who has corresponded for 30 years with the Northern District Times on local and national issues. That is how, as federal member for North Sydney, I first came into contact with Joe. He often took up the challenge of stirring up community debate on pertinent and relevant issues. On behalf of the members of the federal parliament and on behalf of the people of the federal electorate of North Sydney, I wish Joe Crimmings a very happy lOath birthday, good health and many years ahead. Honourable members-Hear, hear! Employment ServicesI would like to discuss the results of the HONard government's disgraceful tendering process for employment services in my electorate and particularly throughout south-western Sydney. If there is one thing we can count on with the Howard government, it is placing its commercial interests above the interests of the community, above the interests of the people that it is meant to represent. That is what it has done with the allocation of contracts for employment services. In my electorate and the surrounding regions, some of the most successful community employment agencies, organisations which have been placing the long-term unemployed into",159,Representatives Main Committee
350,Mrs Crosio (Prospect) (12.39 P.m.),"In the short time allocated to me this afternoon,Thursday, 12 March 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1247 jobs for over 10 years, have now found themselves without contracts for providing employment services. The shame of it all is that, while they may have been unsuccessful, other fly-by-night operators-people of questionable motives, people with little or no understanding of the very specific problems facing the unemployed in south-western Sydney-have not. I refer, of course, to one gentleman in particular, Mr Khadar Roude, and his agency, Employment Interactive. The fact that this gentleman, whose only experience in the way of employment services prior to his successful tender was working as a case manager for a few years with the Islamic Council of New South Wales, was awarded contracts for 12 sites throughout Sydney-the majority in south-western Sydney-still leaves me dumbfounded. This is a man who, at the present time, has no office space-let alone offices-in any of the 12 sites that he has across Sydney: no staff, no infrastructure, and his organisation is unincorporated. This is a man who, at present, does not hold, and has not even applied for-as of today-a licence to operate as an employment agent in New South Wales under the Employment Agents Act 1996. In fact, had he applied, I doubt he would have been successful. To qualify under the act, an organisation has to prove it has sufficient office space, including appropriate lighting, ventilation, furnishings, record storage facilities, accommodation for visitors and a private area for interviews. Even if, just for argument's sake, we can imagine that Mr Roude had the infrastructure in place to begin offering employment advice and service to the unemployed Sydney siders, does the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Dr Kemp) seriously. believe Mr Roude is of sound enough character to hold such enormous responsibilities? Mr Roude is currently under investigation by the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs for breaching its tendering process guidelines, specifically its rules on collusive tendering and conflicts of interest. Mr Roude, while employed with the Islamic Council of New South Wales, while playing an active role in assisting that organisation in preparing its own employment services tender, allegedly took the information he obtained from them and used it to prepare his own independent tender, undercutting that council's cost proposals and, in that way, making his own tender appear cheaper to the department. This is despite the fact that Mr Roude was asked four times by his work mates at the Islamic Council of New South Wales, in front of witnesses, whether he was preparing his own independent tender-a charge he denied each time. We also have information, which has come to light in this week's Fairfield Champion, that Mr Roude approached the New South Wales state member for Lakemba, Mr Tony Stewart, allegedly under the pretext of obtaining a reference to support the Islamic Council's job tender. In good faith, the MP provided Mr Roude with the letter required. It was only then that Mr Roude allegedly used the document, not to support the Islamic Council's tender but to support his own. As I understand, Mr Stewart has referred this matter to the Commonwealth Ombudsman for investigation. So, despite his lack of organisation, despite the grubby way in which Mr Roude has tricked and manipulated the fine people at the Islamic Council of New South Wales, he has been given the tender for 12 sites across Sydney by Minister Kemp and his department. The minister justifies this gentleman's success by saying: The government has been determined to break out of the traditional club of providers to find the very best people in Australia to help unemployed people. 1248 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 12 March 1998 I reiterate 'to find the very best people in Australia to help unemployed people'. The minister's logic is: you drop individuals like Sister Mary-Louise of Penrith-a former Penrith Citizen of the Year-and her organisation, which over 13 years has assisted 7,000 unemployed people, with a success rate that has never dropped below 62 per cent; and you give contracts to the likes of Khadar Roude. You drop people like Mr Van Tri Huynh and his group at T &A Skill Care Services from my own area, an agency that has been extremely successful in helping non-English speaking clients--especially those of Vietnamese background-and, I might add, that has been praised continually for it by the government, in a region where unemployment is almost twice the national average. You wipe them and you give the contract to Mr Roude. You throwaway organisations with valuable foundations in the communities which they serve. You throwaway their staff with years of invaluable expertise and collective experience. For what reason? The minister says it is to help the unemployed people. What rubbish! He is doing it because it is cheaper for his department and it is cheaper for his government. It will cost Australians dearly. The logic behind this whole process is difficult to comprehend. I do not understand it, the people of western Sydney do not understand it, and the legions of unemployed will not forget it. (Time expired) Makin Electorate Minister( Mr Howard) made to my electorate of Makin on 29 January 1998. During the visit, the Prime Minister was given insight into Australia's aged care at Lutheran Nursing Homes at Hope Valley, which provides high quality care for many aged residents in my electorate. This provided the Prime Minister with an opportunity to meet with residents from the nursing home, the independent living units and the hostel, and to hear first-hand their views on our aged care reforms. The Prime Minister also spent time discussing the latest legislation with the General Manager of Lutheran Nursing Homes, Mr Tim Gray, and with some members of the home staff. I am delighted to report that hundreds of people turned out to greet the Prime Minister. They were saying that they thought he was a tremendous Prime Minister, that he was honest and caring and that they were proud to have him as the Prime Minister of Australia. During his visit, the Prime Minister witnessed the state-of-the-art care provided for residents at Lutheran Nursing Homes in a very home-like and caring atmosphere. Mr Gray and his staff should be commended for their hard work and dedication to the facility's residents. Also during the Prime Minister's time in Makin, he visited the Avago Skills Training Centre, which is now the venue for a work for the dole scheme which was successfully tendered for by the Tea Tree Gully Development Board. This board is now working in partnership with the Tea Tree Gully Council, who have provided some funding towards materials for the project. TheA vago Skills Training Centre have made the workshop and a trainer-supervisor available for the scheme, and all three organisations should be congratulated on their commitment to the youth in our local community. These work for the dole scheme participants will be building bus stop shelters for the local area which will obviously be used and appreciated by many in the Makin community. This aspect of the scheme highlights the Prime Minister's commitment to mutual obligation, an aspect which is critical in today's society.",160,Representatives Main Committee
351,Mrs Draper (Makin) (12.44 P.m.),"TodayI would like to speak about a visit the PrimeThursday, 12 March 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1249 Also in attendance at the Avago Skills Training Centre was a group of students from the Salisbury East High School who wrote to the Prime Minister in support of the work for the dole scheme. These students felt that the concept of work for the dole was a great idea and one of the best proposals by the government to date. The students also felt that this scheme would, without doubt, be great for the self-esteem of young unemployed people, while also providing employment opportunities through the work experience and the skills gained through this scheme. In fact, three people from this work for the dole scheme have already gained jobs. Mr Deputy Speaker, you would also be pleased to note that in Makin we are very excited about the work for the dole scheme because, sadly, as the Prime Minister stated during his visit, youth unemployment is still too high. I believe a certain percentage of underlying structural unemployment will always be part of the economy due to the role of technology, changing roles of women in the work force, and some aspects of industrial relations that still need changing, as well as the training and literacy requirements. On a lighter note, I would like to inform the Main Committee that I had the pleasure of presenting the Prime Minister with a scarf and tie from the two best AFL football clubs in the country: the Adelaide Crows and Port Adelaide Power. I asked the Prime Minister to take back the message that not only is South Australia the best state in the best country in the world in which to live but also we have the best football teams in the AFL: the reigning premiers and the AFL's newest club, who in 1997 proved they will be a force in the competition for years to come. The Prime Minister's visit to Makin demonstrates the government's commitment to providing employment and training for our youth and also better, fairer and more equitable aged care for our ageing Australian population. I was particularly proud to show the Prime Minister what a wonderful, integrated team is behind two aspects of our community critical to the work for the dole scheme in Makin and the state-of-the-art care provided for our nursing home residents. Multilateral Agreement on Investment concern to me and to a growing number of my constituents. I wish to express my great concern about the way the government is negotiating the current multilateral agreement on investment. There is a veil of secrecy around the government's handling of these negotiations. While the draft test of the MAL is publicly available, the government's negotiating process is anything but public. Not surprisingly, the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) has leapt to conclusions of conspiracy and cover-up. The member for Oxley's paranoia and mistrust of government processes is so extreme, it would not surprise me if she suspected the government of implanting silicon chips in people's brains. Possibly these chips send out impulses that make you believe in your imminent assassination and urge you to record your final words on video. Rather than deride the role of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, as the member for Oxley has done, I support the call by the shadow minister for foreign affairs to refer the draft agreement to the committee immediately. I urge the government to call for public hearings on the possible implications of the MAL for all aspects of Australian life. This is not a treaty we should be rushing to finalise. It is far too important, having the potential to affect every aspect of Australian life.",162,Representatives Main Committee
352,Mr Albanese (Grayndler) (12.49 P.m.},"-I rise today to speak on an issue that is of great1250 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 12 March 1998 The treaty has the potential to homogenise the world in the image of transnational corporations. Globalisation already poses a major threat to the individuality of nations and peoples all over the world. In thousands of years, when archaeologists dig up the remains of our civilisation, what will they make of the shiny golden arches found in dig sites all ()ver the planet-possibly the existence of a religious cult so powerful that it dominated the world? In fact, this may seem more plausible than a fast food chain.so big and so all-encompassing that it monopolised food service markets in every corner of the globe. But multinational organisations such as Coca-Cola, Sony, Ford, Microsoft, Shell and IBM already pervade the lives of people all over the world. If the MAl proves to give multinational corporations even more power to smother and take over smaller companies in the nations in which they operate, then it should be of grave concern to all Australians. The MAl may not affect Australia in this way, but it is very hard to be sure unless we have an open public process of input into what exceptions and safeguards the government is negotiating. The MAl must not thr.eaten labour rights, or environmental and social justice standards. It must not make it possible for our cultural identity to be moulded in its image. It is essential that the government protect core ILO standards and retain the legislative power to regulate foreign investment in a way that favours Australian business rather than allows it to be eaten up. I note that the trade union advisory committee of the OECD shares these concerns about the MAl in general. Certainly, foreign investment in Australia by multinationals can have positive effects for the economy. However, once it is established, the threat of withdrawal can be used to downgrade workers' wages and conditions. It is happening already all over the world, and under the MAl the power of these transnationals may be even greater unless strong and secure exemptions and safeguards are negotiated. Given the government's record on industrial relations, I am very worried about the outcome of its negotiations. I am also worried about the potential impact, in stopping Australia from having a decent industry policy. As I commented earlier, our cultural identity is also threatened by increasing globalisation. Australia's film and television production sector is of vital importance to our cultural identity and is acclaimed internationally for its efficiency and quality. Although film and television content rules are reported to be among the exemptions to the MAl, the exemptions may only be for a limited time before they are removed. This would pose a significant threat to an industry that is already in a David and Goliath situation with, mainly, American production houses and distributors. Australian films occupy just under 10 per cent of the cinema box office in Australia. However, if the MAl gives foreign investors in the film and television industry national treatment, we may be forced to give up the local content rules completely. We would simply not have an Australian film industry. I reiterate my call for the Australian government to open the negotiating process to public scrutiny. The labour rights and cultural identity of Australians must not be undermined by the MAL Furthermore, all Australians should have the opportunity to be informed and express an opinion in the final draft of this process. Rochedale Landfill just highlighted a number of reasons why the Howard government convened the Joint Standing",163,Representatives Main Committee
353,Mr Hardgrave (Moreton) (12.54 P.m.),"The member for Grayndler ( Mr Albanese) hasThursday, 12 March 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1251 Committee on Treaties. I can inform the House that this weekend there will be advertisements placed by that committee calling for public submissions, and I invite the member for Grayndler to talk to his mates in the trade union movement to submit some of those comments to the committee for consideration. We have an open process in treaties. Unlike the previous government's approach, people can be involved. I wish to turn to a matter involving residents in my electorate, particularly in the suburbs of Wishart and Rochedale. They are feeling betrayed by the Brisbane City Council's Soorley administration because of its failure to oversee properly the Brisbane landfill which is known colloquially as the Rochedale Dump. Lord Mayor Soorley in fact campaigned against this dump when he promised to stop it if elected back in 1991. That he failed to deliver is part of the anger that many in my area will never lose about this. That the state Labor government at the time also could have stopped the dump but chose not to because they saw political advantage in the dump going ahead was shabby-'whatever it takes' certainly applied there. That the Atkinson Liberal administration in City Hall actually proposed and approved this so-called 'state of the art' dump is a fact. They did so despite the clear local concerns represented by local councillors Graham Quirk and Graeme McDougall, now the member for Griffith, and supported by my own concerns as a representative of the Liberal Party grassroots in the local area. Ironically, both Councillor Quirk and the member for Griffith were re-elected to Brisbane City Council in 1991 and Lord Mayor Atkinson was not. This certainly says something about never losing the importance of representing your constituents first and foremost. It is a principle which I know the Liberal and National parties follow, but it is a principle that those opposite certainly do not have. The Labor Party has a clear 'party first, constituents second' approach. In fact, Labor even threatens you with expUlsion if you speak out against the party. Look what is happening to Anne Scott in Oxley. Lord Mayor Soorley is adding to his failure to stop the dump by failing to ensure proper standards are maintained. Residents who live in the vicinity of the dump at Rochedale have made numerous complaints about environmental matters over a considerable period of time. There has been concern that the dump's lining may have been compromised, allowing leaching into the watertable. There have been dust and noise concerns. Residents along Kessels Road and Mt Gravatt Capalaba Road know of the increase in truck traffic as compacted rubbish is trucked to Rochedale. But the biggest concern is smell. The licence for the dump prohibits any release of noxious or offensive odours beyond the boundaries of the dump. The city council has sought, though, to amend these licence conditions relating to environmental nuisance and release of noxious or offensive odours beyond the boundary of the dump. They have also put to the state government a draft environmental management plan about how to minimise the offensive odours. . The application and the draft plan were found wanting, for substantial reasons, by the state coalition government. I welcome the commitment to high standards by the state minister, Brian Littleproud, and also the local focus which state member Frank Carroll has consistently displayed on this issue. I join with them and local councillors Graham Quirk and Michael Caltabiano in calling on Brisbane Lord Mayor Soorley to get on with the job he is supposed to be doing. 1252 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 12 March 1998 Councillor Soorley is fond of spending ratepayers' money on massive overseas world tours. As Channel7 found out last year, his European sojourn was not so well supported by authorities he was supposedly off to visit. Liberal opposition leader June O'Connell rightly labelled him 'Jetset Jim' -and the ratepayers foot the bill. Instead of tripping around the world, Jetset Jim would be wise to address council matters, like mowing the parks, fixing up the potholes, cleaning out the stormwater drains, which seem to always clog when the summer rains come and cause flooding in my electorate. Jetset Jim would better serve the people of Brisbane if he gave up trying to out point score state and federal Labor leaders over Wik and got on with the job that he is supposed to be doing. He did himself great discredit the other week when he politicised the Australia Day citizenship ceremony at City HalL I know this because over 1,000 people supported my criticism of him at the event over his misleading and party political conduct at what should have been a non-partisan celebration for 680 new Australians and their supporters. Many people in the city of Brisbane rightly believe that Councillor Jim Soorley has lost the plot. Jetset Jim has a slogan about liveability in Brisbane. It applies generally though to inner suburbs, where he lives. Jetset Jim does not see the liveability of the residents of Wishart and Rochedale as a high priority, and the Brisbane City Council does not seem to have the practical policies needed to address the concerns of residents around the Rochedale dump, a dump which Soorley said he would never allow. The reason the practical·approach is missing is simply because there is no practical focus from the leadership at City Hall. Jetset Jim Soorley earns a prime ministerial size salary. But while, in his mind, he might see it that particular way, he is not the Prime Minister. In fact, his many failures over the Rochedale dump provide ample example that he is proving to be a failure as lord mayor.
