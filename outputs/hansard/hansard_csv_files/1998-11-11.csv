Cognate bills: Second Reading Debate resumed. Ms MACKLIN (Jagajaga) (3.30 p.m.)-Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I congratulate you on your election to the deputy speakership. The Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Bill 1998, the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1998 and the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety (Licence Charges) Bill 1998 establish the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency, ARPANSA, covering all Commonwealth agencies that undertake activities which raise radiation protection or nuclear safety issues. Given that we are debating them together, I will address all the issues at the one time. It was the previous Labor government that actually initiated the process to establish a satisfactory system for nuclear regulation in Australia and I am very pleased today to see that this process is finally coming to completion. The legislation also has roots in the Senate Select Committee on the Dangers of Radioactive Waste whose April 1996 report was entitled No time to waste. These bills are of current importance because of two key decisions that Australia faces about the development of nuclear facilities. The first is the overdue decision on future provision of nuclear materials for medical and industrial purposes. The Lucas Heights reactor is reaching the end of its useful life and should cease operation by 2005. Whether a new reactor is built on the existing site or on a new site, or whether an alternative strategy is followed for production of nuclear materials, is a major issue. It is one on which the public has every reason to be concerned and a right to demand the fullest public debate. The second is the resolution of a site to store Australia's own radioactive wastes in a secure and acceptable manner. Whilst a framework has been developed, there is a lot of detail to be resolved. Australia has in the past relied on overseas facilities for a permanent solution to the problem of nuclear waste, but increasingly we are likely to find that these will not be available. It is critical that both these decisions are made within a regulatory framework that is soundly based on international best practice and that commands public respect. It will be no good if the government establishes a new agency but fails to take the necessary steps to ensure that",149,Adjournment Jobs For 1 000 People In Eastern Sydney
235,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr Nehl) Took The Chair At 3.30 P.m.,,154,Representatives Main Commiitee
236,Mr Deputy Speaker,"Allow me to welcome you all to the first meeting of the MainWednesday, 11 November 1998 MAIN COMMITIEE 193 the agency is credible. There is the need to be credible not just to the scientific and medical community, but also to those in the general public who have serious concerns about the spread of nuclear facilities and the widening application of radiation in our daily lives. I strongly support the establishment of a strong and credible national regulatory framework for the control of applications of radiation and nuclear materials for medical and scientific purposes. I believe the government and the opposition have similar views on most of the major issues and I do welcome the extent to which this bill has been improved since it was last debated. For example, the inclusion of clause 83 requires that the powers to be given under the bill can be exercised only in accordance with prescribed international obligations. However, I have received representations on a number of issues. One is that the legislation is not sufficiently transparent to public scrutiny. Others are that the standards that will be required could be inadequate and that the make-up of the committees does not include consumer and environmental representatives and could become unbalanced or insular over time. I am of the view that these concerns can best be addressed by amending the legislation in two areas to ensure that the new authority has credibility and independence. I would suggest that that could be done, firstly, by enshrining a requirement that the CEO have regard to best international practice in deciding whether to issue licences and, secondly, by ensuring that there is representation for a person with a consumer and environmental perspective on the important issues before each of the three new bodies is established. As far as best practice is concerned, the other major concerns that have been raised with me appear to be based on a worry that the authority will lag behind best practice in other countries and take refuge in less stringent standards adopted as part of international treaties. I have no doubt that the Australian public would wish our regulatory framework to be amongst the world's best and not be based on any 'lowest common denominator' standards. At present the CEO's powers are very open-ended and subject only to regulation which could be changed readily by future governments. These powers are also capable of delegation under section 17. I therefore propose to the government for, their consideration that the principle of best practice be built into the legislation, as it affects the issuing of licences by the CEO. In my view this could best be achieved by adding to both section 31(3) and section 32(3) the following words: 'and having regard to international best practice'. I understand at the moment that the Minister for Health and Aged Care is not inclined to agree to these words being inserted into the legislation but that he would consider inserting a similar provision into the regulations which the CEO is obliged to take into account. In my view this is not good enough, as the regulations may easily be changed. The wording of the bill even contemplates that the government may in fact not prescribe any regulations in relation to sections 31 and 32. I do not propose to move these amendments today, in order to assist the expedited consideration of the bill, but when the bill is debated in the Senate it may be appropriate to do so if discussions have not proceeded to a satisfactory outcome on this point. The bill also gives the CEO very wide discretion to make decisions. It is vital that the appointment be of a person who is widely respected, as the credibility of the agency will depend on the personal authority of its head. The position should therefore be filled by a thorough process to obtain a world-class expert with the authority and judgment that the role requires, and I certainly understand that the government has that in mind. 194 MAIN COMMITIEE Wednesday, 11 November 1998 On the second issue I have raised, which is representation of the interests of the public, I want to go through the processes that the bill sets in train and then some suggested improvements. The Radiation Health and Safety Advisory Council, as set out in the bill, will identify emerging issues, examine matters of public concern and advise on the recommendations from the other two committees. It also has the general power to advise the CEQ on its own initiative or to look at things referred to it by the CEO. The second committee, the Radiation Health Committee, is a specialist body for radiation protection, looking at national policies, codes and standards and the promotion of these policies. It can look at things only at the request of the chief executive or the council. The third committee, the Nuclear Safety Committee, has the parallel role in relation to matters of nuclear safety and is similarly restricted in what it can look at. I note that the outline in the explanatory memorandum states that the Radiation Health and Safety Advisory Council will include, amongst others, consumer groups. However, this is not required in the bill. It also fails to give appropriate weight to the environmental issues, which Instead, we see that the minister has said that he will appoint a single person who will 'represent the public interest'. I would have thought that it. was the purpose of the entire committee and all of its members to be committed to protecting the public interest. This language actually misses the point that the council and the two committees need to include people who represent those with different views. There is a need for debate between experts to ensure that our system for radiation protection and nuclear safety is first rate. We will not get that if the members are carefully selected to accord with the views of, say, the chief executive or of any established orthodoxy amongst the key players in the industry. We in the Labor Party believe that it is very important that the advisory council has on it, by legislation, people who represent the broadest range of opinion in the community. The minister has indicated that he intends selecting people who do not come from a narrow group. However, there is always the prospect that some will feel excluded or, more likely, that a future minister may not abide by any understanding that is not reflected in the words of the legislation. I believe that the relevant three clauses should be amended so those selected by the minister to 'protect the public interest' are specifically people selected from nominations by national consumer and environmental groups. I have made these suggestions to the minister and I understand it may be possible to agree on new words that achieve this objective. I am pleased that the government has agreed to an amendment proposed by the opposition in May when the bill was previously debated. This will ensure that someone from an area affected by a controlled facility is appointed to the Nuclear Safety Committee to represent local government. I also understand that, in the first instance, this will probably be a representative of the Sutherland Shire, which is the area surrounding the Lucas Heights facility. I have received representations from the Sutherland Shire and they have been very detailed and professional. I think they have lobbied on behalf of the residents of their area very effectively and certainly merit being directly represented on the Nuclear Safety Committee. I would appreciate hearing more from the minister about how he proposes to ensure that other areas with controlled facilities are to be represented. As it happens, I represent the electorate where there is another facility-the Australian Radiation Laboratory-which has operated successfully for many years and has very good relations with its local community. It does an outstanding job in carrying out its functions. Wednesday, 11 November 1998 MAIN COMMITIEE 195 My view-and I put this to the minister-is that each facility should be proactive in engaging with its local community to ensure public confidence. All that we are talking about today is not something that should be done on the cheap. If Australia is to ensure the application of radiation and nuclear technologies that are safe, well managed and get the public's support, we mu-t ensure t\1at we have the best expertise, a capability to do our own research and access to the latest techniques for measuring risks and monitoring the impact of radiation. Nuclear Safety (Licence Charges) Bill 1998 provides for charges to be levied on the holders of source licences and facility licences. The bill makes no provision about how these charges are to be set. WhatI would seek from the minister is an assurance that the new agency will be given a budget which is adequate for it to properly fulfil its statutory role. It is essential that ARPANSA has the resources to enable it to be well informed about the best practice around the world in the management of risks from the use of radiation and nuclear materials. I understand that the principal holders of licences will mainly be other Commonwealth agencies such as ANSTO. There is a major risk that pressure from these agencies will result in ARPANSA being given an inadequate budget and being left as a toothless tiger. There is also a risk that shortage of resources will result in lengthy delay in the development of the standards and codes that are foreshadowed. I would appreciate the minister's advice about how this is to be avoided. As I said at the start, the opposition supports the establishment of a strong and credible national regulatory framework for the control of applications of radiation and nuclear materials for medical and scientific purposes. I recognise that the bill is to be given expedited passage, and I support this to make sure that the legislation becomes effective as soon as practicable. I trust that the minister will be able to provide the information that I have sought before the bill is debated in the Senate and that he will give consideration to any minor amendments arising from my comments today. to point out to the member for Jagajaga that I note she has made some criticism of the phrase 'to represent the interests of the general public'. But it was actually her predecessor, the member for Dobell, who insisted on this phrase being inserted during the last parliament. Also, I noted that the member for Jagajaga raised, in her concerns about this legislation, how the local council would perhaps be represented on the committees. Ms Macklin-I said it was a good thing. for a person to represent the local government or the local administration of an area affected by a matter relating to the safety of a controlled facility. Ms Macklin-I am very happy about that. Sutherland Shire are interested in seeing put into the legislation. Mr Deputy Speaker, this is the second time this legislation has been presented in the Main Committee. As a member who has one of the 'controlled facilities' in my electorate, being the nuclear research reactor at Lucas Heights, I have a personal interest in ensuring the progress of this important legislation.

I must say we never sawMs Macklin-No, we initiated the review. Speaker, just to clear it up. I do not want to verbal the member for Jagajaga. Ms Macklin-That is not what I said. Mr V ALE-My understanding is that, despite the initial review being done during the Labor Party government in 1993, there did not appear to be any perception that any recommendations of that review actually had been put into force. It is with great concern that this legislation does again come before the Main Committee. I acknowledge the work of the previous Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Family Services, the member for Adelaide, and also acknowledge the Minister for Health and Aged Care for bringing this legislation again befo-e the Main Committee today. I refer to my speech on 14 May this year when this matter was initially presented. I understand that perhaps I will have very little time to canvass many of the issues that I raised in that speech, Mr Deputy Speaker. It is important for my constituents because, for the first time in 40 years since the establishment of the facility at Lucas Heights, they are going to have an oversight agency which will protect the people and the environment. This is an oversight agency and the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency will be responsible to the Minister for Health and Aged Care, not the minister for science. It will actually operate at arm's length from the activities of the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation and will reflect the world's best practice to have an independent regulatory agency that will act for the people and for the protection of the environment in our area and, indeed, Australia-wide. The government is to be commended because it is acting in that regard. It gives me some satisfaction to welcome this legislation for an independent regulatory oversight agency, together with the enabling bills to cover the licensing charges and consequential amendments. The nuclear research reactor at Lucas Heights has been in my electorate of Hughes for almost 40 years; It is important that the Main Committee is aware that this is a research reactor which operates at 10 megawatts whereas a power reactor operates at 3,000 megawatts. I just stipulate that because there often is some confusion regarding nuclear reactors and there are differences. By way of history, the reactor was built in the Sutherland Shire in the mid-1950s and it was completed in 1958 when I was a child at Sylvania. The research reactor has been operating in my electorate for almost 40 years and, in that time-and most importantly in recent yearswith a significant growth in world consciousness about scientific safety and environmental protection, the facility has established a sound safety record which it scrupulously maintains in accordance with community expectations. The facility employs between 800 and 900 local people, many of whom are my constituents. It has a policy of positive support for local",157,Representatives Main Commitiee

It contributes almost $50 million to the economy of my electorate. So it is a very important facility for the electorate of Hughes. It also produces nuclear isotopes that are used in the delivery of diagnostic and therapeutic health services to thousands of Australians. As a matter of fact, the isotopes produced at Lucas Heights save many Australian lives and are depended upon by an increasing number of Australians as medical science expands its application of nuclear medicine. However, it has long been a concern of mine and many other residents in the Sutherland Shire that, although the facility has been operating safely now for 40 years, its regulatory regime has been significantly inadequate, given the growing world consciousness regarding health and safety issues and the heightened awareness of our responsibility to our environment, especially in the last decade. It is amazing that the previous government never had the political will to provide the proper legislative base for the appropriate regulation of nuclear installations and radiation activities in Australia. The facility was thought to operate under conditions laid down by the International Atomic Energy Agency, but this was dismissed by the research reactor review in 1993. This review found that, up to the present, ANSTO had operated under authorisation issued by its board to its executive director. As I pointed out in my earlier speech, the Nuclear Safety Bureau had referred to this as, amongst other things, a de facto licence. Minutes from meetings of the Safety Review Committee show that, in certain areas of operation, there has been regular confusion between the Nuclear Safety Bureau and ANSTO as to who has jurisdiction in certain areas of operation. Although the International Atomic Energy Agency has set the ground rules for independent regulation of the nuclear industry, by which most countries abide, the previous government had allowed the situation to drift along. The research reactor review in 1993 concluded that this state of affairs could no longer be allowed to continue. It has been of immense personal concern to me, since my election as the member for Hughes, to ensure that appropriate regulation comes to fruition. It is with great satisfaction that I have been able to successfully lobby the government and the cabinet to take these actions necessary to put into legislation the recommendations of the research reactor review in this regard. There is wide support from the various sections of the community for this legislation. The New South Wales state Minister for the Environment, Pam Allan, has stated that the Environment Protection Authority, which administers the radiation control act in New South Wales, confirms its support for a national uniform approach to the control of radiation. The Mayor of Sutherland Shire Council, Mr Kevin Schreiber, stated: Council supports this bill and hopes that it will enjoy the confidence of the Senate and it will be passed as soon as possible. The council also supported the establishment of the oversight agency in submissions to the research reactor review in 1993 and more recently in the Senate inquiry. The prime object of these bills is to protect the health and safety of the people of Australia and to protect the unique Australian environment. These bills give effect to the cabinet decision to enact the legislation to provide this protection by the regulation of all its Commonwealth radiation and nuclear activities, and to provide the statutory base for the regulatory safety agency to be called the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency or Laboratory-the ARL-and the Nuclear Safety Bureau-the NSB-to form the Australian 198 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 11 November 1998 Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency come within the health and family services portfolios. facility and the management of radiation sources, including ionised material and apparatus and non-ionising apparatus, where such activities are undertaken by the Commonwealth, Commonwealth entities and all those who do business with such entities. This legislation will provide a complete, independent oversight body for the better protection and assurance of all my constitilents. Most importantly for my constituents, a Radiation Health and Safety Advisory Council will be established under the legislation and there will be capacity within the working groups for local representation. Again, I mention the legislation for local council representation on the Nuclear Safety Committee. Clause 26(1)(d) provides for: . . . a person to represent the local government or the local administration of an area affected by a matter related to the safety of a controlled facility. It will be a direction of the CEO of this agency that matters to which he must give consideration will include consideration of world's best practice. These directions will be listed, as appropriate, in the regulations. The direction will apply to corporate bodies of the Commonwealth like ANSTO and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and Commonwealth business enterprises like Australian Isotopes. It will also apply to non-Commonwealth contractors who work under contract to one of the aforementioned entities. This legislation will also impose regulatory controls on the operation and decommissioning of ANSTO's research reactor and the disposition of spent fuel. It will regulate and license each stage of the life of the replacement research reactor. ARPANSA will also regulate the establishment of a national nuclear surface radioactive waste repository. This national repository will provide for low and intermediate level waste suitable for shallow ground burial and will arrange for the safe storage of material not suitable for disposal in other ways. Mr Deputy Speaker, the waste generated from nuclear reactor operation is a real problem. The storage of waste, especially in the repository up at Lucas Heights in my electorate, has been of great concern to my constituents for many years. It is with significant interest and appreciation that we welcome this government's announcement of its selection of a designated site for this purpose in South Australia. This government is committed to the health and well-being of the Australian people and the Australian environment. Its actions in implementing the recommendations of the Senate Select Committee on the Dangers of Radioactive Waste show that commitment, as does the implementation of this legislation. Dr WOOLDRIDGE (Casey-Minister for Health and Aged Care) (3.56 p.m.)-I will just sum up, as I understand that this debate is to be adjourned, and I would like to thank honourable members for their contribution. The Labor Party raises a number of points that I am happy to take on board. The first point relates to the nature of representation on .the Radiation Health and Safety Advisory Council. I am happy to look at a form of words around that. I point out that what the shadow minister is seeking to amend was a Labor Party proposal in the first place. While we are happy to look at it, I point out that consumers in this area are physicians in nuclear medicine. I would prefer that organisations had the opportunity to put names forward and that I make a choice after receiving those. , Wednesday, 11 November 1998 MAIN COMMITIEE 199 The opposition raises a point on international best practice: this is sensible and we are happy to take it up. The opposition raises a third point regarding the CEO. Naturally, we would follow the practices that are well established over the last 15 to 20 years of government for doing that. On the issue of a representative of local government, I am very mindful of this. The member for Hughes was a very forceful advocate for this prior to the last election and, clearly, given that ANSTO resides in her electorate, the Sutherland Shire Council will have a specific interest. I will be mindful of that when making appointments. This bill has been delayed as it was one that did not get through the Senate. Clearly, it is important that we have some nuclear regulatory framework in Australia, so I look forward to its speedy passage. Finally, in terms of the point about funding that I understand the shadow minister raised, section 55 of the bill does allow funding. In fact, the Commonwealth funding for this will continue. The issue of cost recovery is only if the organisation, ARPANSA, wishes to supplement its funding over and above the current budgetary appropriation. I thank honourable members for their contribution. Debate (on motion by Mrs Elson) adjourned. Second Reading Consideration resumed. time. Question resolved in the affirmative.

The States Grants (General Purposes) Amendment Bill 1998 is a noncontroversial bill and as such is supported by the opposition. It provides the untied Commonwealth financial assistance to the states and territories for 1998-99. The untied assistance, of course, is that which may be spent according to the states' own priorities. The bill authorises payments for the funding agreed to at the 1998 Premiers Conference of $17.1 billion for the financial year 1998-99. In doing so, the government has continued the Labor practice of indexing the pool of funds on a real per capita basis-that is, increasing both for inflation and for the increase in population. That is a fair funding formula in the view of the opposition, as demand for state services such as health, education, infrastructure, and the like, is often driven by both inflation and by population changes. The bill also authorises the revenue from the safety net arrangements introduced to make up for the state revenue shortfall arising from last year's High Court decision in the Walter Hammond case, which invalidated state business franchise fees concerning tobacco and the like as being uncontroversial, that is, $6.5 billion for 1998-99. The Prime Minister likes to pretend that he is a successful federalist. He pretends that the Commonwealth is good at cooperative relationships with the states. However, frankly, his government's record has been somewhere approximating the worse in history. There have been three premiers conferences with Prime Minister Howard and Treasurer Costello. All of them have been disastrous, which I think is an unparalleled effort. Just prior to the 1996 meeting, Treasurer Costello announced an enormous new tax burden on the states, some $1.3 billion per annum. That ambushing poisoned the water for the conference. It was a farce. In the end the Treasurer had to back down on his tax proposal, except in respect of some cars: Instead, he cut $1.5 billion from the funds available to the states over three consecutive years, thereby cutting much needed services for Australian families. This was the meeting where the states put on the record what they really thought about the Treasurer and in the end the premiers refused to meet with the Treasurer, and the Prime Minister had to meet with them alone to finally salvage an outcome. Last year we saw a complete collapse of the COAG process, which has remained completely stalled through the whole of this wasted period of office. Finally, we had an unprecedented result where the premiers simply walked out and went home. Without question, this government has the worse record in Commonwealth-state relations of any government. We saw the proposed start of a new five-year Medicare agreement delayed due to this government's ongoing incompetence. We were unable to get, for a very long period of time, an agreement between governments of this country concerning the delivery of health care for their citizens-again, an unprecedented outcome which smacks of incompetence. So, if we look ahead at what is in store in relation to federal-state financial relations, I do not think the picture looks too rosy. I want to come to some of the thoughts that opposition leader Kim Beazley has been expressing about the future of federal-state financial relationships in the event of the GST tax package being successful.",161,Representatives Main Commitiee
247,Mr Kelvin Thomson (Wills) (4.01 P.m.),"Mr Deputy Speaker, I join with otherWednesday, 11 November 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 201 In addition to the issue of federal-state financial relations, we also need to remember that the GST will detrimentally affect the third tier of government-local government. I know that local government has been expressing great concern about the impact of the government's tax package on it, both in terms of the direct extra costs which local government will experience through its own GST liabilities, but also through the way in which the change to federal-state financial relations proposed by this government through the GST will impact on direct local government financial relationships and diminish its position. I think that is a bad thing. Local government plays a most important role in the life of Australians, and to see its financial position disadvantaged in the way that the federal government proposes is not a good thing. This debate, which looks at the Commonwealth-state implications of the government's tax package, amongst other things, needs to look at what implications the tax package has for other policy areas, the social policy areas. Indeed, I think what we have to do is to look at the social implications of changes to Commonwealth-state financial relations which the coalition proposes. One of the things that will increasingly be understood about the tax debate is that it did not end on 3 October; in many important respects it is only now beginning, as people come to understand and want to debate what its implications will be in a whole variety of areas which were not covered by the taxpayer funded $15 million or so in advertising supporting the government's changes. We need to have a much closer examination of the GST package's implications for Commonwealth-state financial relations. As opposition leader Kim Beazley has observed, what this government is proposing with its GST is the most radical change in Commonwealth-state financial relations since the Commonwealth's acquisition of uniform taxation powers during the Second World War. That much has certainly been recognised in the debate, but only ever suggested as a good rather than for its potential dangers. What the supporters of the change fail to recognise in particular is the very clear intention of this government in proposing the structure it does for Commonwealth-state financial relations. What we have not recognised sufficiently so far is that this issue goes to the very heart of government service delivery. It goes to the heart of, an agenda of some 30 years standing in which, through special purpose payments, the Commonwealth government has jointly with the states laid the fundamentals for equity and social justice in the Australian community. That is an agenda which certainly developed in the postwar climate where we had a greater sense of understanding of Australia as a nation and the need for the Commonwealth to be involved in service delivery; and it certainly came very much as a result of the work of the Whitlam government, during the mid-1970s, drawing attention to the need by Australians for better services as our community matured and developed. The theory on which this government operates is that it is now time to sweep that aside, that premiers conferences should come to an end. The basis of the Commonwealth's tax package is that it will vacate about $30 billion of direct and indirect taxes and the system of financial assistance grants. The states, in return, will vacate a series of indirect taxes and will gain GST revenue worth about $30 billion. That, it is said, will give the states financial independence. And the public awareness of this shift is largely focused on the government's promise that the GST will not rise without a unanimous state vote. We note that no less-or more incessant-a critic of the ALP than Alan Wood has written of John Howard's tax plan, that it: 202 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 11 November 1998 ' ... leaves the Commonwealth largely dependent on the income tax base for its revenue, a situation it will not long accept. There are several ways it can get around this, such as pushing spending programmes onto the States, cutting back Special Purpose Payments to the States ... or simply legislating to reduce State access to GST revenue. We can see from this that the Commonwealth has a number of options if it finds the package unsatisfactory in future. Kim Beazley has pointed out that this is likely to be highly detrimental to long-term equity in the tax system, that it is confusing in a range of public policy areas critical to both fairness and productivity in Australian society, and that these dynamics will produce constant challenges to the political process when confronting the adequacy of public provision in areas like health, education, community services, transport and the like. So the situation we will have is the Commonwealth's passing more and more responsibility onto the states and the states operating with a veto over changes to the GST. However, increasingly they will be forced to respond at the level of the lowest common denominator, that is to say, the cheapest possible service. It ought to be noted while we are on this theme that there is nothing preventing the states from reinstating the taxes which they are required to abandon as part of the GST plan. They are required to abandon them n0W but there is no constitutional or other limitation on the states simply reintroducing those taxes or user charges in response to cuts in Commonwealth special purpose payments. So for this reason I think it is necessary that the Prime Minister guarantee that, as part and parcel of the taxation arrangements, there will not be cuts in Commonwealth specific purpose funding for the states, so that we will not come to a situation where we are faced with a terrible choice between fewer services, higher GST, or a myriad of increased state taxes and user charges. I think we would all understand that both of those revenue raising options there would be highly regressive. We are concerned that the Commonwealth is prepared in the first instance to cut special purpose payments and require the states to pick up the slack. That view was something the Prime Minister was expressing during the election debate. When the issue of dental care arose, the Prime Minister said, 'That is a state responsibility.' He has that same position whether the issue be education, aged care, transport, or other community services---eventually, I guess, everything bar defence and pensions. Currently, the Commonwealth provides in the order of $16 billion a year in special purpose payments. Within that sort of funding, we get all the equity programs in education and the Commonwealth contribution to aged care funding via HACC, just to point out a couple. These are important areas where continued, ongoing Commonwealth support will be necessary and where we cannot afford to have the Commonwealth retreating from the field. If we look at the area of public hospitals, the states have referred to an annual shortfall of $1 billion. The Commonwealth's initial response in the area of the Medicare agreement was $180 million. The states may have been submitting an ambit claim, but certainly the Commonwealth's offer was inadequate; it was simply not going to meet the ongoing health needs of this country. So Labor responded to that with an election policy for an extra $500 million per annum over and above the coalition's $180 million. We considered that sort of additional support to be essential. At the same time as the Commonwealth is inviting the states to fill holes in the area of services, it is also going to need the states to help it fill a hole in the business tax agenda. We saw during the election campaign quite a few business organisations going quiet in the hope Wednesday, 11 November 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 203 of post-election concessions, the foremost of which, no doubt, was the abolition of payroll taxes. This is now in the gift of the states, but it was the Commonwealth that started off debate in that area. The not so subtle invitation to the states now will be to raise the GST by the required three to four per cent, in order that the payroll tax can go. initially modest GSTs in Europe have risen up to 25 per cent under various pressures, entirely similar to the ones that we are talking about now-the same sorts of pressures with the same sort of outcome: up goes the GST. And there is plenty of room to move. Dr Southcott interjectingMadam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Hon. J.A. Crosio)-Order! The member for Wills has the call. I will call the member for Boothby in a moment. formula of state financial independence is reinforced, the cooperative model of the past 30 years of critical service delivery will give way to the opportunity for that electorally timed federal income tax cut. There is no doubt in my mind that this process is going to institutionalise-indeed, exacerbate-inequity in the Australian taxation system. It will reduce the progressivity of the Australian taxation system. For those people who support a GST as a supposed growth tax which will be a way in which services might be protected, they are wrong. There is no protection or guarantee of service protection inherent in a GST. The prospect of the federal income tax cut will be to put more service responsibilities back onto the states, looking to them to boost the GST and to reintroduce some of those user charges that people are so distressed about; we will still see all of that. What we will have is the balance of regressive taxes in the Australian taxation system increasing as the balance of progressive ones decreases. Public expectation of the Commonwealth is high in eaucational and social services and in public infrastructure. Regrettably, the government has been able to get away with things like cuts to dental services; but, if they are able to get away with the GST package, we will see them increasingly endeavouring to get out of the area of service provision, and passing those responsibilities on to the states. BeforeI conclude"" the other thing I ought to say about federal-state relations is that it is regrettable that we find a race to the. bottom, or a dutch auction, going on in terms of state fees and charges. One of my colleagues in the Victorian parliament put a question on the notice paper to the Victorian Treasurer about the cost of the decision in 1995 by the Queensland government to cut stamp duty on share transactions, and the Treasurer's answer came back that,·of course, in the light of the Queensland government's decision, Victoria had halved its rate· of stamp duty on share transfers and that the cost of that tax change was estimated at an average of approximately $125 million per annum over the four years of 199596 to 1998-99. Clearly, that is a very substantial loss in income; and it was a theme which was picked up as recently as this morning by the Courier-Mail in its discussion of the states' arguments aboutMadam DEPUTY SPEAKER-I do not wish to interrupt the member for Wills, but I am finding it very difficult to hear you, and I am sure that Hansard is, as well.

251,Honourable Members Interjecting,"204 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 11 November 1998 courtesy from the people sitting at the front table. Thank you, Minister Hockey; thank you, the member for Boothby. The member for Wills has the call. Mail has been commenting this morning on what it describes as the 'outbreak of war' among the states as they prepare to meet the Prime Minister to discuss the impact of the GST on their finances. We have had some debate between Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria about the way in which the GST package will impact on them-indeed, should it impact on them. It is regrettable when we get to a situation where states decide to reduce their own taxes and in tum cause other states to do likewise. As a result, the services which are needed in the community diminish. It is certainly my belief that where Commonwealth-state financial relations are concerned there is an obligation on the states to do what they can to raise revenue in a progressive way. Where their taxation is regressive there is clearly a case for Commonwealth support but, where the taxation arrangements that they have in place are progressive taxes, I think it would be desirable that the states continue to maintain that taxation effort. As I said at the outset, this is not a controversial bill and therefore the opposition will be supporting it. Dr SOUTHCOTT (Boothby) (4.21 p.m.)-As the previous speaker said, the States Grants (General Purposes) Amendment Bill 1998 is not a controversial bill. It is a bill we debate every year which gives the states untied money in order to operate. I thought I might just take this opportunity to reflect on the differing responsibilities that the Commonwealth and state governments have, and also the proposals that the government has to improve them. Recently there was a study done by Professor Francis Castles of the ANU and Kerry Barwise of Treasury which concluded that, when it comes to taxing revenues, Australia is one of the most centralised raisers of revenue in the world. In fact, we ranked third out of all OECD countries. If you look at other federations, in the United States, Washington raises something like 50 per cent of the total revenue raised. In Germany, Berlin raises about 30 per cent of total revenue raised. In Australia, Canberra raises about 80 per cent of total national revenue. I might point out that that study w-s done before the August 1997 High Court case which said that the states did not have the power to raise excise on tobacco, alcohol and petrol. Not only is Australia more centralised than any other federation in the world; it is also more centralised than some centralised states, such as France. In fact, as I said, it was third out of all OECD countries, beating several countries which do not even have states. While the Commonwealth is centralised on the revenue side, it is highly decentralised on the outlay side. They found that to be significant because decentralised systems actually end up spending less because the levels of bureaucracy actually provide a constraint to the money being spent. Generally, in terms of vertical fiscal imbalance and the whole shape of the federal system, we are in poor shape in that the states only raise about 55 per cent of the revenue that they spend and Canberra supplies the rest. At the annual Premiers Conference you see fights always breaking out about the amount that Canberra will give them. It means that the states generally do not have responsibility for raising the money that they subsequently spend. It is not a new problem. The states have been reliant, to some extent, on the Commonwealth since Federation, and especially since 1942 when they gave up their income tax power.",165,Representatives Main Committee
252,Mr Kelvin Thomson,"Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. The Queensland CourierWednesday, 11 November 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 205 Malcolm Fraser, in the 1970s, attempted to reform the system by giving the states some powers, some responsibilities, and also the power to raise income tax. None of the states took up his offer. Bob Hawke, in 1990, in reflecting the spirit of 100 years earlier, decided it was time to rejig the Federation. He went through a series of consultations with the states to introduce his new federalism. As most people will remember, new federalism was one of the first things that was poleaxed by Paul Keating prior to his final assault on Hawke. The High Court's decision last year now indicates that the states are more dependent on Canberra than ever. In terms of how that is going to change, one of the positive things, I think, about the government's tax package is the way that the revenue from the GST is going to be given to the states. The states will be given something like $20 billion in revenue. This could be one of the last bills we actually debate in which we are going to be giving all the revenue in this sort of way. Instead, we are going to have a specific amount of GST revenue which will go direct to the states. One of the problems is that the states have only very limited areas that they can actually tax. That is probably one of the reasons we have seen an explosion of gambling around Australia. In fact, the Economist a year or two ago described the explosion of gambling and casinos in Australia as like the rabbit plagues of the 1950s. They tend to be a little bit out of date with their images of Australia. The taxes that the states rely on are inefficient. They rely on taxing bank transactionsthings like FID and BAD. These involve significant compliance costs for people who are operating in different states because they differ depending on the jurisdiction. They also do impact a lot harder on people who have low incomes. Also, stamp duties, again, are different between different jurisdictions. The stamp duties on shares are levied by each of the states, but are an important obstacle to Australia becoming an important financial centre in the Asia-Pacific. There are vast differences between the state tax bases and rates. The way it is going to work is that during the transition period the states will not be worse off. It is estimated that by 2003-2004 the states will be something like $370 million better off. That is, as the economy grows, the amount of goods and services transacted will grow and the states will have more for services such as schools, hospitals and so on. Having said that, just briefly, I think that is a positive move. It does not actually address vertical fiscal imbalance because we will still be raising the money for them, but it does at least give the states some responsibility for that money. I will support the bill. p.m.)-I would like to thank the member for Wills and the member for Boothby for their contribution to this debate. Despite the fact that this is essentially an uncontroversial bill, I join with the member for Boothby in welcoming the fact that hopefully this will be one of the very last times that this parliament should have to debate a bill proposing general purpose grants to the states. That is because, as both speakers pointed out, under the coalition's tax reform package, the states will, for the first time, have access to a new national, aggressive growth tax. The growth tax comes from not its level of application, or the issues to which it applies, but from the simple fact that there is always going to be an ever increasing-or we would expect ever increasing-amount of consumption by the Australian people. Therefore, the net",166,Representatives Main Committee
253,Mr Hockey (North Sydney,"Minister for Financial Services and Regulation) (4.27206 MAIN COMMIITEE Wednesday, 11 November 1998 revenue collected from the tax will obviously continue to grow. That is one of the most significant gripes that the states have: the fact that they have a deteriorating taxation base; that the stamp duties that they collect are under very serious challenge from various aspects of globalisation; and that FID and BAD taxes are exactly that, bad taxes, because they are in fact handcuffs on the flow of money within the economy. When you have other transaction based taxes such as stamp duties on marketable securities, particula-ly stamp duty on the transfer of shares, then what you have in 'place are serious disincentives to international investment in our financial markets. One of the most significant benefits of the government's tax reform package is the fact that we are removing the shackles from the movement of money in the Australian economy and therefore making it a more attractive place. In fact, we are reinforcing the idea that we are a haven for the flow of international money. Most speakers referred to the fact that we continue to endure the unfortunate aspects of vertical fiscal imbalance-that is, that the Commonwealth collects significantly more revenue than it spends in terms of direct services to the community. That situation will change. Technocrats can argue forever and a day whether the clear definition of vertical fiscal imbalance will change, given that the Commonwealth will collect a GST, but the revenue will go to the states. I am sure the debate on the theoretical aspects of that will continue for years to come. However, the fact is that the states will determine the rate of the GST, in consultation with the Commonwealth and both houses of parliament, and they will receive the full benefit of the GST collected. In that sense, it is clearly arguable that the vertical fiscal imbalance problem is addressed. Of course, it will never resolve, and we will never resolve, the horizontal fiscal equalisation problems that, occur. That is the imbalance in the amount of revenue paid by the people in New South Wales and Victoria to the states but primarily to the Commonwealth, and the fact that through the Grants Commission process the money is reallocated to the benefit of some of the other states. I think there is a stranger in the House. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Hon. J.A. Crosio)-No, I am sure there is not, Minister. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-Order! The minister has the floor. on from some of the comments from the member for Wills, I do want to point out to him that the most significant threat to services provided by the states-and I want to emphasise this-is not the amount of revenue that they receive but, at the moment, the quality of the revenue that they receive and the fact that the taxes that the states rely on, such as stamp duty on the transfer of shares, get caught up in the bargaining process between, say, Queensland and New South Wales-and we saw the Queensland Premier threaten to abolish the last tranche of stamp duty on the transfer of shares only recently-and also the fact that other taxes such as FID and debits are under threat because of the significant transformations in banking and financial services. Therefore, the Commonwealth is throwing to the states a lifeline in the form of the GST. It is throwing them a lifeline so that they can continue to deliver the same services and improved services compared to what they are currently providing. We have not heard the states. I do not think that even Bob Carr, the Labor Premier in New South Wales, has said that he did not want the revenue from a GST. He has not said that and, surprise, why not?",167,Representatives Main Commitiee

FollowingWednesday, 11 November 1998 MAIN COMMITIEE 207 Because he is a significant beneficiary of the new taxation system that we are proposing. If any issue is self-evident for the Senate, it is this: the Senate is a states house. It was set down by the founding fathers to be a house to represent the interests of the states. The new taxation system is the most significant saviour for the states and their ability to provide essential services to the people of Australia that have been provided in the last 50 years. If the Senate truly is a states house, it will. truly support the taxation initiatives that we have put in place. This bill is an essential bill. It is a very important bill. It is the blood flow to the states so that they can continue to provide the essential services in health, education, law and order, and so on. I do thank the honourable members for Wills and Boothby for their significant contributions to this debate and, accordingly, I seek leave to continue my remarks at a later hour. Leave granted; debate adjourned. Second Reading Debate resumed. to introduce through the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill 1998 were due to commence on 1 July 1998. This bill was first introduced into the parliament on 12 March and has been on the books since then. Its passage through the Senate was interrupted by the government's decision to call an early election. This is yet another example of how this government puts its political agenda ahead of the needs of families. The government had 2Y2 years to fix some of the problems with the child support scheme, yet this bill, like so much of this government's agenda, was subsumed by its political agenda. The government's delay in dealing with this bill is a sad reflection on the level of its commitment to bringing about important reform in this area. Like many members of parliament my office has been inundated by calls from both custodial and non-custodial parents, raising issues as emotive as they are difficult. Labor understands that there are no easy fixes, but a responsible government must tackle these issues. After talking to many individuals affected by these problems, I will always consider well thought out and fair proposed changes in this area. The delays in dealing with this bill have perpetuated the problems for many people. The correct balance between the needs of custodial and non-custodial parents is very difficult to achieve. This bill represents the government's substantive response to the recommendations of the inquiry of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues into the child support scheme, and goes part of the way toward achieving such a balance, but the Labor Party believes that more needs to be done. The opposition will be moving the same amendments that we moved last May, with the exception of our amendment dealing with non-agency payments, the substance of which has now been incorporated. However, as someone who has spent the last 2Y2 years having a spell in the paddock, and doing a lot of listening, I have an open mind on what further improvements could be made in this area in the years ahead. This bill proposes a number of changes. Firstly, the bill introduces a minimum child support liability for all payer parents of $260 per annum, and, secondly, includes net rental property",168,Representatives Main Commiitee
256,Mr Swan (Lilley) (4.34 P.m. ),"Some of the important amendments the government seeks208 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 11 November 1998 losses-that is, negative gearing types of losses and exempt foreign income-in the taxable income for child support purposes. The bill proposes to introduce case management to assist parents at risk of family violence, to end the collection of child support or, indeed, to recommence the collection of child support as appropriate. However, I offer a note of caution, which I hope the Minister for Family and Community Services, and her representative in this place, will heed. As Centrelink is now the first point of contact for clients of the child support system, it will be the staff of Centrelink who will be placed in the unenviable position of explaining the changes which the government is proposing. These are the same staff who have been told they must endure savage cuts of 5,000 jobs over the years ahead. At the same time, they have been asked to deal with new and complex policy issues. While the government may choose to ignore the crisis in Centrelink, the Australian people know the truth about the constant engaged signals, overworked and despondent staff, and a worrying number of mistakes and delays in payments. Centrelinkstaff are now being asked to somehow find the time to help people sort out what the government changes will mean for them. I suspect very few child support clients will be satisfied discussing their personal affairs with a kiosk in a shopping centre. Of course, those clients who would be prepared to interact with a machine, rather than with a trained staff member, will have to hang around for five years waiting for the government to install the technology. The simple fact is that the current services are in crisis. There are more job cuts on the way and the new technology is years ,away from being ready. Child support system clients have every right to be suspicious of this government's commitment to assist them or to help them resolve difficult problems which they face. If this government fails to provide Centrelink with the resources it needs to assist clients of the child support system, it will be held accountable by the Australian people. Be assured: the Labor Party will not allow this government to shirk its responsibilities or to pretend that this problem does not exist. The government also proposes increasing the exempt income of the child support payers by 10 per cent. For 1997-98, the exempt amount would be $9,907 for single taxpayers and $16,525, plus additional amounts for each child, for payers with natural or adopted children in their care. It also proposes to lower what is referred to as the 'payee's disregarded income' from $37,424 to $29,598 by using a figure known as the 'all employees average total weekly earnings', rather than full-time adult weekly earnings. It needs to be pointed out that this reduction will be offset, at least in part, by the halving of the rate at which child support is reduced from the present dollar for dollar reduction in child support once you are over that income limit to 50c in the dollar. Payees may seek reassessment if they incur high child-care costs exceeding five per cent of their income. The bill also seeks to revise the child support scheme objectives to recognise that both parents are responsible for the support of their children. It seeks to allow parents, by agreement, to undertake private collection of child support at any time, and it talks about using the most current taxable income information available in the child support assessment. However, I would want to suggest that simply using the previous tax year, rather than the one before, does not really resolve the problems faced by many clients of the child support system. People are required to make estimates of their income or face being subjected to the indexation factors. If t-ey do estimate their income, and if it turns out that their income is less than they Wednesday, 11 November 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 209 have estimated, but the difference is less than 15 per cent, they cannot recover the amounts they pay in child support. This problem is a source of great frustration to many people. In talking to clients of the child support system, I have heard, time and time again, heart breaking stories about the effect of this rule. Labor will be considering how this and other problems, not addressed by the government's amendments, can be addressed in the future. The government's bill also seeks to allow the non-custodial parent to pay up to 25 per cent of their child support liability in kind without the consent of the custodial parent, subject to discretion on the part of the registrar. It also seeks to introduce an internal review mechanism for objection to decisions made by the Child Support Agency. It proposes to deem a stepchild to be a dependent child where the court has made a relevant order under the Family Law Act. It also proposes to continue child support liability until the end of the school year where the child is undergoing full-time secondary education and turns 18 during that school year. It has to be said that the child support legislation has been controversial and was the subject of an extensive inquiry by a committee of the parliament, the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues. That committee received 6,197 submissions which, I understand, is the largest number ever received by any parliamentary committee. So there is a very substantial degree of community interest and community concern in relation to this issue. This is borne out by the fact that the 1997-98 Commonwealth Ombudsman's report notes that the Child Support Agency accounted for some 12 per cent of all complaints to the Ombudsman's office. I understand that the Child Support Agency receives in excess of 4,000 letters a day and that, from 1 July 1997 to 30 November 1997, it received 17,516 applications for departure from the standard formula. So there is no doubt that the Child Support Agency has generated a lot of community comment and, indeed, community concern. When the child support review was conducted by the joint select committee, it concluded that the development of the child support scheme was a qualified success.' It pointed out that it had been successful in sheeting home to parents responsibility for looking after their children, and making it clear that it was not acceptable to have children and then to walk away from that responsibility of looking after them until they attain the age of majority. It ought to be said that there are many people who have been highly critical of the child support scheme. Indeed, I think it is fair to say that it is used in some places as a campaigning weapon against the Labor Party. But, if we look at the legislation before us, the government has essentially acknowledged the strengths of the child support scheme by making no essential changes to the basic model. We now have a situation where the government appears to support the scheme, leaving those in its own ranks wpo have been critical of it in an interesting position. I would be interested to hear what other participants in this debate from the government side have to say about this bill. When this bill was first debated in the House in May, the government used its numbers to gag debate on opposition amendments. That was a clumsy and outrageous decision, and smacks of genuine contempt not only of the parliamentary process but also of the interests of the thousands of parents who are interested in the debate on the child support scheme. It was cut off thanks to what was essentially a mean-spirited act by the government. One has to ask: why did this happen; why was it gagged? It seems clear that the government was deeply concerned that some within its own ranks were seriously considering supporting some of Labor's amendments. 210 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 11 November 1998 For example, we had the unprecedented event of the former member for Dickson, Tony Smith, moving amendments to the government's bill. Let me repeat: a government backbencher at that time moved amendments to a government bill. And it is important to remember that at that time he was still a fully paid-up member of the Liberal Party and the coalition. Of course, he cited the government's failure to reform the Child Support Agency as a major reason for his resignation from the government. For our part, good policy is always an unfinished business. Just because the child support scheme has noble objectives does not mean that it is by any means perfect and it does not mean that it will not require adjustment into the future. On the contrary, it is all the more probable that important and complex legislation which affects the lives of countless families will always require adjustment into the future. The simple fact is that an astounding number of ordinary Australians, from both sides of the debate, felt strongly enough about this issue to make submissions to the joint select committee inquiry. Labor understands the depth of that feeling and the frustration among ordinary Australians, and so we will be monitoring the effect of the government's amendments. The opposition has put forward a number of amendments which we believe pick up issues arising out of the report of the joint select committee. We will be doing that at the end of this debate. A particularly important amendment we are looking at is to try and ensure that changes in income are properly reflected in child support liabilities. At present, the payers who suffer a reduction in their income cannot recover any payments that they make unless that reduction exceeds 15 per cent. Recommendations 125 to 127 of the joint select committee's report provide for a much more up-to-date assessment of income and thereby largely address this problem. The government has made some changes, both in this legislation and previously, which are intended to help address this problem, but as far as we can tell it still remains a serious issue for people making estimates of their income. Let us say that a person is employed as a part-time cleaner, that they have a part-time cleaning contract. If that contract comes up for renewal and they miss out on the contract, their income is therefore reduced but their child support is paid on that earlier basis and they are not entitled to recover the overpayments. This strikes us as a problem that could be better addressed. Therefore, we are proposing that recommendations 125 to 127 of the joint select committee report be put forward to address this. We think there ought to be a financial penalty on anyone who deliberately or recklessly provides false or misleading information. We do not want to encourage dishonesty in this area. This is something that the joint select committee also recommended in recommendations 128 and 129. The opposition's amendment has also been designed to work in reverse-that is, if a payee's income rises unexpectedly, then they will be required to declare that increase and meet any increased child support liability. We propose to put forward some amendments which will attack child support avoidance, which continues to be a problem. The joint select committee recommendation 142 is designed to help repair the child support income base by identifying parents who receive business or investment income and the extent to which· those parents minimise their child support liabilities in that way. The joint select committee recommendations 143 and 144 propose that fringe benefits should be added to the existing child support income base for both parents and that we should require both parents to provide full details of all fringe benefits received from an employer. Wednesday, 11 November 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 211 Our amendments also provide for the establishment of an inquiry into certain aspects of the modelling of the scheme, including the impact on the relative disposable income of payee and payer parents of the value of fringe benefits provided by all levels of government to parents who are social security recipients. This is in accordance with the joint select committee recommendation 162. We also propose that that assessment be conducted by a body independent of the Department of Family and Community Services. We will be putting forward an amendment concerning the issue of subsequent family repartnering following the joint select committee proposal 139 that a payer parent's subsequent family formula self-support component be increased so that the relativity between the single and married rate of pension is reflected in the basic and subsequent self-support component. I believe that this amendment would go some way towards addressing what is an increasing concern-that the children of subsequent relationships are being treated as less valuable than the children of the first relationship. The amendments we propose to move cover matters that need obvious attention. There are some matters that may need further consideration, and it is possible we will be moving amendments in the Senate in respect of those matters. In particular, I am concerned that some custodial parents at the lower end of the income scale might receive less child support as a result of the bill and that this loss will be only partially picked up by an increase in their family allowance entitlement. We will therefore be moving amendments in the Senate to address this problem through the social security system. What the government has failed to acknowledge is the effect of some of these changes upon the poorest sole parent families as well as upon the poorest non-custodial families. Labor will be moving to remedy this problem by moving further amendments in the Senate. Child support, as we in the parliament all know, does arouse very strong passions, and it is seen as evidence that there is some sort of gender war taking place in our society. Members who spoke on this issue in a previous debate in this place were absolutely right when they indicated we should stop looking at this issue just through the prism of gender. Most importantly, I think we have to continue to look at it through the prism of need. In over 90 per cent of cases of separation or divorce it is the woman who ends up with the children and becomes the payee parent, and therefore in over 90 per cent of cases it is the man who is the payer parent and liable to pay child support. The joint select committee process confirms what many of us have known for some time: that the levels of disquiet, frustration and dismay on both sides are staggering. I might take this moment to quote a section from the committee's report: The Joint Committee considered the wider social impact of the interaction of social security, child support, family law and taxation legislation on the behaviour of custodial and non custodial parents both within and outside the Scheme. In particular, the Joint Committee is concerned that the interaction of this broad range of legislation may be creating serious work disincentives for both custodial and non custodial parents, putting intolerable pressure on existing relationships and discouraging the formation of new relationships generally. These are complex and emotive issues which must be tackled with the interests of both the custodial and non-custodial parents in mind but with the absolutely paramount imperative of ensuring that the children are adequately provided for. The government has yet to demonstrate its commitment to this goal. The Labor Party understands there is a way to go before the child 212 MAIN COMMITIEE Wednesday, 11 November 1998 support system will be widely accepted as delivering the best outcome for our nation's children while being at the same time as fair as possible to both parties. I hope that in the future we are able to move forward to a situation where there is less hardship and misery all around. There is no question in my mind that the breakdown of a marriage, or of any relationship involving children, is a terrible thing: it leaves emotional scars on parents and on children. We try, as a parliament, to do justice to each and every one of these situations, but from my own experience as a member of parliament that sometimes that does not occur-and perhaps all too frequently that does not occur. But whether, as legislators, we can find an adequate remedy for each and every one of those cases I am not sure. I hope that the government's bill represents a further step in the development of a fair and just social policy. As I indicated at the outset, we support it but we will move amendments both here and in the Senate which we hope will improve it further, and may move additional amendments to that end in the Senate particularly. Legislation Amendment Bill 1998, a very important bill. It was introduced into the House of Representatives in the previous parliament, and I spoke on it in this second chamber. It was passed, with government amendments, in May 1998. The bill has been reintroduced to the parliament because it had lapsed due to the prorogation of the parliament in Selltember. As I said at the time when I spoke on the bill in this chamber, I am a bit of a radical on child support. I do not say this with any criticism of the current government, nor of the previous government. I think that the Child Support Agency and its mechanisms have not fully encompassed the gravity or the size of the task we have before us, and I stand committed to that view. Statistics tell us that as many as one marriage in three ends in divorce. When reflecting on this startling figure, we are confronted by the conclusion that whatever we put in place has to be streamlined, fair, accessible and, above all, affordable. There are some very sensible measures in the bill which address most of the concerns of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues, which the member for Lilley just referred to. It underscores the fundamental principles that parents are primarily responsible for the financial support of their children. I think the marginal increase from $9,000 to $9,900 in the exempt income for payers of child support could have gone further, but I appreciate there are limitations on what the government can do in any given year. I personally would like to have seen it increased by 20 per cent rather than by 10 per cent. The amount of the carers income to be disregarded has come down from $37,000 to $29,000, in round figures. That, too, is a fair assessment because, instead of being based on the average weekly earnings of someone in full-time employment, it is based on average weekly earnings of all employees, and I think that is a far better benchmark to work on. I think the introduction of the minimum payment of $260 per annum in calculating the amount of child support payable is a good rule. I have had people come to me and say, 'I'm going on the dole; I'm going to go on the pension; I'm not going to support my kids any more; I've had enough of this,' because of some emotional frustration with the previous partner. I do not think that is good enough, and I think the fact that people have to pay $5 a week is an indication that everyone has a responsibility, even those on the lowest of incomes. I am not saying that at times people's circumstances do not call for reassessment. But I think the attitude that you can just throw yourself on the care of the state and expect to be exempt",169,Representatives Main Commitiee
257,Mr Neville (Hinkler) (4.53 P.m.),"I am pleased to speak in support of the Child SupportWednesday, 11 November 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 213 from all other responsibilities for your children is stretching the issue too far. The amendments will allow a token payment of $5 per week from social security pensioners and beneficiaries. It is an acknowledgment that there is a financial responsibility in bringing children into the world no matter what your circumstances are. Allowing payers and payees greater flexibility in reaching arrangements relating to child care is a very sensible measure too, as is addressing the situation where child-care arrangements have changed from those specified in various orders. Allowing child support to continue to the end of the school year in which a child turns 18 is completely reasonable. Where a child turns 18 in July of their final school year, no-one would expect the custodial parent putting that child through grade 12 to have to support that child without any assistance for the second half of the year. There are also such things as the introduction of review mechanisms enabling the registrar to initiate a departure from the administrative assessment of child support where the registrar has information pointing to a review process, rather than just the word of one parent. I think that also has been long awaited. There is inclusion of exempt foreign income and rental property losses in calculating income. I think we have all seen potential payers become very adept at using rental properties to avoid paying their just entitlements. I would personally like to see that part of the bill strengthened even further. I have a number of outrageous cases amongst my constituents where income is hidden in all sorts of family companies and discretionary trusts. I know of one instance of a gentleman who drives around in a BMW and who spends' $300 a week in restaurants, $150 a week on liquor, takes frequent trips overseas and then pays his wife a pittance, because the family has been very adept at concealing income. I think the registrar and the ATO should have some mechanism of probing those sorts of things more fully. Also in the bill is a provision allowing determinations to be based on more recent income, instead of on income from the previous two years. Basically, assessment will be on income from the last full year. It also means that payments can be altered automatically and in a more meaningful fashion. The one that I particularly like amongst these is allowing 50 per cent of child care expenditure to be excluded from a person's income for purposes of family allowance. This has been long awaited, and it allows the non-custodial parent, in the case where that noncustodial parent has taken on a new family, to receive a fuller and more reasonable assessment. By the way, Madam Deputy Speaker, I do not see the government's amendments as being the end of the process. I would like to see this put in the hands of an ongoing committee. Whatever form that takes, whether a parliamentary committee, a select committee, a joint committee, or a prime ministerial task force, I think that this thing is so fraught with emotion and with financial abuse that there needs to be some monitoring body that ensures that fairness prevails. I have in my own electorate groups of the men's support service, a group in Bundaberg and another in Gladstone. RecentlyI attended the Bundaberg men's support service. I do not say that with any sort of gender bias; they just happen to be the ones who have most of the noncustodial parents as members. They have some horrific instances that relate partly to the Child Support Agency and partly to the Family Court, and I would like to touch on something in the context of this today. 214 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 11 November 1998 I am not one of those who believe that you can separate access to children from Child Support Agency matters. I know the theorists tell us it should be that if you bring children into the world that is one responsibility, and to have access is another one. We have manipulative parents, as you all know, who do not send their kids for access. Suddenly the kids get the flu on the morning that they are due, or the kids are going to a cold climate and the parent says, 'Yes, you can have the children but you will have to buy them warm clothes,' or, 'Yes, they can go, but I cannot pay half the plane fares this time.' All those sorts of things go to frustrate the non-custodial parent having reasonable access. I have had some outrageous cases of custodial parents who have been defying the courts for nearly three years. When once or twice the non-custodial parent-because the child has been sick or there has been a suggestion of some form of abuse-has held the children for two or three days, the custodial parent never seems to have any trouble getting legal aid to have the children returned. Yet, when the boot is on the other foot and the custodial parent is defying the court on an ongoing basis, sometimes for two and three years at a time, nothing ever happens. For that reason, I would like to touch briefly, in the few minutes remaining to me, on the proposal put up by the Attorney-General for the establishment of a federal magistracy. I am a great supporter of this, and we actually debated this in the context of a similar debate in this very chamber in the dying stages of the last parliament. The former member for Dickson, himself a barrister, made some very good suggestions about this. If we had federal magistrates, some of those orders that are being abused could be rectified very quickly. Solicitors' expenses would be reduced; barristers would be less likely to be needed to be briefed; waiting times would be lessened; legal costs and costs incurred through litigation would be kept to a minimum; access to magistrates in regional areas would save litigants having to travel. I hope that when the Attorney-General brings in his legislation we get a degree of bipartisanship about this because I think it is urgently needed. If we could get very clear-cut rules that both sides have to abide by, we would get a much better result in this matter. I have exhausted my 10 minutes, Madam Deputy Speaker, and I know that the minister wants to wind up this debate, so I will conclude on that and commend the bill to the House. the honourable member for Lilley and the honourable member for Hinkler for their contributions to the debate on the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill 1998. I know that this is an issue of great interest to many members on both sides, and there has obviously been an extensive debate on this legislation in the previous parliament. I am grateful to the opposition for granting the rapid passage of this legislation so that it can get to the other house and be taken up where it was left off at the time that the parliament concluded. This is, as the honourable member for Lilley rightly commented, a difficult area. This legislation is an acknowledgment that not all is right with the Child Support Agency arrangements. However, he says, and I readily agree, that no matter how perfect we may get the formula and the arrangements-and we should strive to have them as perfect as is possible to be-there will still be many difficulties in this area. We are dealing with breakdowns in relationships where often there is an absence of goodwill, or where there is sadly a degree of attempting to get square and to use the formula or whatever administrative arrangements might be in place to endeavour to even up the balance sheet for things that had gone wrong in a past",174,Representatives Main Commitiee
258,Mr Truss (Wide Bay,"Minister for Community Services) (5.05 p.m)-I begin by thankingWednesday, 11 November 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 215 relationship. That certainly means that this legislation and, indeed, all endeavours in this area are often cast in the most difficult environments possible. In the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues there was a very comprehensive inquiry into these sorts of matters. There was tremendous public interest in that inquiry, and the report came down with 163 recommendations. That came down in 1994; and I noted the criticism by the member for Lilley of the actions of the current government in addressing those recommendations. Perhaps it is worth it to point out that, whilst he referred to his absence from this chamber for a while, he was a part of the Keating government that actually received this report and did precious little. Very few of the recommendations were dealt with by the Keating government, even though they had a year and a half or more to address them-and those that they dealt with were basically the pretty easy ones. The coalition government was left with the report and has, through this legislation and other actions, addressed the vast majority of the recommendations of that committee. We acknowledge the bipartisan effort that was put into that committee to endeavour to address the very difficult issues involved. We have now very substantially, with this legislation, worked through the recommendations of that report. The government has acknowledged that it does not see this legislation as the end of the issue. This is stage 2. We are already working to address others of the remaining recommendations of that report and, indeed, other issues that have come up since. The commitment was made, in the summing up of the legislation in the House of Representatives, that this was not seen by the government as the end of the matter and that further legislation could be expected in the life of this parliament. The opposition proposes to move some amendments, and I will comment on those when we get to that stage of the debate. I thank the member for Hinkler, who outlined many of the features of the legislation and many of the changes that are proposed. They are quite comprehensive and cover a very large range of matters of concern. We know that, as the honourable member for Hinkler has rightly said, there is still more to be done, but we believe that this legislation should be supported because it does make substantial advances. I have to say that even in my own electorate I had people coming to me during the election campaign, critical of the fact that this legislation had not passed. SoI hope that the Senate will deal promptly with it and that the opposition will give it smooth passage-bearing in mind that the Senate did have some opportunity to deal with it and did not take up that opportunity. I hope that they will give it much more priority when it comes to the Senate following its passage through the House on this occasion. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time.

(2) The regulations may set out the form in which the information required by this section is to be provided. 55B Updating of value of fringe benefits received In working out a person's child support income amount in relation to the days in a child support year, the value of any fringe benefits, as defined in the Fringe Benefits Assessment Act 1986, received by the person during the person's last relevant year of income is to be multiplied by the inflation factor (if any) applicable to the child support year under the regulations. 2 At the end of section 60 Add: (4) If a person has made an election under this section and that person subsequently becomes aware that his or her income for the year is likely to vary by 15% or more than the sum estimated for the purpose of the person's election, the person must notify the registrar of the details of the estimated variation at the first available opportunity. 3 After subsection 75(3) Insert: (3A) Without limiting subsection (1), the Registrar must amend any administrative assessment if satisfied that information provided by a liable parent or an entitled carer to child support establishes that the liable parent's monthly taxable income has varied by 15% or more from that recorded in that person's child support assessment. 4 After section 154 Insert: 154A Review of certain arrangements (1) As soon as practicable after the commencement of the Child Support Legislation Amendment Act 1998 the Minister must arrange for an independent inquiry to be conducted to make an assessment of and report on: (a) the impact on the relative disposable income of liable parents and custodians of the value of benefits provided by all levels of Government to parents who are recipients of benefits under the Social Security Act 1991; and (b) the extent to which use is made of devices to reduce income tax in order to reduce or avoid obligations under this Act. (2) The Minister must cause a copy of a report prepared under subsection (1) to be tabled in each House of the Parliament within 15 sitting days of that House after the Minister receives the report. 5 After section 159 Insert: Wednesday, 11 November 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 217 159A Statements made recklessly etc. (1) A person who recklessly: (a) makes a statement to an officer which is false or misleading in a material particular; or (b) omits from a statement made to an officer any matter or thing without which the statement is misleading in a material particular; is guilty of an offence. Penalty: 5 penalty units (2) In a prosecution of a person for an offence against subsection (1), if, having regard to: (a) the person's abilities, experience, qualifications and other attributes; and (b) all the circumstance surrounding the alleged offence; the person has acted without taking reasonable care as to the accuracy and completeness of the statement, or with wilful disregard to the requirements to obtain and provide relevant information, the person is to be taken to have acted recklessly in making the statement.

These amendments seek to give effect to the changes that I outlined in my speech on the second reading. I will just briefly digress and respond to some of the things that the minister said in the context of these amendments. We will be moving further amendments in the Senate and I welcome the spirit 'Of goodwill that he made his comments in and I would want to be speaking to him about those amendments subsequently. Item2 of schedule 15 of the bill seeks to alter the definition of the liable parent's child support income amount in section 38 of the Child Support (Assessment) Act to include exempt foreign income in rental property loss. Our amendment No. 1 seeks to insert a new paragraph (c) into proposed section 38 to ensure that the non-custodial parent's relevant income also includes the value of fringe benefits as defined in the Fringe Benefits Assessment Act 1986. Our amendment No. 2 does the same thing in respect of the definition of the entitled carer's child support income amount in section 45 of the act to ensure that fringe benefits are also included in the income of the non-custodial parent. 218 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 11 November 1998 Our amendment No. 3 seeks to insert a new schedule 20A into the bill and deals with the other concerns I highlighted in my speech on the second reading. Item1 of this proposed new schedule adds new sections 55A and 55B. Proposed section 55A requires both custodial and non-custodial parents to notify the registrar within 30 days of the end of the financial year of the value of any fringe benefits received. Proposed section 55B requires the Child Support Agency to apply the relevant inflation factor in assessing the value of fringe benefits. Item2 seeks to add a new subsection (4) to section 60 of the assessment act. Section 60 deals with the situation where a person's current income is at least 15 per cent lower than their income for the last relevant year of income and allows them to elect to have their child support liability or entitlement assessed on the basis of an estimate of their current income. Proposed subsection (4) would require a person who has made such an election to notify the registrar if he or she subsequently becomes aware that his or her income is likely to vary by at least 15 per cent of the estimate. Item3 of the proposed new schedule seeks to add a new subsection 75(3A) requiring the registrar to amend any assessment if satisfied that information provided by a custodial or noncustodial parent establishes that there has been a variation of the relevant income of at least 15 per cent from the income recorded in the assessment. Item4 of our proposed schedule would require the minister to establish an independent inquiry to investigate, firstly, the impact on disposable income of the value of fringe benefits provided by government to parents who are recipients of social security benefits and, secondly, the extent to which use is made of devices to reduce income tax in order to reduce or avoid their child support obligations. Item5 seeks to introduce sections 159A and 159B into the Child Support (Assessment) Act. These sections create offences in relation to the making of false, of misleading statements, or intentional or reckless omissions, and to notify the registrar of information when required. Their intention is to help ensure that the custodial and non-custodial parents alike meet their obligations in relation to the child support scheme. does not support the opposition's amendments to the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill 1998. They were proposed when this debate took place previously. We opposed them on that occasion and nothing has happened in the interim to lead us to change that position. We have taken on board some opposition amendments in the early stages of the debate but we do not propose to accept these. The bill makes the child support scheme more flexible and equitable. It encourages parents to cooperate in finding ways to support their children and at the same time it confirms that the parents have the primary responsibility for the support of their children. One of the amendments proposed by the opposition is intended to ensure that fringe benefits are counted as income in assessing child support. The government supports the principle of counting fringe benefits in assessing child support payments, but we are not anxious to deal with this matter in isolation. The government proposes to address this issue as part of its wider reform of the fringe benefits tax arrangements. The tax reform package will provide for fringe benefits to be included on group certificates and therefore to be included in income for child support purposes. The necessary legislation is being prepared and is expected to be introduced to the House quite soon.",177,Representatives Main Committee
260,Mr Truss (Wide Bay,"Minister for Community Services) (5.15 p.m.)-The governmentWednesday, 11 November 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 219 The second part of the opposition amendments would add a significant reporting burden to parents by requiring them to notify any changes to their income greater than 15 per cent. Changes would have to be notified on a monthly basis. These amendments would add greatly to the reporting burden of the parents with fluctuating incomes, without benefiting the children. Under the current system patents can choose to notify such changes now. The government believes there is no need for a further parliamentary inquiry into the two particular issues raised by the opposition. I referred earlier to the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues inquiry which was a very comprehensive inquiry and examined these issues with the benefit of public inquiries and the full joint powers of the houses. The government is in the process of responding to those findings and undertaking whatever consultation is necessary to address those sorts of issues. The final issue raised by the honourable member for Lilley was that the government sees no merit in duplicating the existing provisions regarding making false and misleading statements. These sorts of statements are already prohibited and we regard the existing safeguards as effective. The government believes that this bill reflects a balanced approach to the reforms of child support arrangements and we do not support the opposition's amendments. We wish that the bill will have a speedy passage. Amendments negatived. Bill agreed to. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Hon. J.A. Crosio}-The question is that this bill be reported to the House without amendment. Question resolved in the affirmative.

So we come to this debate unfortunately not knowing what wisdom there might have been made available to us had that report actually been published. I commence my remarks about the specifics of this legislation by saying that the approach that we take today will be subject to any necessary adjustment as we view the report of the",180,Representatives Main Committee
261,Mr Kerr (Denison) (5.18 P.m.),"Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. This legislation220 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 11 November 1998 Senate committee. It may well be that it recommends to us amendments that would improve the legislation or require some change to it. There has also been some minor change to the legislation itself in the form in which it was first presented to the House and now comes before us. The change that I have noted in the short time that I have been able to do it is that the period for which the experimental scheme will be operating has been extended from 30 June 2002 to 30 June 2003. Whilst this may be due to delay in the legislation, the scheme will not commence as early in the financial year as might have been hoped and, therefore, one can understand it being extended for an extra year. But I guess it does present a difficulty in that the whole objective of introducing this measure was to provide a pilot so that there could be an assessment of whether or not it was an appropriate vehicle for additional support for funding for the film industry. It would be unfortunate if the process of assessment was delayed past the year 2003. There seems also to be some internal inconsistency because the period for actual fundraising seems to have not been so extended. Clause 14(2) states as follows: The total amount of concessional capital allocated by the Minister to FLIeS to raise on or before 30 June 2000 must not exceed $40 million. So it would assist to identify whether there is intended to be an extension of the period for which capital can be raised, because otherwise it would seem that, whilst the scheme has been notionally extended an additional year, that may be simply to spread the cost to revenue at no additional benefit to film producers, who will be only able to receive funds which have been invested by 30 June 2000. That would not be something that the opposition would regard as an acceptable outcome, so I look forward to the minister's advice in relation to those matters. The Australian film industry has all the appearance at the present time of great strength and so it should because the Australian film industry has been a focus of a long period of strong government attention. Indeed, stemming from the days of John Gorton as Prime Minister, but then particularly through the Hawke and Keating years, Australian film has been a source of great pride to successive governments and investment designed to build an indigenous and strong film industry. A strong film industry represents jobs-and if you look now at film, television and video, there are about 40,000 Australians employed in those cultural industries-and it also gives us a great sense of our own character, as we see material produced which reflects the kind of community we are. It gives us an opportunity not merely to see material from overseas but gives us also an export opportunity as film opens doors for Australia overseas. We have had a number of films which have received international acclaim, not the least being Geoffrey Rush's Oscar for Shine. Actors have starred now through the training they have received in Australia. Most recently LA Confidential had two Australians as its leads. We have seen Australian films such as The Sound of One Hand Clapping explain to Australian communities something of the multicultural experience that many have had in this country, and they have also found a market overseas. Film is a large and important industry. We see it as something which represents more than just jobs but which, at its core, also is an industry for the future. Content is increasingly employing large numbers of Australians and we have an opportunity, if we do not undercut Wednesday, 11 November 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 221 the achievements of the past, to build an industry of substantial national and international importance. Whilst the position looks very strong, whilst we have George Lucas proposing to invest in production of film for the Star Wars series in Sydney, whilst we have the BBC's Channel4 putting independent money into film making, and whilst we have the Fox Studios, we also have the knowledge that, particularly at the developmental end, Australia's industry requires assistance from the community. The Gonski report, which formed the basis of the legislation currently before us, accepts that the market is not such that the community can withdraw and leave the industry to remain sustainable, particularly at the level of development and script, and research and development and that we do need to find innovative ways of raising funding for film. This is particularly important because the current government has withdrawn substantial support from the Australian film industry. The recently released Australian Film Commission survey would highlight what we have achieved. Statistics from the Australian Bureau of Statistics show that Australian audiovisual production is worth about $1.3 billion. Employment figures show stunning growth in different areas of film, video and other audio vision ranging from 35 per cent to nearly 200 per cent. Figures also show that 40,000 people are employed in the industry. Yet, whilst the government claims to foster emerging film-makers and support quality film and television products, they have cut the funding for the Australian Film Finance Corporation, AFFC, by some 24 per cent and further cuts are in store in the forward estimates. The government has also abolished the commercial television production fund. Initially, the government proposed killing off low budget film funding but after a lot of community pressure they were kind enough to reduce the funding by only 50 per cent! I mentioned the special production funding, which is an important area because it is an incubator of talent. It is an investment in people, in projects and in the future, with all the excitement and possibilities of big-time outcomes. The social and cultural benefits w,hich can flow from this kind of investment mean it should not be simply market based. But, since coming to office, the Howard government has cut funding for Australian screen culture by 20 per cent. Forward estimates figures show a further cut of just under 50 per cent by the years 2001 and 2002. The Gonski report, which was the springboard for this legislation, also recommended, as a minimum, three times the funding that the government has seen fit to provide for script development. At a time when our major competitors are gearing up investment in this area, the government has not met that challenge. This particular legislation was put forward initially to replace funding that currently goes to film under section lOBA of the income tax act. Fortunately, the government did not pursue that course and accepted the criticism from the arts community that this should be seen as a trial, to see how effective it is. They have responded to a large number of concerns from the Screen Producers Association of Australia, and others, that this legislation may not succeed in its intentions. I would hate to see either the Film Finance Corporation or section lOBA be reduced in terms of the funding that will go into this industry before we are able to see whether this trial is the success which we hope it to be. Even if it is a success, we would need to continue to have the sources of funding that currently go into Australian film maintained so that we do not have a situation where, having 222 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 11 November 1998 built an industry and having established its framework, we then cut the ground away from those things which enable it to continue to develop, to bring in new talent, to fund low budget productions and the like. It must not be thought that the opposition believes that all film must be funded through public funding. A lot of exciting work is being done, with no subsidy at all. But the Gonski report clearly says to government that market imperfections are such that the industry cannot maintain itself without support. It will fall over. It will not remain strong or maintain the opportunities needed for a growing investment in the future unless we provide funding mechanisms of the kind which are represented by the Film Finance Corporation, section lOBA and, of course, this present trial. There are a couple of issues involved in the trial, and time will tell how successful it will be. It is not exactly what Gonski recommended. Gonski recommended that the tax arrangements should be that you could write off 120 per cent of the investment. He argued that this would be a means of providing an adequate investment framework. The government has chosen not to proceed down that course but rather to set the write-down to 100 per cent. Gonski recommended that there be an adjustment on capital gains so that gains that are acquired from a successful film are not rated back as if the investment were zero in the first place, so that every dollar of gain is subject to capital gains tax. He recommended that it be based on a method that really does respect that there is an element of risk venture in funding film. The government has not seen fit to accommodate that. The Gonski proposal was also expressed in a way which dealt with continuing support for script development and small productions and, as I have mentioned, there have been substantial cuts in funding for that basic infrastructure required by a successful industry. Some concerns have been publicly expressed by those in the industry that this method of seeking investment funds in film from the business community may not be as successful as the government would hope. But there is no reason not to give it a trial. My predecessor, the then shadow Bob McMullan, said that we could support this bill provided it is supplemental to existing funding. I would like assurances from the minister that will condition our response in the Senate. Currently, forward estimates provide that funding for the Australian Film Finance Corporation expires at the end of the current triennium. In order words, it is 'zeroed', in the jargon of the finance bureaucrats, after the current triennium funding is concluded. It is widely thought that the government may review this. I would just like to say that our support for this legislation would be much less conditional if the government would simply say what many expect it to actually do in the future, and that is to say that once that triennium is completed there is an intention to enter into a future funding round for the subsequent triennium. If this is a stalking horse to kill off the funding through the Film Finance Corporation, it is retrograde and inappropriate policy, and it will be a marker for the death of a very substantial part of the Australian indigenous film industry. We do have great challenges. Film is one of those industries which is inherently important because of its localism and the voice it gives to us as Australians, yet that voice is part of an industry which is inherently international. So we are dealing with both of those issues at the same time. Film needs to be diverse; it gives a sense of great pride. Very few Australians would not re-ognise it as part of their cultural traditions now, just as we once might have thought of poetry like The Man from Snowy River. We now value films like Gallipoli and all Wednesday, 11 November 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 223 the films that we have grown up with as part of the Australian experience. To lose that would be to throw out a valued strand of Australian culture. We must not believe that this cannot happen. It has happened before. It happened in Britain during the 1970s, where they became basically a production facility for overseas films. We have to make sure that there is a proper basis for there being a continuing and strong national film industry, recognising that a diversity of sources of funding is necessary for a diverse industry and to give us a community voice, to nourish this, to give Australians a sense of optimism, engagement and excitement, and also to make sure that there is a diversity where governments do not get involved directly in decisions about which films will be made. Far too often we hear voices raised about films being provocative. I know that voices are raised from time to time about Australian films like Head On. It is a provoking film. But it is not, I think, a good thing for governments, when these issues are raised, to in a sense try to dictate the course of the cultural and community responses by using funding mechanisms to deal with these. That is one of the things that is actually good about this particular legislation-that government does not have any direct hands-on in relation to what projects are funded. And this trial means, if it succeeds, that there will be more need than ever for things like the Film Finance Corporation. There are two reasons. One is that the Film Finance Corporation currently asks, as part of its criteria, 'Could this film be funded from commercial sources without government assistance?' So it will sometimes tum down perfectly good proposals because it recognises that they can generate those funds from the market-and why put in public funds in those circumstances? FLICs are market based mechanisms which means that they will fund the sorts of proposals that will l;>e attractive to FLIC investors. You will still need to have something like the Film Finance Corporation to address those proposals which cannot raise funds directly off the commercial market. The other reason is that, of necessity, the focus of these larger film conglomerate investors will be Sydney-Melbourne. Sydney and Melbourne both have the scale to demand the attention of investors and film-makers. But there has been a tremendous amount of very good film generated from South Australia, from Tasmania recently, and from other states and territories. It is important to make sure that there is a mix and diversity of funding sources to ensure that we do not either-as I have indicated could occur-become principally a production house for overseas investors or develop a system of funding which channels money through only established film-makers focused in a couple of the capital cities. Those would be very regressive outcomes and that is why you need a range of different funding methods to ensure diversity. Let me conclude by saying that, when this bill first came before the House of Representatives, the opposition proposed a second reading amendment which indicated that, whilst not declining to give this bill a second reading, we would criticise the government for withdrawing a substantial amount of support for film over the past period of three years. I resile from none of those criticisms. But, in view of the circumstances in which this bill comes before us, and because everyone agrees that we should move forward as quickly as possible to give it passage in a cooperative way, I do not propose to take up time with moving such amendments. The criticism stands and it is self-evident and it ought to be addressed by this government. We will, however, want to have a close look at the Senate report. It may suggest some constructive amendments; it may suggest that we take even further measures; it may suggest 224 MAIN COMMIITEE Wednesday, 11 November 1998 we not support it. We have not seen the Senate report so it would be useful to see it and we would like the minister to give the assurances that I have sought, particularly an assurance as to the ongoing commitment to the Film Finance Corporation which in forward estimates in the budget is not funded past the current triennium. If we felt that this was simply a stalking horse or a device to kill off the Film Finance Corporation, then our attitude would be very different. The whole basis upon which it has our support-and it has been put forward publicly-is that it is a trial supplemental to current funding arrangements which would remain undisturbed. With those remarks I am happy to indicate that we will not oppose this legislation through the House. We look forward to it going to the Senate. We would anticipate that the government cooperate to re-establish a committee to look at it in the Senate but, as there is a report which has basically been drafted and ready for publication, I would anticipate that we could deal with the Senate inquiry in a very expedient way with a very short time required for a report. Once we see that report then, obviously, we can adjust any position as necessary. I thank the chamber for the opportunity to make some remarks in relation to this legislation and hope that the strong work that has gone into building a great Australian film industry is not undermined by meanness of spirit. Strong as the industry currently is, we will fail if we do not recognise that that strength has grown upon a base which, if removed, will eventually cause a corrosion of the spirit, vitality and capacity of the industry to employ Australians .. matter of leftover business from the 38th parliament. On 28 May the predecessor of the member for Denison, in the shadow ministerial role, agreed broadly with the principle of the bill. The then member for Canberra, Bob McMullan, who is now the member for Fraser, made similar points at the time. Essentially, the point I made in rebuttal to those points I will make again: $27 million out, $40 million in. That is what the government has done because this is a vehicle for real investment in a real industry. It is not an industry that is a by-product of some sheltered workshop which seems to be the basis of the Labor Party's argument-that, if you do not have government involved in the constant financing of films and television in this country, it is not going to happen. It is important also to correct a number of the falsehoods from the member for Denison in his contribution today. I am sure that, as he gets the brief of this particular portfolio, he will realise, when he looks back on this speech, that to make a suggestion as regards the Film Finance Corporation being under some sort of threat by this government is to tum your back completely on the central premise of the success of the Film Finance Corporation; and that is that this is a government instrumentality which rightly looks around for success. It views in a professional way, based on both cultural and artistic values, the short films, motion pictures and scripts that are submitted to it, makes suggestions to potential producers and potential recipients of assistance about ways to improve those scripts, and finances them accordingly. It provides seed money, provides incentive, provides a signal to the market that this is a worthwhile project. And guess what? There is great success that comes out of the Film Finance Corporation.

263,Mr Hardgra Ve,"This is a government which rewards success. We are not in theWednesday, 11 November 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 225 to those sorts of projects which have no market value but which have intrinsic cultural and artistic value: it is all about developing an important and growing industry. The member for Denison wants to know why there is not some assurance about the continuation of funding. That is just one of those typical cheap-shot, budgetary, bureaucratic nonsenses that we hear normally in the first year of every government. You are not going to see any line in a budget paper past three years. It is just a simple matter of procedure that there is a zero in the column after the third year. So what? The government is very committed to the Film Finance Corporation because it is successful. It is producing results; it is turning out onto the world stage movies like Shine-which, by the way, is the movie that Geoffrey Rush won the award for-Muriel's Wedding, The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert and Strictly Ballroom, which have all gone on to be huge commercial successes because of the professional people who are involved in the Film Finance Corporation-people who will continue to be encouraged by this government as it seeks excellence in an important industry. The other thing the member for Denison talks about is the Commercial Television Production Fund. Essentially, the premise of what he is saying is that the Labor Party does not want money turned into vital expenditure, such as for the poor and the elderly in my electorate of Moreton; it prefers me to look them in the eye and say, 'No. We're going to give it to Kerry Packer and to Kerry Stokes, because they've got to be able to produce television programs. Never mind the fact that you haven't got enough food; Labor says, ""Let's not give you cake. We'll give you a television program instead.'"" of the day, the government has got a responsibility also to the children of tomorrow to run the economy properly. The other half of the premise that the member for Denison has put in his contribution today is 'Go further into debt. Clock up more money and just throw money at the problem.' If throwing money at a problem had fixed problems, the Keating government would have gone down in history as successful-and, of course, it never shall, unless the Labor Party gets back into the treasury bench and starts handing money out for things like artists-in-residence in trade union movements all around this country so that they can try and organise the cultural history of this nation in some particular way. The other ruse that the member for Denison has offered today is the question of lOBA under the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. Now lOBA stays-and Gonski, in fact, had recommended in his report that you replace lOBA with FLICs. Acting cautiously, in the spirit of being a responsible government, handling the finances of this nation well, as well as encouraging a vital industry like the film and television production industry, the government has said that lOBA stays. At the same time, it has put together the film licence investment company concept to encourage greater investment into this particular sector. If those opposite were truly interested in advancing the cause of television and film production in this country, as we always seem to hear at glitzy, once every three years presentations where they troop out ex-prime ministers-except for the one, Mr Keating, whom they sent off overseas during the most recent election campaign-and if the Labor Party were truly interested in this particular sector, they would not try the constant stunts of delays in the Senate; they would get this bill passed.",186,Representatives Main Committee
264,Mr Kerr,You are a cheapjack.,187,Representatives Main Committee
265,Mr Hardgrave,"The member for Denison can say 'cheap' all he likes; but, at the end226 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 11 November 1998 We have had to bring in a number of amendments relating to the particular dates that this bill will work towards because of those deliberate delays, not based on good policy but just based on cheap politics, in the Senate. The simple amendment we have put forward is that investing capital has to be secured by 30 June 2002. It was 2001. Theparticular film involved has to be completed by 30 April 2003. It was 2002. Essentially, what the government is doing is extending the concept of FLIC by 14 months to accommodate those sorts of delays that I fear the member for Denison, as he learns his portfolio brief, will probably inspire amongst his Senate colleagues. Over time. I am certain that this government will continue to promote the mature growth that we are now starting to experience in this sector. The industry is employing a lot of people; it is making a mark on the world stage. We do not need to go back to the cultural cringe concept of a by-product of a sheltered workshop industry. We need to give it life. We need to give it incentive. This bill, this approach, is an experiment-yes-but it is an experiment worth working for because, after all, what we want to get is those people in Australia, those people in the world who have an interest in earning a dollar out of investing in a worthwhile project, to do so. That is what this bill does and I look forward to further debates with the member for Denison on these matters and others in the future. Mr MeGAURAN (Gippsland-Minister for the Arts and the Centenary of Federation) (5.51 p.m.)-I wish to thank the member for Denison for his cooperation in allowing us to expedite this very important bill, the Film Licensed Investment Company Bill 1998, through the lower House. It is extremely important because we need investment. Under the legislation the investment will now need to be completed by 30 June 2002 instead of an earlier period. The deadline for the completion of films is now 30 April 2003 instead of 30 April 2002, which allows for a more realistic time frame for finalising investment and the completion of projects. I was much inspired"" by the contribution by the member for Moreton. He is a man who has an abiding interest in film and television production and development. I thought he made a most constructive, if at times provocative, contribution. He is a person of strong views. They are ideas and concepts that should be tested against established policy in the best traditions of policy formulation. The member for Denison, having cooperated in the speedy passage of this reintroduced bill, did let himself down a little bit with the hoary old chestnut of 'why don't we make section lOB more attractive by a 120 per cent deduction instead of thecommitment during the last election. It is one of those things that oppositions do, although not in my lifetime, and that is hold out the promise of grand funding without ever committing to paper.

It is most disappointing. That is a scare campaign that does not reflect particularly well on him. who built largely his reputation in that area on film funding, would know the procedure. The Film Finance Corporation has triennial funding and you do not go beyond that' in forward estimates. It is an established budgetary process and practice that extends back decades. The triennial fundingdo I not, Madam Deputy Speaker, move quickly to a conclusion? Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER ( Mrs De-Anne KeIly)-1 say to the honourable member for Denison: you were listened to with great courtesy by other members; please extend that to the minister. funding locked in at over $48 million a year until the year 2000-2001; it has triennial funding which obviously allows the government flexibility in setting levels in response to industry needs. The Australian Film Commission funding is stabilised and the government has asked the APC to investigate ways to redirect funding to the important area of script development and the industry is in very good health. As I said in my second reading speech in another place, earlier today, and I quote exactly again so there will be no misunderstanding or misinterpretation by my opposite number: The FLIC does not replace any existing funding for the industry, rather it will complement those programs. The government recognises the vulnerabili,ty of the industry, especially for some of the most culturally sensitive genres, and the need for certainty for investors and producers alike. Forward funding for the Australian Film Commission and the Australian Film Finance Corporation was confirmed in the 1997-98 budget, and the continuation of film agencies was confirmed in the government's response to Mr Gonski's report in November 1997. I hope that settles the matter once and for all for the shadow minister and We can unite in promoting a vital, social, cultural and financial industry in Australia.

278,Mr Lee (Dobell) (6.00 P.m.),"For the 3.2 million individual students at Australian schoolsWednesday, 11 November 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 229 these reasons, this bilI, which allocates federal funding to primary and secondary schools throughout the country, is a very important piece of legislation. In many ways this legislation seeks to give effect to decisions that were announced in the 1998 budget. Some of this legislation was introduced into the House of Representatives on 25 June 1998 and it is quite disturbing that, with a few weeks to go before the end of this calendar year, this parliament is debating how much money should be allocated to schools from 1 January next year. I might be showing my age. When I was first elected to this parliament, after the budget was read out by the Treasurer on budget night, a series of ministers would stand in the House of Representatives and introduce all of the budget bills. All of the budget bills for funding schools would be introduced on budget night. The minister for education would stand up on budget night in the House of Representatives and introduce the bills that funded various payments. Certainly the Treasurer would introduce bills that would implement changes in various payments and vario'us decisions that had been made by the government. Yet here we are, a few weeks before these bills need to actually provide the funds to our schools, trying to get them through this parliament in a very speedy manner. I will say a bit more about the government's attempts to have these pieces of legislation passed through quickly in the discussion about the next piece of legislation. There are perhaps a few issues that need to be dealt with on this piece of legislation. It provides $40.2 million to extend the National Asian Languages and Studies in Australian Schools Program through to the end of 1999. This program was an initiative commenced by the former federal Labor government in 1994. This might be an opportunity to place on record the great debt which is owed to the former Queensland Premier Wayne Goss for this program being introduced by the former Labor government. I should also place on record the role played by the newly elected member for Griffith, Kevin Rudd, as the then head of the cabinet office of the Goss Labor government. He played a very important role in making sure that this National Asian Languages and Studies in Australian Schools Program was initiated by that former Labor government. A few questions have arisen because of various promises that were made by the coalition before the last election. The Howard-Fischer government gave a promise in the last election campaign in its election policy-and I draw it to the attention of the parliamentary secretary in particular. At the last election her party promised to: Provide an additional $90 million over three years for the National Asian Languages and Studies in Australian Schools Strategy. In the education policy that the Liberal Party launched during the election they promised an additional $90 million over three years. This piece of legislation provides $40 million for 1999. What we would like to know in the parliamentary secretary's summing up is whether this $40 million is part of the $90 million that was promised in that election policy. We would also like to know what that promise of an additional $90 million over three years really means for the program. Does it mean that it is $90 million on top of the annual amounts that were paid over the last three years, for which there is no funding in the next few years, or does it mean that the $40 million in this piece of legislation leaves us with a balance of $50 million for the next two years for this excellent program? Perhaps the parliamentary secretary might like to make some inquiries about that. We would be very interested in any response which she can provide 230 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 11 November 1998 today on the future of the National Asian Languages and Studies in Australian Schools Strategy. The other point is that this piece of legislation also provides $20 million for the so-called full service schools initiative which is, according to the government, meant to provide compensation to schools to help them cope with the influx of additional students which will inevitably occur because of the changes that this government is making to youth allowance. We know that the government postponed the date for that and that 1 January will be the date on which 16and 17-year-olds will transfer from the youth training allowance to the new youth allowance. It means that there will be a large number of 16and 17-year-olds who will be expected to attend senior secondary school because of the policy changes that the government has made. The concern I have is with the impact that this will have on those schools. What will be the impact of this policy change on the resource needs of secondary schools across Australia? The government says it is providing an extra $20 million to compensate schools for these changes and yet it is now public knowledge that the minister's own department prepared a cabinet submission recommending an additional expenditure of $140 million to help schools cope with the influx of students as a result of the youth allowance changes. Quite clearly, if the minister believed the cabinet submission that was prepared by his department, this package falls short by $100 million. I can also make it clear that the government claimed that it would be putting $20 million into two other programs-$13.5 million for the Jobs Pathway Program and $6.2 million for the New Apprenticeships Access Program. Madam Deputy Speaker, I am sure you are aware that the former Labor government initiated those two particular programs. We established the Jobs Pathway Guarantee.and the Pre-Vocational Places Program, which was simply rebadged and renamed the New Apprenticeships Access Program. Labor certainly believes that there will be a need to put extra resources into secondary schools, if the government increases the number of students attending schools. The other disappointment is that the government has not been prepared to take note of another recommendation which was made by the minister's department in that cabinet submission. The submission recommended that the government 'resuscitate' the Students at Risk Program. That program tried to identify those students that were at risk of leaving school early. Funding for that program ran out in late 1996. It is quite clear that this minister for education intends to ignore the recommendation in his department's draft submission that the program be resuscitated. That was an excellent program and I am disappointed that the government has not been prepared to take account of the very careful views-I am sure-that have come through his own department in the preparation of that draft cabinet submission. We are concerned that up to 27,00016and 17-year-olds will be returning to school next year due to the government's policy changes on youth allowance. These young people will need special help with literacy and numeracy programs. In many cases what they will need will amount to individual case management. That is not only to make sure that they get the full benefit of attending classes at school every day, but also to make sure that other students are not receiving a lower quality of education because of the increase in the number of students attending schools. There are a whole series of issues that arise as a result of the changes that this government is making to youth allowance. Wednesday, 11 November 1998 MAIN COMMITIEE 231 In many cases what they will need will amount to individual case management. That is not only to make sure that they get the full benefit of attending classes at school every day but also to make sure that other students are not receiving a lower quality education because of the increase in the number of students attending schools. There is a whole series of issues that arise as a result of the changes that this government is making to youth allowance. The young people affected by this policy change are heavily concentrated in areas of high unemployment. I will quickly run through a few examples from my own state of New South Wales. If you look at the postcodes of those people who are currently receiving youth training allowance, it is clear that you could have, for example, 28016and 17-year-olds in the Mount Druitt area returning to school or 220 in Campbelltown or 160 at Liverpool or 120 at Lake Illawarra or 127 in Gosford, in my electorate. But there are only three in places like Manly. The postcode information indicates that there is only one 16or 17-year-old receiving youth training allowance in Cammeray and only one in Killara. It is quite clear that the schoois in the areas that have the highest rates of youth unemployment are going to be the schools that are hardest hit by this government's policy changes. They should be the schools that are receiving the extra $140 million that the minister's own department recommended should be provided to secondary schools to cope with the changes that result from the new youth allowance. It is quite clear that these are the schools that need the extra help that is being denied by this government. These are not just the views of the Labor Party. If you look carefully at the views that were expressed by the former coalition minister for education in Queensland, it was certainly that minister's view that an extra $7,000 per student should be provided to make sure that a quality education is being provided to each of those additional students. The additional federal funding that flows to those government schools in Queensland only amounts to one-tenth of that amount. So, while the students are returning to schools in areas of high unemployment, the federal government is only providing one-tenth of the recurrent funding that is needed to provide the quality education for those students. It is clear that this title 'full service schools' is inappropriate. It is typical of the overblown rhetoric that we have come to expect from this minister, with reality falling far short of the promises made in his own words. Steering committees have been set up in each state to take submissions for funding for these amounts that have been provided to full service schools. Quite a few principals have already told me that there are schools that have not even bothered to lodge submissions because they are so disheartened by the quantum of funds which is available. This bill also provides funding for flexibility of funding allocations under the literacy and country areas program, so that the most recent ABS census data can be used for determining relative need. The bill also inserts amounts for capital funding for non-government schools up to 2003. It only provides $74 million each year from 2000. This amount declines from $84.6 million in 1999 and is $40 million less than the $113 million provided by the Labor government in 1996 for non-government schools capital funding. So, at a time of growing capital needs in the non-government sector, it would be interesting if the parliamentary secretary could get the minister to justify these continuing cuts to nongovernment capital funding. I would be very interested in any comments the parliamentary secretary had on that as well. 232 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 11 November 1998 The amounts provided for recurrent and capital expenditure for 1997 and subsequent years are adjusted by this bill for the most recent rounds of supplementation. This minister has a history of incorporating nominal increases for supplementation as part of his attempts to distort the schools funding figures to claim credit for non-existent increases. The minister has a habit of making year-on-year comparisons between funding sums that are not in real terms. Any discussion about school funding cannot pass without some mention of the enrolment benchmark adjustment. In 1997, almost every state and territory increased its enrolments in government schools. Yet every state except Tasmania was subject to the EBA. For enrolling 8,495 extra students, government schools lost $11.9 million through this coalition policy. This equates to a loss of $1,813 for every government school in Australia. The former schools minister said in a media release on 24 May, 'Any suggestion that the government has decreased funding to government schools is wrong.' The minister should explain how giving schools less money for more students is not decreasing funding. While the opposition is not opposing this bill, we have serious concerns about the direction of schools policy under the coalition and under this minister. I notice Bruce Juddery, I think in the Australian, had an article drawing to everyone's attention the fact that, under the changes the Prime Minister has made to the education policy, Dr Kemp, the minister for education, has had his portfolio responsibilities halved. In most circumstances, having a minister solely concerned with education might be considered a plus. Mr Juddery made reference to the fact that usually this would be seen as recognition that the government finally is giving education the sort of priority it deserves. But when that minister is David Kemp, when that minister is the current minister for education with his well-known ideological obsessions, with his well-known track record of distorting facts and manipulating figures, with his record as the father of the Job Network disaster, this change-that he is now going to focus and give all of his energy to education-could bode ill for this portfolio for a number of years to come. I formally move the following amendment to the motion for the second reading: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: 'whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House condemns the government for damaging Australia's schools, including by failing to provide them with adequate resources to cope with the expected increase of up to 27,000 students a year as a result of the introduction of the youth allowance.' We believe that the federal government should be providing the extra $140 million a year that the department of education's draft cabinet submission recommended. We believe that all students will suffer because this government has not been prepared to put the extra funding into schools that is required to meet the extra needs, the extra demand, that will follow as a result of the changes that this government is making in youth allowance policy. We believe that every Australian student, wherever they live and whatever their family circumstances, is entitled to the best possible start in life. These changes and the other funding cuts that this government has made to education do not guarantee that every Australian student gets that best start in life. They are the issues that we will be raising in future debates on education. . Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER ( Mrs De-Anne Kelly)-Is the amendment seconded?",190,Representatives Main Commi Itee
279,Mr Sercombe,"I second the amendment.Wednesday, 11 November 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 233 Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill 1998. The purpose of this bill is to give effect to the initiative announced in the 1998-99 federal budget. Standing here today, I guess it feels like an eternity has passed since the 1998-99 budget was handed down. It was an important budget in that it was a budget that saw the Australian economy go back in the black and back on track. Today we are dealing with a small but important part of that budget-namely, the introduction of full service schools over three years and the extension of the National Asian Language and Studies in Australian Schools Strategy. The government is providing an additional $40.2 million over two years from 1998 to support, enhance and expand Asian languages and studies through our school system. It is a very positive decision and one that I welcome. I also acknowledge the opposition's support for this extension. I recall speaking on the 1996 states grants bill for primary and secondary education. At that time the Asian economic crisis was still far from the front pages of the national newspapers. Indeed, many strategic analysts were publicly saying that the outlook for the Asia-Pacific had never looked so secure. We live in a very different region economically from that of two years ago. While Australia has weathered the Asian economic crisis well, many of our regional neighbours have not. This, however, does not diminish the importance of the Asia-Pacific area to Australia. Countries like Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and China all remain very important trading markets for Australian exporters, and particularly so for North Queensland exporters. While the Asian economic crisis has in many ways hampered trade in our region-and in your region, too, Madam Deputy Speaker-it has also created many new opportunities for Australia. The economic potential of the Asia-Pacific region is still very significant. We should not close our doors to those opportunities. I said in this place two years ago that exporters in Townsville and in North Queensland should be doing everything they can to try to break into those new and emerging market opportunities. We, after all, are on the doorstep of the Asia-Pacific region. The $40 million expansion of the NALSAS strategy is a positive step towards preparing now for Australia's greater economic involvement and engagement in the Asia-Pacific region in the future. As I said earlier, the other major points that this bill deals with are the measures to provide $20 million over three years for schools to develop programs and innovative services to address the special needs of young people who are at risk of not completing year 12. I think that the Deputy Prime Minister summed up the youth allowance very well when he said that it was not about putting the unemployed dowri but, rather, about bringing students up. I acknowledge that there have been some problems ·with the introduction of the youth allowance. With any social reform of this size, there always is. But overall, and particularly in my area, it has been widely welcomed. The goals of the youth allowance remain clear: bring students up; give them incentives to stay in schools; provide them with the same level of financial support as we give to the unemployed; and provide adequate traineeship and apprenticeship opportunities for those who do not choose higher education. One of the intended effects of the youth allowance was to encourage students to complete their secondary education. I quote from the honourable member for Goldstein's second reading speech:",194,Representatives Main Committee
280,Mr Lindsay (Herbert) (6.18 P.m.),"I appreciate the opportunity to speak on the States234 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 11 November 1998 In recogmtlOn of the possible additional costs associated with these high needs students, the Commonwealth has established the full service schools program. The full service schools program is intended to provide supplementary assistance to schools to enable them to effectively meet the needs of students who are likely to return to or remain at school. It will also build on the range of other initiatives that the government has already put in place. A result of part of the funding in this bill tonight was seen at an opening in my electorate today at St Anthony's School, Deeragun. It was unfortunate that I was unable to attend that particular opening, because we are here in Canberra, but money that is being provided in the budget will affect that school in the Catholic system in my electorate of Herbert. I am pleased to support this bill, and I recommend that it obtain the support of the parliament. Ms WORTH (Adelaide-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs) (6.24 p.m.)-I would like to thank the members who have taken part in this debate, the member for Dobell and the member for Herbert. I will perhaps enlighten the member for Dobell on a couple of issues which he raised. I inform him that direct funding to government schools has in fact risen by $200 million since 1996. I further inform him that the minister is the minister not only for education but also for training and youth affairs, very important areas not only for those undertaking formal schooling and higher education but for those who are training for skills they are going to need in the future. The youth affairs portfolio is very important, and anyone of us who can raise the image of young Australians is playing an important role. The member for Dobell raised issues of promised funding -f $90 million in the election campaign, and I have to inform him that the government will need to give detailed consideration to election promised funds in the normal budget process and find out the best ways of spending that money. He also raised issues about the $21 million and whether in fact this was going to be adequate funding for the full service for schools program. Of course, this $21 million is intended to provide supplementary assistance to schools to enable them to effectively meet the needs of students who are likely to return to or remain at school, and it will build on a wide range of programs and initiatives that are already in place. I remind the member for Dobell that not all students returning to or remaining at schools will require special assistance and services. Many will be catered for by the normal funding arrangements. All students who return to or remain at school will attract general recurrent funding at an amount per student in accordance with government policy. Of course, the needs of students for physical facilities will be taken into account in the assessment for capital funding under the Capital Grants Program. These students may also be eligible to access other special purposes and targeted program funding provided to state and territory education authorities by the Commonwealth. The member for Herbert mentioned the Youth Allowance Scheme which began on 1 July 1998. Despite attacks from the opposition, this really is a major social policy reform because it provides financial incentives for young people to develop skills that they really do desperately need to improve their chances of finding a job. There has been a lack of balance and fairness between students who were tempted to leave school at a vulnerable age so that they could collect unemployment benefits and those who continued to study and had to work that much harder for it; although at the same time bettering themselves, they were, by Wednesday, 11 November 1998 MAIN COMMI'ITEE 235 comparison, being financially disadvantaged. I commend the member for Herbert for raising these issues. Again, I thank everyone who has taken part in the debate and commend the bill to the parliament.

In some ways education is both an inspirational and a depressing portfolio, and it is still inspirational and depressing with you, Mr Deputy Speaker, in the chair as well. It is inspirational because of the importance of education. from early childhood to school, to vocational education, to university, in shaping our society, our nation and our economy. Education is an inspirational portfolio because education is about our future and our ability to shape that future for our children and ourselves. Our primary schools playa vital role in teaching our young children about working, learning and playing together, as well as laying the foundations for a life of learning.

281,Mr Lee (Dobell) (6.31 P.m.),"Kim Beazley wants to be known as the education Prime236 MAIN COMMITIEE Wednesday, 11 November 1998 goals and give them the tools to pursue them. Vocational educational colleges help develop those skills for younger Australians to equip them for their careers. Universities push our best students to academic excellence and prepare our next generation of teachers, engineers, scientists, doctors, lawyers, and even politicians. They extend our knowledge of the physical and social world in which we live and, through research, contribute to improving our health, our society and the growth and future of our economy and our nation. Education is not a once-only process which finishes at 25. More and more Australians are going back to university or their local TAFE college or adult education centre to broaden their education, to improve their chances of promotion, or to completely change their careers. To foster an Australian culture of lifelong learning is one of the great challenges facing Australia now. Education is an inspirational portfolio because of the phenomenal success of Australia's educational institutions in exporting their expertise and attracting very large numbers of overseas students. Australia's education exports now contribute more than $3 billion to our economy. It is hard to think of a more important area in deciding the kind of Australia in which we want to live. Unfortunately, education is also, sadly, a depressing portfolio because of the untold damage that is being done to our schools and universities, our teachers and our students, by the coalition government through the slashing of funding to schools and universities, the massive barrier of doubled HECS fees driving down university applications, and the looming spectre of the GST adding to the cost of books, software, the Internet, food, clothing, public transport-for teachers and students alike. It will be increasingly difficult to maintain the clever country with such stupid government decisions as these. I said during the last debate that I would make a few remarks about the processes that have been involved in dealing with this particular bill. Governments and oppositions, of course, do not always agree and there will be occasions when there are differences on issues in this portfolio. But you would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, that this parliament only works through the cooperation of both sides of politics in making sure we have a common sense attitude to the way legislation is dealt with in this parliament. I learnt from the former member for New England on several occasions that an effective opposition can bring the parliament to a halt. If oppositions want to and if they are effective they can make it almost impossible for governments to have legislation pass through this parliament. Thankfully, there are very few occasions when oppositions seek, or are forced, to use the standing orders to that extent. The point I am trying to make is that I have taken over this responsibility in education with the intention of trying to work constructively with the government and to work in a way that allows proper consideration of legislation in the parliament. We will not seek to unnecessarily delay the passage of legislation but we do believe that important pieces of legislation are entitled to have a fair amount of time for consideration in this parliament. We do not believe that this has been the case with the piece of legislation which we are debating this afternoon. It is true that part of this piece of legislation was dealt with by the previous parliament but was not passed by both houses of the parliament; that is why it is back here. It is also true that part of this legislation was introduced only into the House of Representatives and that it did not have a reasonable opportunity to be debated. Even if we allow for the fact that the government introduced both halves of this bill into the last parliament, it has made changes in bringing those two pieces of legislation together into a new bill, and that should allow the opposition in the Australian parliament a chance to consider the changes that the government Wednesday, 11 November 1998 MAIN COMMITIEE 237 has made in this new piece of legislation. It has redrafted two pieces of legislation into one new, consolidated piece. The opposition was only given a draft copy of the legislation less than 24 hours ago. We had a party meeting on Tuesday. We were given a draft copy of the legislation on Tuesday afternoon after our parliamentary party had finished its meeting. There was no opportunity for me and my staff to give proper consideration to this piece of legislation, to take a recommendation to the shadow ministry, let alone to give the members of the parliamentary Labor Party and the caucus committee an opportunity to consider this before going to the full party meeting. I would like to use this opportunity to say that our cooperation on future pieces of legislation on education is conditional upon the minister and the parliamentary secretary-I know she does not have full control over all of these issues-giving us sufficient time to take pieces of legislation to the shadow ministry, our parliamentary party committees and the Labor parliamentary party's caucus meetings. If the government is not prepared to give us sufficient time to allow our members to consider this legislation, then the government is on notice today that we will use the standing orders of the parliament to give the parliament a right to consider legislation in a proper manner. The reason we have not done that today is that we know there are a number of institutions that will need the money on 1 January. So we are going to allow this legislation to pass, even though there has not been sufficient opportunity to consider the legislation today. I repeat once again to the parliamentary secretary, and through her to the minister, that this is the last occasion on which we will allow the government to steamroll legislation on education through this parliament without there being sufficient and fair opportunity for the party that got 51 per cent of the two-party preferred vote to consider the Howard government's intentions. Having mentioned that we had less than 24 hours to consider the draft legislation, I would also point out that late last night we were given a further government amendment, which makes the sins of omission even worse--added to by a sin of commission, I suspect. Either way, we will not be allowing the government to treat the parliament with such contempt in future on education. In many ways, this is a very bad start for dealing with legislation on education, and we can only hope that the government gets its act together in future. It is pretty rough to be forcing two such vitally important education bills through the House without any meaningful debate. If the government had had the courage to legislate its funding cuts when they were first announced in 1996 in tertiary education, or in 1997, or even in early 1998, then we would not be faced with the ridiculous situation now where we will be forced to pass this bill almost without debate six weeks before university funding runs out completely. The minister should have had plenty of time to concentrate on education now that his portfolio responsibilities have been halved, but he has not done too well on this first test. We believe that this is an issue that requires more attention in future. Before the 1996 election the member for Bennelong, the Prime Minister of Australia, said the following: A Howard government will maintain levels of funding to universities in terms of operating grants. The main provision of this bill is to belatedly legislate the government's massive cuts of $840 million to Australia's universities. These cuts correspond to a loss of 21,000 university places. How can we be a clever country when there are such stupid government decisions? The 238 MAIN COMMI1TEE Wednesday, 11 November 1998 government announced these massive cuts more than two years ago but it is not until now, with less than two months to go before the money runs out, that the government has finally gotten around to legislating them. Australia's universities have been on death row for more than two years but it is only with the passage of this bill that we actually see Dr Kemp take them out and shoot them. In 1999, university operating grants will fall by $590 million. In the year 2000 they are slashed by a further $140 million to a level $730 million below their funding level in 1998. This highlights the tragic, downward trend as the government fails to realise the importance of higher education to individuals and to the nation, and it demonstrates it is treating education simply as a cost to the budget which must be reduced, however possible. The government will no doubt trumpet the fact that this bill ·restores funding for the 450 places it cut at James Cook University. It would have been interesting if the member for Herbert were still in the Main Committee to respond to these remarks. Whilst the restoration of those places at James Cook University is very welcome, vie would like to ask the government when it intends to restore the rest of the 21,000 places that the Howard government has cut from Australia's 37 other universities in other less marginal and safe seats. CouldI also point out that if the member for Herbert had been here I would have asked him to explain to us what the government's plans are for the future medical school at James Cook University. During the election campaign he and I exchanged press releases on the future medical school at Townsville. I was certainly very proud to have stood with my former colleague the Hon. Ted Lindsay-unfortunately, the unsuccessful Labor candidate in Herbert at the last election-when we announced that the Labor Party intended to put funding in to establish that medical school at James Cook University. We also went as far as to promise that as soon as accreditation was received by the Australian Medical Council we would allow that medical school to be run by James Cook University. I did say at the time that if the Prime Minister matched our promise I would be the first person to welcome that. Therefore, I was pleased to acknowledge that during the election campaign the Prime Minister also agreed to match the Labor Party's initiative in putting the funding into James Cook University. That was a bit of a change from 1996 when the then Liberal candidate for Herbert, Mr Peter Lindsay, said that it was impractical to have James Cook University establish a medical school. We are pleased that the current member for Herbert is no longer criticising such a policy. In fact, he is now embracing it as his own. The question I have for the government, and also for the member for Herbert if he cares to raise this matter in an adjournment or in this chamber at a future time, is: what is happening with the progression of the establishment and funding for that new medical school at James Cook University? I have heard a rumour-and I would be grateful if the parliamentary secretary or the member for Herbert could confirm this rumour-that there was to be a meeting in Queensland to discuss this very issue about the future of the medical school in Townsville and that it was expected that the federal department of health and the federal department of education would both be represented there. This was to happen shortly after the election. The rumour I have heard is that while the federal department of health was willing to attend that meeting, the federal department of education said that unfortunately they had been instructed not to attend the meeting to discuss the future of that medical school at James Cook University because they had to brief their new minister. Wednesday, 11 November 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 239 The only problem was that the· new minister is the old minister. The only change in this minister's portfolio responsibilities was that he had his workload halved. Yet this is used as some excuse as to why his department was unable to receive instructions to attend this meeting in Queensland to, hopefully, expedite the future of that medical school. Far be it from me to believe every rumour I hear, but perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs could make some inquiries and tell us whether it is correct that her departmental officers cancelled their attendance at that meeting, which forced the collapse of the meeting, which resulted in a further delay in progressing the establishment of that new medical school at Townsville. The effects of the massive cuts to university funding have already been felt across the country. In New South Wales 1,285 places were lost at Sydney University, 950 places were lost at the University of New South Wales and, much closer to my home, 655 places were lost at the University of Newcastle, which affects the Ourimbah campus in my own electorate. I intend, as member for Dobell as well as the Labor Party spokesman on education, to keep raising in every possible forum the need for additional federal funding for additional places at the Ourimbah campus of the University of Newcastle. Students who live on the Central Coast have very low post-secondary participation rates, very low tertiary education participation rates, and it will be only through an expansion of the number of places at the Ourimbah campus that we can make sure that more students on the Central Coast have a chance to complete tertiary studies. Universities across Australia have been forced to cut the range of courses that they are offering. For example, the University of New South Wales has been forced to close its St George campus and its teacher education facilities. At Monash there has been a loss of 120 staff from the arts faculty and the closure of the classics department. In the Northern Territory there has been the closure of the English department, I understand, and at the Sydney University of Technology there have been job losses in nursing, humanities and social sciences. I was interested to read in the minister's second reading speech the following statement: The government also recognises that collaboration between universities and industry is critical to expanding our knowledge base and generating wealth. By providing enhanced opportunities for university researchers and research training students to collaborate with the industry, Australia will be better able to position itself in the global knowledge market. The problem is that this government have introduced funding cuts that have decimated research in Australia. Not only have they cut back funding for universities; they abolished the tax concessions for research and development for the private sector. And changes in industry policy, for example, in pharmaceutical manufacturing, have meant that companies are receiving less incentive to carry out research and development in Australia. I suggest that the minister needs to look very closely at the policies of his own government if he believes that there was any basis to believe that there is an increase in research as a result of this government's policies. In international marketing and promotion, this bill also highlights the government's failure of commitment in relation to education exports. Two-thirds of the $21 million promised by the minister for the new Australian education international marketing body have simply been cut from existing programs. The Howard government is clearly failing to recognise the importance of the education export industry, which generates more than $3 billion a year for Australia. 240 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 11 November 1998 The bill also contains funding for open learning organisations in 1999 and 2000. Open learning has been seriously damaged by this government, in deregulating fees for open learning but failing to match those changes with changes to the open learning deferred payment scheme. By increasing the fees but not increasing the capacity of students to defer payment of those fees, the government has placed a substantial financial barrier in front of prospective open learning students. The bill also alters estimates for special capital projects, various grants programs, superannuation and teaching hospitals, in line with government estimates of relevant inflation rates. In relation to these matters, I can only say the opposition is delighted that the minister seems so far to have left them mostly alone. There are two final issues I would like to raise. First of all, I want to raise the matter of HECS. Before the 1996 election, John Howard promised he would 'ensure that all individuals have a fair and equitable opportunity to benefit from a higher education'. Three years later the government's HECS changes and cuts to university operating grants mean that Australian students h-ve to pay twice as much for their opportunity to get access to fewer places. HECS charges have increased by up to 125 per cent under this government and students are being forced to repay thadebt long before they achieve a salary close to average weekly earnings. In 1997, HECS for arts, humanities, social studies, performing arts, education, nursing and legal studies went up by 35 per cent; HECS for mathematics, science, engineering, computing, health sciences, agriculture, architecture, business and economics went up by 92 per cent; HECS for law, medicine, dentistry and veterinary science we.nt up by 125 per cent. I know that veterinary science would be an issue of concern to you in particular, Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl. It went up by 125 per cent. The tragedy of these mean-spirited and narrow-minded cuts is that they have had a dramatic impact in discouraging potential students from applying to go to university. The Howard government has raised a massive financial barrier to tertiary education, which is discouraging students, especially those from low-income backgrounds, who are far more likely to be wary of accumulating large debts. Finally, the GST will increase the cost of food, books, public transport, software and Internet usage for all students, including higher education students, many of whom are on very low incomes. Books have never been taxed before in Australia, and this government's policy to introduce a GST on books is another win for mindless market ideology over common sense. Schools, TAPEs and universities will be faced with a massive administrative burden. They will have to pay the GST on the goods and services. which they used to be able to purchase sales tax exempt, and then they will have to fill out mountains of paperwork to claim back the money they should never have paid. For these reasons, we will not be opposing the legislation, but I move the following amendment to the second reading motion: That all words after 'that' be omitted, with a view to substituting the following words: 'whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House condemns the government for damaging Australia's vitally important higher education system by: (1) slashing funding to Australian universities reSUlting in 21,000 fewer student places; and (2) driving down University application rates by 3.3% in 1997 and a further 3.1% in 1998 by increasing HECS charges and lowering the repayment threshold'.",197,Representatives Main Commi Itee
282,Mr Deputy Speaker,"Is the amendment seconded?Wednesday, 11 November 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 241 to endorse all of the words spoken by my colleague the shadow minister, thereby obviating the need for me to say a lot. But I do want to make a very quick reference to the Northern Territory University. The fact is that when I was first elected to this place in 1987, on the first occasion, we fought to have the Northern Territory University properly funded by the federal government. It took some time because of the recalcitrants in the CLP in the Northern Territory and their attitude towards it. But nevertheless it happened. But, since the election of the first Howard government, we have seen the Northern Territory University lose about 20 per cent of its funding. We have seen enrolments fall by 14 per cent, the largest fall of any university in Australia. There appears to be a direct correlation between the funding and the provision of resources and courses. The Northern Territory University no longer offers courses in English, ceramics, sculpture or cartography. A university not offering English! I ask you, Mr Deputy Speaker: is that reasonable in this day and age as we approach the centenary of our federation, in a community where multiculturalism is so important to us, in a community where English is so important to us? The Northern Territory University has lost 70 staff through rationalisation, 15 of these through involuntary redundancy, which has caused great angst and cost a lot of money. There is now increased pressure on research staff to support new structures at the expense of research activities. Despite the efforts of local business, the funding gaps left as a result of the malicious policies of the Howard government will not be retrieved by the support of local enterprise; that will only come from government. Ms WORTH (Adelaide-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs) (6.55 p.m.)-I will respond briefly to some of the comments made by the member for Dobell. I am pleased, first of all, to hear him say that he will work constructively with the governmentleads me to some explanations. Perhaps it was because he was concentrating on the health portfolio that he was unaware that the main measures of this bill were introduced and passed through the House in 1997 but did not pass the Senate. Other measures wer!! introduced into the House on 1 July 1998 but have lapsed. The only new measures in this bill are the funding for Notre Dame University, which was agreed to in writing. I have here a copy of the letter from the Leader of the Opposition dated June 1998. The only other additional measures coming out of election promises were the funding for James Cook University and the strategic partnership industry training scheme, with additional funding through to 2000. There are no other new measures in this at all. I am sure that the member for Dobell will become better acquainted with his shadow portfolio as time goes by. In response to his stories about rumours about meetings being held and which department officials would be there, it is my understanding that the meeting was only rescheduled and that it will take place very shortly, with the involvement of my department as well as that of the officers of the Department of Health and Aged Care.",202,Representatives Main Commitiee

I present the signed explanatory memorandum. The amendment is required because of a drafting error. The amendment will ensure that the University of Notre Dame Australia will receive funding for operating purposes, under section 15 of the Higher Education Funding Act 1988, for its Broome campus, rather than under section 16 for limited operating purposes. The amendment will have the effect of providing the university with triennial funding as opposed to annual funding and will provide a capital roll-in and research quantum component in the university's operating grant as well as enable the university to seek funding under the capital development pool for major building works. This is consistent with the government's intention to provide a stable funding base for the university's Broome campus in recognition of the significant role that the university plays in that region.
