Education citizens of the Commonwealth petitions showing that (a) the Commonwealth Parliament has acted to remove some inadequacies in the Australian education system; (b) a major inadequacy at present in Australian education is the lack of equal education opportunity for all; (c) more than 500,000 children suffer from serious lack of equal opportunity; (d) Australia cannot afford to waste the talents of one-sixth of its school children; (e) only the Commonwealth has the financial resources for special programmes to remove inequalities; and (f) nations such as the United Kingdom and the United States have shown that the chief impetus for change and the finance for improvement come from the national Government. The petitioners pray that the House make legal provision for (1) a joint Commonwealth-State inquiry into inequalities in Australian education to obtain evidence on which to base long term national programmes for the elimination of inequalities; (2) the immediate financing of special programmes for low income earners, migrants, Aboriginals, rural and inner suburban dwellers and handicapped children; and (3) the provision of pre-school opportunities for all children from culturally different or socially and economically disadvantaged backgrounds.

Petition received. to the Minister for Health. Is it true that the Department of Health is preparing a large scale leaflet campaign to explain the Government's health scheme? If so, is it intended to send leaflets to more than 4 million Australians? Would a campaign of this nature cost at least $300,000 to prepare and complete? If that is correct, how can such spending be justified when there is a critical shortage of hospitals? Would the cost of such a campaign provide substantial additional hospital accommodation for the Australian Capital Territory? ment 1 made to the House early in March and in my second reading speech on the National Health Bill, it is the view of the Government that, for the common fee system to work, it is vitally important that everybody have a knowledge not only of the common fees themselves but of the way in which the system works. As I pointed out then, it is intended that there will be a very widespread publicity campaign to ensure that the level of understanding of the system by the public is as high as possible. I would make the point in relation to the remainder of the honourable gentleman's question lhat the benefits which will be obtained by the public, when the new health benefits plan is operating, will be immeasurthe actual cost of rubbish disposal at the able, and in order of importance this is very much greater and has a very much higher priority than the matters which the honourable member chose to raise. ask a question of the Minister for Health. Is it a fact, as alleged recently by the Victorian Graziers Association, that in August 1969 a report on tenders for incinerators called by the Melbourne Harbour Trust was submitted to the Commonwealth Department of Health and that a particular tender was recommended for acceptance? Is it also a fact, as alleged by the Victorian Graziers Association, that the Department of Health has informed the Melbourne Harbour Trust that an incinerator of only half the size need be constructed if the garbage is sorted before being placed in the incinerator, a process thought by many to be either very difficult or virtually, impossible? As this haggling between the Commonwealth Government, the State Government and the Melbourne Harbour Trust has been going on for at least the last decade, can the Minister do anything to break this deadlock, decide who is legally responsible for disposal of ships' refuse and get the incinerators built before there is an outbreak of some exotic disease brought in by ships' refuse? ties with the State of Victoria in regard to an incinerator in Melbourne. I would not say that the honourable gentleman was right in claiming that this has been going on for a decade. In fact, the Commonwealth made an offer to, the States in 1966 to provide the full capital costs of building incinerators at ports around Australia as a measure to reduce the risk of an exotic disease coming into Australia. This offer was accepted by most States as a generous offer and, as a result, incinerators have steadily been built around the Australian coast. Victoria did not accept the Commonwealth's offer and it has not yet done so. Victoria claimed that it was the Commonwealth's responsibility both to maintain and run the incinerators and to meet their replacement costs. The Commonwealth has argued-and this has been accepted by most of the other States-that traditionally ports has been a matter for the port authorities and that in any case it should not be a charge on State or Commonwealth funds but properly is a charge on the ship owners. In 1968 the Commonwealth Government, in order to get some action in Victoria, agreed to provide moneys for these incinerators without agreement on the points in dispute. As a result, incinerators have been provided and paid for by the Commonwealth at Portland, Western Port and, I think, Geelong. As the honourable gentleman says, the present problem relates to the incinerator at Melbourne. In this case the port authorities called tenders for an incinerator without any consultation",15,Petitions

11,Dr Forbes,As I explained in the state,16,Melbourne Harbour Trust Incinerators
12,Mr Fairbairni Would Also Like To,,16,Melbourne Harbour Trust Incinerators
13,Dr Forbes,"There have been difficulwith my Department and on a basis which completely disregarded the discussions that had taken place with my Department in 1968. In essence the problem is that my Department regards the incinerator as too large and too expensive for the purpose for which it is intended. I have high hopes that the matter will be resolved soon. Discussions are currently taking place to bring the matter to an end, but I make the point that one does have a responsibility to pay some regard to the proper use of the taxpayer's money. The fact that satisfactory arrangements have been made in relation to a great number of incinerators around the Australian coast creates, in my view, a strong presumption that the Commonwealth has not been unreasonable in its approach to this matter. Minister for Labour and National Service. In view of all the petitions that have been presented to the House asking the Government to take positive action to restore confidence in the arbitration system, does the Minister propose to take any action to restore such confidence or are these petitions going to be pigeonholed and ignored as happens to so many petitions? does not have the confidence of the community does not mean that the statement is true. I believe there is a widely held confidence in the arbitration system in Australia. Furthermore, I make it clear that the Government intends to maintain the arbitration system because of the protection it gives to 85% of the work force in this country who rely on it to guard their minimum wages and conditions. That needs to be said firmly and clearly. Criticism can be put into 2 categories. It may be put, first, earlier this year present an anti-dumping into the category of criticism from people who would like to strike the arbitration system down and leave nothing in its place except what they call collective bargaining based on the systems-if we can call them systems-o r lack of systems which operate in some other countries and produce industrial strikes and stoppages of greater magnitude than we have in Australia. I see no basis for that criticism to be responded to as though there is something wrong with our system. The second form of criticism goes to 2 specific issues really, and it is not new that the systems should be criticised on these 2 grounds. One is delay and the other is the excessive use of legal practitioners in the system. In respect of these 2 matters I asked for an inquiry to be made by my Department and, with the consent of the President, by the Registrar of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission to ascertain reasons for delays and the occasions on which legal counsel were used. I have recently had brought to me a report in relation to delays. The investigation required literally going through thousands and thousands of pages of transcript to find out why there were delays, at whose request the delays were and how long it did take before a particular matter came on for hearing after being filed. I received that report either yesterday or on Monday; I have forgotten which. But I have read it within the last 24 hours and I hope to be able to publish thefindingsof the report relatively soon. I am now considering whether action ought to be taken in relation to the delays, if there is anything that can be done to minimise them. Regarding the use of lawyers before the Commission, I am expecting that report very soon and when I receive it I will make it available for honourable members and the public generally to see. AlsoI would hope to publish a history of the legislation as it permits lawyers to appear and what is the present provision. When I am able to respond, I will do so. Minister for Customs and Excise relates to the dumping of cheese in Australia, which is a matter of great concern to a number of my constituents. Did the Minister notice on foreign cheese entering Australia? If so, has he been carrying out any investigations on the matter since then? Has he anything to tell the House? of the question is yes. I notified that these goods were subject to dumping investigation, I think early in December 1969. During the interim, as is required by the Act, my Department has conducted inquiries here and overseas to ascertain",16,Melbourne Harbour Trust Incinerators

20,Mr Swartz,"The honourable memberdirected to the Minister for Primary Industry. Will the Minister respond to the challenge issued by the honourable member for Riverina in the adjournment debate last night and tell the House how much wheat of the 1969-70 crop has been handled outside the Australian Wheat Board? I refer particularly to interstate sales. Will be also tell the House how much wheat is still being held on farms because farmers do not know if. when and how much they will be paid if it is delivered? lenge in this. This is information that has been asked of me several times. Some of the information can be provided and some cannot. I have quite openly stated on a number of occasions that there is no record of wheat that is traded outside the Australian Wheat Board. This is more or less illegal trading of wheat, using the provision in section 92 of the Constitution, and there is nothing that can be done to stop it if the wheat is going across a State border. There have been some very wild and extravagant estimates made of the amouni of wheat that has been traded across borders. I will explain why these estimates are wild and extravagant. I believe allocation for the forthcoming season there that a figure of SO million bushels has been used by the honourable member for Riverina. But when one looks back at the records of the Australian Wheat Board for the quantity of feed wheat that is used in Australia one finds that this figure is generally between 16 million and 28 million bushels, depending upon whether the figure is for a drought year or a nondrought year. For anyone to suggest that 50 million bushels of wheat is being traded across the border for this purpose is just to make an almost stupid estimate of the amount involved. We know that wheat is being traded across the border for stock feed purposes, but there is no indication that millers are involved in illegal trading in wheat. Therefore any wheat that is going across the border is being used specifically for feed purposes and the amount involved must be a figure below the maximum that has been used in the past. Of course, the Australian Wheat Board is making useful sales of wheat for stock feed purposes. The Board is making these useful sales by disposing of a lot of its off-grade wheat. Therefore part of the stock feed demand in Australia must be met by the Australian Wheat Board. We also know that the sales of other types of stock feed-sorghu m and barley-ar e hitting record levels this year and they must be replacing in some cases wheat that is normally used for stock feed purposes. But to suggest, as the honourable member for Riverina suggested, that the amount involved is 50 million bushels is a stupid and extravagant statement and cannot be claimed to be authentic in any way whatsoever. As far as the amount of grain being held on farms is concerned, a figure could be obtained for this. I will do what I can for the honourable member. The Department of Census and Statistics might be able to obtain a figure for this. But anyone who says that growers do not know whether they are going to be paid for over-quota wheat is not keeping informed of the situation, because the Australian Wheat Growers Federation has firmly laid down a policy for over-quota wheatthat there will be no payment for this wheat this year, but if wheat growers are able to include that wheat in their quota will be a payment on it. Shipping and Transport whether it is true that 13 British and European shipping firms have agreed to form a consortium and to pool their container ships in a single fleet with a unified marketing and sales organisation. Is this fleet to be called the Australian Container Services and will this consortium be a threat to new container ship construction? of companies from many countries, including Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy, France and Australia, represented by the Australian National Line, have formed themselves into a corporation, virtually, which jointly will operate all the container ships, numbering 13 by the end of this year, between the United Kingdom, Europe and Australia.

24,Mr Sinclair,"Is it true that a numbername now has been changed to the Australian Europe Container Services. Whether or not the companies act jointly or individually, I do not believe will have any effect on future container vessel construction. The whole purpose of bringing the container vessels together into one operation is predominantly to ensure the economies which demonstrably can be achieved by greater rationalisation of services, the achievement of better frequencies than might otherwise be possible and the provision of intcrchangeability of cargoes. These are all part of the service to shippers which we in Australia so badly need. I believe that by operating together the Australian Europe Container Services will provide a better opportunity for the container concept to be effective in cargo carriage. With the Australian National Line as a participating member of that group I believe that we, the Australian Government, will have an opportunity to ascertain the efficacy of this new. form of cargo movement and I hope, in the end result, have a better concept of the structure upon which freight rates are negotiated. the Minister for Shipping and Transport. Has the Minister made any progress in his negotiations with the container consortia for the inclusion of Tasmania in the consortia shipping port programme? Is he aware lhat Tasmania already is suffering serious loss of markets, irregular shipping and frustration because that State is in what could soon become a disastrous container shipping backwater? Is he also aware that the Minister for Trade and Industry and container consortia chieftains promised in 1968 and 1969 that Tasmania and north Queensland would share in this revolutionary shipping service with equalised freight all round the Australian continent? member is probably aware, in Australia this week the Australia London Tonnage Committee is engaged in freight negotiations. One of the services with which the negotiations are concerned is that between Tasmania and the principal container ports. The undertakings given by the consortia relate to the preservation of the sea leg freight around Australia. This sea leg freight is the actual cost of moving goods from wharf to wharf. It is true that the sea leg freights remain constant for Tasmanian ports and for all the principal outports as well as for the container ports. The advantages of the container shipping charge lies in the additional service which the container concept envisages and for which an added charge is made but when a person ships by conventional vessels this added charge is borne separately and in a different way. I can well understand the concern of the honourable member for the future industrial development of Tasmania. It is shared by the Tasmanian Government. That Government has spoken to my colleague the Minister for Trade and Industry and myself on several occasions, expressing its concern that there should be an early resolution of these negotiations. I am confident that the negotiations now under way will lead to a solution of the problem which, I trust, will be eminently satisfactory to Tasmanian shippers. Dr SOLOMON1 direct my question to the Minister for External Affairs.

What significance does the Minister see in this latest condemnation of the one Communist giant by the other? broadcast and consequently I do not know of its full contents. WhatI can say, without any thought of approval of either the philosophies, the policies or the international potential relationships of the Peking Government, is that the word 'Communism' has lost its original meaning-that is, from each according to his abilities to each according to his needs. As well, the idea of the dictatorship of the proletariat has long since been abandoned in favour of the idea of the dictatorship of the Communist parties whether they happen to be in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, China or any other part of the world where Communism prevails. WhatI can say about the philosophies of the Communist movement is that wherever the Communists have set up",19,Shipping

My Department, the Department of Social Services and the Repatriation Department-other s perhapsthat provide benefits to the public do as a standard pamphlets in respect of the benefits that they make available so that the public can be informed. That is done by my Department and by the other Departments and that practice will continue. But it has also been the practice, certaininform the honourable member that this ly in my DepartmentI cannot speak for the others-that when a departure is being made from existing arrangements, particularly a departure of a substantial nature, where it is necessary for the public both to understand the new arrangements and to be aware of them so as to get the benefits additional methods are employed. For instance, the Leader of the Opposition will be aware, if he reads the Press at all or if he listens to the radio, that at the time of the introduction of the subsidised medical scheme there was a pretty widespread advertising campaign by Press advertising, by radio advertising and, to a certain extent, by advertising on television. Pamphlets also were put out which were available from the traditional sources. It was felt in that case that, in relation to a new departure which involved completely new entitlements and particularly where it was necessary for people to be aware that these entitlements were available in order for them to get the benefits, this sort of departure was justified. What we propose to do in the present case is justified on the same grounds. The pamphlet will refer not only to the common fee but also to our subsidised medical arrangements. We have found that these other measures taken in respect of the subsidised medical service have not reached as many people as we intended that scheme to reach. We feel that, on the basis of that experience, if these benefits are to be available to the people who need them most and for whom they are intended, we need additional methods, on a once and for all basis, in this case. The existing methods of distribution in doctor's surgeries, in the offices of my Department and so on will continue as usual. to the Minister for Social Services. By way of preface, may I refer to a statement made pattern provide information by the Minister some months ago with regard to the possibility of introducing a national child minding scheme. 1 ask the Minister whether such a scheme is still under consideration by the Government. matter is at the present moment under the active consideration of the Government. I cannot give him any commitment as to when or if legislation will be brought in, but I can assure him that this very important matter is under active review. It relates of course to the responsibilities of my Department and also to the responsibilities of the Department of my colleague, the Minister for Labour and National Service. ping and Transport state whether, in view of the damage caused by the fire on the tanker 'Amanda Miller* at Whyalla, the disruption to the Whvalla shipyard could bring about anv cancellation of present orders due to altered completion dates that could now apply? the last part of the honourable gent'eman's question, but I gather that he is concerned about future orders at the Whyalla shipyard. A determination of the delays that will result to the completion not only of vessels that have been commenced but also of future vessels for which the Whyalla yard holds orders depends on the finding concerning what needs to be done to the ruined hulk of the partly constructed ship that has now been burnt out. But let me say that the Whyalla shipyard has established a very fine reputation as an Australian shipyard. I believe that its reputation would in no way be impaired by this disaster.

Nonetheless I would expect that there would be some delay, and it is this delay which, necessarily, is of concern to those building ships and ordering ships. The delay in the completion of the 'Amanda Miller' will mean for R. W. Miller& Co. Pty Ltd a delay in the provision of a replacement for the company's 2 smaller tankers which it had undertaken to withdraw from service when the 'Amanda Miller' came into operation. It will mean in relation to the movement of crude oil around the Australian coast, that for whatever the period of delay might be-and it is estimated to be about 6 months at the present timethere will inevitably need to be some replacement tonnage. As to the delays that will be imposed upon future orders, so much depends on the extent to which the company is able to achieve forward steel deliveries to replace the steel that has been Senate, where the questions received this affected in the fire and also on the time taken to remove the huik and recommence construction.

Standing order 148 states: Notice of question shall be given by a member delivering the same to the Clerk within such time as, in the opinion of the Speaker, will enable the question to be fairly printed. It has not been found necessary in the past to fix a close-down time for the lodgement of questions and it has been customary for questions for the next day's notice paper to be accepted up till the adjournment on the preceding night even although this has delayed the sending of notice paper copy to the Printer until late questions have been checked and edited by officers of the House. This checking and editing may take up to an hour after the House has risen. In the present circumstances, I feel this practice can no longer be continued. I am informed that in the case of the session are less than one-third of those received in the House, it is a general working notice paper should be lodged prior to the dinner adjournment on the preceding day.

The amounts set out in the schedule to the Bill represent estimates of the additional cost agreed between each of the States and the Commonwealth. The proposed reimbursements total $2.5m.

Dealing first with the Special Advisory Authority's report on cherries, temporary additional duties of 6c per pound were recommended. The temporary duties are in addition to the normal duties of 4 7 i % ad valorem general tariff, and 221% ad valorem preferential tariff, plus primage duty of 10% general tariff and 5% preferential tariff where relevant. On electric circuit breakers and switch units the Tariff Board recommended duties of 45% ad valorem general tariff and 35% ad valorem preferential tariff for apparatus rated for use on nominal system voltages up to 200 kilovolts. The change in the level of duties on these goods varies according to their rating. For circuit breakers and switch units operating at higher voltages the Board has not recommended any change in the existing duties of 7£% ad valorem general tariff, and free preferential tariff. In its report on floor and wall coverings the Tariff Board recommended duties of 35% ad valorem general tariff and 25% ad valorem preferential tariff for linoleum, printed paper felt base floorings, cork flooring and rubber underlay material. For vinyl, plastic and sheet rubber floorings the Board recommended rates of 45% ad valorem general tariff, and 35% ad valorem preferential tariff. This represents an increase in the level of duties of 10% ad valorem for plastic tiles and sheet rubber forms, while for printed paper felt base flooring the increase is 7 i % ad valorem. The duties on linoleum and tiles of cork remain unchanged. The Board recommended in its report on gang slitting machines thai protective duties of 30% ad valorem general tariff and 20% ad valorem preferential tariff apply to these machines. This represents a decrease in the level of duties on machines des gned to slii mild steel sheet thinner than : 12 gauge (BG)-that is to say, slightly less than one-tenih of an inch in thickness -and not exceeding 40 inches in width, from 40% ad valorem general tariff and 271% ad valorem preferential tariff, and an increase for the other machines formerly subject to non-protective duties. On leather gloves and mittens, the Tariff by the Special Advisory Board recommended that tariff protection at a level of 30% ad valorem general tariff be restricted to industrial gloves and golf gloves. For other leather gloves nonprotective duties are provided. This means duties are increased on industrial gloves and golf gloves and are not varied on dress gloves and are decreased on other gloves, such as baseball gloves or policemen's gauntlets. Preferential tariff rates are fixed in accordance with international commitments. Turning now to the report on secateurs, the Board proposed thai protection should be accorded the local proditciou of secateurs of the anvil-type. Duty on these tools is increased from 7-J% ad valoren general tariff and free preferential tariff to 25% ad valorem general tariff and 15% ad valorem preferential tariff. The Board proposed no change in the duties on other types of secateurs, for example, those with 2 cutting blades.

54,Mr Hayden (Oxley) [3.10],"The prosuperlative terms, but rather in positive terms because it does show an improvement on the situation which exists now. On the other hand there are still many areas which need improvement if we are to have an adequate system of support for the development of an indigenous film industry. Although we will not be opposing the Bill in the second reading stage we will in the Committee stage be proposing an amendment to clause 6 to allow the appointment of a person to the Australian Film Development Corporation in spite of the fact that he may have some remunerative interest in the industry, and I will outline the reasons for doing this at that stage. The proposition in this Bill is a late one industry was going into its eclipse the findbut nevertheless welcome. It is particularly welcome for us members of the Opposition because it is the sort of thing which a Socialist party would undertake. It is a Socialist venture. It extends public particihave been of great benefit to the Australian pation within the market economy. I have no doubt that the inspiration for this Film Development Corporation comes from Great Britain from that great British Socialist, Harold Wilson, now the Prime Minister of Great Britain but in 1949 President of the Board of Trade, who established a film corporation with £Stg5m at that time, stating when he introduced the appropriate legislation that it would have 'power to lend this money on reasonable commercial terms for film production'. When one reads through the second reading speech of the Prime Minister( Mr Gorton) in support of this Bill one gathers that he must have been greatly influenced by this great British Socialist. BeforeI pass from this discussion, it is interesting to note that during the debate in the House of Commons on this proposal the Conservative member for Woodford, a Mr Churchill, expressed grave reservations about this extension of public enterprise, this encroachment of back door Socialism. We of the Australian Labor Party, of course, could understand a Conservative having this view because the principle implicit in this proposal is the sort of principle which a Socialist would uphold. In any event here we are, having boxed the compass, as it were, some 70 years after the establishment in the first instance of an Australian film industry. For nearly the past decade an indigenous film industry has been trying to establish itself after 70 years in which there has been a complete dearth of public support for such an industry. Australia was one of the first countries in the world to produce feature films. In 1906 we produced the world's first full length multi-reel feature film, The Kelly Gang'. Between 1899 and 1929 we produced approximately 2S0 feature films. Then came the depression and the advent of sound and the industry was subjected to severe strains which with the restrictive trade practices of distributors controlled by overseas interests led to the collapse of the industry in this country. This was rather sad and was pretty much avoidable, because we had on hand at that stage when the ings of the Royal Commission on the Moving Picture Industry in Australia which heard evidence between 1926 and 1928. It made many recommendations which would film industry of that day. Interestingly enough, many of the proposals in that report would be of great benefit to the film industry in Australia today. I refer honourable members to what I said earlier, namely, that although the legislation before us represents progress it does not deserve to be discussed in superlative terms. There is still a lot to be done. In 1970 we have not fulfilled many of the suggestions which were put forward in the 1926-28 Royal Commission report on the Australian Film Industry. I can quote from the report some pertinent sections. At page 29 of the report the Commission suggested: That, subject to recommendations by the Appeal Board(a) Awards of Merit shall be made each year for the best films produced in Australia which will build up national sentiment, will be of high moral standard, contain humour, but not containing propaganda which might be prejudicial to international relations or likely to promote ill-feeling with other countries. (b) The Awards shall be, in order of merit, First, $5,000; second, $2,500; third, $1,500 . . . The report goes on to discuss an award of merit for the best film scenario and an award of merit under similar conditions for the best film scenario containing Australian sentiment. It makes a number of other recommendations. Of course, time will not allow me to detail them, and this is a shame, because here we are in 1970 not even yet fulfilling the outline proposed then but I will mention briefly, rather than detailing the proposals of that report, some of the suggestions which we could take up at this stage: quotas on the exhibition of films guaranteeing some Australian content; an increase in customs duty on the import of films; reciprocal tariff preferences for local films; laws dealing with the motion picture industry so that we will have uniform laws throughout the Commonwealth which will foster an Australian industry; a special Act based on the recommendations of the Royal Commission report. Of course, because we did not follow the recommendations then, and have not until recently done anything about helping the film industry, we have been responsible for scourging Australian artists from this country-drivin g them to other lands. In 1928, as stated in that report: Australians have shown their adaptability in the moving picture world, and to-day there are many of ihem engaged in the industry in the United States of America who are capably filling posts as directors, actors, actresses, scenario writers, cameramen, &c. The unlimited scope afforded by tbe well-established industry in America has been responsible for (heir remaining in that country, and it cannot be expected that many of them would be prepared to sacrifice highly remunerative positions and return to Australia in order to assist in the establishment of the industry here unless every encouragement and assistance were given to make production in Australia a profitable and lasting employment. It is remarkable that in 1962-63 the Italy and France are larger than Australia Vincent report was echoing these words. It and are well known to us as film producing stated: 'The situation would be Gilbertian if it were smaller than Australia in population have not so serious. In Australia we have the spectacle been able to maintain their own film indusof a substantial proportion of our theatrical talent tries. I refer to Sweden which has a populagoing overseas to obtain employment. There they tion of fewer than 8 million; Norway with assist in the production of television programmes which are then purchased for telecasting in a population of less than 4 million; and Australia.' What irony. What peculiar irony that the able to maintain a flourishing film industry. Government should fail to act in the light Those of us who have been fortunate to of evidence that is continuously available see films produced in these countries apprefrom findings in reports responsibly based ciate the high quality of production between 1928 and the beginning of this achieved. These countries have been able decade. The Vincent report even indicated to maintain a film industry; we can do the how Australian talent in script writers living same. here was in fact selling its product in Britain and America and earning a good income because we had done nothing to been assisted a long time ago to enable us foster the industry. In 1968 Lord Willis was to achieve the sort of standards that we re-echoing these words: 'Australia has always been able to produce great dinavian countries. I interpolate here that talent: writers, singers, artists, poets and actors. we must not expect too much immediately But for the most pari such people hove had lo turn to Britain, Europe and America for the opportunity fully to develop their abilities.' So it is all very belated to arrive at this point in 1970. At this stage one is well justified in asking why we have had to bear with two decades of Conservative neglect of the Australian film industry. A film industry is a vital part of the artistic content and of the creative achievement of any society, and is probably one of the most influential sectors of the artistic role of a society. But we have applied philistinic indifference towards the development of an Australian film industry which would absorb Australian talent and allow it to revive itself and achieve a sense of expression, which would be in harmony with national aspirations and which would interpret the aims and the aspirations of Australian citizens. A film industry would examine the sort of society that we are trying to create; it would prick the pomposity in our society by critically questioning all the assumptions and values which we aim at putting forward within our society. Compared with some other countries we are a late entrant-and I continue in my vein of criticism because I want to keep this thing in some sort of reasonable relationship to what has just been done and what should have been done-in developing and fostering an indigenous film industry. Some of these countries, such as the United States, the United Kingdom, countries. However, some countries that are Denmark with a population of fewer than 5 million. Each of these countries has been The Australian film industry should have are used to seeing in films from Scanfrom an Australian film industry. After all, we have allowed ourselves to be plundered of our best talent; we have restricted the opportunity for our creative people who produce or direct films to gain experience in this country by making it a more attractive proposition for them to leave the country and permanently reside away if they wish to become engaged full time in the industry. Again, there are countries less advanced technically than Australia that have great film industries. I refer here to India, Korea and Greece. Considering the situation today in the Australian film indussaw, of a high standard and were able to try the proposal now before the Parliament is certainly good. It is good to the extent that it represents an official recognition and which are made to sell things surely we an official commitment in support of the Australian film industry. But in comparison with what has been done in other countries it clearly underscores that we should have started much longer ago, and having started at this late date we should have done much more than we have so far been prepared to assume. I could suggest that we have muffed a good chance too, in proposing this film corporation, by restricting the proposal to Auscircuits are overseas owned and controlled. tralia alone. It would have been an ideal opportunity, to develop closer co-operative relationships with our near neighbour New Zealand in involving that country in such an arrangement as we are proposing-the establishment of a film development corporation-and perhaps we could extend this opportunity to the islands of Oceania because Oceania seems to be an area which has a continuity of interest and one with which we will be increasingly closely associated as time goes by. The sort of thing I have in mind is the development of something similar to the Nordic Council which has assisted greatly in the promotion in the Scandinavian countries of, among other things, the film industry. I would like to quote somefiguresshowing again how we have missed badly in promoting Australian talent where we had an opportunity to do so in the production of Australian shows. I quote the findings of Sylvia Lawson who pointed out that in 1967 only 2.8% of television drama shown in Australia was locally produced. This was only one twenty-fifth of what Finland produced in terms of local content for its television network. Czechoslovakia, with a population about the same as ours had 70% local content; Sweden 58%; France 80%; Japan 80%; Britain 85%; and Canada, in the shadow of that giant, the United States had 50%. Yet, all we could achieve at that stage was 2.8%. Interestingly enough because of protection laws which the Government had enacted, we are doing vjry well in the production of television commercials. The commercials produced were technically and artistically, in terms of the way in which people acted in them and the effectiveness of the depiction which one compete successfully on the international market. If we can do this with commercials should be able to do it with films which express what people want to do, where they are going in life and the sort of aspirations they have. This, after all, is the role of an art-to interpret society and its scale of values. Australians each year spend about Si00m on attending film screenings. Most of this money is going out of the country. In fact, probably more than half of this sum goes overseas because most of our cinema Again, the films which are displayed are almost overwhelmingly produced overseas. So here we have almost a total outflow of Australian money because of the lack of initiative on the part of the Federal Government to act earlier to sponsor an Australian film industry. But there is a feeling in Australia that people do want to see Australian films. 'Age of Consent', which is a recent production in Australia, was rated the thirteenth most popular film, according to one scale of popularity testing, in a recent 12-month period. So on this basis alone people are interested; they do want to see what Australians do, how they are depicted and how their attitudes are reflected. If we fail to give the sort of support which we have to give-thi s goes much beyond what is before the Parliament at presentI am afraid that the chances of reaching the high standard of excellence which we must aim at if we want to foster a really viable film industry will be muffed. AgainI come to the question of quality of production. Perhaps one could commence by considering television programmes in Australia, because quite clearly we must seek to encourage later on the fostering of quality production of Australian films. It is reasonable enough in the immediate term to say, as the Prime Minister has said, that what the Film Development Corporation will aim at is to promote films which will be commercially successful. We will want to go beyond this later; that is, we will want to modify this legislation and to build in safeguards which will give some sort of protection to an indigenous film industry to encourage more Australian participation in terms of acting material, in terms of technical capacity in producing and directing shows and in terms of Australian capital funding the production of these shows. This is a longer term project, but it is not too much in the distance I would hope. I would now like to refer back to television programmes. In 1967-68 we seemed to get some scale of the cultural values of this country from the annual report of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board which showed that the metropolitan commercial television channels devoted 13.3% of their time to sporta little under 20% to personality programmes such as quizzes, which are a quaint device for getting around the Australian content requirement imposed by the Australian Broadcasting Control Board. In contrast with this, the proportion of non-formal education programmes gained only 1.1% and the arts 0.6% of the total time. Serious drama obtained nil. One could be invigorated, I suppose, at least for that year, to find that 0.6% of the total time devoted to art was a 100% increase on the previous year. But then, of course, sport programmes substantially increased too. All this adds up to this: We have become a derivative culture. So much of what we see and have reflected on television screens and film screens is an amalgam of the lesser cultural peaks of the United States and the United Kingdom a hotchpotch of The Beverley Hillbillies' and 'Coronation Street'. Michael Wale, writing in 'The Listener' of 7th December 1968, said: One survey showed rhat of the 136 evening harnessing in Australia. The Senate Select programmes televised nationally in America, only Committee stated in its report that this 12 were not being seen in Australia. As an interesting sidelight he also pointed make world quality films and export them out that one Wednesday evening he was and the only reason it did not continue to do stunned IO see a rerun of a Randwick horse so was that the industry was left unrace item on Channel 9. But then he disprotected and squeezed out of the business covered that Sir Frank Packer's horse had by an overseas industry which was heavily won the event. Sir Frank Packer, who also owns the station, had missed the showing on Saturday and had asked for the event to be rerun. Culturally, on the basis of what Michael Wale says and on the basis of our own experience, we become a pocket borough of Hollywood's B class film kingdom and this is not good enough. The second paragraph of the Australian Council for the Arts Film Committee interim report endorses this view. Therefore quite clearly we should look with some urgency at this proposition which is before us. We have to consider ways of refining it, of developing it and of taking it beyond the boundaries now before us. Harking back to a suggestion I made earlier relating to the 1928 film industry royal commission, one thing we ought to do is to consider the introduction of import controls on films coming into Australia. It was stated in evidence submitted by the Australian Film Producers Association to the Senate Select Committee on the Encouragement of Australian Productions for Television, that: 11 is essential to realise 1'iat producers of Australian films cannot possibly compete with the dumping of programmes by overseas English speaking countries which are being sold at a mere fraction of their original cost of production. In fact, their costs have already been recouped by usage overseas and thus Australia, like many other countries find films entering into competition with the local film producing industry sold by overseas interests at prices with which the local producers cannot possibly hope to compete unless the Australian product is subsidised. This Bill would have provided a good opportunity for the Prime Minister to have projected means of protecting the local film industry. Quite clearly, no Australian industry can expect to compete against this sort of dumping, particularly in view of Australia's small population and the high cost of production factor involved in the film industry. The capacity and potential for developing a local industry are awaiting country has already demonstrated that it can protected in its own country. We have to quote what Mr Silverstein said, as published protect our industry; we have to subsidise in the Melbourne 'Herald' of 13th July it. It is generally estimated that for a 1969: country to have a viable self sufficient film industry it requires a population of about 'modest' productions and go for the bigger ones. 80 million. This means that only the United From what he said in that statement then States of America, Japan, China, the Union quite clearly the sum of $400,000 for the of Soviet Socialist Republics and India production of a film is an extremely minute would fill the bill. Therefore we have to amount. In terms of the costs which have support this industry.

56,Mr Hayden,"Indeed I am. I agree.film production. The Act relating to this Corporation provides, as 1 mentioned earlier, for the sum of $10m to be used by the Development Corporation in achieving these objectives. Each year awards of $100,000 are made to feature films of merit. The Swedish Film Institute was established in 1963. Its major functions included the following: Firstly, to make financial awards for outstanding Swedish productions. A rotating panel of film critics decides the awards which are made regardless of production costs or box office takings. Quality films which run at a loss are able to receive some compensation. Secondly, it was to establish a Swedish film library. Local film clubs and interested groups receive assistance in order to see difficult to obtain films which commercial theatres do not screen. Thirdly, it was to establish a film school providing a 2-year course in direction, camera work, sound and production administration. Practical work forms a large part of the course and involves the production of actual films. Fourthly, it was to publish information about the film industry in film journals and at various international festivals. In 1963 the tax on cinema screenings was abolished and in its place a 10% levy was imposed. The levy alone provides thefinancesof the Swedish Film Institute. In France a tax is imposed on all films released for commercial screening and a levy is imposed on ticket sales. From this fund a subsidy is paid to local production. In 1966-67 the subsidy rate was 13% of the net box office returns; that is, the more successful the film the larger the subsidy. In Italy at least 25 days, including 3 Sundays each quarter, are to be allocated to local feature films in cinemas. To qualify for this quota a local feature film must be of the requisite technical standard and of sufficient artistic, cultural and entertainment quality. Exhibitors of quality films are allowed a 25% tax rebate. A 50% tax rebate is allowed to exhibitors of films designated as suitable for children. Cash tive and to mention some things that we awards worth up to $65,000 are made to ought to do. We should provide quotas, producers and directors of the year's best tariffs and tax rebates. In the case of quotas, 10 films. In Denmark a 15% royalty is we have an arrangement in New South imposed on ticket sales. This fund is used Wales whereby 2.5% of film screening time by the Film Council to support and is supposed to be devoted to Australian encourage local film production. It gives productions. It seems that this can easily aid to script writers, assistance to producers of high quality films, awards for high quality films and aid in sponsoring them at major film festivals. In the United Kingdom in 1960 entertainment tax on cinemas was abolished and replaced by a 7 i % levy on tickets, to be paid into the British Film Production Fund. Local film producers receive from the Fund a grant in proportion to the film's box office takings. The more profit that is made on a film the bigger is the grant. In 1949 a National Film Finance Corporation was established with a fund of £Stg5m to make loans to local producers. I referred earlier to the Socialist object of the proposal which no doubt has inspired the conservative Prime Minister of Australia. In Spain, which is scarcely one of the more enlightened countries of the world, the Spanish Government provides subsidies to local producers out of a fund generated by duties imposed on foreign films. One week a month must be allocated to Spanish productions in commercial theatres. In meeting this quota 'quality films' are allowed to count as 2 days for each day's screening. In the rest of the world a great deal has been done to sponsor a film industry. Today we are deliberating on legislation which proposes to do a little bit to help local film production. I restate that at this juncture we should look at the need to promote quality in the production of films. This should be looked at as a medium term objective. In Sweden, as I mentioned earlier. 15% of the levy is available to compensate merit films. A further 20% is available for special merit awards. There, if a film loses money commercially but is artistically outstanding or of merit, then it can expect to receive support. Frankly, not only the majority but also the minority in the community deserve to be pandered to in the production of artistic work. Accordingly, quality production ought also to be an objective of the Corporation in the rr.edium term. At this stage I should like to be construcbe stepped around. If we are going to apply quotas then we are in danger of producing quickies which are produced not because of their quality content or suitability to the market but rather because there is a desire to move in quickly and cash in on the support that is available for the industry. This type of thing nearly wrecked the industry in the United Kingdom in the 1940s. It can be avoided. I have no doubt that adequate measures can be built into our legislation to ensure that this does not happen. Clearly, we do not need quotas. As I mentioned earlier, the Australian Film Producers Association said in evidence: Our Association has been advised by many well informed persons that in the light of their experiwhich could easily be ironed out to the ence, the Australian fdm producing industry can advantage of the industry. only hope for stability if it achieves in relation to financial assistance, a basic quota of the Australian film content.

Not only the material vent the dumping of films from overseas, wealth that is created is important; the a practice which is in evidence according quality of life which we are trying to achieve to the statements that I read out earlier. is also important in the evolutionary We must in any event protect the local film development of any society.

Generally I have severe in which sales can be beefed up. reservations, on the basis of sound economic principles, about giving protection to Australian industry whether it be carefully the distribution and exhibition of in the form of tariff protection or subfilms. I mentioned somewhat earlier that in sidies. But in the case of a film industry the 1920s, approaching the depression a clear case could be made on the basis period, overseas control of the distribution of the contribution to the artistic endeavour and exhibition of films in Australia of our society.

It has little opportunity for an outlet consider the cost disadvantages to the indusfor exhibition in the country. try in Australia. If a duplicate negative, which is not for sale but is for bulk reproduction, is produced then it is subject to tax. This again seems unreasonable, especially at this early stage. Perhaps we can apply taxes much later on when the industry becomes soundly based, but at this juncture it seems to be quite unreasonable. Many tools or pieces of equipment which are essential for the Australian film industry are unfairly subjected to tax charges. For instance, exposure meters which are so necessary for measuring light are taxed. In contrast, micrometers used by engineers and scientists for measuring dimensions are tax free. This seems to be an anomaly We need relief from sales tax on film stock and equipment. We need relief from for one minute that the importance of the that of the mining industry in the developThe Government ought to investigate resulted in the throttling, or in contributing to the throttling, of the Australian industry. The problem is that producers are pretty much in the hands of these distributors. They do not know how the allocation of income from films is made by the distributors. The worse example of this was the distribution of the film They're a Weird Mob'. Allegedly this film grossed a total of $3m in Australia, but so far the producers have seen about $500(000. This means that $2,500,000 went to the distributors. The film was released by British Empire Films Pty Ltd, which is the distribution side of the Greater Union group of companies which is 50% owned by the Rank Organisation of Great Britain. It is obvious from what occurred on this occasion that the people who contributed the creative work, who took the greatest risk-that is, the producers of thefilm-received only $500,000 out of the S3m grossed by the film and were exploited because of the peculiarly advantageous position which was held by British Empire Films with its tie-up through the Greater Union group of companies that are 50% owned by the Rank organisation in the United Kingdom. At this juncture 1 would encourage the Minister to discuss with us ways in which Australian producers could be guaranteed by law access to details of the way that the income earned by films is broken down and distributed. He should look at the possibility of breaking up the vertical integration which is quite apparent in sections of the Australian film industry and which could conceivably throttle this industry in its infancy just as it apparently helped to do in the late 1920s and early 1930s. Under the proposals of the Bill the Corporation membership will exclude anyone participating in it who has a monetary interest in the industry. The Opposition does not accept that this is a legitimate ground upon which to debar anyone from participation in the Corporation. It could very well be that a person with pecuniary interests in the industry may have an extremely valuable contribution to make as a member of the Corporation board. Accordingly we propose to move an amendment at the Committeee stage indicating our attitude on this. I would like now to draw some comparisons. If a corporation board is operated to give advice in an area of health services in the community quite clearly qualified people will be needed to sit on it. One could not object to a doctor sitting on the board on the basis that he has a special interest in that section of the health services and would therefore seek to give a loading in support of that area in which he is interested. I have not heard anyone on the Government side object to the fact that the Premier of Queensland, the Cabinet of that State Government, participates in Cabinet deliberations on applications for oil search permits within that State despite the fact that he has a pecuniary interest in many of the applications that go before that Cabinet. However in the case of a Minister the position is somewhat different and I do believe there is a clash of private and public interests apparent there. In this case of artistic involvement though I do not believe there should be any fetter to a person sitting on a corporation board merely because he has a pecuniary interest in the industry, so long as he declares that interest. It may well be that he has a valuable contribution to make to the deliberations on the industry. It is to be hoped the Corporation will not aim at creating moguls of the film industry in Australia but will seek to develop a fairly broadly based industry, one which will meet the demands of the broad, popular market in the community and help the development of quality films within Australia. What is needed is the development of a vital, creative, imaginative film industry giving a true reflection of the ideas, values, ways of life and aspirations of the Australian community. This must be the fundamental basis upon which the Corporation sets about its functions. I conclude by reiterating that whilst the establishment of the Corporation represents an improvement or an achievement for the film industry in Australia there is still a great deal to be done. There are many gaps, many deficiencies, many problems which have not been attacked and many questions which still remain to be answered. I hope the Government will do something about this soon and develop the means, some of which I have outlined, which will really help the vital and enduring growth of an important Australian film industry.",31,Australian Film Development Corporation Bill 1970
57,Mr Bjelke,"Petersen, the prime member ofhonourable member for Oxley( Mr Hayden) gave some grudging support to this Bill. He said that if Labor had been in Government it would have brought in a similar Bill. I do not know whether lhat is a commendation of the Bill. I for one have never heard any suggestion from any member of the Labor Party advocating such a measure in the past. The honourable member for Oxley claimed that this was a Socialist measure and that the Liberal Government had introduced this Socialist measure. But it is not a nationalisation measure and if Labor were in power I have no doubt that it would nationalise the film industry because it has this mad, insane idea that everything must be nationalised and brought under government control. What the Government is doing in this Bill is bringing in something From the start there has been an enthusiwhich is essentially Liberal policy-that is, co-operation between private enterprise and government when it is necessary to have that co-operation for an enterprise to be successful.

There are many more. Yet all of these famous artists were forced by lack of opportunity in Australia to seek fame and fortune in other countries. It is strange that Australians have proven themselves equal to any in the world in almost very field except that of film production. Film making in Australia dates back to as early as 1900 but very few of the many films made have been of a sufficiently high standard to command a world audience. astic audience forfilmsin Australia and until the late 1930s it was possible to make a profit on a small budget film from the home market alone.

62,Mr Jarman,"This young lady todayway of setting up a training school, and $200,000 has already been allocated for experimental film making-$100,00 0 for productions and $100,000 to facilitate their showing on television. The setting up of this Corporation will encourage Australian produced films of high quality which also have a good chance of being a commercial success. The Corporation's moneys are not just hand-outs to any hopeful or hopeless production, but rather they are an investment which will be recouped in the whole future of the Australian film industry. I think we can look with confidence to the National Film Finance Corporation which was set up in Britain in 1950. In the 17 years between 1950 and 1967 the British Corporation invested $70m in assisting the production of 694 feature films and 164 short films. In that time it received back $43.5m. The 694 films however are still in distribution and will undoubtedly go on generating income even after the full $70m is regained. The setting up of this Corporation is just one more step by this Government in the building of a greater, more productive Australia. A flourishing film industry in Australia will employ talented Australian actors, writers, artists and technicians. No longer will they have to go overseas to follow their careers successfully. As a direct result of the work of this Corporation Australian films will be distributed throughout the world, thus projecting the ideas and the way of life of our people and our nation. As the Prime Minister said in his second reading speech, we should devote ourselves not only to the building of great new factories and smelters, not only to wresting produce and minerals from the earth, not only to material standards, but also to involvement in and development of the arts. This is an excellent Bill. It is a great step forward for the film industry, and I commend it to the Bill on which I would like to comment.

He made a splendid full length With all respect, here we have the cart feature of it, and I offer no comment except before the horse, because as anybody who to say that perhaps 'Gone to the Dogs' may has been engaged in the film producing well have been dedicated to the Liberal industry knows, before hiring actors or Party. Australia, someone said, is the counwriting a script one has to be absolutely try without a face. Part of the reason for sure that the film will be distributed. It is this, of course, is the lack of a film industry of its own. It was stated in an article in 'Quadrant' written by Sylvia Lawson on the Australian film industry: The Australian film industry is not only the least productive in the world; it is also, in a sense, the most written about. Other countries talk about their films. We talk about our lack of them. I think that is perfectly true. It is very necessary to point out, in speaking to this measure, that at present Australians spend about SlOOm a year on going to the movies, and none of this goes to local industry. The Opposition, as mentioned by the honourable member for Oxley( Mr Hayden), is delighted that at long last we are to have a face, no matter how small or shy that face may be. I want to say right now that, although this may be a shy face and although it may be a small one, nonetheless hope springs eternal. As a practitioner in this industry for a number of years, I very sincerely congratulate the Government, or perhaps more specifically one should say the Prime Minister( Mr Gorton), on bringing this Bill into the House. The honourable member for Oxley has dealt with its shortcomings and I think I would only be boring the House if I were to repeat these. It does have some shortcomings, but I intend, if I may, to point out that the film as an art form is the only true art form to emerge in the 20th century. The cultural impact of film as an art form can be stimulating, provoking, satisfying and, above all, entertaining. This it has to be if it is to be a success in either the artistic field or the commercial field because-and let us be perfectly honest about this-unles s a film will satisfy a certain artistic appetite and also be a box office success, any film industry is in great trouble. There are just one or two parts of the The Prime Minister said in his second reading speech, when speaking of the Australian",37,Australian Film Development Corporation Bill 1970
63,Mr Sherry (Franklin) [4.13],"I thank Film Development Corporation:of prime importance to make absolutely certain of an assured distribution before 1 foot of film is shot. If we are to set up this Corporation and then, almost as an afterthought, suggest that perhaps we could participate in the formation of a company for the distribution of the products we are making, I would suggest with all due respect that some very ill advice has been received. The Prime Minister also said: The Corporation will seek to encourage the production and distribution of Australian films of high quality. 1 have no dispute with this aspiration of high quality, but I would like to ask: Who determines what is a film of high quality? Experts have over the years been trying to determine this point. A film of high quality may indeed be a film that has high quality of scripting, high quality of acting or high quality of photography, but unless ail these are blended together as an artistic and acceptable commercial whole it is almost impossible to determine what is a film of high quality. We have to get our priorities right when we are trying to determine a question such as this. Indeed if anybody in the film industry could predetermine that a film would be of high quality and a box office success he certainly would not need the assistance of this Bill. I turn to a part of the second reading speech in which the Prime Minister said: a Chairman and 4 other members who will Producers of films will still be expected to have years. In my view, in any artistic enterprise a substantial equity in a film, and to show faith -be it theatre, films, ballet or music-the in their artistic and commercial judgment. . . NowI come back to the point I made a can sometimes be dangerous. When we are moment ago, that it is almost impossible dealing with the arts, as 1 said earlier, I in this industry to show faith in your comthink we must examine it on a totally differmercial judgment, because this is not like ent plane. To state arbitrarily that we will making and selling a pound of sausages or appoint a Chairman and 4 other members any other product. Producers are relying for a period not exceeding 5 years is, in upon human reaction to the product they my view, a mistake. What we should have have made. In my experience in this in the creative field or the artistic field is a industry, nobody has been able to deterconstant interchange of chairmen and memmine with any degree of certainty what the bers so that there is the constant inflow of success or otherwise of a film will be. But new ideas that is so necessary to any creative I would not argue with that wording. I field. This is not like a normal business or would agree, and I would hope that people industrial enterprise, which has a certain would show faith in their artistic and compattern that is followed. Here when we are mercial judgment. It is possible to show dealing with creative people the normal faith in your artistic judgment, but it cerstandards of business do not apply. tainly is not possible to show faith in your commercial judgment, and it does not necessarily follow that if your artistic judgfication, that the sum of $lm is a fairly ment is right your commercial judgment niggardly amount. I think this is probably will be right. In fact, it is quite the contrary. true. I return to my original theme and that The Prime Minister also said: So we expect profits in money terms but at least as importantly we expect profits in human values. I have no argument with that at all. 1 think that we have to apply ourselves as realists to this, but if we intend to set up such an industry as envisaged in the Australian Film Development Corporation Bill, as I said a moment ago, it must of necessity make itself a paying proposition. If it does not the whole concept of the enterprise is doomed to failure. I was interested in the Prime Minister's remark that in other countries considerable investment in film production is forthcoming from banking and other financial organisations. I support what the Prime Minister said. I would very sincerely hope that banking institutions and other investment organisations would find not only that it is .substantially profitable for them to invest in film production but also that they would be doing themselves as well as their shareholders, whoever they may be, a service. They would also be doing the nation a great service. I hope that a similar course will be followed here to that which has been followed in practically every other country. The Bill provides for the Australian Film Development Corporation to be made up of be appointed for a period not exceeding 5 arbitrary term of appointment of members It has been said, perhaps with some justiis, the fact that this Corporation has been established is in itself a splendid move and I applaud it on behalf of all the actors, writers, producers, designers and directors in this country. The situation here has been a bone of contention with many creative people in Australia for a number of years. As was pointed out by the honourable member for Deakin, we have had a mass exodus of creative people from Australia over the years. I can testify to the accuracy of that statement because I jointed the exodus from this country many years ago as a writer and an actor. I can well imagine the frustration that has been felt in Australia for many years. It has been quite impossible for any creative artist in this country, perhaps with one or two exceptions, to be assured not only of a reasonable living standard but also of continuity of work. Without continuity in artistic creation very grave problems arise. At this stage I would like to outline practical ways in which I think assistance can be given. I have here the report of th: Vincent Committee of nearly a decade ago which made certain recommendations. Paragraph 112 of that report referred to tbe assistance that should be given to Australian companies engaged in producing films. It recommended assistance in the following ways. By excluding from the taxable income of producing companies the profit resulting from sales of films overseas. I commend this recommendation to the Government because it has great sense and sensibility and I think it would be of great assistance to film producers. Another recommendation in the Vincent report was this: By lifting sales tax completely from all purchases those people who have been engaged in of either materials or film stock and all products manufactured by film producers pertaining to film production other than final release prints. The honourable member for Oxley touched on this point very lightly but I think it is worthy of further comment. Those two points from the Vincent report are pertinent to the Bill we are discussing today. When Lord Willis was out hereI forget exactly when it wasI had a conversation with him about the position not only of the Australian film industry but also of the Australian television industry, with particular emphasis on the position of writers in this country. I do not propose to take up the time of the House by giving a long, detailed account of the importance of writers, but I think it is generally agreed in the industry-certainl y as far as television is concernedthat unless we create, maintain and encourage Australian writers to remain in this country and pay them a reasonable recompense for their creative talents, the prop on which the film and the television industries are based is doomed to failure. I think it is accepted now by many people that one of the great weaknesses of Australian indigenous drama, particularly as it pertains to television, has been in this area of writing. We should do whatever we can, although this is not specifically mentioned in the Bill, to encourage Australian writers to remain in this country and make their contribution to the film industry. The honourable member for Oxley intimated that we would be moving an amendment in the Committee stage. It is to the part of the Bill we will seek to amend that I would like lo turn my attention at this stage. It says that nobody with a pecuniary interest would be allowed to be a member of the board of this Corporation. I really do have some argument with this provision. I suggest to the Government that if it does this it will be in very grave danger of pulling the supports out from under a very worthwhile measure. It seems to me that if the Government says arbitrarily that anybody who has a pecuniary interest-and by 'pecuniary' I assume that it means some sort of monetary or financial interest in this industry-wil l be denied the opportunity to serve on this board, it will probably be robbing the board of a great deal of expertise that is needed. Who knows the business of the film industry better than it and upon it for a number of years and who possibly have been able to make a profit out of it? I suggest to the Government with all respect that it give some further thought to this clause. To follow up this point-thi s may not be a very relevant analogy-it seems to me that, if we are to deny a conductor Ihe right to be on the board of an opera house or to deny a film producer a place on this Corporation because he has some pecuniary interest in the industry, it is not only surprising but is not consistent with what I would have thought would be Liberal policy. If we arc going to deny this right to people with expertise, we will have much difficulty in attracting people who have the right sort of contribution to make to the Corporation. thing with other boards. the honourable member points out, but 1 am making this suggestion purely and simply as a constructive criticism because I want this particular Corporation to succeed for the reasons I have outlined. The mere fact that 1 am on the Opposition benches does not mean that 1 want to see it fail. I do not want it to fail; I want it to succeed, and any suggestion that comes from this side that will make it succeed ought to be given due consideration by the Government. Honourable members may recall that in my maiden speech I laid some emphasis on the need for a better image1 hate lhat word, but there is no substitute for it-for Australia abroad. ] agree with the Prime Minister's summation of his second reading speech that this is one way whereby we may achieve a better image. The image of Australia abroad as a land of koala bears and gum trees no longer applies. The image we should try to establish abroad in the eyes of our neighbours and friends is of an Australia that is vibrant and artistically and culturally creativea land that has a contribution to make in the realm of communications with other nations, whoever they may be. If we can create this image abroad we will have gone a long way towards achieving true and full nationhood. If by the establishment of a corporation such as is proposed we can encourage the making of films and the establishment of a film industry we may well achieve a better image abroad. In conclusion I refer to censorship. 1 do not know whether this has been considered, because I see no evidence of it in the Bill. Censorship is important and relevant. It has been my experience overseas, perhaps not so much as in Australia, that if a producer hopes that a film will succeed he will inevitably run foul of Australian censorship laws. When I talk of censorship I do not advocate wild permissiveness. Of course, this is noi the occasion for a broad debate on censorship. But I do say. with the greatest respect, that we may find that a film produced with assistance provided by this Corporation may well be exhibited in New South Wales but banned in Victoria. I mean no disrespect to Victoria, but this is a real problem that could arise. Alternatively, the film could be shown in Tasmania and be banned in Queensland. A closer look must be had at censorship as it relates to the cinema, because in my view in film making the only way to reach the objective of an artistic and profitable exercise is to make sure that the film does not run foul of censorship. I hope that this does not occur, but with (he peculiar censorship set up (hat we have in Australia at the moment there are bound to be problems. 1 hope that they can be averted. With all its shortcomings, I am quite certain that this legislation will be welcomed not only by the Australian people but by Australia's creative talent. The Opposition welcomes it because it will fill in an artistic void that has remained for far too long in this country. with previous speakers thai this Bill fulfils a need the meeting of which is long overdue. I do not propose to recount tbe history of film making in Australia but it is a pretty sorry story. This has been due to a number of factors, all of which conspired to produce films which by world standards were pretty shoddy. We can remember the early days when films like 'For the Term of His Natural Life' were produced, the era of the Dad and Dave films which I suppose were entertaining to many Australians, and finally the efforts which culminated in the production of 'They're a Weird Mob', which was a pretty good film. None of those films, including 'They're a Weird Mob', would make any impact in countries other than Australia. It appears to me, as one who has been associated with Ihe film industry for some years, that one of the great shortcomings in the history of our film making was that we made films essentially for local consumption. The people responsible had rather a poor opinion of the standards expected by Australian people. Having said all that, perhaps somewhat in contradiction I pay a tribute to Charles Chauvel. He did everything possible in most discouraging circumstances to build up a film industry in Australia. Because of his efforts and the efforts of a few",38,Australian Film Development Corporation Bill 1970

66,Mr Katter (Kennedy) [4.36],"1 agreepeople with him we have now reached the gratifying position today where the Australian film industry is to be assisted. I agree with the honourable member for Franklin( Mr Sherry) when he says that $lm is a very modest sum, particularly when one has regard to what a really good movie costs to produce. It is perfectly obvious that the Sim proposed in the Bill will serve only to establish the Corporation and perhaps give some sort of launching point for someone or some group of people who are prepared to embark on the production of a worthwhile film. Let us consider for a moment the ingredients that are necessary to produce a really worthwhile movie. 1 would say that people overseas and in Australia would now regard our previous history of film making as a closed chapter. We are commencing afresh. Hence the first film that is now to be produced here could well set the standard by which our capability of becoming an identity in the film making world shall be judged. The first ingredient1 suppose it is the first necessity for most enterprises-is finance. If film making in this new era is to be worthwhile a lot of money will be required. If a person has been involved in purchasing films, in looking at them and in trying to separate the chaff from the wheat, he gets rather a second sense. He can almost detect, when a film is getting a huge build up by the distributors, that they are trying to cover up what has been a pretty shoddy film that has been produced on a shoe-string budget. It becomes perfectly obvious when that film is exhibited and the audience or lack of audience gives a clear indication of how the film is received. There will have to be adequate finance and I repeat that this Sim could not contribute to the making of a film. Every penny of that will be required to set up the Corporation. The next requirement is the people resof Music', 'Mary Poppins', 'Oliver', ponsible for making films. The most im'Camelot', and others which do not have an portant department is that of directorship. excessive content of violence or sex. We The directing of a film is quite clearly the people in the industry know this. We know most important aspect of film making in whal we have to pay for those films. While this great art of the cinema. As an example I am on that subject let me say that it is I refer to 2 of our television series, 'Bellhigh time that someone took a look at the bird and 'Homicide', both of which have percentage which is being demanded of 1 almost universal acceptance here in Ausexhibitors these days. When the Corporation tralia. I do not know whether they would in some other facet of the cinema world be exhibited overseas. I should imagine that 'Bellbird' would not be of much interest to people living elsewhere but 'Homicide' would be of some interest. 'Homicide' would most certainly be most acceptable to people wanting realities. I would say this series has a very authentic touch about it. It is apparent that the directorship of both of these television series is quite outstanding and that we do have directors of outstanding ability in this country. As to the other requirements I suppose that most people would, without giving too much thought to these things, say that Ihe actor in the film provides the most important facet of film making, but of course this is not entirely correct. Here again we must get back to the first film that we will produce. I think that it is vital to get some big name in the film industry to lake part in our first production. Before a musician becomes qualified to be so called he must achieve a certain degree of excellence. The same applies to technicians. We have adequate people in Australia who could fit the bill in these directions. One outstanding example of a film that would take in Australia is True Grit', for which John Wayne received an Academy Award. it was a western film of tremendous appeal. In Australia we have all of the requirements for the production of this type of outdoor film. Some honourable members may feel that this type of film is not particularly popular these days, that people prefer so called adult films-film s which have a pretty high content of violence and sex. It might interest honourable members to know that it is on record in the current copy of 'Box Office', which is the periodical that is circulated to most film exhibitors throughout the world, that almost 90% of the top box office attractions are the wholesome family type film. One immediately thinks of films such as 'Sound is established it might well interest itself than the actual making of films. Its responsibilities might be extended a little to enable it tains-the y would be in real trouble, and to look into the matter of the very high percentage charged by distributing companies in Australia to the poor struggling exhibitor who in these days of television is barely able to keep the wolf away from the door. I thoroughly agree with the point of view expressed by the honourable member for Franklin as to the difficulties that could arise with the censorship laws which vary from State to State. I should imagine that when a film is made, at least in the early stages when this Corporation is trying to build up a going concern, it might even produce a film that could get through the censor. When one looks at some of the films that are around these days one would think that a fair amount of elasticity would be allowed in the content of our first film as to violence or sex. The Coiporation would have a good deal of elasticity to produce a film which would not worry the censor in any State. I should not imagine that this would present any great difficulties. We have wonderful settings in Australia for the making of films, particularly films of the outdoor type. We have excellent light, particularly in the northern parts of Australia. We have unlimited scope for settings. No expense would be involved in providing settings for outdoor films. We have a large field for extras, particularly in the western areas of Queensland; there will be more extras than we will ever need if this drought continues. I suggest very humbly and with respect that when this Bill is passed-ther e is a surprising degree of unanimity in this matter although an amendment is foreshadowed; but because it will be presented by a Queenslander I think it will be a pretty reasonable oneand when the Corporation is set up it should take into account first and foremost the type of film to be produced. It is perfectly obvious that as Australia is known as a great outdoor country the first film to be produced under the operations of this Corporation should be an outdoor spectacular, and it should include in the cast an actor of some international status. I could suggest 1 or 2 in this House, but I rather think that the type of actor required is the outdoor type and the people I have in mind, if they ever got beyond the Great Dividing RangeI mean the Blue Mounhence if they were to portray the type of character I have in mind it would be like a goanna at a maypole dance. I would like to say, as one who is in this industry, that we should set out to achieve a box office success. All honourable members would agree that we will do or die in the very early operations of this Corporation. I must disagree with the honourable member for Franklin on one point although I do agree with him to a degree. No-one can say for sure whether any product is going to be a financial success. But we can say this: We can examine the films which have been successful and we will find that in most cases they have been the type of film, as I said before, that appeals to a family. They would be the wholesome type of film like 'Sound of Music' or 'North to Alaska'. The film 'North to Alaska' is a particular example of an outdoor film which has been a tremendous success. This type of film could be brought back into a theatre time and time again and it would do well. I do not suggest that the Australian film industry should produce a 'Gone With the Wind' unless we can sell the Opera House and apply the funds to the making of such a film. This was a film that cost many millions of dollars many years ago. But with a good deal of forethought and with consultation with people of experience films of the kind I have referred to can be produced. It is very important-and here again I go along with what was said by the honourable member for Franklin-that if people are to be excluded from the Corporation because they have a pecuniary interest in film production surely there should be some compromise. I speak here of people who have experience which may have been gained through their association-eve n a financial association-wit h the industry. We would think that when the Minister talks about a pecuniary interest this would relate purely to the investor. But surely the man who would be most qualified is the man who has made a success in the industry. I must again refer to the early stages of the operation of the Corporation. It would probably be necessary in these stages to secure the services of some people of international status. I would hope that this industry would be established far away from the great cities of this country, ft has been proved overseas that the best and most economical place for film studios is away from the more congested areas. There must be space for studios. HenceI would very strongly suggest that there is an area in western Queensland where we can provide just everything. We can provide all sorts of characters1 can assure the House of that: we can provide some of the most colourful characters. We can provide vast spaces. We can supply many extras, I regret to say. But above all, we can supply glorious Australian sunshine. There would be no question of holding up a film crew and thousands of extras because of rainI can assure honourable members that there is no danger of that possibly for years to come. IfI might make a plug for my own area, those people who establish the studios, as they eventually will, might well give consideration to establishing them in the great outback of Queensland. come this legislaiion. 1 referred to the need for such legislation probably 10 or 12 years ago. 1 have always been interested in films and film making and I have always been very upset to think that Australia was so far behind the rest of the world in this field. I compliment the honourable member for Oxley( Mr Hayden) for the way he presented the Opposition's case. I congratulate those who have already spoken on this measure, which the Opposition operated on a shoestring, as the honourable agrees with, except in respect of the matter member for Kennedy( Mr Katter) has said, dealt with in the small amendment we are and which have had to fight the cynicism going to move. It is always a pleasure when of the Australian public, have performed we can get a point of agreement in this miracles in the past with such films as The House on measures of this nature.

That is a really statesmanlike utterance and I hope that what is proposed starts off on that plane, because I for one would oppose the expenditure of Sim if we are going to produce films of the type that we sometimes see on the screen and others, of course, that have not hit the deck because of censorship. I want to say something about my views on censorship later. The attitude of the Prime Minister-it is also the attitude of the Opposition-is a laudable and excellent one. We hope that we will have men running the Corporation, and film producers making films, who will help to build this country's image in the world in the very best sense. After all, this has been the Cinderella of Australian industries. Our film making history is the story of struggling companies always starved for finance and often for talent. The national Government's long delay in coming into this field with the sinews of war-that is, finance-has enabled overseas film producers to export their films to Australia in their hundreds and thousands over the last 6 decades. In this period we have been completely inundated by foreign films. We have always had the talent and the ability in all fields of the arts in this country. Our film technicians, our actors and our actresses have been forced to go overseas to sell their talents to foreigners instead of using this talent in their own country. Our pioneer film companies, which honourable member for Kennedy as one of our very great early producers who people, its way of life and its language. customs greater than their knowledge of",41,Australian Film Development Corporation Bill 1970
67,Mr Duthie (Wilmot) [4.54],"I weltheir own country. Most Australian young people today could tell more about America than they could about their own country just because of what they have seen in films. This is not altogether a bad thing, but it gives a one-sided picture. We should be boosting our own country in our own films. The films that were mentioned by the honourable member for Kennedy, such as 'Bellbird', 'Homicide' and, of course, 'Division 4'-the latest advent in this field -and 'Showcase' have shown that we have the talent in Australia to produce documentaries or short continuing stories week by week. It is time that we gave a publicity boost to this beautiful land of ours with its vastness, its grandeur, its beauty, its colour, its vigour, its varieties, its history, ment Corporation. I hope that television its customs, its humour, its uniqueness, its music, its adventure, its rawness, its beautiful women and its sports-minded men. Our women are the most beautiful in the world; 1 married one of them. now. One important factor has been the advent of television in film making, producing and viewing. Its impact on the world has been fantastic. The movie film has now invaded thousands of Australian homes night by night and afternoon by afternoon. We do not need to go to the picture theatres-mos t are closed down anyway-o r to the drive-ins. The moving, dramatic outside world itself marches into our lounge rooms every night. While in our homes we can see men walking on the moon at the actual time that it is happening through the miracle of television. We see in our own homes movies that we had never heard of. We see some that we wish we had never heard of because the standard is so low. While on the matter of standards and the past I hope that our womenfolk keep on looking at those ancient films, those made 10 or 20 years ago, and continue to wear mini skirts. If ever there is a hideous sight it is the frocks, the maxis, of 10 to 15 years ago. I think all honourable members will agree with me on that point. Week by week we see news documentaries, travelogues and educational films in our homes. Television has opened up a whole new world of opportunity for script writers, film technicians, actors and actresses, cameramen, producers, directors, musicians and composers. This Sim loan for film production in Australia will give producers a chance to employ these people in our own country and to make full length films and documentaries as well. I understand that a television documentary or film lasting 1 hour costs §60,000. This sum is recovered 10 times over when it is circulated round the world to the various television stations. This shows what can be done when talents are married tofinance,equipment, geographical background and colour. Television can do a lot for us through the activities of this proposed Film Developdocumentaries become a very important part of Australia's film development in the next few years as a result of the establishment of this Corporation. There is tremendous scope for quality stories with historical and geographical content and with dinkum Aussies playing the leading and secondary roles. We have to counter the Americanisation of Australia through the movie films. This is where Australian producers can do so much. Australian people are exportable through the medium of films. Our country can be exportable. This is a magnificent country and we have magnificent people. Why should we have to watch American films, or French films or films from other countries all the time and be so starved of our own? We have proved that we have the talent here because many of our actors and actresses have made headlines overseas. I suggest, Mr Deputy Speaker, that when we are thinking of someone to run this Corporation that, as the honourable member for Franklin( Mr Sherry) so eloquently said, we need someone with experience, such as a producer or an actor. Why not coax back from overseas, from England or America, some of the leading Australian actors and actresses who already have made headlines in reports on our films in foreign countries? Why not choose one of these men, offer a top salary and invite him back to become the leading personality in this Corporation? This would be a challenge to him. It would be a pioneering effort for him. By doing this we would be bringing talent back to where we need it and establishing it in charge of this Corporation.",44,Australian Film Development Corporation Bill 1970
68,Mr Killen,What does she say?,45,Australian Film Development Corporation Bill 1970
69,Mr Duthie,"I cannot tell you thatThe distribution of our films is another task for the Corporation. The Prime Minister referred also to this matter when he said: It may also, subject to ministerial approval, parable to do so. I am a censorship man, am ticipate in the formation of a company for the distribution of Australian films. This is a tremendously important aspect of the scheme. What is the good of producing films if we cannot distribute them profitably in other countries or to the Australian television circuit? We need skill in this field also. We need persons of ability to sell Australia and Australian films by distributing local works. I think that a distribution section should be formed early in the piece and should be a very important part of the work of the Corporation. It should distribute and market our films in Asia, Europe, England, the Pacific countries, and of course, America. Naturally competition will be greatest in America. 1 agree with the honourable member for Franklin that we have to fill out the image of Australia beyond that of koala bears, kangaroos and stock whips. Quality of film production is absolutely vital and the Prime Minister referred also to this point. He said: The Corporation will seek to encourage the production and distribution of Australian films of high quality. He referred to high technical quality, talent and production quality and stated that he wants the films to be commercially successful. This is true; the films have to be box office successes. The Prime Minister said that excellence in production, camera work and technical presentation were necessary in order to justify the description 'high quality'. The Prime Minister went on to say: The fund is intended for investment in films. It is not intended as a giveaway project. He wants the funds to earn money so that the profits can be reinvested in the industry. 1 think we will have to spend a lot more than $lm to get this project satisfactorily off the ground. It may require an annual grant or loan for several years until it is properly established. However we will have to lift the standard of film production generally. The standard at the present time is getting to the lowest ebb in its history. Despite all the modern techniques, modern acting methods and modern scientific knowledge the general standard of film production has reached its lowest ebb. It will go further down the drain if we do not stop it. We should stand up and fight this process. I intend to fight it as long as I am proud of it, and I intend to stay that way. I shall refer in no uncertain terms to censorship in a few moments. Surely we can lift films from the gutter and the cesspool into which they are descending. Censors are overworked at the present time in having to cut out this tripe and filth from films. Why do we cater for the lowest common denominator instead of the highest in the production of films which are finding their way into the homes of thousands of our people, into our schools and into our entertainment areas? The best films of all time, those which attracted the biggest box office return, were devoid of depravity, uncouth sex and crudity. 1 will name just a few of the modern ones. 'The King and I ' was a remarkable film and starred Yul Brynner. 'Ben Hur' was a film we will remember all our lives. The Great Escape' and The Dam Busters' were two other magnificent productions. One could see the 'Sound of Music' many times. 1 would like to include in this category all Disney films. All of them are high quality films; all of them are decent. Disney made the greatest contribution of any producer and never produced a second grade film in his life. His films can be shown to anybody at any time. 'Doctor Zhivago' was another great modern film. Another two are 'Where Eagles Dare' and 'Born Free'. 1 have named just a few of the great films which did not depend on depravity for their sales. Before concluding I want to say a few things about censorship. Nearly everybody runs for cover when this subject is raised. People are saying that the censorship board should be wiped. People say. that censorship should be cut out; that we should let in everything that is ugly and sordid. 1 want to say a few words about censorship because it is tied in with the subject of films. If we are to produce films then they should be films which can be kept away from the censors. It is a waste of time and money to produce films from which a whole heap of film will have to be cut because it is pure depravity. If we start with that type of film we will waste a lot of money. Having read reports Have honourable members ever heard a from people who viewed the segments of more naive statement or suggestion than film cut by the censors which were shown that in their lives? How can persons under here in Canberra last Monday night, I am 18 years of age be left out? There is a 100% in favour of continuing censorship sample of what the viewers saw the other and maintaining standards. I shall quote a night of segments cut out from films. I am few remarks made by one of the pressmen amazed at the self righteousness of those I will not say who he is, but he will know invited to that cinema who are giving the when he hears me reading his commentsabout the type of film that has been cenivory tower dwellers. It made me sick to sored. He said: We saw George Peppard righting for his life with ings of filth and corruption. Those who the spike of a belt buckle and the jagged neck of a broken bottle against a mob of homosexuals watch and who advocate the burial of intent on beating him to a pulp. We saw George Peppard and Slim Pickens fightare incorruptible themselves are prepared to ing to the finish with chains, branding irons and poison, distort, corrupt, twist and destroy an assortment of other handy farmyard weapons. We saw a bloody scene from an Indian film in which a remarkably agile one-legged victim people who are not incorruptible-peopl e did his desperate best to defend himself from a who are at the most impressionable age of much larger two-legged attacker. And so on. It proved little to me. Then he went on further and said: It is the censorship of scenes or whole films legalised on the screen for all over 18 years because of their sex content which causes the of age. God forbid. controversy, and that is really what we were there to study. We were not disappointed. For example, there were four on-screen rapes. 1 admit one of them shocked me, but only because the rapist was Frankenstein, whom 1 had always associated with clean family monsters. There were two lesbian love scenes-withou t doubt the most powerful and moving items on the programme. One, from the French film 'Therese and Isabelle', was tender and beautiful. The other, from 'The Killing of Sister George', intense and passionate. One of the items, from the Swedish version of 'Fanny Hill' showing the teen-age heroine watching a couple making love on closed circuit television in a brothel would have to go if there is to be any censorship at all. He admitted that. The article continues: But in my view there is no reason why adults should be prevented from seeing most of last night's programme . . . A case in point was a rape scene from the Italian film Two Women', which had none of the clinical explicilness of some of the other clips. Sophia Loren's portrayal of the terror and agony of the victim was superb cinema. My overall impression from the evening was that film censorship in Australia is, at the very least, inconsistent. No pattern emerged of why some things offend the censor and others do not. What the evening did show, quite vividly, I think, was the urgent need for an X or R certificate system of film classification in Australia Listen to this partunder which the onus would be on the exhibitor to refuse entrance to people under a prescribed age. impression that they are incorruptible, unmovable, beyond temptation, indeed read these apologists for unrestricted screencensorship of films and books because they the minds and characters of millions of life. Those self righteous people want fornication, horrifying violence, sexual intercourse, lesbianism and homosexuality to be screened for everybody's viewing and What sort of race will emerge if people are fed for life on this type of stuff? This is what worries me. All of us who are legislators in this place ought to think about that. This is not a laughing matter. Pressure is being put on the Government to wipe out the Censorship Board and to let all this material come into Australia unrestrictedly and onto our screens, in the forlorn hope that no-one under 18 years of age will see it. To lift censorship entirely is to lift depravity and corruption to the same level as decency, and to lift ugliness to the same status as beauty. It will give the green light -thi s is what, to my mind, is serious-to every morally deformed, spiritually bankrupt producer to include more depravity and violence in his movie films. This is what would happen, until morals sank to a much lower level than they are at the present time. The cry that this filth is only for adults and that persons under 18 years of age would not be permitted to view such things is as weak as water and as naive as the little children themselves. Our censorship people do their job and cut this sort of thing out of films that are imported. They mark some 'For Adults Only', but how can children and teenagers be controlled when no longer do they go to the theatre but millions of them watch films on the television screens in the freedom of their own homes? Such films, if allowed, would be shown on television within a year or two or even within a few months. Parents are being forced to send their children and teenagers off to bed. Tbe pressure on parents is terrific. It is unfair to subject them to this type of thing when Bringing up children is tought enough today without this kind of film to make it harder. The only way to keep children's minds away from such depravity is not to show depravity in films. It is as simple as that. The greatest films of all time, as 1 have said, contained no sexual depravity at all. They were outstandingly free from the sort of filth that was shown a few nights ago to a selected group in the Parliament by the Minister for Customs and Excise( Mr private enterprise has in this field today, Chipp). were not back in time. Honourable members know what is done with sewage. It goes deep underground. I put these films at the same level. We are crying out about the pollution of cities, harbours and beaches, and are making a great outcry for action. But the apologists for the ending of censorship condone the pollution of man's mind, and that is far more serious than the pollution of a few cities. They do this without any disapproval at all. I honestly cannot understand their attitude or inconsistency. I realise that censorship, in one sense, is the denial of freedom. But1 ask: Freedom for whom? Is it freedom to the producers who make these quick, cheap films which have such a devastating effect on the impressionable people who view them? It may be all right for adults. They can probably take it without any effect. I am thinking about the thousands of people who are not yet adults. The censors have a responsibility here to keep these corrupting films out of Australia or from being produced in Australia. I have found nothing yet to change me from being a censorship man. I do not make any apology for it. I would still feel that way until we could have films produced around the world and in this country that were free from such depravity beyond the need for censorship. It is argued that that is the way to sell films. I have proved to come forth to the Government since this honourable members this afternoon that the best films that were ever produced were produced without that sort of thing, and they have brought in millions and millions of dollars. I appreciate very much what the Government has done in this new field of enterprise. One honourable member chided us by saying that we might nationalise this industry if we became the government. We would not decide on that at this moment, but if the industry failed even with Government help and had to be rescued entirely perhaps by a government taking it over, nationalisation may have to be the ultimate solution. Let us give private enterprise in co-operation with Government a chance to make this work. I feel that with all the talents, all the energies and all the initiative coupled with financial assistance, we can make a success of the mm industry in Australia. It is absolutely essential to do so and on the highest possible level we can put it, because in the end the type of films which were seen the other night here and which were censored so heavily would ultimately kill the industry that produced them. We cannot continue feeding on films of that type forever. There conies a time when we will probably cry out in horror against them. So let this Corporation help to lift the standard of film making in this country and perhaps give a lead to the whole world. the temptation to comment on the censorship matters which the honourable member for Wilmot( Mr Duthie) raised. IfI could take a word out of the speech of the honourable member for Franklin( Mr Sherry), I think the honourable member for Wilmot is a pretty hard act to follow. I hope we will have the opportunity in this House one day to debate at length the whole subject of censorship so that it can be discussed in some form of totality and in context. I do not agree with the honourable member for Wilmot that censorship can be viewed as if looking at a black and white film; there are no blacks and there are no whites in the subject. I believe it is not an easy subject to discuss in public unless the whole subject is covered at some length.

72,Mr Dobie (Cook) [5.23],"I shall resistlegislation was brought before the House. Once again we are seeing the implementation of policies laid down by the Prime Minister( Mr Gorton) on 8th October last. More importantly, and as mentioned in the Governor General's Speech, we are seeing a clear demonstration of the willingness of the Gorton Government to foster and develop Australia's performing arts. As all honourable members will know, the Government, acting on the recommendation of the Australian Council for the Arts, established an interim council to investigate and report on the best way of setting up a national film and television training school. For this purpose I believe $100,000 was allocated while another $200,000 has already been allocated for experimental film making. Of course it is still early days as far as their experimental work is concerned but nobody would deny the need for such experimentation in a country where so much pioneering film making took place and where over the past generation or two the Australian film industry has fallen away from commercial importance and, I am told by those who have persevered in the industry, away from commercial profit as well. For example, there is an Australian film showing in Sydney at the moment which clearly illustrates the great, if not the crying, need for development away from and above the standards that this film has created. It is pleasing then to know that the Corporation to be established by the Bill before the House will seek, and I now quote from the second reading speech of the Prime Minister: To encourage the production of films which 1970 which I believe the House should are box office successes and which have those hear. It says, referring to this legislation: excellences of production, camera work and technical presentation which justify the description 'high quality'. Now we are all aware of the keen interest instead of building on this basis, the Government of Prime Minister Gorton in fostering all should mercifully perform euthanasia and start forms of artistic and cultural development from scratch with untried but ambitious raw and in the February newsletter of the Aushuman material which has the capacity for tralian Film Council it was pleasing to note growth. that in its opinion-that is, the industry itself-h e was the first Australian Prime Minister to acknowledge the existence of an Australian film industry. I have no doubt this fact is well and loudly acknowledged by all branches of the Australian performing arts. It is not my intention to repeat what has already been said by honourable members on both sides of the House who have already spoken. We would all agree the standard of speeches has been very high, particularly the speech of the honourable member for Franklin. The figures quoted and the articles to which reference has been made have obviously been read by all of us and I do not intend to repeat them. But I believe that there are signs that the Australian film industry has not disappeared forever. For example, Mr John McCallum, President of the Australian Film Council and a man of great yet diverse achievements in the film industry throughout the English speaking world, said in a letter to the Australian Financial Review dated 14th April 1970: Most of the 15,000 members we represent have been working tenaciously for some time to make films under conditions which are more difficult than those confronting other industries-legisla tion more honoured in the breach than the observance, restrictive marketing practices, no Government help (until recently) and no tariff protection (except in the case of advertising films for television . . .

But I believe it would be a sad day if this advice were followed by any Government and by any Party and I can assure the editor of this newspaper that it will never be the policy of this Government to destroy any art form which can develop Australia into a mature nation.

Commenting on this need for this Bill and all the things that sort of film she said: we hope it will achieve. But I think we ought to bear in mind that, in recent years, of 'Age of Consent' should be enough to convince a steady decline has taken place in the large any adult filmgoer of the total inadequacy, so far film groups producing films. Hollywood is as on the decline if we look at it in terms of uses Australia as a location. The fact that this the great extravaganzas that used to be profilm is doing roaring business here al present does duced. The great stars of just a few years not disprove my point; it rather suggests ibe ago are no so important as they were once. grounds, We often find that the stars of the films screen.

Such is the precarious nature of the film I think that what we must seek to do with industry. It is interesting to note also that some independent original groups of film makers. of the most popular films these days are This brings me to the point that 1 want to productions made on a shoestring.

I am prepared to These are modest productions by Hollywood accept thai in fact, in view of the apparent standards. One has to try to analyse what interest of the Prime Minister( Mr Gorton), this development might mean. I think that the Corporation may well be the right the reason for the popularity of these films honourable gentleman's baby and bis prime is that the age of the theatregoer is falling. interest. Also, I am prepared to accept that Older people tend to remain at home and at this stage the group of advisers that he observe the films on the 'telly' in the luxury has around him may well beI am not of their lounge rooms or wherever the telesaying that they are-the best available in vision set may be. The age of the filmgoer the community. But that is not the basis on is tending to fall. It is perhaps less than 30 which a corporation such as this should be years of age. Surprisingly, young people are not interested in frivolous films. They seem to be interested in films with social commentaries, even films with severe, unrelenting, highly critical commentaries of many of our accepted hopes and values. I think that all of the films that I have mentioned come into that category. So if we look at what we are trying to do in Australia it would seem that the need is not to encourage the super-duper feature film. This inevitably The overstrained, manufactured Australia nism Australian self-interpretation is concerned, of the Britishor American-based film project which extent of audience-hunger to see Australian backAustralian life and performers on the this Corporation is to encourage small founded. After all, it is dependent on the insight of the Prime Minister. What happens if he goes and somebody with a rather narrower horizon than he has is in the position of deciding on the composition of the Corporation? Quite clearly it will be somebody like that who will decide on the composition of the Corporation. What happens if someone with rather limited horizons comes to stack the Corporation? This is something one mustworry about, and I hope that the Government will think about it a little. In addition-and we have also hinted at this-the claim that someone who has a financial interest in film production should therefore be automatically prevented from taking part in this Corporation is wrong. If we are to find the best available people in the country to best advise the Government on assistance for the film industry, we are most likely to find that sort of advice in the ranks of film producers, directors, actors, technicians and so forth. We are unlikely to find them in groups of laymen like myself, who have an average man's interest in these things. I am well aware of my shortcomings in understanding the problems of the film industry. I wish to conclude by suggesting that, as laudable as the Bill isI am not wanting for one moment to detract from it1 hope that the Government will seriously consider the amendment we have suggested, which does not go as far as I would like to suggest it should go. But it at least removes the bar to the best types of people we should be encouraging to take part in the functioning of this Corporation. Customs and Excise) [5.42]I applaud and support this Bill, which is a Bill to devote a considerable sum of money to encourage the film industry in Australia. All of us would hope that the film industry, through this encouragement, will develop to such a stage that we will be proud of the films we are making and that they will be of such a quality that they will be marketed and sold abroad and earn valuable export income. I have consulted the Cinematographic Regulations relating to the export of films, and after consultation with my Department I have decided to cancel the film regulations which as some honourable members may know, still control the export of Australian made films. The most vital part of these regulations reads as follows: (iii) an export permit will not be granted if the film or slide That relates to the days of the old magic latern slides(a) is blasphemous, indecent or obscene; (b) is likely to be injurious to morality, or to encourage or incite to crime; (c) is likely to be offensive to the people of a friendly nation or to the people of a part of the Queen's dominions; (d) depicts a matter the exhibition of which is undesirable in the public interest; or (e) is likely to prove detrimental or prejudicial to the Commonwealth. Those regulations still apply to films made in Australia for export, which means that any film made under the assistance of this Bill would have to cross the threshold of the provisions of those regulations. In other words, every film made for export would have to be censored in terms of those criteria. T believe that would be an absurd situation, and to my mind it would be unthinkable to restrict the creativity of Australian film makers by imposing regulations which would merely be a strait-jacket for those trying to make films to compete on the world's markets. It is therefore my intention to cancel those regulations. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Message from Governor General recommending appropriation announced. In Committee The Bill. man, with the compassionate consideration for which you have become renowned, may I be permitted to make one observation quickly before I proceed to move the amendment circulated in my name? The observation relates to the announcement which has just been made by the Minister for Customs and Excise (Mt Chipp). I heartily commend him for this proposal. One of the celebrated cases which pointed to the ridiculousness of this export embargo concerned the film produced in 1969 by an Australian and entitled 'Sketch on Abigail's Belly'. The producer applied to the Commonwealth Censorship Board for an export permit to show it at the Oberhausen Film Festival. Because of the delays he proceeded and sent the film by mail. It made the finals and received a",50,Australian Film Development Corporation Bill 1970
75,Mr Chipp (Hotham,Minister for,52,Australian Film Development Corporation Bill 1970
76,Mr Hayden (Oxley) [5.45],"Mr Chairdiploma. Because he had sent it by mail and without the authority of the Censorship Board he was fined $50. This is a rather ridiculous situation. Another thing is that if it is good enough to remove censorship controls from films produced in Australia which will be exported it is reasonable enough to be consistent and say that we ought to apply the same sort of standards to those films which are imported. However, 1 probably am trespassing a little too far to continue in this direction in the Committee stage. I move: That in clause 6, page 3, line 29, omil 'appointed art world. In other words, he stands to gain as a member if , insert 'precluded from appointment as a member because'. What this means quite simply is that under clause 6 as it stands, a person who has a pecuniary interest in the film industry would be precluded from serving on the Australian Film Development Corporation. We feel that this is unreasonable. The Corporation is not some sort of purely materialistic money-making organisation within society. It is an organisation which, we would hope, will aim at achieving standards of excellence in areas of artistic endeavour. The people involved in it. we would hope, would represent a wide spectrum of expertise, business acumen, professional acumen and administrative capacity. 1 seems obvious to us that if we are to seek to achieve these standards of excellence in our artistic effort we will have to attract to the Corporation people with the best ability and the best qualifications in the various fields which will be represented on the Corporation. Quite clearly, among those people who will be best qualified within the film industry will be people who, in some cases anyway, have a pecuniary interest in that industry. The Bill requires that they must disclose their interest. So long as they disclose this interest before sitting on the Corporation; it. seems not unreasonable to me that they should be allowed to sit on that Corporation. Where a conflict of interest arose-and remember that there will be 5 members on the Corporation, not 1, 2 or 3-thi s would be patently apparent and appropriate steps would be taken, 1 am sure, by the person concerned, as a moral obligation, to ensure that he had no involvement in the decision making process on that specific occasion. May I draw the attention of honourable members to what seem to me to be two important analogies, one of which relates to the United States of America. The Chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts, which was set up by President Johnson, is Mr Roger L. Stevens. Mr Stevens has indisputably contributed a dynamic force lo the promotion o.f the arts in the United States of America since he has achieved this position. Mr Stevens, while being Chairman of this Endowment, concurrently holds pecuniary interests in some sections of the from his involvement in a business associated with the promotion of art. Mr Stevens has found no impediment because of this pecuniary interest in contributing quite generously and quite beneficially to the promotion of the arts through the National Endowment. I suggest this is a good example of the sort of arrangement I have in mind. I feel it upholds the argument I am putting to the House. The second case concerns industrial advisory committees of various types which the Government has formed. It has a defence advisory committee, an industrial advisory committee and others. 1 cannot remember them all. Each of these committees is manned by people who are in fact magnates of the business world and who stand to gain in a very real sense from some of the decisions that the Government makes. I refer the Minister, or any other person who wants to dispute this point, to Sir John Allison's Queal Memorial Lecture in Adelaide in the earlier part of the last decade, where he discussed the role of these advisory committees. If it is good enough for the Government to have these advisory committees which are directly related to very many topics, it seems more than good enough for the Government to allow a person with a pecuniary interest to sit on the Corporation. Ft seems to me a narrow minded suspicion that someone who has a pecuniary interest must therefore be a person who cannot be trusted and who will exploit his situation for personal gain. Some people will do this, but not all people are like that. Frankly, I believe as a general statement that people do feel a moral commitment lo society, and when they are given a public responsibility they do their best to discharge it honestly and conscientiously. I repeat that if a man discloses his interest in a section of the film industry there should be no problems at all. The next subject which I would like to raise with the Minister for the Navy( Mr port by investment in this industry. Killen), who is at the table, is found in clauses 20 and 21 of the Bill. If the Minister will apply his forensic skills to these clausesI know that he will give us his usual precisely distended ambiguity when he explains the implications of them. He is a celebrated advocate of the courts and an even more celebrated Minister of State. So it is fair enough to ask him to give us the benefit of his experience. Clause 20 states: The functions of tbe Corporation are to encourbut not deliberately created. The Corporaage the making of Australian films and to encourage the distribution of Australianfilmsboth within and outside Australia. Does this mean that the Corporation will have authority to make recommendations to the Government about such things as quality, tariff controls, import controls, tax concessions or methods to encourage quality of production of films. I will put this to him shortly rather than take up the time of the Committee any further. I refer next to clause 21 which says: The Corporation has power to do all things necessary or convenient to be done for or in conthe merit of the project and that it had nection with the performance of its function It goes on in sub-clause (1.) (c) to say: to provide financial assistance to producers of Australian films. . . . I will not go into tbe details of it. Does this mean in fact that the Government would be prepared to take up the initial investment in a. proposed film venture? There is some sort of unintentional conflict or vagueness on this point in the second reading speech of the Prime Minister( Mr clause 21. It does not lay down in advance Gorton); I wish he had dealt with this more specifically. Will it be the Government's policy always to demand-ther e seemed to be an implication of this in the Prime Minister's speech-that there should already be an equity on the part of the producer, the director and the other investors in the proposed film enterprise before the Government will be prepared to commit itself? I suggest it would be more desirable for the Government to take up the initial investment as an indication of good faith and as evidence that it is a worthy project to support. This would encourage outside investors who may be contemplating making an investment in the enterprise. This would be the more practical way of encouraging more prompt supNavy) [5.55]-If I could take the questions put by the honourable member for Oxlsy( Mr Hayden) in reverse order, I will first of all deal with clause 21. Clause 21 does not lay down any a priori directions as to how the Corporation shall work. The clause is cast deliberately in very broad language to provide financial assistance to producers of Australian films. IfI may I will correct an impression that has been erroneously tion will not be a film producer. It will provide financial assistance but plainly the Corporation could not be expected to go off oh some silly frolic of its own. It will direct its efforts and attention only to those enterprises that would seem on the balance of probabilities to have some prospects of success. As I understand the honourable gentleman's question on this point, he may have had in mind the case of some well deserving project that was under way but was lacking in financial backing. I would imagine that the Corporation would assist, if arguments were put to it which showed every reasonable chance of success. If the honourable member looks at the language of clauses 20 and 21 as a whole, he will see that they are deliberately cast in a very broad way. They are not definitive because, as I am sure the honourable member will agree, the functions of the Corporation may take a little time to shake down. That is certainly the way I read any particular way in which the Corporation shall function. It leaves it to the essential good sense of the members of the Corporation. In regard to the question of the honourable member concerning clause 20, the short answer would be no, the Corporation could not assume the responsibilities that are now presently entrusted to the Tariff Board. However, I could contemplate a set of circumstances in which the Corporation may make a suggestion to the Tariff Board Mr HaydenA general sort of statement.",52,Australian Film Development Corporation Bill 1970
77,Mr Killen (Moreton,"Minister for theit would not, as I read the Bill, seek to play a role which would in any sense rival the Tariff Board. The language of clause 20 is broad and it does not restrict the Corporation unnecessarily. It gives it, as it were, a very wide charter indeed. I deal now with the amendment which has been moved by the honourable gentleman. ] do not think he had his heart in it. I would start by saying that the comparison that he invited us to draw with the gentlemen in the United States of America is not completely a realistic one. As I recall the language used by the honourable member for Oxley, he spoke of the American Arts Council. We have here the Australian Arts Council, and it may be fair to compare one with the other. We may well find people on the Australian Arts Council who have pecuniary interests in industries associated either closely or peripherally with the arts in Australia in one form or another. The Films Committee of the Australian Arts Council in Australia recommended the insertion of the provision which is now found is clause 6. But it is not only because the Films Committee of the Australian Arts Council made that recommendation that it has been included in clause 6. I invite the honourable member to look at the principle which rests Committee's report? recommendations and the Government did not follow them up. The Minister has just indicated that because a committee recommends something it is always followed up. all. I would ask the honourable member not to be impatient. I am saying it is not merely because tbe Films Committee of the Australian Arts Council made a recommendation to this effect that the Government has accepted it. What resides in clause 6 is good sense because it does not allow for a conflict of interest of a person sitting on the body and advising it. For that reason the amendment is not accepted. Progress reported. Sitting suspended from 6.1 to 8 p.m. Ministerial Statement -by leave-Sinc e 1965, Australian ground formations have been engaged with our allies in resisting armed attack on the Government of South Vietnam. Since that time, the question of whether Australian forces should have helped resist that attack has been debated in Australia. This Government, as previous governments, has approached this question in the spirit which was crystallised in one sentence by the right honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) when he was Leader of the Opposition. That sentence is: The overriding issue which this Parliament has to deal with at all times . . . must be judged by this one crucial test: What best promotes our national security, what best guarantees our national survival. The Government believes that judged on this standard, our engagement in Vietnam is right and that it does best promote our national security, and we believe that for these reasons: It is surely incontrovertible that in Vietnam aggression is taking place and is being resisted. It is surely incontrovertible that the war there is only being sustained because large numbers of troops from North Vietnam are constantly dispatched to invade and subjugate the South, and that if that troop flow stopped the war would stop. Resistance to such aggression does best promote our national security, because we must strive to ensure that history is not repeated and that invasion and aggression is not allowed to be successful. For if it is successful, then the short span of history through which many of us in this chamber have lived shows that once successful, it is repeated and repealed until it becomes insufferable and has to be stopped-bu t stopped at a cost in blood and treasure infinitely greater than would have been the case had it been stopped at its initiation. Surely something of what happened in the last generation can be taken as experience by the present one. We saw Fascist and Nazi aggression raging unchecked and subjecting one small country after another to conquest until it had to be stopped-a t the cost of a world war-whic h need not have happened had the aggression been stopped at its beginning. I thought that these lessons, which, let us never forget are of",54,Australian Film Development Corporation Bill 1970

83,Mr Gorton (Higgins,"Prime Minister)more import to small nations than to large, had been learned. Because for some years after the close of the Second World War, resolute action was taken to resist and defeat subversion in Malaya as it then was. This took some 12 long years or moreyears when civilians were murdered by terrorists-whe n bands of guerillas with grenades and Sten guns sought to overthrow by force a government the people in Malaya wanted. Australians were there, with British and local forces, resisting that aggression. We were told then-and the words are strikingly familiar today: 'Australians should not be in Malaya. The war will go on forever. It cannot be won'. But it was won. That aggression was not successful and Australia's national security was best promoted because of that lack of success. Then we saw aggression in Korea. We saw the people of the North sweep across the frontiers of the South in armed formations. Because the prevention of aggression, then, was the basic concept of the United Nations, we saw United Nations forces moving to defeat that aggression. Australians were there. And the aggression was defeated. And Australian national security was best promoted because it was defeated. We saw, and the principle is the same, Malaysia threatened during the confrontation and armed incursions into Malaysian territory. Australia helped to repel this aggression. And our national interest was best served by this. And then we saw the pattern repeated in Vietnam. It is Communist aggression there as it was in Korea and Malaya, but the source of the aggression-significan t though it may be-is not as significant as the fact that it was aggression. For the Government believes that if small nations are to survive and prosper, then aggression from whatever source-whethe r it is inspired by Communism, Fascism or old fashioned nationalism-mus t not be allowed to succeed. The one consistent thread of principlethat small nations are best rendered secure if other small nations are not allowed to be overrun-ha s distinguished our policy through the post-war years. That is why we are in Vietnam, and that we should be there is a proposition supported by three of the significant political parties in Australia and opposed by one-the Labor Party. I put it to the House that Australian security is bound up with seeing that aggression does not succeed. I put it to the House that it is immoral to launch aggression but not immoral to resist it. This is a proposition which has been twisted and turned inside out by those who cry that this is an immoral war. So it is-bu t the immorality is in those who began it, who continue to invade, who will not negotiate for peace, who are bent on conquest and nothing but conquest. We have said that successful invasion of South Vietnam by the North would lead to further attempts at conquest in Laos, in Cambodia, and on the frontiers of Thailand. This was scouted and denied by those in the ranks of the Opposition who support the case of the invaders. But the history of recent days shows, I submit, how dangerously wrong they were. Sir, I have thought it necessary to speak of this background in discussing the latest decisions on our participation in Vietnam. It was and is right for us to help to stem aggression. It was and is in our national interest-and that of all small nations-for aggression to be defeated. It is in our interest to help to secure by negotiation peace with self determination for the people of South Vietnam. And in the meanwhile, while the invader will not negotiate, it is right to help resist him. Against this background, I speak to the House of the Government's decision. Following a review of the situation in Vietnam which led to the earlier United States decisions to reduce the level of its forces by 115,000 by the middle of this month, President Nixon yesterday announced his decision to introduce a new and long range programme of United States troop reductions involving the withdrawal of 150,000 men over the next 12 months. On 16th December last I announced the Government's decision that when the military situation in Vietnam permitted a further substantial withdrawal of allied troops, then some Australian units would be included in the numbers scheduled for withdrawal. Since then we have, with South Vietnam and the other allies, continued to keep developments and prospects in Vietnam under close study. The Communist side maintains its intransigence and continues to set its face against a negotiated settlement. There is no progress to report as regards peace talks. As the President has stated, there has been some overall decline in enemy force levels in South Vietnam in the last few months, though their actions in Laos and Cambodia must give us all cause for concern. The development that gives encouragement is the progress in what has been called 'Vietnamisation'-the movement towards South Vietnamese self reliance. We see one result of this in the progressive reduction of allied forces. But it must be understood that 'Vietnamisation' means much more than the assumption by South Vietnamese forces of a greater share of the combat burden. Behind it lies a massive programme of expanding and modernising those forces. And behind that again is the progressive assumption by South Vietnam of the responsibility for all aspects of the wara war fought across the widest fronts, embracing a complexity of military, political, psychological, social and economic factors. In all these areas much still remains to be done by South Vietnam, assisted by its allies across a wide civil and military spectrum. Yet progress has been such that important qualitative changes are being made, and will continue to be made, in regard to the assistance required by and given to the Government of South Vietnam in pursuit of the objective shared over the years by that Government and its allies. 1 reiterate that that objective is to establish the circumstances in which South Vietnam can determine its own future without fear. There can be no thought of abandoning that objective by a precipitate withdrawal of allied forces. But in continuing to give assistance to South Vietnam, that it will, then at some stage during the our intention will be to take account of their own growing strength and to strike the additional troops into the planned withmost appropriate balance between an Australian military contribution and other forms of Australian assistance to Vietnam: We are mindful particularly that the process of 'Vietnamisation' obtains no less in Phuoc Tuy Province than in other parts of Vietnam and that it is both desirable and feasible for Australia to undertake, as the circumstances permit, qualitative changes in the shape of our overall contribution towards the goal we seek. Accordingly, I now announce to the House that after consultation in recent weeks with the governments of Vietnam and the United States, who understand and accept our approach, the Government has decided that one Australian infantry battalion and some supporting personnel will be withdrawn from South Vietnam. This reduction to our force in Vietnam will be effected by withdrawing, without replacement, the 8th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, which at present is scheduled to complete its tour of duty in November next. This will require a modification of the role at present played by our forcesa modification made feasible by the forces of Vietnamisation and national acceptance of responsibility by the Vietnamese themselves in Phuoc Tuy. But let no-one say that because there is a modification of the role we play therefore we should play no role at alt. Reducing our forces because the Vietnamese arc able to assume more responsibility is one thing. Totally removing our forces before the Vietnamese are able to accept full responsibility for replacing them is quite another. The timing of the battalion's departure from Vietnam remains to be determined. It will be governed by general circumstances within the area in which Australian forces are operating and by the progress of Australian projects to assist the growth of greater capability in the South Vietnamese forces, and I shall touch on those later. Whether or not the battalion's departure may be brought forward from the November date will depend on developments in these fields. After the initial withdrawal, should the progress of pacification and Vietnamisation succeed as the President hopes and believes 12-month period, we will consider phasing drawal. But the future situation is so uncertain and the future strategical situation so unpredictable that it is impossible to be any more definite than this. In co-operation with the Government of South Vietnam, in pursuit of our basic objectives, we are actively examining further ways in which we can contribute to the growth in South Vietnamese self-reliance. Following consultations with the Vietnamese Government, we have decided to provide a number of small mobile Army teams, totalling some 130 men. to work with the regional and popular forces in Phuoc Tuy province. The teams will have a liaison and training function and will operate on a pattern similar to that developed by some members of our existing Army Advisory Training Group, which will continue its work. We are also developing a further proposal that Australia provide instructors and other assistance to a South Vietnamese training centre for junior leaders -leader s of the popular forces and regional forces-planne d for establishment on the site which will be vacated by the Australian battalion to be withdrawn from Vietnam. It is envisaged that courses at this centre, which would accommodate 400 to 500 students at a time, would give particular attention to instruction in methods of jungle warfare which have been developed by Australian forces. In addition. Cabinet will give urgent families in Australia and the whole standattention to the results of comprehensive ing of this country, then better preparation studies now being made of other forms of would have been given. assistance which might be offered to Vietnam.

The Prime Minister's statefied the commitment on 1great ground: The war in Vietnam, he claimed, was part of the downward thrust of China between the Indian and the Pacific Oceans. Subsequently the justification has been narrowed to 'teaching North Vietnam that aggression could not succeed'. All along it has been these false interpretations of-the nature of the conflict in Indo-China that have trapped us into false responses foredoomed to failure. Tonight the Prime Minister has done nothing to dispel, the aura of unreality which has for so long vitiated his Government's policies. In particular, there is the same refusal to grasp the implications of President Nixon's statement yesterday that characterised his refusal to admit the full implications of President Johnson's crucial statement of 31st March 1968. The crux of President Nixon's statement is that, irrespective of military events in Indo-China, irrespective of progress in Paris, American disengagement is irreversible. Despite the deterioration of the situation in Indo-China the process of disengagement is being speeded up. The kernel of the President's statement is this plain, specific fact that a further 150,000 combat troops are to be withdrawn within a year. The manner the President chose to present this fact to the American public does not alter its meaning, and the full impact of its meaning can be measured when set against the terrible and tragic events in other parts of Indo-China in the past month. What the President has admitted by his action transcends his explanation of his action. He has admitted that the whole Vietnam venture has been a terrible and tragic mistake-that is the real meaning of his statement. The whole and sole purpose of American policy is to extricate the United States from that mistake. The situation in Indo-China is far too serious for the injection of exercises in self justification such as the Prime Minister indulged in tonight. It is all very well for him to state that our policy in Vietnam has succeeded: Let those believe it who choose. Yet there is a real menace in these efforts to depict Vietnam as a success. It is not just a distortion of history; it is a refusal to learn the lessons of Vietnam. If you claim that you have succeeded in Vietnam, if you assert that your objectives are being achieved, then you are in fact justifying in advance a repetition of Vietnam. Why would one choose to abandon successful methods? This is a dangerous delusion. God knows, the United. States, the people of Indo-China, have paid, are paying a terrible enough price for the lessons of Vietnam. Are we to refuse to learn them in order to save somebody's political skin? It is time to end trying to save face and start trying to save lives. There is a fearful symmetry about the 5 years of Government pronouncements about Vietnam. They began with pretences and they are ending tonight with pretences. On 29th April 1965 we had the pretence that our involvement was required by our obligations under the South East Asia Treaty Organisation. We had the further pretence that our commitment was a simple response to a simple request from the then Government of one Dr Quat, the tenth Prime Minister to succeed the assassinated President. Diem. Tonight we have the pretence that the reduction in our commitment is related to developments in South Vietnam and in particular in the province of Phuoc Tuy where our troops have been engaged for 4 years. Yet everyone knows that what was said in Canberra tonight was contingent solely on what was said at San Clemente yesterday. Let us drop the pretence that this is an independent decision reached on the basis of the military situation in Phuoc Tuy or the political situation in South Vietnam as a whole. This announcement has come not because we are 'Vietnamising' Phuoc Tuy but because we are following America in de-Americanising Vietnam. The Minister for External Affairs show away when he was overseas last week. In Bangkok he said: Australia will announce a partial pull-out of its troops in South Vietnam if President Nixon gives a specific withdrawal figure on Thursday. He continued: If the United States does not pull out Australia will follow the negative move. Then he went to Saigon itself where the following exchange occurred: Question: Did South Vietnamese leaders bring up the question of Australian troop withdrawals? Answer: No, they did not. Question: Did you volunteer your views? Answer: I did have a long talk, a very long talk, with President Thieu and 1 did inform him",58,Vietnam

But I did confirm and he already ter said were hypothetical last year are knew it, so it wasn't necessary for me to confirm it, that we would take action in certain continhappening this year. These events have gencies. He accepted that fact. He knew about it been set in train irreversibly. The time has It is only if we grasp this fact-that the decisions by this Government have nothing to do with the real situation in Indo-China -that we can explain why the Government now thinks it is possible to reduce the commitment piecemeal when that was supposed to be totally impossible and irresponsible only a few months ago. Right up to the eve of the October election the Prime Minister held to the line that 'when and if an Australian withdrawal occurred it would be 1 out all out'. In his last television broadcast before the pre-election shut-down, he said: The size and composition of the Australian ground forces in Vietnam is such that it would not be possible to have a phased withdrawal. The Prime Minister had developed and reiterated this argument throughout last year. On 6th July he said, also on television: I think that the suggestion of phasing down the' Australian contribution of infantrymen and artillerymen and people driving tanks which is somewhere around 8,000-no t quite 8,000 men ] think the suggestion of phasing that down is scarcely tenable. The force was built up to 3 battalions with its artillery and with its tanks because that was a viable force. You could have 2 battalions in the field and I resting and that gave you much much more capacity than if you only had 2 battalions there because you could only have I in the field and I resting. Although it may mathematically sound as if it is only twice as good, in fact it is better than twice as good. So yon would be very very much cutting down the military capacity of the force there and of course, I would think you would be increasing tbe danger to the ones that remained there if you didn't have a self-contained viable force. on 6th July. He went on to say: So the question would rather be, if it arose, whether we should have troops-groun d troopsthere or whether we should not. And then he was asked: 'Would we scale down comparably, that was really the question', and he replied: '1 think not scale down. I think a time would have to come I don't foresee it-bu t it would have to come when if there was a great and continuing American withdrawal, we would has become solely the war of a political have to decide whether we left troops there Party-the Liberal Party. It is no longer or not.' Now all tbe things that the Prime Miniscome. The people of Australia, not least Australia's armed forces in Vietnam, are entitled to know why the untenable last year is now not only tenable but, according to the Government, desirable. Conversely and more directly, why is the undertaking of one out all out not being honoured? Some are to come out. Why not all? The question further arises of the Prime Minister's integrity in making the statements that he did last year. Was it the considered view of the Cabinet? Was it the view of the Chiefs of Staff? Was it the view of our commanders in Phuoc Tuy? Or was it merely a cheap riposte to Labors proposal to achieve a phased withdrawal in 3 stages by June this year using the method of non-replacement as the serving battalions completed their tours? Whatever his motives, the people were entitled to believe, presumably did believe, that it was meant seriously and sincerely. So were the troops and their relatives entitled to take it seriously. It was a statement of policy-no t just a single statement but statement after statement by the Prime Minister of this country. What has invalidated it? Why has this undertaking been dishonoured? It is just part and parcel of the deceit and deception that has characterised the Liberals and particularly the Liberal leadership throughout this tragic and disastrous chapter. There is indeed only one bright fen lure in the whole of that commitment and that is the conduct of the men of the armed forces themselves. They have done their Minister duty-hav e done it in the first war in Australian history opposed always by a substantia] section of the Australian people and now by a majority of the Australian people. In the light of the undertakings given by the Prime Minister last year and in the light of his statement tonight it is intolerable that they should be called upon for further sacrifices in so discredited and disastrous a cause.

Debate (on motion by Mr Jarman) the pay off would not be such that it would adjourned. In Committee Consideration resumed (vide page 1456). Dr CASS (Maribyrnong) [8.37]I would like to refer to the comments made by the Minister for the Navy( Mr Killen). He suggested that it was unwise to have on I do not believe that this is necessarily a strong argument against the case being film producers on it. However, I still adhere to the claim that we are trying to make: That if this Corporation is to judge the I am aware of the feeling that there is Let us assume that one of our film experts on the Corporation had a biased view. In those circumstances I suggest that have a crippling effect on the Corporation. What would be sought, in terms of money, would not be all that much. Even if one ot the individuals involved in the judgment had some tenuous association with one of the applicants then surely there would be only 2 possibilities. The first is that tbe group which obtains the money, with the assistance of one of its spokesmen who are on the Corporation, might fail to produce a worthwhile film. That is one possibility and in that case the Commonwealth would lose some money. I grant that that could happen. One could hardly say that the individual on the Corporation had gained anything through giving perhaps slightly unwise advice. All he has done has been to ruin his own chances for the future. I do not feel that we have lost all that much. On the other hand, supposing that, on the advice of this gunfieman, the Corporation gives some funds to a group with which he has some slight connection and it produces a significant film, then surely we have lost nothing but have gained a lot. We have benefited from the fact that the gentleman with this intimate knowledge of film production has given wise advice. So, with all due respect to the Government's fears and suspicions, even at the worse we would lose very little, whereas at the best we would have a lot to gain. 1 suggest that the standard of (he advice would be potentially much better than if the only pool of advisers we had were people who had no intimate knowledge of film production. That is the key to the proposal that the Opposition is making. As we said before, we are strongly in favour of the Bill but we are seeking to ensure that the best possible advice is tendered to the Corporation. We suggest that this can only be obtained if the people serving on the Corporation have some intimate, direct, active working knowledge of the production of films. states quite categorically and quite specifically that members of the proposed Film Development Corporation will be appointed from amongst persons of standing and varied experience. 1 have no argument with that. In fact J think that this is as it should be. But1 cannot for the life of me accept that part of the legislation which will penalise people in a particularly sensitive and creative industry who have experience in that industry. 1 know that the Minister for the Navy( Mr Killen) has pointed out, very cogently, the reason why this particular clause was inserted in the Bill. To come back to the point that has been made, surely it follows that, if we are to set up a corporation to advise into which film making activities moneys will be channelled and if we then prevent anybody who has a pecuniary interest in that industry from being appointed, we are robbing the industry of the expertise that it needs. This is a very complicated industry. It needs imagination, creative originality and I am sure that this will appeal to our Liberal colleaguesa great deal of business acumen. Tf we are going to deny these people the opportunity of appointment to the Corporation by virtue of the fact that they possess business acumen and the ability to assess the creative originality of a film and its potential both commercial and artistic, then this seems to me to be a very odd attitude to take. The Corporation most certainly would need the best possible experience that it could obtain. I do not think that the amendment we are proposing is audacious. I think it is a very business like amendment. If we are going to establish a precedent, as has been done in the Bill, by denying representation on the Corporation to people who are possessed of expertise in an industry that is particularly difficult at the best of times, then the Opposition cannot agree with the proposition. We have said before that it is our sincere and honest desire that the Bill should go through and that the Corporation should become a living entity to provide the sort of stimulus that is needed for not a flagging industry but an almost non-existent industry. I come back to my original point. If the Government robs the film industry of the expertise that it so badly needs then, in the Opposition's view, it will destroy the whole proposition that it has sought to put forward. I ask all honourable members to accept the amendment because it in no way sets out to destroy the fabric that has been set up in the Bill. In fact, it would add quality to the Corporation and certainly the expertise and the business acumen that it will most certainly need.",60,Vietnam
88,Mr Sherry (Franklin) [8.42],"The BillNavy) [8.45]I do not know whether the honourable member for Franklin( Mr cryptically describe it, and the honourable Sherry) is completely conscious of the weight of his own argument, but he has persuaded me to accept his argument as being one which is untrammelled in its support of the existing provision. The honourable gentleman referred to the fact that what is needed is. business acumen. That is the term he used. I point out to my honourable friend that the whole character of the Corporation is directed towards putting the emphasis upon business acumen, which I repeat is the very argument that the honourable gentleman used. If, on the other hand, my friend had said that the emphasis is upon the Corporation having an artistic, cultural or theatrical acumen, then he would have had a lot of weight on his side. But he has elected to put the enphasis upon business acumen. My friend is precisely right. This is exactly wards those who do practise in the courts. what the Corporation is designed to do. Before the suspension for dinner I tried .to explain that the Corporation does not whistle off on a frolic of its own, taking the view that some particular form of film activity should be encouraged or discouraged. It looks to see where it can, for the most part, secure a maximum amount of value-no t for my friend's money, not for my money and not for the Government's money, but for the taxpayers' money. I am sure that my honourable friend will agree that that is the essence of good sense. that? for Oxley, who led for the Opposition on this matter, is predictably unpredictable. 1 will illustrate that simple proposition. I know that my honourable friend has the greatest of difficulty in following the most elementary of proposals, but I will try to reduce it to an even subsumed level of elementariness. honourable member later. Let us imagine that the Government said: 'Now, John James is going to be appointed as a member of the Film Corporation', if I may so member for Oxley came in and said, with his cheerful mien: 'Oh, but John James has got lengthy and extensive business interests with the film industry'. We could imagine the sort of argument that some of my honourable friends opposite would make of that proposition. They would say: 'He is going to use his efforts to persuade the Corporation to direct business activity his way'. It is an old fashioned principle, and I think a pretty good one, that if you have a particular interest in something you do not sit, in any sense, by way of adjudication. That applies to the courts. I know that some people tend to deride those who practise in the courts-although , looking opposite, I see honourable members who I suspect have some sense of gratitude toBut it is a great principle of the law that no person shall sit in adjudication if he has an interest in the matter in question. Some good law on the point was laid down by the House of Lords in the Grand Junction Canal case. You can take that interest and that principle long enthroned in the law and you can apply it to ordinary civil secular life. That is exactly what the Government has done. That is a good, sound principle; it is good sense. I am rather surprisedindeed, I am rather perturbed-that the Opposition and, in particular, the honourable member for Oxley( Mr Hayden) has sought to try to persuade us to another course. Minister for the Navy( Mr Killen) took some time to explain his point without really arriving at it. He makes his progress at the rate of an inch each Good Friday, which.

96,Mr Hayden,"It depends on whetherwell established practice of the Government. There are 11 industry advisory committees, covering the various sections of industry, which the Government has set up and to which it resorts for advice. According to the answer to a question asked in this House, membership comprises about 80 leading industrialists who are appointed because of their knowledge and experience rather than their other activities. The fact is that these leading industrialists have a pecuniary interest in various fields of industrial activity in the community. I mentioned earlier Sir John Allison's Queale Memorial Lecture in Adelaide in the early part of the last decade. I asked the Minister to refer to it. In it Sir John Allison clearly indicated that there was much benefit for the Government to gain by having these people, who were experienced in business and had pecuniary interests within industry, advising the Government. If this principle is good enough in that area which is merely the area of material interests in business advising the Government where it will get its best gain, surely it is good in this sphere we are discussing which goes beyond mere business involvement but includes artistic endeavour and creativity, which is something quite different. I suggest to the Minister that there is adequate experience in the United States of America to support my contention. Looking quickly at my notes, I see a quote from 'Henry VT by Shakespeare. It is: The first thing we do, let's kill all the lawyers. After hearing the Minister's speech tonight, 1 can understand why Shakespeare said that. There is plenty of precedent in the United States of America with its Arts Council where it does appoint people who have a pecuniary interest within various fields of art to assist in the promotion of the arts and culture. It is quite ridiculous and represents a narrow-minded suspiciousness which is quite unbecoming of the Minister to argue against the amendment proposed by the Opposition.

SEAT OF GOVERNMENT (ADMINISTRATION) BILL 1970 Bill-by leave-presente d by Mr Nixon, and read a first time. Second Reading the Interior) [9.10]I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to remove a doubt whether ordinances of the Australian Capital Territory may have extra-territorial effect. The need to remove this doubt has arisen in connection with proposals to make certain amendments to the Uniform Companies Acts, and in particular the Companies Ordinance of the Australian Capital Territory. The amendments to the Companies Acts will give effect to recommendations by the Company Law Advisory Committee, consisting of Mr Justice Eggleston, as Chairman, Mr J. M. Rodd, CBE., and Mr P. C. E. Cox. This Advisory committee was appointed by, and reports to, the Standing Committee of Commonwealth and State Attorneys-General. The Advisory Committee has recommended amendments which, amongst other things, will require the disclosure of substantial shareholdings in companies and improve the effectiveness of the takeover code. The provisions requiring disclosure of substantial shareholdings will require a person having a beneficial interest in not less than one-tenth of the voting capital in a company listed on an Australian stock exchange to disclose that interest, thereby preventing concealment by means of provisions will prevent circumvention of the code by means such as first come first served offers. The Company Law Advisory Committee specifically directed its attention of its second interim report the Committee made the following, statement: We think it is important that the legislation should be so expressed as to leave no doubt that the obligation of disclosure is intended to apply to persons resident, or companies incorporated, outside the jurisdiction, as well as to persons or corporations within the jurisdiction. The Standing Committee of Attorneys General has decided to give effect to this recommendation and has agreed upon a draft of the proposed amending provisions. There is, however, some doubt, as the matter stands at present, whether the proposed amendments to the Companies Ordinance of the Australian Capital Territory can be given an extra-territorial operation. It is desirable that this doubt should be removed so as to facilitate the making of this proposed companies legislation, and also other legislative measures that may from time to time require similar treatment in the future. The High Court of Australia has held that, as a matter of constitutional law, laws for the government of a territory can operate wherever territorially the authority of the Commonwealth runs. But there is a doubt whether, as a matter of statutory construction, the ordinance-making power conferred by section 12 of the Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910-1965 enables an ordinance to be given such an extra-territorial operation. The present power in section 12 is to make ordinances 'having the force of law in the Territory'. This Bill provides instead for a power to make ordinances 'for the peace, order and good government of the Territory'. The form of words proposed by the Bill is a time-honoured one. It is used in the Northern Territory (Administration) Act, Cocos (Keeling) Islands Act, Christmas Island Act, Norfolk Island Act, Papua and New Guinea Act, the Constitution Acts of the States and, in respect of specified subjects, in the Commonwealth Constitution. It has been held by the. courts to permit the making of laws having extra-territorial",63,Corporation Bill 1970

The present Bill accordingly provides for the repeal of section 11. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on adjourned. BILL 1970 Bill presented by Mr Anthony, and read a first time. Second Reading for Primary Industry) [9.14]I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill and the related Bills is to give effect to proposals submitted to the Government hy the Australian Dairy Industry Council to provide statutary support to the present dairying industry equalisation scheme. The equalisation scheme which has operated since 1934 is based on a system of voluntary agreements between participating manufacturers and the Equalisation Committee Ltd, hereafter referred to as the Equalisation Committee. Broadly the scheme is an annual pooling of local and export sales so that all factories receive the same return for their butter, cheese or casein irrespective of the market on which the product is sold. The stability which has resulted from the equalisation scheme has proved of great value to dairy farmers. An inherent weakness in the scheme is its dependence on the voluntary co-operation of manufacturers who may give notice of withdrawal at any time. Any appreciable withdrawal could result in the breakdown of the arrangements with disastrous consequences for the industry as it would inevitably result in price cutting on the local market and lead to a complete loss of price stability as the domestic price wpuld inevitably be forced down to the level of export parity. The Commonwealth Government as a practical measure of support has since 1943 made eligibility for bounty payments on butter and cheese under the stabilisation arrangements conditional on factory participation in equalisation. The strength of this provision however has diminished over the years with the reduction in the average unit rate of bounty payable arising from increased total production and a gradual widening in the gap between equalisation values and the return from the local motion by Mr Daly) market. While there is no immediate threat to the scheme these factors have created some uncertainty as to its continued operation on a voluntary basis. At the present time there are a number of small cheese companies that are not in equalisation but their production is not sufficient to make their non-participation a threat to the existing scheme. However dairy industry leaders have been aware that the scheme could be quickly undermined by the withdrawal of even one significant manufacturer and for some years have been investigating with the Commonwealth and the States ways and means of buttressing the scheme. The Government agrees with the Australian Dairy Industry Council that the continuation of the equalisation scheme is necessary for the orderly marketing of butter, cheese and casein and that the voluntary scheme requires statutory supCommonwealth Dairy Produce port in order to secure afirmerfoundation for the industry's organisation. It has accepted the Council's proposals for federal legislation to provide a Commonwealth levy on production to finance equalisation payments as the most practical means of achieving this. This Bill and the accompanying Bills give effect to the basic provisions of the industry's proposals which are designed to permit the continuation of the existing equalisation arrangements. The proposals have been unanimously endorsed by the Australian Dairy Industry Council and have also received the approval of the Australian Agricultural Council. The basic element of the industry proposals is the establishment of a fund by way of a levy on the production of dairy produce to provide the necessary finance for equalisation payments. The purpose of this Bill is to provide for a separate levy to be imposed on the",65,Bills Returned From The Senate
100,Mr Anthony (Richmond,"Ministe rproduction of butter, butter oil, cheese, casein and such other dairy produce as may be prescribed. The Bill provides that where production at a factory is on average less than 5 cwt per month over a production period the product is exempt from the levy. This provision will exclude the smaller fancy cheese manufacturers and there is flexibility in the proposed legislation to make any concessional payments to larger manufacturers that may be negotiated with the Equalisation Committee. Condensery products have been specifically excluded as there is no support from the manufacturers of those products for an equalisation scheme. The levy will be payable by the proprietor of the factory at which the dairy produce is produced. It will apply from a date to be prescribed for each type of dairy produce and the operative rate will be prescribed after recommendation to the Minister by the Australian Dairy Industry Council. The maximum rates of levy specified in the Bill are the rates recommended to the Government by the Australian Dairy Industry Council. The legislation has been designed to perEqualisation Committee will be able to conmit the imposition of the levy on one product or a number of products as circumstances warrant. The levy for equalisation purposes will be related to a production period which will normally cover the 12 months period ending 30th June but there is provision to reduce a production period should the need arise. As the rate of levy will be determined essentially by the amount of equalisation payments made in respect of sales from the relevant production period it cannot be determined for some months after the end of the production period. Consequently provision has been made for the rate of levy applicable to the specified kind of dairy produce to be prescribed between 6 months and 2 years after the end of tbe production period. For the purpose of securing the collection of the levy during the interim period there will be imposed a provisional levy which will enable funds to be collected for equalisation purposes as the season progresses. I would emphasise that all the proceeds of the levy will be repaid to the dairy industry and that the scheme does not involve the Commonwealth in any financial commitment. I. propose now to outline the other main features of the scheme such as the arrangements for the collection of the levy and the distribution of equalisation payments which are embodied in the accompanying legislation. The proceeds of the levy will be used essentially to make equalisation payments on the export of dairy produce subject to the levy at the rate required to increase the export return to the level of the domestic return. Equalisation payments will also be made on the export of other products made from dairy produce which have been subject to the levy, such' as processed cheese. In addition, the levy proceeds may be used to make equalisation payments on the production of products made from dairy produce subject to the levy. This will permit the industry to continue its long-standing practice of making concessional sales to manufacturers of certain products-notabl y ice cream manufacturers. In addition to the equalisation payments mentioned above the levy proceeds may also be used to meet cold storage and other marketing and administration costs incurred by the Equalisation Committee. In effect the tinue its present important function of ensuring the maintenance of supplies of butter and cheese to meet requirements throughout Australia all the year round without additional costs to the consumer. The levy proceeds may also be used to meet costs incurred in the withholding of export surpluses and subsequent planned shipments to the United Kingdom to ensure continuity of supply on that market. These are important functions currently being performed by the Equalisation Committee. Provision has been made for the Commonwealth Government to make arrangements with the Equalisation Committee to collect levies and disburse equalisation payments on its behalf. This will enable factories already in equalisation to continue their existing arrangements with the Equalisation Committee if they so wish. In effect they will continue to make payments to the Equalisation Committee when market realisations exceed the average equalisation value out of which the Committee will pay the levy on behalf of member factories. In turn the equalisation payments will be offset against levy commitments. Other factories may opt to pay the levy direct to the Commonwealth or the Equalisation Committee, and receive equalisation payments where eligible. I mentioned earlier that the payment of bounty on butter and cheese under the dairying industry stabilisation arrangements is restricted to factories participating in the present equalisation scheme. As the levy under the proposed legislation will be payable by all factories, provision has been made to amend the Dairying Industry Act to enable the payment of the stabilisation bounty to be made on the production of all butter and cheese on which levy has been imposed. For the purpose of administering legislation involving the collection of levies and their disbursement provision is required for persons authorised by the Minister to enter premises and examine documents and papers that are relevant to the operation of the legislation. Some concern has been expressed by the Parliament on the need to ensure that such provisions do not infringe on the civil liberties of the community and a new provision has been included which takes account of the main objections raised. The provision which has been included in two of the accompanying Bills provides for reference to a justice of the peace for a warrant to enter premises in which dairy produce is produced if the consent of the occupier is not forthcoming. This provision should ensure that the civil liberties of the community are not infringed and, at the same time, permit the legislation to be enforced. The equalisation scheme embodied in prospect of securing the co-operation of this Bill and the accompanying legislation State governments and the industry in is an industry scheme financed completely taking some positive action to meet the by industry money and accordingly it has problems of the industry. I commend the been deemed appropriate to make provision Bill. for the Australian Dairy Industry Council to make recommendations to the Minister for Primary Industry on the main aspects adjourned. to be covered by regulation, such as the date of imposition of the levy, the rates of levy, provisional levy and equalisation payments. A referendum of dairy producers held a first before the introduction of the existing equalisation scheme in 1934 indicated overwhelming support for the scheme. While it is apparent that there is general producer acceptance for the proposed legislation in for Primary Industry) [9.30]I move: view of the lapse of time since the last referendum the Government considers it desirable to hold a further poll of producers. The Dairying Industry Equalisation Legislation Referendum Bill provides that the implementation of this Bill, the Dairying Industry Levy Collection BiU and the Dairying Industry Equalisation Bill, is conditional on a simple majority vote of dairy producers cast at a poll being in favour of this course. It is the intention of the Government after consultation with the industry to conduct the poll as soon as practicable after the legislation has been passed by Parliament. The legislation has been designed so that a compulsory equalisation scheme for a particular product or products will not be implemented unless there is a specific need created such as by the withdrawal of an important manufacturer from the present voluntary equalisation scheme. The Australian dairy industry is faced with a serious situation because of increasing butter production which has resulted not only in a reduction in producer returns because of the higher proportion which has to be sold on the unprofitable export market, but it is also heading the industry into a serious surplus problem. The industry will need to take some positive steps to meet the situation which could well impose some strain on its present marketing structure, the core of which is the existing equalisation scheme. The Government believes that this Bill and the accompanying Bills will provide a firmer foundation for the industry's organisation and improve the Debate (on motion by Dr Patterson) Bill presented by Mr Anthony, and read time.

The James Cook University of North Queensland, in conjunction by Mr with the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and with such post-graduate institutions as this one will be, offers northern Australia a chance for research in the fundamental and applied fields that it has never had before. I know that from this side of the House there have been over the years tremendous pressures exerted on the Government to establish an institute of marin science in the field of marine biology in particular. My colleague, Senator Felix Dittmer, has for many years been in the forefront of the plea for assistance to establish such an institute. It would seem that the Government hasfinallydecided to establish it. The Great Barrier Reef, located in the area which the Institute will serve, is destined to become one of therichesttourist centres and one of Australia's greatest permanent assets for earning international income. I believe that the Reef zone in addition to its priceless value as an Australian asset will emerge as one pf the world's leading marine science research laboratories. In fact the biological and physical mysteries of the Great Barrier Reef itself and its contiguous waters and the life on the continental shelf adjacent to the Reef are a challenge which I am sure is eagerly awaiting the before, both fundamental and applied research will accelerate the knowledge which is greatly wanted with respect to the Great Some honourable members will remem-",70,Dairying Industry Bill 1970
105,Mr Anthony (Richmond,"Ministe rintegral part of the living reef and to damage the so-called dead part of the reef would in fact disturb the ecological balance of the Great Barrier Reef itself. One could go further and say that if the balance is disturbed there is the strong possibility of the tidal systems of the Great Barrier Reef being also of such a nature and of such power that the whole structure of the Reef itself and the living side of the coral could be disturbed. This could have a cumulative effect and damaging seas could come onto the coasts of the protected inland areas behind the Reef. Those living there, like myself, know how great an asset the Barrier Reef is not only in terms of its value to the tourist industry but also of its tremendous importance to the northern coast of Queensland. If anything upsets the ecological balance of the Great Barrier Reef there would be a tremendous difference in the shape of the north Queensland coast. There is no surf in this area as people in the southern States know surf, except when we have the south-east prevailing wind. We do not have the surf as honourable members know it in the south because we are protected by the Barrier Reef itself. The Barrier Reef zone is an integral factor in the proposed Federal legislation to assert ownership and control by the Commonwealth over territorial waters and the continental shelf. At least, the Opposition believes it is. As such, the Bill we are now considering is complementary, one might say, to that legislation in that it actually heightens the Commonwealth's responsibility in the fields of marine research, marine biology and the associated physical sciences fundamental to any programme of conservation and development. I believe that, as far as the Barrier Reef is concerned, conservation must march hand in hand with development. Fundamental to that is the Institute of Marine Science in the fields of fundamental or basic research and in the application of that basic or fundamental research so that the conclusions of the hypotheses can be translated into commercial application. Although many people would like to see the Barrier Reef left untouched, undeveloped, Australia has an obligation to share this asset with the rest of the world. The best way to do that is through positive steps for tourist development and positive steps for the development of natural resources keeping in mind all the time the great need for the conservation of the Reef and the contiguous areas. I believe this is one of the great virtues of research. I do not believe there should be any attempt to spoil or damage the major reef areas unless bodies like the Institute of Marine Science or those concerned with postgraduate research or applied research in the geological or biological fields have at least been able to express scientific opinions as to what the effects of a particular development project will be. I think this would be one of the main purposes of the Institute. It is not just some type of learning setup where people go along and do a master's thesis or a Ph.D. thesis in a particular field and leave the area to go overseas or somewhere else. I hope it will not be that. I hope that the Institute will be closely integrated with the development of the area and that the scientists who work there will stay in the north. Too often we see scientists go to an advanced institute of learning just to get a higher degree and then immediately leave the area. It is hoped that the Institute of Marine Science will attract overseas scientists of high repute. I believe that it will, because the Barrier Reef is unique in the world. It is the largest structure which has been formed by living organisms. As I said before, its ecological balances must be protected in reef areas because of their great importance to the entire reef zone. It was my intention tonight to deal with some scientific aspects of what I believe the work of the Institute would entail. This was particularly in respect to the measurement of proteins from the waters. I wanted to refer particularly to the fundamental research with respect to the food from the sea which can then be translated into fertilisers and so forth. However, most of the notes that I had have been left upstairs, because I did not intend to speak on this Bill till later tonight. But I am sure that the more important jobs the Institute will do will involve not only work which will protect as well as enable the development of the Great Barrier Reef zone but will also involve fundamental work with respect to measurement of the wealth of the sea, particularly in the field of food, because the sea is a tremendous source of food, of protein and of energy and fertilisers. As the Minister has said, in his second reading speech, there will be a great deal of work concerned with marine environment. It is also expected that there would be work carried out with respect to the Crown of Thorns. The Crown of Thorns is causing a lot of controversy in the Barrier Reef areas. In my area of Mackay in Queensland it is a very rare thing to see the Crown of Thorns. In fact, very few people have actually seen a Crown of Thorns in this area. Even in the areas where they are more plentiful-a t Cairns and Innisfail-it is a very strange thing that the fishermen or people living there for years will tell you that in some years they are in plague proportions and then the following year it is difficult tofindthis pest. centres feeding the Barrier Reef. Of course They are analagous to a grasshopper plague. They seem to come and go. However, according to scientists like Dr Endean they are capable of doing tremendous damage. One of the reasons why the Government has introduced this Bill to set up an Institute of Marine Science, and why the Opposition supports it, is to get value for money. I have mentioned some of the factors involved in research but I am sure also that the Government hopes that this move will lead to a further development of the area. I would say that there is no permanent asset in Australia which, in world terms, has greater value. The Great Barrier Reef has far greater value than all tbe minerals or oils that we can find in Australia at the present time. This research is necessary because the Great Barrier Reef is not an inexhaustible asset. We have to make certain that the Reef and its surroundings remain as they are and that nothing happens to them. I have referred to the question of the best way to develop the Great Barrier Reef. Is it by mining? Is it by oil drilling? Is it to do nothing? Or is it by means of encouraging the tourist industry? I have mentioned that hand in hand with research there has to be development in order to let people see this unique wonder we are so fortunate to have on our doorstep. We have to be able to integrate tourist facilities with the marine research being carried out. We have to integrate the great airlines or the air routes of the world with those of the north in order to let people see this great phenomenon, the Great Barrier Reef. The Minister for Education and Science is aware that one of the planks of the Australian Labor Party policy is the establishment of an international airport at Townsville. This should be done. At present tourists who want to see the Barrier Reef, people who rank it as the No. 1 tourist attraction in Australia-internationa l surveys have revealed that this is so-hav e to fly to Sydney, mainly, then to Brisbane and to Townsville or Mackay and back again to Sydney to get another international flight out of Australia. Tourists object to having to do this. There is no reason why there could not be an international airport at Townsville with feeder flights to Cairns, Mackay, Rockharnpton and Gladstone, all this will come in time. It certainly will if there is a change in government. quicker than the honourable member thinks. The Opposition supports this Bill. It is sorely needed and should have been introduced years ago. My notes in connection with this Bill are upstairs and I can only quote from memory but 1 think the former Prime Minister of Australia, Sir Robert Menzies, said, when this proposition was first put forward, that he would give it no priority. I am subject to challenge over that statement but I think that basically I amright.It was not given priority 5 or 6 years ago when it was first put forward. It can confidently be expected that this proposed Institute will lead the world in tropical research, as will the lames Cook University of North Queensland. Both the Institute of Marine Science and the University at Townsville are specialising in tropical research. The university is specialising in suchfieldsas tropical engineering and some aspects of tropical medicine, in the husbandry of beef cattle and their environment in tropical areas-breed s with such as zebu or Brahmin blood-al l in association with the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation in Townsville.

107,Dr Patterson,"It might come aboutother, swapping ideas, learning from their research and experience. The great knowledge being gathered in the tropical areas is being passed on to workers in associated areas in other countries analogous to northern Australia. This work will also bring to Australia scientists who want to do their work in the northern areas. They will come to this area. This Bill is a step in the right direction. I believe it is of great importance for the development of one of our greatest assets, the Great Barrier Reef. Obviously 1 have not dealt with the other warmer sea areas such as those around New Guinea and the north west of Western Australia. However, they are relevant. Although the work of the Institute will be centred in Townsville it will not be confined to that area. It will be concentrated on the Great Barrier Reef but there will be basic work, fundamental and applied research, carried out in other areas of Australia. Some people have suggested that this Institute should be established not at Townsville but in some other area. This is a matter of opinion. I think it is being established in the right place. It will be in an area where there are tremen-. dous problems. There are problems associated with oi! drilling in the area contiguous to the Great Barrier Reef. I do not want to get into that controversy. However, the biological, geological and other research which the Institute will undertake is needed to throw more light on whether it is safe to drill in the Great Barrier Reef area. It is essential that research be married to practice; that before there is any development which could damage areas of the Reef, scientists are consulted fully in order to get the great benefit of the hypotheses and results of the research which will flow from the Institute. As I said before, this is a good Bill. when there is a world wide awakening to tant that the scope and the terms of referthe growing requirement to understand and ence of the Marine Institute should neither exploit to the advantage of mankind the be limited nor be such that they will duplifull bounty of the sea, the Gorton Governcate or replace any of the valuable work ment is to be congratulated on its timely that is already being accomplished by such action in establishing an Institute of Marine organisations as the Commonwealth ScienScience in Townsville.

In fact it would oceans not only as the bounding main but as a source from which and by which many of mankind's current and continuing problems can be alleviated. Nevertheless, there will always be mystery surrounding the seas, which man may never control even though his understanding of them improves. In establishing tbe Marine Institute in Townsville the Government is not only following the recent example of the United States of America, France, Great Britain and Germany; it is acclaiming that Australia is indeed an extremely marine oriented nation. Not only does the vast proportion of our population live within and enjoy the environs of the several oceans which skirt our continent but, in being one of the world's great trading nations, we have become more than ordinarily concerned with the waterways of the world as a means of communication, transportation and survival. So in 1970 we must remain concerned to see that the waterways which play such a vital role in giving us the means of maintaining a flourishing economy and high standard of living are secure for free trade and movement and protected from international pirating and lawlessness. In a sentence, we must maintain and develop a national concern about our oceanic activities to see that they are directly correlated to the needs and aspirations of the Australian community. In his second reading speech, the Minister for Education and Science( Mr N. H. Bowen), who is sitting at the table, neatly described the Government's reasons for establishing the Marine Institute. I was pleased to note that he saw the Institute as being 'a national centre that will conduct research itself and give encouragement to valuable studies conducted elsewhere concerned with both biological and physical",73,Australian Institute Of Marine Science Bill 1970

It is most imporbe fair to say that, with their diverse professional activities in the field of marine science and their individual pre-eminence within their respective disciplines, no more appropriate group of marine scientists could have been brought together. Nevertheless, I do commend to them the need to look at their brief in the broadest possible terms and to establish the unshakeable principle that the Townsville Institute will not become the sole base for nationwide research, experiments and development. There can be no denying that Townsville Prime Minister( Mr Gorton) told us in his should become one of the great centres of policy speech on 8th October last: marine studies in the world and may well rank with the world's best once it is under will be one of the first priorities of the Institute. way.

And if this is true of the United States, as I believe it is, then this sentiment must stand with equal force here in Australia. Quite obviously, the role of the new Institute should not be seen as being limited to any one activity. Most of us in this Parliament will be very much aware of the nationwide interest in saving the natural beauty and wonders of the Great Barrier Reef. The Research in the area of the Great Barrier Reef However, the most important investigain the Bill before the House. It is significant widespread destruction of the Great Barrier oceans and that there has been serious 'that more information must first be oblong term co-ordination as well as short term combat plagues of the crown of thorns starwere not able to come up with any specific the suggested areas of research mentioned in their report will constitute much of the original work of the new Marine Institute. But I again repeat the need for the Interim Council to make certain that the scope of the Townsville Institute has to be very much wider than protecting the Barrier Reef. Obviously, the acanthaster planci is a problem beyond the confines of the Barrier Reef. I would like to think that all investigations by the various Australian organisations will not only be co-ordinated per se but will also be part of an international investigation of what we presently regard as a pest of the seas. There would be few, if any. members in this House today who would dispute the wisdom of choosing Townsville as the site for the Marine Institute. I believe that the honourable member for Herbert( Mr and university colleges. However, the two Bonnett) must be given the credit for having the Government make this decision. The honourable member is well known for his advocacy of the north and its claims for involvement in national activities. I know from personal visits to his area that the residents of North Queensland have many reasons to be grateful for their active federal member and his work on their behalf. To ensure that the members of the Interim Council will be fully alive to the necessity for collective action, both internationally and within Australia, I would hope that there will be included in the Budget Estimates later this year sufficient funds to facilitate visits by all the Council members to all the major marine institutes around the world. After all. if the Twentysixth Parliament could send a committee around the world to look at other houses of parliament then it should not be beyond the resources or the wit of the Twentyseventh Parliament to send 7 marine scientists on an equally important tour of discovery. Whether this type of expenditure is considered or not, I believe that the funds to be placed at the disposal of the Interim Council should be of generous proportion and fully adequate for this professional panel to perform professionally their most important of tasks for the future of Australia. If we do not start off on the right foot, because of unnecessary restriction on expenses relative to preliminary investigations, then we could well be frittering away the golden opportunity that is contained in the legislation before the House. The Prime Minister, in his policy speech, mentioned that the capital cost of the Marine Institute would approximate §3m. This sounds a sensible figure. But if the Institute is to become the centre of excellence, as the Prime Minister predicts, then adequate funds must also be made available for preliminary work and investigation. As the Minister mentioned in his second reading speech, this Bill 'makes formal provision for detailed planning of its functions and powers'. As I have mentioned previously, a considerable amount of valuable work is already being accomplished in marine geoscience in Australia. It was revealed at the Occanology International 1969 Conference in Britain a year ago that, in terms of fundamental study, interest in marine geoscience extended to all 14 Australian universities biggest existing oceanographic organisations in Australia are the Division of Fisheries and Oceanography of the CSIRO at Cronulla and the Royal Australian Navy. The former is in my electorate and is only a short distance away from my residence. It employs 113 professional people and it is the centre of the research into the prawning industry, amongst other industries, in Australian waters. I would hope that the Interim Council does not see its way to recommending the transfer of this unit to Townsville and that any suggestion of such a move will not be allowed to retard the already announced plans to extend the research facilities at Cronulla. The work of the Royal Australian Navy in oceanographic research is well known and the decision 2 years ago to design a specially built ocean science ship was proof that the Liberal-Country Party Government is concerned with the development of marine studies. Of course, the Royal Australian Navy has been concerned with defence matters but as so much of its research can be applied to civil marine science and technology I would hope that the Interim Council will be giving much thought to co-ordinating the efforts of the Royal Australian Navy and that the Royal Australian Navy in turn will be as cooperative as security will permit. Recently the annual conference of the Australian Marine Sciences Association was told by its President, Mr R. C. Sprigg. that there was 'a transcending need to establish a clearer dialogue between governments, research and industry'. Mr Sprigg went on to say that the seas were not being exploited sufficiently to feed the world and that there was a great need to investigate animal life of the seas. This view was repeated by Germany's Federal Republic Oceanography Commission which also saw the need for exploitation of food reserves in the sea and, co-incidentally, the requirement that industry will play an increasingly important role in marine research. SoI again make a suggestion to the Interim Council that it should include in its charter such provisions Government in April 1969 one noticed a as will encourage industry to participate in marine research in Australia alongside the Institute and the universities. Coming as I do from an electorate which is almost completely surrounded by water and which has one of the largest shorelines of any Australian electorate, I am most anxious to see that the Marine Institute applies itself with enthusiasm to conservation of the Australian coast and overcoming water pollution and its revolting effects. There is scarcely a day passes that I am not made aware of the need not only to conserve but to improve the beaches that are part of Bate Bay. From Cronulla to Boat Harbour one is constantly aware of beach erosion and one is even more aware of the fact that none of the experts is prepared to say exactly what causes it. Some experts blame it on the concrete promenades which were built 30 years ago; others on the high-rise units that have been built on the waters edge during the past decade; while others blame the erosion on the regrettable removal of sand from the natural and once extensive Cronulla sand hills. The University of New South Wales has tried to help, the Sutherland Shire Council has turned its attention to it, but nobody can say with real certainty what Causes the beaches to disappear. Canute thought he had the answer by assuming his sovereignty over all he could see. But in Cronulla, and I know in many other beaches pound Australia, the sands run out and do not come back. If there was an area for urgent investigation by the Marine Institute it is in the field of hydrology and the implementation Of a conservation scheme, not only for ^Jronulla's beaches-importan t and beautiful «ft they are-bu t for all the beaches around the beautiful Australian coastline. For if we do not get some objective research put into this field we could well finish with no beaches before anybody can learn why the erosion occurs and where the financial responsibility of this conservation rests. One thing is certain: Local councils cannot be asked to assume this financial burden for all time. When reading through the White Paper on Marine Science and Technology which was presented to the United Kingdom lot of space was given to pollution control and, more particularly, to sewage pollution of the seas. AgainI would like to draw attention to the health hazards that are experienced by many surfers who use the beaches around our urban areas. Apart from having less beach to come back to, surfing loses a lot of its aesthetic charm and attraction when one is conscious of sharing a wave with what the scientists refer to, somewhat pointedly, as solid waste. I know there is no need to remind the honourable member whose electorate also boasts beaches almost as beautiful as Cronulla that an experience I have just described certainly takes the joy out of our national sport, surfing. It would be amusing if it was not so serious a matter. Premier Askin is to be congratulated on his recent decisions to spend large sums on communition as well as the construction and siting of longer outfalls for sewage discharge into the sea. But the tragedy of this pollution of man's environment by himself is the lack of research that has gone into this aspect of pollution. If it is that this problem has been fully researched and not put into practice then it is all the more serious and all the more reason for the Marine Institute to establish close lines of liaison with government and industry in all that it undertakes. It should see that all of its findings are quickly communicated to all interested parties so that the value of its research can be the more quickly put into practice for the advantage of all. The final suggestion I would like to make to the Interim Council at this time relates to legal problems that will surround this area of activity. It does not lie within the scope of this debate to discuss the legal problems surrounding the sea. Nor, I fancy, does it lie within the competence of the members of the Interim Council properly to interpret international law as it relates to the sea and as it is developing in this legal field. For example, Professor D. P. O'Connell of the Department of Law at Adelaide University has emerged as one of those whose expertise in the law of the sea is fast gaining international and local recognition. When Professor O'Connell sess fit to comment recently that the whole fabric of the law relating to the sea could be thrown open to challenge over such a simple matter as prosecuting a fisherman for taking an undersized fish, then it behoves the Interim Council of the Marine Institute to consider the establishment of a legal bureau to advise the institute about its legal competence to undertake specified research and development. If Professor O'Connell is not available to lead such a bureau or, at the least, accept a brief to establish such a legal department, then the Council should take pains to find a legal mind of comparable excellence to do so. In conclusion may I again commend this legislation. It promises a new era of understanding of our oceans and waterways. It throws out a challenge for marine scientists, whether expatriate Australians or uot, to come to Australia and share in a challenging new development in the next 2 decades which should equal anything we have experienced in Australia in the exciting decades that have just passed. It offers a chance for dramatic improvements in the quality of life, not only for Australians but for our less fortunate neighbours to the north. It could mean that the future generations of Australians will see in the establishment of an Australian Marine Institute in Townsville one of the important political decisions of this decade, and it could well be that the Gorton Government will be remembered, among many other achievements, as having developed in the Australian nation a real and new awareness of the vital importance of our marine resources. I sincerely hope so. come from as far west as one can go in Australia without actually treading water and about as far from Townsville and the setting of this Marine Institute as it is possible to get within Australia. But I am sure this legislation will be welcomed by all Australians. I do not agree with the honourable member for Cook( Mr Dobie) that it is a very timely action. Senator Felix Dittmer has been advocating this for at least a decade. I would hesitate to say that it was his advocacy which produced this, just as 1 would hesitate to say it was the advocacy of the honourable member for Herbert( Mr Bonnett) which produced it. 1 think there were 2 great threats to the Great Barrier Reef which helped to speed the decision. One was the crown of thorns starfish and the other the activities on the Premier of Queensland. The honourable member for Cook said that the Prime Minister has estimated that the cost of the Institute will be $3m. If that is the estimate I think we must all be prepared to spend $9m. In the 25 years I have been associated with the construction of one body that was created by the Commonwealth Government, the Australian National University, I have never found the estimates for the buildings to be much more than one-third of the ultimate cost. If the Institute does cost us $9m it may still be a thoroughly justified expenditure. The legislation creates an Australian Institute of Marine Science in principle. The Bill sets up an interim council to define the scope of the Institute. We have not farmed the sea scientifically. On the west coast of this continent, we know, a 38-foot rise and fall of tide could in gulfs become a great source of hydro-electric power. Apparently we are engaged in destroying or watching the destruction of an ocean wonderlandthe Great Barrier Reef. From time immemorial man has been fascinated by the sea, and that in itself would justify an institute of marine science. But the sea is becoming more and more important as a source of food, as a source of climatic knowledge, as a source of fertiliser and, of course, as a tourist attraction. It may also be a source of medical knowledge, since the immunity of certain fish to deadly poisons and to pain may have a significance for mankind. More and more we are coming to appreciate that the preservation of our environment is a factor in public health and mental hygiene, and in the Indian, Southern and.

In particular is this so when so much of the population of the We can take the matter even further than Deputy Speaker, the waters of the world cover about 70% of our global surface. We have here an immense area as yet untapped in the sense that land surface currently is tapped, and in some cases overlapped. 1 do not wish to reiterate, any more than 1 can help, arguments, points and aspects of this matter which have been put before. But I wish to commend again the Minister for Education and Science( Mr N. H. Bowen), the Government at large and those individual honourable members on either side of the House who have been responsible for having this come forward by or at this time. I was quite taken by the mentioning of the honourable member for Cook( Mr Dobie) of the degree and extent of research in the marine area which already goes on in Australia, despite the fact that for most of the last 20 years I have been either student or teacher in Australian universities. However, most of this work to the best of my knowledge goes on under the heads of particular disciplines such as zoology, geomorphology and so on. Very few of the concentrated efforts of marine research are conducted under a specific head or in a specific institution brought together under one specific heading in terms of marine scientific research. SoI think that tbe proposition that we have this Australian institute of Marine Science is entirely admirable. I draw attention for a few minutes to something of the sort of development that has gone on in this field elsewhere. I think that it would be generally held that, in the field of marine science, the United States of America is well ahead of the world, ns well it might be because of its immense resources infinancialterms and in scientific know how generally. Nevertheless, that does not necessarily follow. To illustrate my point I wish to use one or two quotations from the 1969 report of the United States Commission on Marine Science, Engineering and Resources. The Commission says, for instance: The Commission finds that tbe United States position of world leadership in marine science depends mainly on the work of a small number of major oceanographic institutions. These few, large, well-staffed, and relatively well-financed centres of oceanographic research have had profound influence on scientists and programmes at other institutions and have estabh'shed criteria of excellence for the efforts of others. Such institutions as Scripps Institution of Oceanography, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and the Lamont Geological Observatory represent a major national investment around which the nation's marine science programme must be builL Now, in substantiation of this belief in this matter but at the same time indicating just how this has been given practical effect in the United States in recent times 1 with to take a very few figures indeed from the same report. In 1960-61 there were 77 graduates and 262 enrollees in the field of ocean science. There are other subcategories or related categories in this whole field of marine science such as basic science, technology, engineering, marine food science and so on which have comparable although rather fewer numbers. By 1967-58 the graduates in this field of ocean science numbered 474 and the enrollees 2,647. So in the short space of 6 or 7 years numbers had increased many fold. I think this indicates the respect with which this field of scientific endeavour is held in the United States. I would like to indicate from the same report just what are the propositions for expansion in this field in the United States. 1 will take just a few examples so as not unduly to take this report apart, because it is available in the Parliamentary Library for those who seek it. It states: The Commission recommends that federal marine science laboratories be strengthened by adequate funding and staffing. Selected, consolidation of marginal laboratories is one way of 'achieving this purpose; however it should be remembered that effectiveness is not necessarily a function of size. I would underline that point verbally because that may well go for some of the universities in this country and for other institutions concerned with education of one sort or another. A further recommendation states: The Commission recommends that the United States establish as a goal the achievement of the capability to explore the ocean depths to 20,000 feet within a decade and to utilise ocean depths to 20,000 feet by the year 2000. That is a very big aim, and it indicates the sort of thing we might have in mind, if not that actual aim, when we found an institution such as the one under discussion. 1 mention only one other recommendation. The report states: The Commission recommends that the United Science Foundation expand its support for undergraduate and graduate education in the basic marine-related scientific disciplines and plan post doctoral and mid-career marine orientation proof organisations and structures which may grammes in consultation with the academic and industrial marine communities. That, in a very small nutshell, is the sort of position we find in this developing field in the United States. I have already referred on vast resources and that they support very by name to 2 or 3 of the institutions in the large numbers of staff, not by some other United States. Although this report sugstandards, but for an intensive research gests that size is not necessarily a preinstitute. This sort of thing is well ahead requisite to excellence, nevertheless some of us and by no means near. What we are of the leading ones there are of substantial saying in effect is that the usual sort of size and of a size which we could not hope American setup for major institutes of to achieve in quite a long time. However may I very briefly outline the they have private endowments which are of resources available in 1 or 2 of the leading a substantial kind and the equivalent of institutions which we may care to take as which is not likely to be found here in models for the ultimate development of the the foreseeable future. They have professors institution which is proposed here. For who are basically paid by the universities, instance, the essential aspects of the strucfor example, the University of California ture of the Scripps Institution of Oceanoin the case of Scripps, and so on. graphy at La Jolla, California, are as follows: It is an integral unit of the University of California at San Diego, supported by a of the varying types of students of marine parent institution, the United States Governenvironment who may be involved in these ment, industry, special funds and income institutions. As I recall, most of the from endowments. Its staff consists of 110 comments of the honourable members for research and supporting professionals, 385 Dawson, Cook and Fremantle ( Mr Beazley), technicians and 189 others. They then have touched on the research area. Certainly elaborate some 20 or more principal fields that would seem to be the appropriate thing of research, which include, amongst others, to talk about in relation to such an institute. marine environment, submarine geology, It need not however necessarily confine studies on the interaction of biological and itself to post-graduate, doctoral or similar geological problems, submarine organisms research.

I do so not sure of research-in 1961 was $4m; in entirely out of my own knowledge but as a 1963 it was $6,500,000, and so it goes up result of discussion with some former the scale. Again the principal fields of colleagues who have a greater knowledge research are similar to, although not identhan I in this field. I would suggest that tical with, those of the other institute that the first and foremost essentialI hope the I mentioned. These are perhaps the kinds Minister for Education and Science, who be borne in mind as ultimate possibilities for our marine institute that is now proposed. However it is quite clear that they depend marine science is that they are, firstly, attached to universities and that, secondly, I have not yet touched on the question exclusively with the post-graduate field. But for the moment we have many problems I would like to suggest a possible alteris sitting at the table, will hear me on thisis to have a good director for such an institute. If we have almost nothing else we need to have a good director of outstanding qualifications so that scientists around the world, thinking in terms of coming to the Institute for a short or long time, will know what they are about. His name will do a great deal for the institution. It may not be easy to find such a man, but it should not be impossible. After that we obviously need some plant, technicians and equipment. It is clear from the figures I have quoted for Woods Hole and Scripps that the technicians will by far outnumber the researchers. This will be the case for most institutions of this kind. So we have to contemplate a fairly fundamental amount of support equipment and staff before we can do as much research here as anywhere else. But with a relatively modest background or underpinning such as this, I suggest that we can contemplate this Institute in its first stages of development as being one with a good director and operating on the basis of offering postdoctoral fellowships. In other words, it would not necessarily have to pay considerable salaries to leading scientists in small or large numbers. It could offer substantial salaries but nevertheless less in terms of total cost than the kind of salaries I have mentioned. It could offer post-doctoral fellowships to people around the world to work with the local equipment, with the assistance of local institute technicians. If that sort of proposition is put into effect I suggest there will be no difficulty whatsoever in attracting first rate people. With a reasonable amount of flexibility of operation, which again would be desirable, this will very quickly assume the proportions of an institute approaching world standing. This has been the hope expressed by other honourable members who have spoken on this Bill. Referring to large or small institutions, I have already heard privately and not from any official source, suggestions of empire scientific endeavour which can attach to an building. Some honourable members have institute such as this in a country such as expressed certain reservations on the aspects this. The honourable member for Dawson of empire building in such an institution and perhaps one or two of the other honas this. It would perhaps be wrong of me ourable members expressed the fervent to suggest that those fears are absolutely hope that the people who came to work groundless. It is human nature, as far as I in this Institute, from wherever they came, have observed it, to empire build, and, again would stay and work in the area and to 13667/70-R-[56 1 as far as I have observed it, the academic stream of mankind is not exactly exempt from that inclination. Nevertheless, I would say to those sceptics who are inclined to believe people who ply a few glass bottomed boats from here to there on the Barrier Reef rather than some piece of unbiased, properly and statistically supervised scientific research about the problems of the crown of thorns starfish or any such related scientific problem, that they need have very few fears of this kind. Their fears certainly need be no more than normally would be held of any other educational institution. In fact, nowhere can you find a more disinterestedI say this in a particularly personal sense-bree d of people than the scientists who have only their salaries to gain and no commercial interest of the kind that normally attaches to empire building in other spheres. SoI would regard that as no sort of fear sufficient in any way to inhibit the fairly rapid development of this Institute. I have very little more to say. I indicated earlier a number of important matters that have already been touched upon by honourable members who have spoken previously. But I would like to underline the requirement of such an institution to have the capacity, and certainly to have a charter, that would enable it to investigate all manner of important problems within its financial limitations-no t only biological problems which tend to be rather accented in the popular Press but also the physical ones. In this I include the oceanographic aspects such as the development of the coastline. Incidentally, the honourable member for Cook made some reference to the failure of people to solve the problem of disappearing beaches and the like. I could in fact suggest to him that only recently a very near colleague of mine had to go to quite some lengths to solve a lot of the problems of the kind he fears. These are usually beyond the capacity of the local councils to solve. So we have an almost limitless field of some extent would be rooted in its problems. Tbat is a very nice hope and aim, but 1 would hope also that it does not develop into an excessive strain of parochialism. The honourable member for Fremantle suggested that this should be an institute which looked for scientific knowledge and did not follow the trends of nationalism. May1 adapt what he had to say and suggest that what this Institute should set out to do is endeavour to find national scientific knowledge and not parochialism. While1 readily agree that the tropical environment could be very well investigated-it would probably be hard to find a better site to do this than Townsville I think we should by no means consider the Barrier Reef, the Queensland coast and that general area as the only source of operations for people who will be attached to this Australian Institute of Marine Science. As has already been suggested, in terms of the wealth of some of the American institutes, there is one other field which the Institute could develop in this area. For example, both the Scripps and Woods Hole oceanographic institutions take about 2,000 journals in their libraries. That may be some small indication of the degree, the complexity and the diversity of scientific endeavour in this field, a field which has barely been brought to the notice of the general public at this stage. Even when it is given attention it is usually in fairly specific fields such as exploration for oil or pollution by the sinking or the holing of an oil tanker. There are vast and untapped fields here which are coming very much into the public purview but which have long since been under the notice of scientists. Of course, the basic difficulties in coming to grips with a submarine environment, or even a surface marine environment, compared with the ability to move about on land, has inhibited development in this field relative to development on land up to the present time. So while trying to avoid a parochialism which I suggested should be avoided but nevertheless indulging a healthy local interest in these matters, I suggest that as this field of research develops we may well increasingly consider that, figuratively speaking, the oyster for such development is the Australian coastline, and as time goes on the claims of sites other than Queensland1 would certainly include Tasmania with its unique coastline-wil l be considered for investigation. For the time being one must agree that the choice has been well made and, with the new, emerging and autonomous 'James Cook' University at Townsville, it is fairly obvious that there are associations and other facilities capable of being used in the development of this Australian Institute of Marine Science. Finally, 1 commend the Minister and I commend all those honourable members who have before my time here sponsored this move. I hope that the matters which 1 have drawn to the attention of those listening might be noted, together with the other myriad facets of this matter to which attention has been drawn by other honourable members. As I said at the outset, there is a great deal more in this proposition than meets the eye when we look at 2 or 3 pages of a Bill to establish a marine science institute for Australia. Debate (on motion by Mr Cross) adjourned. Container Shipping Services-Wheat Political Parties-Vietnam-J'""ir c in Whyalla Shipyard-Naturalisatio n and Citizenship Motion (by Mr Snedden) proposed: That the House do now adjourn. to refer tonight to the difficulties confronting Tasmania because of deficiencies in Federal Government shipping policy. The first problem area derives from delay in integrating Tasmania into the overseas container shipping service. This entails that the cost of feeder services from Tasmania to the Melbourne container port be absorbed either by the shipper or by some form of Government subsidy. The second problem area results from the inadequacies of existing services between Tasmania and the mainland and Tasmania and overseas ports, particularly in Japan. The crisis facing Tasmania goes beyond defective services and uncompetitive freight rates; in the broader sense it strikes directly at the policies of decentralisation whicb have been vaunted by the Federal Government. Because of",78,Australian Institute Of Marine Science Bill 1970
111,Mr Barnard (Bass) [10.58],"I wantTasmania's exclusive reliance on sea transport for its place, in national and international trade, this is just as much an issue of national policy as the .provision of beef roads in Queensland and the building of the standard gauge railway. There is no lack of evidence to support the belief that Tasmania is facing an era of economic stagnation if solutions are not found quickly to these pressing problems. The threat of stagnation is already menacing the industrial development which has been carefully nurtured over the past 20 years. It is also undermining the expansion that mineral developments in recent years have brought to the island. The disadvantages facing Tasmania in the container era were emphasised in the report of the Senate Select Committee on the Container Method of Handling Cargoes. The Committee recommended that Tasmania be given special treatment for the disabilities it would certainly suffer in export trade. On 23rd February 1967 the Minister for House that it was the intention of those operating container ships to provide feeder services from outports to the three main container ports of Sydney, Melbourne and Fremantle. On 13 th May last year, in answer to the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam), the Minister said it was still the intention of the shippers to provide feeder services from outports and absorb the cost in freight rates. He said that with freight from Hobart to Melbourne it had been found that the price quoted for shipping containers would make the through freight to London quite uneconomic. This was a matter that would have to be negotiated and the Minister expressed confidence that it could be resolved. The Minister concluded by saying that if there appeared to be any unjustified delay in introducing the feeder container service he would take immediate action. It is a year since the Minister made this promise but the Government seems to be no nearer to stating a clear policy on providing container facilities in Tasmania, or in securing equalised freight rates. On 17th MarchI raised this issue with the Minister for Shipping and Transport ( Mr Sinclair). The Minister stressed that this was primarily a question for negotiation between shipper bodies and Conference members. However, he said that the Commonwealth recognised that this was a serious matter and should be settled as soon as possible. The Minister said he expected the negotiations to be resolved at the meeting between Australian shippers and overseas shipowners scheduled for the end of April. I understand that these talks began on Tuesday. This should make it possible for the Minister for Shipping and Transport to make a statement when the House resumes. In the light of the assurances of the Minister for Trade and Industry it is not good enough for the Minister for Shipping and Transport to throw the whole weight of the success of negotiations on to shippers and shipowners. It is the clear duty of the Commonwealth to set a more active example in getting a just and rational formula for equalising freight rates. According to the Tasmanian President of the Associated Chambers of Manufactures of Australia, Mr Cuthbertson, Adelaide shippers who send their cargo to Melbourne for overseas container shipping pay the same cargo rate as Melbourne shippers. The same applies to Brisbane shippers who send cargo to the container port at Sydney. Yet as between Hobart and Melbourne, which are not as far apart as are Adelaide and Melbourne or Brisbane and Sydney, the container companies will not absorb the cost. On the face of things this seems to be an incredible perversion of basic economic logic. Doubts about the Commonwealth's sincerity in assuring an integrated container service have been reinforced by a meeting of the Export Development Council in Hobart last December. At this meeting, the head of the Department of Trade and Industry, Sir Alan Westerman, said that it could be too costly to integrate Tasmania fully into the container service. He suggested, as an alternative, the use of special ships similar to the great Scandinavian vessels now being used overseas. According to Sir Alan, these ships could call at Tasmanian and mainland ports collecting goods for direct transport to Europe. What this sort of thinking implies is a second string shipping service outside the container shipping network. A service of this sort may be useful for subsidiary ports and less important exports of the mainland. But it is vital for Tasmania that it be incorporated into the container system with",83,Adjournment
112,Trade And Industry ( Mr Mcewen) Told This,"equalisation of freight rates. The Government has made this promise and it must be honoured. Beyond the container issue, poor shipping services are seriously impairing the effectiveness of the Tasmanian economic structure. The Tasmanian Premier approached the Prime Minister( Mr Gorton) in December last year seeking some remedy for these grave problems. He seems to have got little if anything from these negotiations. Inadequate shipping has dealt a heavy blow to wool and fruit exports from Tasmania. Overseas merchants are reluctant to buy Tasmanian fruit because they know that delivery cannot be assured, and delays in shipping make purchases from Tasmania uneconomic. Delays in wool shipments mean that brokers have to extend the period of repayment, which increases the interest bill and forces the growers to wait longer for their returns. It has been estimated that shipping delays will add $20,000 this year to the interest bill of Tasmanian wool growers. The pattern has been established of Tasmanian exporters accepting discounted returns for their commodities. Inadequate shipping services and the high freight framework also have had an unfortunate impact on the domestic price structure. The prices of consumer items are often substantially higher than for comparable items in other States. The most unfortunate effect of the shipping crisis is the loss of key industries to other States. This crisis is blotting out the tunity of dealing with this matter. work whicb has been done over many years by way of incentive schemes to develop industries. The disabilities of the shipping services have been felt with particular severity by companies exporting to the eastern market, particularly to Japan. Irregular and widely spaced sailings have put shippers who are based in Tasmania in an extremely uncompetitive position. The availability of shipping to Tasmanian shippers averages out at 1 shipment every IS days. Quite often the gap between shipments is as long as 1 month. Shipments in South Australia and Victoria average 1 a week. Already Cadbury Fry PascalI Australia Ltd, which is a traditional part of trade and tourism in Tasmania, has had to close down a large portion of its Hobart operations and move to Melbourne. The present situation which applies in Tasmania as a result of what can only be described as an inadequate shipping service is a matter which has been raised by honourable members in this Parliament, particularly honourable members on this side of the House. The Minister for Shipping and Transport will recall that it is also a matter which has been dealt with extensively by those people who have the responsibility of maintaining a regular flow of exports from Tasmania using the shipping services which are available to them. Representations have been made lo the Commonwealth Government by the present Tasmanian Government and the Labor Government which preceded it. The shipping services provided to Tasmania have deteriorated rapidly in recent years. The stage has now been reached were a shipping crisis has developed in Tasmania. Therefore, I have taken the opportunity tonight of raising this matter. J believe that the responsibility for the present situation must be accepted, as I have already pointed out, not only by the ship owners and the exporters in Tasmania but also by the Commonwealth Government, because it has a clear responsibility to solve some of the shipping problems which are now facing the State. Tasmania is completely dependent upon shipping. It is the only State in the Commonwealth of Australia which depends almost entirely upon shipping to ensure that the goods which it produces are available for sale in the mainland States as well as overseas. I hope that the Minister will take the opporMir SPEAKER-Order! The honourable member's time has expired. I rise on the motion for the adjournment of the House, but I believe that a member of this chamber has two very great responsibilities. The first is to watch over the interests of his constituents and make representations to the Government and the Parliament on their behalf. The second is to report the activities of the Parliament and the Government to his constituents. I do not wish to make any apologies or offer any excuses this evening for again raising the question of the present situation in the wheat industry. I only regret that the honourable member for the Riverina( Mr Grassby) and the honourable member for",84,Adjournment
113,Mr King (Wimmera) U 1.9],"Rarely doDawson (Dr Patterson) are not present in the chamber. However, they may turn up before I conclude. Over the last 12 or 15 months there has been a great deal of comment in relation to primary industries, and particularly to the wheat industry. It is not surprising that the problems within most primary industries today are created by world surpluses. Unfortunately the Opposition is making a great play of the misfortunes of the people in primary industries. It seems to be using every opportunity it can get either to pull down the Government or to pull down the Minister for Primary Industry( Mr Anthony) and those supporters of the Government who represent rural interests. Even the honourable member for St George( Mr Morrison) recently tried to make great play of the question of our gift of wheat abroad and 1 quote from the Melbourne 'Sun' of 26th February the heading, 'Gift of wheat called a trick'. I have not sufficient time to go on and explain to the honourable member for St George just how far out he is in some of his comments. The real reason for my rising is to answer some of the statements made by the honourable member for Riverina and I am glad that he has now returned to the chamber. I want to quote very briefly some of the comments that he made in this chamber last night. I have not time to quote the whole of his speech. He said. I think the scheme is iniquitous, ill-conceived and hasty and is operating against the best interests of all concerned. He went on to say: The argument as to who is responsible for the introduction of wheat rationing in the middle of the season . . . AndI repeat the words 'middle of the season'. . . should be dealt with now. The decision was made here in Canberra. It was forced on the States. In the debates in the New South Wales Parliament that I took part in it was made quite clear to every member both in Government and Opposition that the Commonwealth waved the big stick. The Commonwealth had the decision to make. The Commonwealth made the decision and said: 'You will do this'. In other words, the Commonwealth or the Minister directed the wheat industry. The honourable member went on to say: The implementation In detail was left to the Australian Agricultural Council. Naturcolleagues of members of this Government who ally enough this matter was discussed are in government in the States. Let us be quite clear that the decision began here. It was conceived here and was implemented here. He went on to say that he predicted that the sales of wheat outside the Australian Wheat Board would be higher than those inside it. His final comment was: What is happening at present is a tragedy. It is based on policies which were hasty, ill-conceived and even badly implemented. They are statements which were made last night by the honourable member for Riverina. The honourable member should be reminded of a few things when he is talking about the reasons for over production. I want to remind him that it is the doings or activities not inside Australia but rather outside which are responsible. I would also remind him that over the last 5 years production and surpluses of wheat have increased tremendously. World production in the last 5 years has increased by some 20%. The carry over has increased by 30% and world trading has declined by 9%. That dispels any suggestion that there is ample scope for an open go in relation to wheat production. He mentioned that the decision was made in the middle of the season. He is well aware, or he should be as the representative of the seat of Riverina, that the bulk of the crop is sown in about May, June or July, depending on the part of Australia in which it is. I also remind him that the decision was taken by the Australian Wheat growers Federation in Perth on llth, 12th and 13th March 1969, which is hardly the middle of the season. I want to quote very briefly some of the resolutions that were carried at that meeting. The resolutions are: (1) 'That this Federation accepts the principle that wheat production control is necessary.' (2) 'That this Federation formulate a plan for wheat production control to be recommended to the State affiliates for implementation as soon as practicable."" That is hardly a decision by this Government. It went on: Ft is the unanimous desire of affiliated members of the Federation that the quota proposals be introduced for the coming harvest 1969-70. Now, I have mentioned thesefigures.This information was relayed to the Minister for Primary Industry who happened to be at a meeting in Hobart of the there. I want to, just briefly, quote again from a statement by a Mr Price who was senior vice-president of the Australian Wheat growers' Federation at the time. He is now the president of the Federation. He said: I would strongly refute that there has been any political pressure exerted on tbe Australian Wheat Growers Federation, either before the implementation of quotas or since their introduction. My organisation accepts full responsibility in originally assessing the need for wheat quotas; I hope these honourable members are listeningand it was at our request Meaning the Federation's requestthat the Federal and State governments recognised the correctness of our attitude in endeavouring to come to grips with the current situation involving a surplus to sales potential of at least 250 million bushels of wheat. Should any politician or political party endeavour to make adverse capital out of the introduction of wheat quotas, they will be responsible for the greatest disservice ever to the wheat industry of Australia. That was said by the senior vice-president of the Australian Wheat growers Federation and the President at that time, who 'Financial Review' on 6th May 1969: On 13th March, the Australian Wheat Growers Federation decided to restrict the production of wheat in Australia. I want honourable members to note this. He went on to say: Tbe initiative was taken without prompting by the Commonwealth or State governments. It was theresultof a sense of responsibility and concern that leaders of tbe industry have felt for some time. too much. member for Barton interjects too much. member that it is Opposition supporters who are doing all tbe protesting. Does the honourable member for Riverina( Mr he is doing, but I do not think they are Grassby) still think that direction came from this place? If he does then I say that 1 have a duty to the public to expose the honourable member for Riverina, and others who have supported him, for what they really are. I leave it to the House to decide what I mean by that. Finally, dealing with the last part of his statement made last night, that part in which he said that the quantity of wheat that will be sold outside the Australian Wheat Board is greater than that inside, I would remind the honourable member that since 1948that is going back a few yean-the largest quantity of wheat ever consumed in Australia was 70 million bushels, 45 million bushels of which was used in the production offlour.The remainder, 25 million bushels, was used for stock feed and other purposes. The largest amount of stock feed ever consumed in Australia-28. 7 million bushelsin any one year was in 1964 during one of the bad droughts we had. Now, the Australian Wheat Board has had an assurance from the flour mills of Australia that they will purchase all their wheat through the normal channels as far as flour production is concerned. So the real question now is: What are these so-called interstate traders going to do with this amount of 50 million bushels of wheat that has been cited? It is absolutely ridiculous to think that there could be that amount of wheat. I would like to know where this wheat would be stored even if it were possible to purchase it. If we created a record in the amount of wheat used for stock feed it would be in the viciniiy of only some 30 million bushels. member's time has expired. follow the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr King) it is interesting to note that our friends on the other side, the Country Party, appear to have got permission from their colleagues in the Liberal Party, who are now quiet on their anti-Communist bogy, to devote their evening to attacking the honourable member for Riverina( Mr Grassby), a man who has won tbe hearts and minds of the Australian rural sector. They, in their death throes, are attempting to sabotage the excellent job going to have much success. We mauled them last night but they are coming back for another try. I want to speak about something that grieves me and other honourable members here very greatly.

119,Mr Cohen (Robertson) [11.19],"As Ithe passing of this once great party. I want to quote the article which appeared in the 'Australian'. The article states: The Liberal Party was not inspiring young people in Australia, Mr R. Winnel, a 22-year-old party branch president said yesterday. 'People like JessI do not wish to be disrespectful, Sir. I am just quoting from the papercan rave on about the red bogey, but young people won't swallow it', said Mr Winnel. As a matter of interest I decided to get some of the speeches of the honourable member for La Trobe( Mr Jess) and read them. They are very interesting. tired. reading them. There is not much in them. Of the 11 speeches the honourable member for La Trobe has made so far he has devoted 10 to attacking the Communist influence in the Australian Labor Party. He has attacked Mr Burchett twice. He then must have had some sort of mental aberration because he got on to airport noise. He then spoke about Mr Burchett again. Then he was on Labor's membership of the Foreign Affairs Committee and the Communist smear. He then spoke about law and order and I might say that when he was talking about the Labor Party being unparliamentary he referred to the honourable member for Reid( Mr Uren) and the honourable member for Lalor (Dr. J. F. Cairns) as looking like apes. This was said by the man who was telling us how to behave in Parliament. Then he got the prize from one of the local papers for the most tasteless speech in years in which he attacked the honourable member for Lalor. If the honourable members care to read this one on 10th April they will know what I mean. The honourable member for La Trobe then spoke on the Vietnam Moratorium Campaign and the days and hours of meeting in which he referred to everyone as a pack of Corns. Young members on this side of the House expected to hear some contribution from honourable members on the other side. Apart from their front bench, all we have heard has been ravings and rantings and practically no contribution has been made to the problems that face the people of Australia. The honourable member for La Trobe is a classic example of this. Let me continue with the article because it is well worth reading. It is a classic. The article states: Mr Winnel is president ot the Liberal Party branch at Kingsgrove, a Sydney suburb, and president of the Earlwood Young Liberals. cable background-in the St George electorate. The article continues: Mr Winnel has attacked the Liberal leadership in the latest issue of The Australian Liberal, the official organ of the New South Wales division of the Party. He said in this article: 'Some months have passed since the tiresome ramblings at State Council about the Federal election. Yet even after such recent events as the wrangle between the Premiers and Mr Gorton, there still seems to be an air of uncertainty about the direction in which the Liberal Party is heading. 'The question of leadership in the Federal Party has been properly resolved, for the present at least. 'Nevertheless, there is still a burning question in my mind as to what leadership the Liberal Party as an entity itself is providing. 'Since Menzies time, Australian politics seem to have lacked authentic leadership, in that it lacks both inspiration and dignity. Tn the last election swinging voters were prepared to vole against a government which seemed apathetic to their own particular problem. Voters were becoming more discerning not only about candidates, but also about policies. Now, listen to thisThe Liberal Party can afford 'neither tbe extravagance of members with no new ideas or enthusiasm, nor the rashness of members more interested in writing Sc autobiographies than in pursuing the interests of the people and the Party they represent. It gets better'We don't have enough divergence of opinion. By the time somebody gets into a position of power he is likely to favour the status quo. Recently young Liberals put up 10 ideas-and only one got as far as State Council, and that was watered down. It was all right for the Liberal Party to rely on the red peril in the time of Stalin, but people who have grown up in the 60s are too wise to swallow it,' Mr Winnel said. He said it was absurd to suggest that the Vietnam moratorium was a gigantic communist plot. 'Young Liberals won't accept the idea that there is a communist under every cabbage', he said. He is a very wise young man, Mr Speaker. There should be more of them. The article continued: 'Instead of relying on the red bogey, the Party would be better off producing candidates with enthusiasm, idealism and dignity and with a sensitivity towards people's needs as well as an awareness of social, economic and political forces.",87,Adjournment

The article continues: 'There is no moral fibre in many of the expressions of our Government', Mr Winnel said. ""They lack a certain purpose as far as the young are concerned. They conscript young people for war but they are not pushing people into a peace corps.' I suggest that the honourable member for member for Chisholm( Sir Wilfrid Kent Hughes), the honourable member for La Trobe and the Minister for Social Services( Mr Wentworth) would do well to get that article, read it, absorb it and lake notice of what il states. Liberal Party was a great party in the time of Sir Robert Menzies. As to the Country Party, one has only to pick up a newspaper and read what the Minister for Trade He is reported to have said at Warmambool the other day that the farmers should not cut the supply main which has fed them. He went on: You will get nowhere toy shooting down your front line troops from behind. This is beautiful stuff. I wish everybody in the cities would read the article from which I am quoting, which appeared in the 'Sunday Observer' of 19th April. It states: With the contempt of a self-made man for those he had given them in the past 20 years: ' I got a thousand million out of the Commonwealth Treasury into your pockets.' He boasted about it. In today's issue of the 'Bulletin', a half brother to the paper you can trust, a wonderful photo appeared of the honourable member for Farrer( Mr ourable member when you intend to attack Fairbairn) dressed as Captain Cook in a saluting pose. He looks like a potential leader of the Liberal Party. The article, written by Peter Samuel, states: The last few weeks have seen almost continuous bitter argument in the parliamentary Liberal Party over Mr Gorton's attitudes toward policy. His capacity for making enemies in what is supposed to be his base of support is being demonstrated as vividly as ever. The Liberal Party, before Gorton, hardly met for more than an hour each parliamentary week and hardly got beyond discussing procedural issues. Any substantive discussions on policy were a rarity. Now the party is meeting repeatedly, for as many as eight hours per parliamentary week. There is little give and take at these meetings. It is angry polemics and cool efforts at political assassination. This is lovely stuff. The article continues: Walkouts are common. The Liberal Party room has become a battleground of the most serious kind. Last week, for example, some of ihe most talented Liberals were devoting almost all their political energies to anti-Gorton projects. They were against him on the health scheme, against him on the Industrial Development Corporation, against him for excessive gagging on debates in the House and against him for his treatment of the Stales in the offshore minerals legislation . . . Former Minister David Fairbairn is the most formidable rebel and carries probably most authority. Later in the article the writer in referring to rebels mentions the honourable member for Lilley( Mr Kevin Cairns), that great democrat the honourable member for Macarthur ( Mr Jeff Bate), the honourable member for Casey( Mr Howson) and the honourable member for Ballaarat ( Mr Erwin). for La Trobe. and 'Trobe' has a capital ' t \ it. The article goes on: All these men would deny they are rebels. They would claim, with some justification, that they represent the traditions of the Liberal Parly and that it is Mr Gorton who is the rebel. 'The root cause of the trouble is that Mr Gorton is at heart a socialist. He is breaking every single principle lhat the Liberal Party stands for.' It grieves us on this side of the House to see this once great Party disintegrate. my intention to speak this evening in the adjournment debate. However, I would suggest to the honourable member for Robertson ( Mr Cohen) that whilst it is probable that few courtesies are left in this House it is the usual practice to give notice to an honhim or speak about him. I appreciate that the honourable member is newly arrived and 1 am sure that it was not intentional that the usual courtesies were not extended by him tonight. I do concern myself with these things.

But the point is that he did not write it. I think he reads beautifully. Not only does he read beautifully, Mr Speaker, but I think he looks beautiful. When he rose to speak he looked sartorially elegant. Last week he made a statement about the boys in the band. FranklyI thought he looked first rate. I would point out to the honourable member that as far as I am concerned this gentleman in the electorate of the honourable member for St George( Mr executive. I think that there were 3 people, Morrison) has a perfect right to his opinion. A member of the Liberal Party is entitled to make such a statement.

He has had one warning from me tonight and several others during this session. that because of a particular occasion tomorrow night there will not be an adjournment debate and the House is not sitting next week. But1 assure the honourable member for Robertson that I am prepared to bring the document into the House during the first week that the Parliament resumes. I assure him that I have perused it and I am referring to one of the official paragraphs in this statement from the State expelled in this instance, who decided to appeal to a court. I think the document made it fairly clear that the Labor Party allowed no right of appeal to any court of law. Such a step is not applicable to the Labor Party organisation.

But this one young gentleman who has expressed this view has had his name in the newspaper. Good luck to him. I think he could be a potential member of the Australian Labor Pary.

I hope it will be possible to determine how the fire started. I think we would all hope this. Whether or not this is possible depends on an accurate assessment on the spot. The honourable member for Newcastle suggested the inquiry is being undertaken by the Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd and the Department of Shipping and Transport and that R. W. Miller and Co. Pty Ltd are excluded. The Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd is conducting an inquiry and, separately, so is my Department. This inquiry is a preliminary inquiry and has no bearing on any inquiry by the State Government. After all, it is within the Jurisdiction of the South Australian State Government that Ihe conflagration comes. If it decides it is within its statements made by the honourable member capacity to undertake an inquiry it is up to it, but at this stage the two preliminary investigations are being undertaken by Broken Hill Pry Co. Ltd as the people concerned with the shipyard and by the Department of Shipping and Transport in order to determine first of all the circumstances and facts as soon as possible and, secondly, what powers we might have. The matters the honourable member for Newcastle has raised I am quite happy to refer to a technically competent committee for inquiry, but I frankly do not believe this House is competent to prejudge inquiries or to undertake inquiries of this nature. Until we get sufficient facts for us to be able to debate the issues here in an adequate form it is preferable for the matter to be raised in that way. Consequently I hope that when the House resumes I will have some details and facts in relation to the fire and 1 will be happy to raise the matter in this chamber. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mibut for the future and will give to those Barnard) raised several matters relating to who live in Asia some opportunity of shipping issues.in Tasmania. These, as I enjoying a better way of life than they explained at question time in this House would hope to enjoy under Communism. today, are presently under discussion within the Australia-London Tonnage Committee and tbe recognised shipper body. I believe that not only members of the House but it is necessary that discussions be underalso people outside the House recognise taken at a commercial level. This Governthat the stand which is apparently being ment does not believe in intruding on the taken by so-called responsible members of detailed operations of companies who have the Opposition to support a campaign a commercial responsibility to provide a which is basically intent on changing the service. The basis of the closed conference law by breaking it is one which I would see that exists between the United Kingdom, Europe and Australia is that there should be a service which is adequate and which is capable of providing a frequency that can handle the export cargoes of Australia and service all the main ports and outports. These negotiations between the registered shipper body and the Australia-London Tonnage Committee I am confident will come to the solution that not only the Deputy Leader of the Opposition but all honourable members on this side of tbe House hope will lead to an adequate provision of a service for the outports in circumstances where there is more and more of a centralisation of cargo necessary to achieve the full effectiveness of the container method of shipping. The other matter 1 want to mention is that there have been in this House tonight for Robertson ( Mr Cohen) about some of my colleagues on this side of the House, relative to our attitude to Vietnam and those issues that have been raised in this chamber concerning the so-called Moratorium Day that is apparently about to be staged in Australia. I do not speak in the House very often on this subject simply because it does not happen to be my ministerial responsibility, but I assure honourable members and others in the chamber that I , like many of my colleagues -indeed , all my colleagues on this sidebelieve that it is tragic that an insidious propaganda campaign is undermining the minds of men and women in the Australian community against what we see as the absolutely essential necessity for a defence effort which is capable of preserving this country for the future. We believe lhat the commitment of Australians to the assistance of countries in South East Asia will preserve what we have here today not just for today I believe that it is absolutely essential as being the first step towards the introduction into our society of the situation that existed back in the middle ages when it was the law of the strong.which prevailed over the arm of the weak. If we reach a position in our society where the rule of law, the rule of order and the rule of peace are negated, I believe it would be a disastrous thing for the community. I assure the honourable member and other honourable members on that side of the House that when the honourable member for La Trobe( Mr Jess) and the honourable member for Chisholm( Sir Wilfrid Kent Hughes) make statements about these issues, they do not speak alone. They speak with the full support of every member of the Government. the Opposition) [11.56]I wish to say something about the Whyalla fire. The Sinclair) chided the honourable member for Newcastle ( Mr Charles Jones) for prejudging the issue. I would have thought that, if anybody had prejudged the issue, it was the Minister because in his answer yesterday afternoon to the question asked Foster), the Minister said: . . . in my opinion the circumstances of the the Commonwealth is involved. Every ship fire were such that no reasonable man could have over 200 tons built in Australia is built expected even the most adequate of fire fighting equipment to extinguish the blaze once it became because the Commonwealth subsidises it. substantial. The Minister has prejudged the utility of any fire prevention equipment or techgrossly negligent for the Commonniques there. Apparently we should believe wealth that the larger the fire the more futile it is to try to fight it. The Minister made what I thought was one of the most ludicrous statements ever made on such a subject that? when he said: It must be recognised that the fire occurred on a Saturday night at a time when most people, including I would presume those in Whyalla, were not about the shipyard and consequently were not available readily to take the necessary our country insured against the loss involved precautions to put out the fire. I would not have thought that there was any of having one of our own ships do it? technical reason for assuming that fires There is no insurance for those losses. What were less likely to occur on a Saturday the Minister is referring to is the very night than at any other time.

But of combustible material lying around a up to a year's labour may be lost, as well shipyard. of persons to fight the fire? fire brigades do not disperse over the weekend. That is scarcely a very comforting thought. The Minister cannot write off this disaster. This was the largest conflagration that any of us can remember in Australia's history, but the Minister took it with great equanimity. He bore the loss with amazing fortitude. In his answer to the honourable member for Sturt, his first remarks were: I have no idea of what loss has been incurred in the past or at any stage through fire. No doubt, there have been very substantial losses on other occasions. The Minister took it very calmly indeed. The Commonwealth has to bear this loss. I would imagine it is the largest conflagration in this country's history. larger conflagrations? I think there might have been some such fire in wool stores.

The Minister is responsible for tbe Department and the various instrumentalities whicb place these orders and which own this valuable property until delivery is given. 1 cannot think of any Commonwealth instrumentality which has suffered such a loss with such equanimity. The first statement made by the Minister on this subject suggested that it should all be written off as of no importance. He said it was covered by insurance: the Are happened on a Saturday night: we must accept that therefore it would be a difficult fire to cope with; and, in any case, the fire was so large that it was pretty useless to take any steps to deal with it. Let me bring forward the record of fires in which the Commonwealth has been involved in recent years. There was the great fire in the Townsville bulk sugar depot in May 1963. The Commonwealth bore some responsibility there. Considerable Commonwealth installations are in Townsville. It was found that those in the possession of the Department of Civil Aviation and the Department of Air could not cooperate with the port authorities and with the fire brigade of the city council. Nothing could be done for days; the fire had to burn itself out. Then there was the lire in the Melbourne mail exchange. Lastly, I mention the fire at HMAS 'Albatross' which occurred at Christmas 1967. Once again, nobody would be on duty. There is spontaneous combustion on Christmas Day meaning a loss of $1,800,000. The Commonwealth Fire Board did not know about that fire. Quite frankly, the Commonwealth has such large installations and it places such large contracts that it ought to take a much more prudent attitude towards conflagrations affecting its property. It is not the only body concerned here. We now have the fact that the largest shipyard in the southern hemisphere has been discredited by this conflagration. This is the largest shipyard in thewould like to follow the last 2 speakers southern hemisphere. Can any of us from this side-the Leader of the Opposiremember an occasion when any comtion ( Mr Whitlam) and the honourable parable conflagration has occurred in any member for Newcastle ( Mr Charles Jones) shipyard?

It is no great encouragestated that there are to be 2 inquiriesment to a company which is trying to build one by his own Department and the other ships for the Australian trade in Australian shipyards, and which has placed the largest order that an Australian shipyard has ever had, to be excluded from all considerations here.

Ltd and similarly by the investigation by the Australian Shipbuilding Board. by us. Minister rebutted the allegation made in this respect by the honourable member for Newcastle. The biggest customer Australian shipyards have and the first Australian company to place orders for tankers which are the principal ships on our coast is a big sufferer in this instance. Yet the Minister completely wipes off any concern for this matter. Apparently the Department of Shipping and Transport is prepared to cover up for the shipyard itself which ought to be encouraged to pursue safe building techniques and to obtain similar orders in the future. We gain no credit for our Government or for this shipyard by giving the impression that this conflagration was inevitable, that it was a matter of no moment, that insurance will cover it, that it occurred on a Saturday night and that it was so big that nothing could be done about it. This is not good enough. Commonwealth property and a Commonwealth guarantee are involved. The largest ship every under construction in Australia, which was being built for the biggest client of Australian shipyards and the most patriotic of our private shipping companies, is involved.

162,Mr Wallis (Grey) [12.7 A.m.],"Iby the Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd. It is certainly to be hoped that, whatever comes out of those inquiries, lessons will be learnt. I look at this matter from the viewpoint that the fire had burned for quite some time before it was actually noticed and by that time it had got out of hand, and that a little later it struck the oxy-propane bottles and oxy-acetylene bottles. By that time it was too late. There are many circumstances that can arise in a place such as Whyalla and in the confined space of a ship. We must remember that this incident did occur out in the open. A lot of this equipment is inside the ship and there are many circumstances that can arise. A fire can occur suddenly in oxy-acetylene equipment. I have had considerable experience in the handling of oxy-acetylene and oxy-propane equipment. I have seen plenty of things happen in a very short space of time. When a fire suddenly breaks out when this equipment is in the open, if one is unlucky the fire can get out of control. In normal working hours a few hundred men would have been working on this ship. The fact that the men had knocked off at 3 o'clock on the Saturday afternoon does not come into this matter. Normally, if a fire starts as a results of a particular set be learned and that steps will be taken to of circumstances, such as sparks hitting an oxy hose, there is a fire within the bowels of the ship where this equipment is. If the fire suddenly gets out of control, with hundreds of men inside the ship, the fire fighting equipment is just not good enough. I understand that it is a fact that the Whyalla shipyard fire tender had been out of action for a couple of months. I believe that in the inquiries the reason why that happened should be really probed. The reason why there was low water pressure, as was alleged earlier, should also be probed deeply. These are the things that we hope will come out of the inquiries. Surely if 2 inquiries are to be held lessons will be learnt. Let us hope that the Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd takes pretty good note of the lessons to be learnt. I have had a fair deal to do with safety first procedures. It was always our opinion that BHP was one company to which we could always look up and point as an example of a firm that really took a keen interest in safety first procedures. 1 think it has the best safety precautions I have come across up to date, but apparently that does not apply to the fire fighting equipment in its shipyard in this case. I am sure that, whatever comes out of the inquiry, BHP will certainly learn a lesson. Criticism has been levelled at the local fire unit at Whyalla. One must remember that the local fire unit in Whyalla is a small volunteer unit and that the BHP works are outside the town boundaries. I think the men of the Whyalla fire unit did a magnificent job. I have had a bit of experience with these voluntary fire fighting units in my own town and I know the sterling job they do. I am sure that the crew at Whyalla are of the same calibre, but their attempts to hold the fire, as we know, failed because the fire just got out of hand. We should also look at the attitude of the South Australian Government to fire fighting equipment, because too many of the big towns in South Australia rely on voluntary fire brigades. We would hope that the South Australian Government has learned a lesson from what happened here and that it will go into the whole question of fire protection in country towns and try to bring in an improved system of fire protection. I certainly hope that, whatever comes out of these inquiries, lessons will rectify any faults. There may be 200 to 300 men inside a ship, and if something goes wrong, as is quite possible-it has happened plenty of times before-and the fire fighting equipment is not there, there can be deaths. In this case there was only one casualty, and possibly it can be said that we are lucky there was only this one casualty. Let us hope that these lessons will be learned and that the Whyalla shipyards will become a place with adequate fire protection. wish to raise a matter with the Minister for Immigration ( Mr Lynch). It concerns a migrant, a Mr A. J. Vorstman. I quote his name with his full approval and, indeed, with his encouragement. Mr Vorstman is a Dutchman who arrived in this country a little over 6 years ago. He is a boilermaker by occupation, is married to an Australian-born girl and has an Australian-born child. Repeatedly this man has sought Australian citizenship and his applications have been rejected without any reason or explanation",96,Adjournment
163,Mr Hayden (Oxley) [12.12 A.m.],"Ihaving been given. It is quite clear that his applications for naturalisation and Australian citizenship have been rejected because he is a member of the Australian Communist Party. I question the justification of the Government's rejecting an application for naturalisation merely because a person belongs to the Australian Communist Party. I certainly question the wisdom of anyone belonging to a Party of that philosophy, just as I question the wisdom of anyone belonging to the Liberal Party or the Country Party. In any event, he has a right to make a free political choice within our democratic society, that is, to exercise certain liberties and freedoms which inherently belong to an individual within a democratic environment. Having made this decision-and we should uphold the right of a person to make such a decision freely -h e should not be penalised for it. The Communist Party is not a proscribed organisation within this country. There have been referendums which clearly indicate that Australian citizens will not tolerate the proscription of this political party. Indeed, it would be highly undesirable to proscribe this or any other such political party within this country. Certain aspects of the treatment of Mr contribution is just as important as that of Vorstman are, to say the least, highly questionable if his allegations are correct. He claims that on one occasion about 12 months ago, or a little more, two officials from the Department of Immigration and a third party interviewed him and questioned him for nearly 2 hours. It transpired during the course of the interview that the third party with the two Immigration officials was allegedly an Australian Security Intelligence Organisation agent and that this ASIO agent informed Mr Vorstman that if he was prepared to become an informer for the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation-that is an informer on the Communist Party, on political activity and on general radical movements in the community-thi s would favourably influence the outcome of his application for Australian citizenship. I ask the Minister to give his considered opinion and his considered verdict if he can. I know that I have brought this matter to his attention at somewhat short notice tonight but if he cannot say tonight whether Mr Vorstman's allegation is correct perhaps he will do so later. It would be highly undesirable for the Department of Immigration to be working hand in glove in this way with the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. But it would be even more undesirable that an ASIO agent in company with officials of the Department of Immigration should be in a position to say to Mr Vorstman or to any other person seeking Australian citizenship that although he was having difficulty and had been having difficulty for some time in obtaining Australian citizenship a more favourable attitude might very well develop on the part of officialdom if that person became an informer for the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. I do not want to labour the point any further at this stage. IfI cannot obtain some guarantee from the Minister that this did not take place then I feel morally bound to pursue this matter to some greater extent. It is quite wrong and repugnant to anyone who holds democratic concepts that a man's political beliefs should be used as the issue which allows him to be held to ransom for something which he greatly wants to achieve; that is, Australian citizenship. This man is working in the Australian economy. He is contributing to the economic development within the community. His any other member of the community. He has rights within the community. The most important right which he seeks and which has been denied to him is official recognition that he is an Australian citizen. He believes he is an Australian citizen in every other way. He participates lawfully within the Australian society. He has joined a political party as an act of free choice, a party which is not illegal in this country. Accordingly it is quite wrong to discriminate against him. His wife is an Australian born citizen and she feels gravely discriminated against because of the way in which her husband is being treated. She finds it extremely offensive that the family should be regarded in this particular way. They have an Australian born child. They ought to be given Australian citizenship. The Department of Immigration repeatedly replies to Mr Vorstman in the following terms: It is a long standing rule to disclose the reason for the refusal or deferment of an application for citizenship only where the applicant is unable to show that he has an adequate knowledge of the English language or is unable to meet tbe residential requirements of the Citizenship Act. As Mr Vorstman's case does not come within these categories I am unable to inform you ot the grounds on which bis application was refused. Minister, whom I regard personally as a One does not need to be a Sherlock Holmes to conclude very easily that his application is refused because he is a member of the Communist Party. But the fact is that the Department refuses to make this confession and I ask why. It would be a simple matter for the Department to say as a matter of procedure: 'We do not provide Australian citizenship to people who belong to this political party'. It is quite wrong because Mr Vorstman and people in a like situation find themselves being treated in an extremely frustrating way, a way which Kafka found drove him almost to insane distraction; a remote almost featureless bureacracy making decisions in the castle, as Kafka wrote in one of his more renowned works; remote bureaucracy which cannot be reached and which is making decisions almost in the abstract and passing them down through goodness knows what sort of tortuous pipelines finally to reach the hapless victims of these decisions. This is quite wrong. We do not want a remote bureaucracy making some sort of vague assessment and giving some sort of vaguely worded decision on the rights of a person within the community. AsK found in all of Kafka's writings, he was shuttled from minor official to minor official, always skirmishing on the periphery but never really quite reaching the heart of where the decisions were made, never quite reaching where he should be entitled to reach as a citizen within a democratic society, to put his case for his rights within a society. He has the right to establish that he is an individual, that this is a democratic society and that no bureaucracy and no person has a right to take these privileges from any individual. I repeat that I do not support the political views of Mr Vorstman, but he has a personal right, if he wishes to exercise it, to choose freely to belong to the Australian Communist Party. The Minister for Immigration ( Mr Lynch), the Prime Minister( Mr Gorton) or any other Minister in the Government-no t even that great democrat who looks after the Department of External Territories-ha s not a right to deprive a person of citizenship in this country if he meets normal requirements and standards which are not regarded as illegal if they are held by other Australian citizens. Mr Vorstman fulfils these requirements in every regard. I ask the reasonable sort of man, not to allow himself to be encrusted with the barnacles foisted on him by the rutted ways of the bureaucracy with which he has to work but to shrug this encrusting tendency off and to take a fresh and stimulating approach to this man's problem. 1 am gravely disturbed at the very many cases which occur in Australia where people seeking citizenship find their applications rejected largely on the basis of some sort of secret report which often comes from countries outside; from such great 'democracies'I ask Hansard to put inverted commas around 'democracies'-as Spain and Portugal. This is clearly quite wrong. Individuals in our society have rights. There ought to be a clear statement as to why this man and other men in his situation have their applications rejected. Where they are rejected there ought to be a tribunal to which these people can make a public appeal, so that they can exercise democratic rights, otherwise the expression is an empty slogan. Immigration). [12.22 a.m.]I do not intend to keep the House very long at this early hour of the morning, but I do want to respond to the comments made on the adjournment by the honourable member for Oxley( Mr Hayden). I appreciate the fact that he foreshadowed to me late this afternoon that he would be raising this case on the adjournment. The case, of course, concerns the refusal of citizenship to Mr Vorstman and the allegation that Mr Vorstman was offered inducements to provide information. The background of this case is simply this: Mr Vorstman's application for citizenship was carefully considered by my predecessor in February 1969 when he decided that the application was not one for approval. The circumstances of the case were again considered by Mr Snedden in October last, but the earlier decision was not varied. I myself earlier this year examined most carefully the papers relating",97,Adjournment
164,Mr Lynch (Flinders,"Minister forto Mr Vorstman'!. application and 1 confirmed to some honourable gentlemen who made representations at the time that I was unable to approve of the grant of Australian citizenship to him. As the honourable member for Oxley has indicated, the policy of the Government, which has been made clear to honourable members who have raised this question, is that it is a long standdance with the policy I explained earlier. ing rule to disclose the reason for the deferment or refusal of an application for citizenship only where the applicant is unable to show that he has an adequate knowledge of the English language or is unable to comply with the language provisions of the Citizenship Act. As the case of Mr Vorstman does not come within these categories I, as the responsible Minister, am unable to disclose the grounds on which his application was refused. I do want to say to the honourable gentleman, however, that this is not a case of remote bureaucracy, because Mr regarded for a century as a privilege, not Vorstman was subject to a decision made by myself after the most careful examination of all aspects of his case. With regard to the honourable gentleman's reference to matters which Mr Vortsman claimed were raised with him during an interview associated with his citizenship application, the information I have received concerning the interview indicates that Mr Vortsman's allegations are in fact without foundation. The honourable member for Oxley also raised during his comments on the adjournment the generality of government policy concerning refusal of citizenship on grounds of national security. I restate tonight for the information of honourable members that it is the policy of this Governmenta policy which has been reaffirmed on a number of occasionsnot to grant citizenship to Communists or to members of the extreme right. The reason is that those people aim to subvert by undemocratic methods the type of society that we have and desire to maintain. Their aims are not, in our view, consonant with the concept of good citizenship. We have always regarded citizenship as a privilege and its conferral should never be regarded in any way as an automatic process. However, an applicant's political views otherwise are not taken into account in considering citizenship applications. The honourable member for Oxley said that there were very many cases of rejection. To place this matter in its correct perspective let me say that in the period from 1st January 1949 to 30th June 1969 some 580,000 persons were granted Australian citizenship, and during that time only 405 persons were refused citizenship in accorEach application for Australian citizenship is the subject of exhaustive inquiries into all aspects of the application and of the applicant's background. If these reveal that an applicant's activities are such that he is considered to be unsuitable to accept the privileges and to discharge the obligations of Australian citizenship, then citizenship has been, and will continue to be, refused. As I recall it, the honourable member for Oxley also raised the question of some form of independent tribunal. I simply want to say that the grant of citizenship has been a right, and as being properly a matter within the discretionary power of the executive government answerable to Parliament. This Government does not believe that it would be appropriate that policies and decisions on matters of this kind should be made by a body independent of Parliament and in fact not answerable to Parliament. Proposals for independent appeals tribunals which have been raised in the Parliament from time to time usually have arisen from the refusal of citizenship on the ground of Communism or other extremism. But much of the information upon which such decisions are taken could of course not be disclosed at an appeal hearing without severe interference with essential security intelligence sources. That policy is a policy of long standing which has been endorsed by my predecessors in the Government. It is a policy which I certainly intend to maintain. -Earlie r in the adjournment debate the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr King) raised the subject of the problems confronting wheat growers, so I hurried into the chamber lest there was a need to support him in some action on behalf of wheat growers and the solution of their problems but, sad to relate, all that I heard was that if there is anything wrong at the present time in the countryside and with",99,Adjournment

It is located behind me. If they are going to be abusive at least let them be picturesque. It has been suggested that the Commonwealth Government is pure and undented in respect of the administration of matters concerning the countryside. I recall that not to grant citizenship to Communists or to of New South Wales the State Minister for Agriculture made a statement in relation to the first of the 2 measures designed to alter the structure of the wheat stabilisation scheme. He said that the announcement as to what was to happen, particularly to the home price of wheat, was made by the Minister for Primary Industry( Mr be able to deliver only half of their crops Anthony) in this Parliament after he had broken off negotiations with the industry and without any consultation with the States at all. I had conversations with the New South Wales Minister because we were concerned, and he was concerned, with the situation. He publicly opposed the announcement and publicly condemned it. He said that it would lead to increases in the prices of a whole range of commodities in the cities. Of course, this is exactly what loans which were made in the wheat areas. happened. He made it quite clear that it was futile to accept the opposition which I led in the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales because be said: 'If we agree with what the Opposition says and if we accept your line and say that we will have no part of what the Commonwealth has proposed the Commonwealth will wield the big stick. It would be prepared to break stabilisation and ruin the whole of the wheat industry and its structure to get its own way'. That is what he said and if honourable members opposite want to examine his speech I refer them to the records and annals of the mother Parliament of this nation. If we consider the suggestion that the wheat grower is at fault and that it has nothing to do with the fiscal dictatorship of the Commonwealth which brought this situation into being, let us look at what happened. The Minister for Primary Industry said that everybody was aware of what was going to be done. We had the situation where growers were informed of their quotas as they were getting their machinery ready to harvest. But the Minister says that they all knew their quotas. If we consider that point, it might be argued that the growers should not have planted any crops at all or that they should have cut their crops according to the quotas which had not been mentioned and which they had not received. This presupposes that they have a magnificent form of foresight, highly developed. But let us be blunt about this. What actually happened was that not only did the growers not know precisely what was intended but the banking system did not know because in many instances bank managers and bank agencies, both public and private, made advances to growers to plant the crops which they actually put in. Many of them were told subsequently that they would and be paid for half of them, but they had made these plantings in conjunction with their banks. So much for the argument of Government members who are defending the Government so sturdily tonight and who have suggested that the wheat growers are hopeless in their ability to plan. The growers did not know the situation nor did the banking institutions of the nation, because every bank was represented in the The suggestion that everything was known and everyone was aware of the situation fails to the ground. Tonight there was a reference to the side. In fact, this can still be done. I notice black market. I was delighted today when that the Treasurer ( Mr Bury) is in the the Minister for Primary Industry rose in House at the moment. Last year when it his place and said: This business of 50 appeared that the harvest across the nation million bushels on the black market is would be bigger than it turned out to be rubbish. It could not be any more than I asked the Treasurer whether he would 28 million bushels.' The Minister then went consider making more money available to on to confess that he did not know the take in the whole of the crop and pay the actual position on the black market because first advance of SI.10 a bushel. I pay a he did not have the precise figures, but he tribute to him because he wrote back-no t said that he thought that that would be the very promptly but as expeditiously as he position. He was then asked whether he could, and I pay him a tribute for thatknew how much wheat was being held on and said: 'We have done as much as we farms. He said that he did not know but can'. he would certainly try and find out for tbe honourable member for Darling( Mr Government members-Oh! FitzPatrick), who had asked the leading question on this subject. In fact, we do not due. I will let honourable members have a know the actual position, nor does the copy of the Treasurer's letter if they are inMinister. Estimates have been given. These terested in it. I believe that they should act estimates have ranged, as I have said on it. The Treasurer said: ' I am not prepublicly on many occasions, between 20 pared to recommend that any more money million bushels and 50 million bushels. should be made available, but I will cerAsI have said tonight, we have not been tainly make available the full sum'. That is given the precisefigures.The Minister does what the Treasurer said. I have the letter to not know the precise figures. Let us be prove it. But what is the present situation? blunt about it and accept the fact that the Government has lost control of the wheat Quotas of 308 million bushels are being industry to such an extent that it will never applied across the nation. There is a conknow the actual 1969-70 harvest. I have said again and again that the that the Treasurer has in his hip pocket that estimates which have been made by people is earmarked for the wheat growers, involved in the wheat industry of wheat although the Government's supporters are sold on the black market range from not asking him for it. The Treasurer must between 20 million bushels and 50 million be very puzzled tonight as he sits there bushels. The Minister for Primary Industry wondering why they are not seeking the said today that it would not be more than money from him. After all, he said that it 28 million bushels, but he has confessed that he just does not know the actual was available. The money is earmarked for position. However, he is going to make an this purpose and he has it in his hip pocket, effort to find out. I wish him good luck. But but his colleagues are not asking him for it. let us be quite blunt about it and accept the fact that because the Government has Unfortunately the facts hurt somewhat. in fact lost control of the industry it is When trouble arises and wells in the coununlikely ever to find out the precise figures. tryside the voices are not raised when they This was the whole purport of the quesshould be raised and when they are raised tioning which I initiated outside the they are not strong or constant.

167,( Mr Speaker,"Hon. Sir William Aston)The following answers to questions upon Trade Union Dues (Question No. 345) Mr Clyde Cameron asked the Minister for Labour and National Service, upon notice: Does he see any merit in the United States law which decrees that no union member whose dues have been withheld by his employer shall be declared ineligible to vote or be a candidate for office by reason of alleged delay or default in the payment of dues. able member's question is as follows: Presumably, the United States law to which the honourable member refers is the LaborManagement Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959, section 401 (e) of which provides, inter aha: 'No member whose dues have been withheld by his employer for payment to such organisation pursuant to his voluntary authorisation provided for in a collective bargaining agreement shall be declared ineligible to vote or be a mended by the Select Committee on Aircraft candidate for office in such organisation by reason of alleged delay or default in the payment of dues'. I understand that many Australian employers arrange for union subscriptions of their employees to be forwarded to the union concerned. For example, as the honourable member will no doubt be aware, the Australian Workers Union is party to many agreements containing such provisions. My general view would be that there is an obligation on the parties to such arrangements to ensure that they do not operate so as to disadvantage those affected by them. If the honourable member considers there are cases in which persons have been disadvantaged by such arrangements. I would be glad if he would draw them to my attention. Arbitration Law: Definition of 'Public Interest' (Question No. 379) Mr Clyde Cameron asked the Minister for Labour and National Service, upon notice: (1) Has either the Commonwealth Industrial Court or tbe Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission ever given a precise definition of the term 'public interest' as used in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act; if so, what is it. (2) If not, how does the Commission decide whether 'public interest' is, in fact, at issue on occasions when public interest has to be determined. notice were circulated: able member's question is as follows: (1) I am not aware that the Commonwealth Industrial Court or the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission has given a precise definition of the term 'public interest'. (2) When 'public interest' is at issue the Commission makes a decision on submissions put to it by the parties in all the circumstances bearing on the case. Royal Australian Air Force: Learmonth Base (Question No. 484) Mr Les Johnson asked the Minister representing the Minister for Air, upon notice: Will soundproof sleeping quarters be provided for personnel at the Royal Australian Air Force Base at Learmonth in Western Australia as recomNoise. provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Learmonth airfield is being developed as an unmanned base and no permanent sleeping quarters will be provided. (2) The Airfield Construction Squadron which will undertake the development will be accommodated in existing buildings renovated to a standard for short term occupation. On this basis the buildings will not be sound proofed; but during the construction period there will be no significant movement of aircraft on the base. I Non-Manual Workers (Question No. 523) Mr Clyde Cameron asked the Minister for Labour and National Service, upon notice: What was the percentage of non-manual workers employed in the (a) transportation equipment, (b) electrical and electronic equipment, (c) chemical and allied trades, (d) food processing and (e) fuel and power industries, or their nearest equivalent industries, in each year since 1950. able member's question is contained in the following Table.

(4) Which of the member States have ratified H ul U n. i i . each of these Conventions. able member's question is as follows: (1) (a) and (b) Aside from Conventions which apply solely to non-metropolitan territories or developing countries (viz. Nos 82, 83, 84, 85 and 117) and machinery Conventions (Nos 80 and 116), ratification of a Convention cannot proceed without consideration of the relevant law and practice in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory. Some Conventions may, of course, have no, or virtually no, practical application at present in a particular Territory. (c) Mention has been made above of a limited number of Conventions which relate specifically to non-metropolitan territories. As to other Conventions, under the l.L.O. Constitution the question of their application to non-metropolitan territories arises only in respect of Conventions ratified by the member-State, that is in the case of tbe Territory of Papua and New Guinea, in respect of the Conventions ratified by Australia. The l.L.O. Constitution requires a declaration to be made for each non-metropolitan territory in respect of each ratified Convention. Some Conventions, of course, deal with matters that have little, or no, application in the particular territory. (2) and (3) The honourable member is referred to the 'Review of Australian Law and Practice Relating to Conventions Adopted by the International Labour Conference' published by my Department in October 1969.

Tariff Board (Question No. 537) D r Gun asked the Minister for Trade and Industry, upon notice: (1) How many persons employed on the staff of the Tariff Board are engaged in full-time research. (2) What are the qualifications of these persons. (3) What is the nature of the work in which they are engaged. MrM c E w e n I am informed that: (1) At the end of March 1970 four persons in the Office of the Tariff Board were engaged on genera) research-that is, on research other than that required to service the Board's current programme of public inquiries. An additional eight persons were engaged in developmental researchthat is, in developing analytical techniques relevant to the Board's normal inquiry work, such as the application of input-output analysis to assess the inter-industry effects of alternative recommendations for particular inquiries, and measuring the effects of scale and specialisation on production costs in industries under inquiry by the Board. These latter eight persons were also servicing Tariff Board inquiries by applying to them the analytical techniques on whicb they are working. (2) Of the twelve persons involved in this work, eleven are graduates and one is currently studying for his degree. Two have M.A.s in economics, five have Bachelor degrees in economics or Arts at honours level and the remaining four are Bachelors of Economics at pass level. Three have additional academic qualificationsone a B.Comm and AASA, one a second degree in Arts and tbe third a B.Sc. (3) Tbe four persons engaged in general research are working on the general economic effects of tariffs in Australia.
