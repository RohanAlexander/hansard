There may be some difficulty with communication. We still hope that there will be a cease fire because that is the pretion of this country, and therefore cannot condition of a civilized settlement. What will happen if the cease fire does not eventuate is obviously a matter of immense delicacy. We have had a great deal of discussion about it ourselves and we are in constant communication with governments elsewhere. For obvious reasons, it would not be appropriate to say anything about that at this stage. ter for Trade say when it is proposed to release the Tariff Board's report on the vegetable oils inquiry which was commenced in January, 1960?

The report on it is complex and has taken a great deal of study. I am now, happily, in a position to advise the honourable member that the Tariff Board report and the accompanythat it is reported that in the week ended 26th April our overseas reserves increased by £9,800,000, of at the rate of over £2,000,000 a week member ought to ask his question. He is now giving information to the Treasurer. which our overseas funds are being replenished by overseas investments? Are both overseas loans and overseas investment moneys liabilities upon the future producbe considered as making permanent improvements to our balance-of-payments position? and overseas investment do, of course, create some obligations. In the case of overseas loans, there are obligations in relation to the final repayment of the principal amount and the payment of interest. In the case of overseas investment here, if the investment is successful-as , fortunately, most overseas investment in Australia has been in recent years-ther e is involved in some cases the payment of dividends and in some instances the remission of capital payments. However, we generally find that overseas investors, once they are established here, invest in Australia a good deal of their profits, by way of expansion of their undertakings. Overseas investment has been a great source of strength to Australia, particularly in the post-war period. The Government has watched this process quite closely, because we certainly do not want it to reach unmanageable or undesirable proportions. The cost of servicing our obligations, as a proportion of our export income, is now only a fraction of what it",11,Roads

13,Mr Harold Holt,"Overseas loanswas in the 1930's. It is of quite comfortable dimensions at the present time. The degree of influence of overseas investment on the Australian economy is so small as to be of no great consequence to us. Indeed, 90 per cent, of the investment in Australia is still investment from Australian sources. The purpose of the honourable gentleman's question is not entirely clear to me. In fact, the attitude of the Labour Party on this matter is not clear to me because while criticisms come from the Leader of the Opposition and others with him, the Treasurer of the Labour Government of New South Wales is currently overseas trying to arouse interest among overseas investors in investment in the State of New South Wales. the Postmaster-General. In view of the train happens to be running late, these great opportunity for television to educate, honourable members and I assist the guard as well as amuse and debase, what plans has to load air mail letters on to the train in the Postal Department to use this medium order to make up time. I ask the Minister: in order to pass on improved farming Is it a fact that the practice of sending techniques to farmers, as is done in the first-class mail by train is not in keeping United Kingdom, wherefirst-classfarmers' with the promise given when postal charges educational sessions are in operation? implication of the question asked by the honourable member for Wakefield that the medium of television offers a very great opportunity for education in various fields, particularly in the passing on to rural industries of the latest developments in the agricultural techniques. I would say that television offers very great prospects in the field of general education. For some time, the Australian Broadcasting Commission and the education authorities have been holding discussions in order to see how these possibilities can best be exploited. I suggest to the honourable member for Wakefield that the appreciation by the commission of the value which this medium of television may have in rural matters can best be assessed by reference to the service which the commission has given in the field of agricultural development and rural instruction by means of radio broadcasts. I think the honourable member will agree with me that the commission has already rendered great service to rural people by means of the various programmes which it makes available over the radio to the rural community. The commission, having established that it realizes fully the value of radio broadcasting in this field, will, I am sure, continue its policy through the medium of television. I conclude by saying that the development of television services in country areas which is now being undertaken will enable the Australian Broadcasting Commission to maintain this policy and to extend its application. MAIL SERVICES. General a question, which I preface by stating that during parliamentary sessions, usually in the company of the honourable member for St. George and the honourable member for Lyne, I catch the train scheduled to depart from Yass Junction for were increased some time ago? given some time ago that allfirst-classmail would be sent by air mail included a qualification that that practice would be followed when, obviously, it would provide a faster means of delivery than would carriage of the mail train. There are times when carriage by rail gives a faster service than carriage by air, and I think that in the case mentioned by the honourable member for Watson this qualification would apply. I appreciate very much indeed the honourable member's advice that he and others have been prepared to assist the Postmaster General's Department in the loading of mail on to the train mentioned. I am sure that this arises from a desire by the honourable member for Watson to assist our communications rather than from any thought that he might himself obtain any advantage. I advised the House some time ago that we were making very careful investigations into the time taken to deliver air mail in order to see how the present methods were working out.

As experiments are taking place in the United States of America in the use of stratovision television for educational purposes, 1 ask the Minister: What technical advances have been made in Australia in this regard, and is the use of this educational medium contemplated? Reports indicate that a DC6 aircraft circling at 23,000 feet would enable an educational programme to cover an area with a diameter of 300 miles, and I should think that Australia would be an early user of this system. ber's question relates to a new development in communications-the possibility of using the stratosphere for improving communications.

In Victoria, duce Australia-wide uniformity at least New South Wales and Tasmania, nearly 70 mills have closed altogether. By insisting, that credit will not be released to bring home building to the high level of last year, is the Government just as determined to see that these saw-mills do not start again? gentleman appears to me to be quite wilfully misrepresenting the attitude of the Government, ln the first place, it has not been the intention of the Government to put small saw-mills out of business, nor has it been the intention of the Government to deny credit for housing purposes. Indeed, at the outset, I advised the Governor of the Reserve Bank, and he in turn issued a directive, that a social service such as housing was not lo be regarded as one of the fields in which credit should be restricted at the present time. In addition to what the trading banks may be disposed to do, we as a government have taken action to assist the savings banksthe State savings banks as well as the Commonwealth Savings Bank-to increase their rate of lending over the present and future As the House was earlier informed, the Government has quite recently had before we can assist by ensuring that an adequate level of home construction is maintained HIRE PURCHASE. many industries, creating a misleading balance between supply and demand and in addition encouraging individuals to incur debts that are too heavy a burden",13,Television Programmes

However, I will look at the honourable member's question in order to see whether there is anything further I can do for him. addressed to the Prime Minister. Was he completely satisfied with the conduct and questions of the members of the panel which interviewed him on television last Sunday night? Did each member of the panel show sufficient respect and deference? Did he to have a sneer on his face when asking questions? If so, will this unworthy individual be debarred from any future interviewing panel? Finally, was a list of questions submitted to the Prime Minister prior to the interview? honourable member for his natural solicitude on my behalf. As he knows, if he has appeared on television, no list of questions was produced; that is one of the rules of the game. The questioners have it all typed out, but the questionee does not have a clue as to what it is all about until the question comes. That has always applied in my case. I thought that the questioners set a high example of courtesy to some others I know of. WOOL.

Any section of the community interested in the wool industry can present evidence. I think I can discount any suggestion that there has been a hold-up, because the committee is working assiduously and expeditiously. It is trying to meet the wishes of everybody, but, of course, it cannot please everybody. Interior say whether the vacant premises at Rathmines formerly used by the Royal Australian Air Force are now to be used to relieve the acute housing shortage in the surrounding districts? If they are not to be so used, what does the Government intend to do with them? exactly what the proposals are for the disposal of the Rathmines base, but I will undertake to find out and let the honourable member know. the Annual Bulletin of Overseas Investment published by the department under his administration discloses that the new capital inflow from the United States of America in the period from 1953 to 1959 amounted to £61,000,000. while the outflow to that country was £83,000,000, giving an adverse balance for Australia of £22,000,000?

Cakes and buns are two notable examples of the kind of products to which I refer. For this reason, the adoption of the honourable member's suggestion would have a considerable impact upon the revenue. I can assure him, however, that what he has put forward will not be overlooked.

Bill presented by Mr Harold Holt, and read a first time. Second Reading. Treasurer) [3.23] f move That the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this bill and of the associated Appropriation (Works and Services) Bill is to obtain parliamentary authority for certain expenditure for which provision was not made in the 1960-61 Estimates. The various items contained in the Additional Estimates can be considered in detail in committee and I propose at this time to refer only to some of the major provisions. Some re-allocation has been made within the total defence appropriation of £198,153,000, with consequential increases and decreases in individual votes. The increases result in additional appropriations being sought for £4,415,000. Provision is made for additional expendisupplement loan proceeds available for ture of £2,400,000 on departmental and State works and housing programmes and miscellaneous items. Savings on other to finance other Commonwealth commititems, however, are expected to limit net ments. additional expenditure to about £800.000. Included in the provision is an amount of £269,038 for cattle tick eradication and receipts of the Consolidated Revenue Fund control in New South Wales; grants towards could exceed expenditures from the fund the building of homes for the aged, by more than the £125,700.000 originally £300.000; scheme. £144.000; a contribution towards therefore sought for payment to the Loan the cost of the United Nations force in the Consolidation and Investment Reserve of Congo, £193,644; a contribution to the an amount up to £40,000.000 over and United Nations Fund for the Congo. above the £125,700,000 provided for in £334.932; and a supplementary grant for the Budget.

The Australian Broadcasting Commission needs of £115,000 are mainly to meet salary increases.

There will be compensating savings totalling £265,000. When the Budget was prepared, it was estimated that receipts of the Consolidated Revenue Fund would exceed expenditures from that fund by £125,700,000. Accordingly, provision was made in the Appropriation Act for the payment of this amount to the Loan Consolidation and Investment Reserve, whence it would be available to At this stage, it appears likely that Commonwealth scholarship estimated.

To change the metaphor, the Government has not the moral guts to grasp the nettle firmly.

He did not agree with talented amateurs like the Treasurer ( Mr date, but our time will assuredly come.

He agreed with the Labour Party-a t least by implicationthat the Treasurer's formula contained in this bill was too little too late. Because of generally. As I have already said, we the troubles about us in every aspect of the economy, the Government's contribution to the solution of our problems in terms of this measure which we are now discussing is pathetic. It does not solve the big problem. Labour's policy on insurance, with particular reference to the question of how much insurance money goes into investment-governmen t and other investmentwas declared by the late Mr Chifley when he introduced the Life Insurance Bill 1945. We have watched this policy very carefully, because it is ancillary to banking policy, and there are very cogent reasons why it should be watched. This policy has been supplemented from time to time The introduction of this by decisions of the federal conference of the Australian Labour Party and decisions of our Economic Planning Council, which is in almost continuous session. Labour's point with respect to this measure is clear, and we are able to advise the Government as to how far it has fallen short of what should be done. The point that we make here is that this trifling bill superannuation problem. Many millions of pounds worth of investment funds-the amount is increasing yearly-ar e floating about the country and making some very peculiar landings indeed, to say the least of it. When wrongly invested, these funds add to inflation. The Treasurer tries to mend the leak in the pipeline of government investment by plugging the hole with soap-sof t soap. As a result, he is being criticized by his own side; he has disturbed the insurance companies and he is getting ironic cheers from members of the Australian Labour Party. We say to him: ""You do not know how to handle this matter. You ought to turn it over to us. If you do, we shall show you how it ought to be dealt with."" And our time will come. I return now to the Treasurer. When he is not whipping out his magic formula, he threatens the insurance companies or cajoles them or bribes them with tax rebates and a lot of hyperbole about insurance believe that this measure leaves the problem unsolved. The Government's policy is weak. This bill, the purpose of which, technically, is to amend the Income Tax and Social Services Contribution Assessment Act, has a wider scope because it",23,Income Tax And Social Services Contribution Assessment
61,Mr Killen,When?,24,Income Tax And Social Services Contribution Assessment
62,Mr Haylen,"I do not forecast theextends to insurance and permits the discussion of that matter. But the bill leaves the big question of investment still in the dark and still not properly declared. What are the reasons for this lack of investment in government securities? Figures have been given and we have had poured on our defenceless heads statistics about the amounts that used to be put into government securities and bonds and the like. Statistics have been used to show that, despite increased earnings and greater capital gains, money is no longer being invested in government securities. The Opposition's point is that, under this Government's weak policy, the insurance companies have been able to do very much as they like. The fringe organizations which are fed by them and by the trading banks do not come under the control of the Reserve Bank of Australia or under the provisions of the Banking Act. I think that there is a great need for some form of control over the insurance companies throughout Australia. Indeed, by their actions, they are crying out for some sort of control to-day. Of course, anybody who is interested in what I am saying, or who reads my speech in "" Hansard"" later, may say, "" Would the Australian Labour Party resort to nationalization? "" We know what happened to the Chifley Government's banking legislation, of course, and we know that there is a parallel here between the insurance companies and the banks; so we do not speak in terms of nationalization. But we do think that control by competition is a very good thing. I shall tell honourable members why this has much relevance to the issue now before us. Surely every reasonable Australian will agree that there is plenty of room for reform in the insurance field. I believe that the Australian nation should have its own federal insurance authority. Circumstances are literally crying out for such an authority. T believe that we should compete with the private insurance companies for life, fire, marine, accident and other insurance. And we should plough the profits back into the national economy. If we established an authority of the kind that I suggest, we would not have to go now, called re-insurance. cap-in-hand to the insurance companies and ask them for a share in their investment strength to strength; it is insurance and reportfolio. We would have earned that insurance, which is like taking in other investment ourselves on behalf of the people and have made a contribution to the welfare of the national economy by balancing investments. We would have contributed to the investment portfolio, not of private .business or of the insurance bloc or the banking bloc, but of the people's government and thereby of the people themselves. If we had our own federal insurance authority, we would not. like Oliver Twist, be asking for another serving of investment porridge. We would be running the country instead of handing it over to the financial houses, the insurance bloc, the banking bloc, and the fringe banking bloc. We have to do something about the situation, and the government of the day, especially, has to do something about it instead of faltering in its handling of the problem and seeming content to deal with it merely by proposing a trifling amendment of the Income Tax and Social Services Contribution Assessment Act and uttering a few pious platitudes in this House. The Government must face up to the problem as we face up to it. I believe also that we should have our own export insurance corporation to insure cargoes and so on and so save the millions of pounds we lose every year in the payment of invisibles. There is no more badgering problem, no more anxious problem for the Government, and no more newsworthy problem than the problem of the balance of payments. The barometer of the balance of payments goes up and down. I am no economist; I am merely a humble student. However, I can say that if we undertook our own insurance and the ancillaries that go with it we would be able to save many millions of pounds and we would keep the barometer steady by controlling its feverish activity. Much of our exporting and importing is done at set times of the year. If we undertook our own insurance, we would have money available to see us through the flat period and we would not be engaged in the futile activity of paying for invisibles, which wreck a common-sense and planned balance-of-payments scheme.",24,Income Tax And Social Services Contribution Assessment
63,Mr Crean,There is a lovely new one,25,Income Tax And Social Services Contribution Assessment
64,Mr Haylen,"Yes. Here we go frompeople's washing. The suggestion 1 have made is one way of solving the badgering problem of balance of payments, which has the Government run ragged. We have not at any time heard anything in this House of any formula that the Government may have to effect some stability in this sphere the money in the first instance-and they for the sake of the nation. Let us look at insurance broadly, because ment at low interest rates in gilt-edged the bill does allow us to consider investsecurities. That is the reason for the bill ments made by insurance companies and now before us. superannuation funds.

What has been the result of this mad But what happens? We might ask ourstability of the business of insurance companies? What happened to the Standard Company Limited, which in £70,000 for telling the company how to get a shipload of sheep to the United States. How completely stupid! The other activities of this company also failed. Other small groups that have beenfinancedby insurance companies are also collapsing. That is why this bill, weak though it is, is long overdue. The headlines in the press tell the story. The honourable member for Wide Bay, who is curiously named Bandidt and who is now interjecting, reminds me that I want to talk about the bandits of big business known as the fringe banking organizations. On the question of superannuation, there is another matter to be decided and a few questions to be asked. Why has the drift been away from the old trusteeship idea of putting money into gilt-edged securities and so discharging the obligation to workers whose insurance investments aggregate enormous funds? I asked a question some weeks ago about the very solidly founded and very nnancial Commonwealth Superannuation Fund. So far I have not been answered. I shall ask my question again. Why did the Commonwealth Superannuation Fund lend £1,000,000 to David Jones Limited at 8 per cent, while thousands of contributors to the fund were seeking money for homes? The contributors have a gnawing need for money for homes; yet £1,000,000 can be taken by the trustees of the fund and lent to a company in Sydney to build a workshop out in the western suburbs! I asked that question and I have not received an answer. As is common in the House, when a relevant question is asked of the Treasurer, honourable members are fobbed off with a little farrago of words. When the answer is examined, we find there is nothing in it. I want to know and the Australian Labour Party wants to know how a superannuation fund of the stability and strength of the Commonwealth Superannuation Fund was trapped into such a phony deal. We have had no answer, but when we get the answer people may be amazed at the circumstances finance, denied normal outlets, oozes out it will reveal. Wherever we go we find the same story. their source. Trading and finance take a Small shypoo insurance companies, a numspeculative trend, the Government loses ber of which are operating in Sydney, are money, loans are under-subscribed and the lending money for wildcat ventures and public cease to invest in government are wrecking the economy. They lend securities. Because of inflation, the memmoney at 18 per cent., 17 per cent, flat, or bers of the public, too, are chasing the anything they like, and are pushing the mirage of high interest returns. Insurance economy downhill. These companies are formed because of the possibility of obtaining high interest rates on investments. I do not refer to life assurance offices, but to the little companies that are bankrupting themselves as did the Standard Insurance Company Limited in this mad race for money, while more sober business concerns cannot get a penny. The position to-day is such that repercussions are felt in the economy when anybody seeks to channelfinanceoff to his own uses. Because of these things men fall out of work, and the ugly word "" depression"" comes marching grimly into our consciousness. You cannot describe it in any other way. In the meantime, there are before us indications that the Government has created its own problem by allowing the unrestricted growth of the fringe banking institutions which, as I have said, are the offshoots of banking and insurance, because their directorates are interlocked and their investments are interlocked. Everybody says, "" But, it is only this "", and, "" It is only that"". Do not believe it! Capitalism is a very big set-up and when these fringe banking organizations get going, they have the blessing of the capitalist system. The trading banks piously tell us over television that, ""You can bank anywhere and you will get the same splendid service "". Perhaps you do, but what about these little brigands of the fringe banks begging in the street for every penny that comes along, and they make enormous profits which flow back to them. For instance, the time-payment system is owned by the banks and the insurance companies as are the companies that finance the purchase of motor cars. As the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Crean) pointed out, that is where the Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt) wants to look for the cause of the trouble. One result of the credit squeeze is that from unofficial and unethical sources while the real founts of money are dried up at companies that have money to invest have held out to them the tempting bait to tread the primrose path of dalliance with propositions they would not normally entertain. In addition, the ordinary investor deserts the gilt-edged fields, and sometimes, too, the trustee. It is here that the fringe banker works his nefarious worse on the Government and the community. Security, which should be the keynote of investment, is subverted to greed for the fast buck, the quick quid. By this means, we get a situation in which, either by persuasion or statute, the Government requires those concerned to do the right thing. It has moved in with this bill, which attempts, in a rather feeble and weak way, to do something about the matter. Under this legislation which we are discussing, certain insurance companies are properly targets for to-day in this matter of nnancial adjustment. And so are the superannuation funds which are misused for investment purposes, a trend which should be corrected. This is indeed a deep abiding perplexity to the Government, but the Government can remedy the situation if it will only take more vigorous action. To the Labour Party, it presents no problem. Our policy on insurance is defined. We cannot nationalize the insurance companies at this stage, but they must assuredly submit to some form of control, if only for the reason that the people have made the insurance companies rich, and they are now being financially crucified by their own money. The investment of money by the people in life assurance, in accident insurance premiums and in insurance on motor vehicles and other things has made the companies rich, but, by a curious and most astounding anomaly, the people are now being financially crucified by their own money. The money invested by insurance companies, which aggregates £600.000,000, comes mostly from those who labour, small businessmen and others, and it has never been used for the benefit of the worker or the small businessman. In these days of credit squeeze and other things, control of their own funds has long since passed out of the hands of the people who subscribe these funds to insurance companies. Curiously enough, £20,000,000 is paid by the Commonwealth Savings Bank in interest on the people's money, yet, because of the credit squeeze, banking legislation and bank directives, nothing is being done to provide homes for the people or to bolster small businesses. Money for housing, home improvement or the development of small businesses, finance for the builder, a thousand or so for the struggling trader or manufacturer, cannot be supplied. The primary cause is the credit squeeze, but the investment policies of some insurance companies at least must share the blame. I know that once this speech appears in "" Hansard"" the public relations officers of the insurance companies will smother me with statistics about the millions of pounds lent for homes, businesses and so on. Even so, that may not alter the general principle, for it gets back to the old homely phrase -ho w much have you got? How much will you give? After all, to whom do we owe the first responsibility? Surely to our own country? Ts it good business in the long run to say to a man wanting to build or buy a house: "" You are one of the lucky ones? We have some money for housing. You may have a loan at 8 per cent, interest flat""-it is 17 per cent, in effect"" but you have also to insure your life with our company in Order to get that house."" That is a fantastic position. A married man of 40 years of age, who has children, and who is struggling to get himself out of the rat race for a home, is told by the insurance company: "" You are lucky this week. We are releasing a little money for housing."" Then the insurance companies impose this condition of a flat rate of 8 per cent, interest, or, as I have said, an effective 17 per cent, interest. Such a disgusting state of affairs is deserving of the deep social scorn of the nation. It is disgusting to think that these luckless people who are seeking a home have imposed upon them a double liability. A man seeking a home is loaded with an extraordinarily high rate of insurance premium also because of his dire need. You may be sure that the insurance companies do not encourage the young man to do business with them. He is cared for in other ways. Tbey seek the business of the man approaching middle age who is thinking in terms of his responsibility. What a burden to place on a decent citizen who. above all things, is looking for a home for his family! I think that is one of the worse features of the whole system. Members of the Country Party may smile at what I say because they have become so buried in their own egotistical concern about how they can get a quid out of the country that they cannot imagine that there are tragedies in the city. They cannot imagine that these unfortunates who happen to be looking for money, who happen to be battling, become the victims of the sharks. I do not care how high the reputation of the insurance company may be, there is room for a great deal of improvement and reform in the direction I have mentioned. Why. Ned Kelly himself would not get a living in the holdup business in Sydney these days when we see what is happening, when we see such things as the imposition of double charges on a man who wants to build a home! T come now to the fringe bankers. Dr. Coombs has pointed out in his annual report for 1960 that these fringe institutions are not subject to supervision of their standards banking and associated matters. I suggest of liquidity. We do not know how they are fixed! They are not backed by central bank guarantees of support in the event of a run developing. But they are, nevertheless, encouraged by the trading banks which, in turn, are encouraged by the deposits of insurance companies. So far as the citizen is concerned, these companies are all in the racket. These fringe organizations flout the Banking Act and Reserve Bank control. I do not know whether they can be taken care of under the Banking Act. Recently, T read some reference to this matter in the financial column of the "" Sydney Morning Herald "". The"" Sydney Morning Herald"" is not even sure of the position. These institutions create their own interest rates. inquiries regarding one particular State inThey pay 4 per cent, on current accounts while the trading banks pay nothing.

Let me revert now to insurance and the of course, they owe primary allegiance. bill before us. Let me deal with the insurance companies which team up with hire-purchase firms in insuring motor cars honourable member for Parkes has said. I purchased on terms. To gain some idea prefer to discuss statements made by the of the effects of their business methods, let honourable member for Melbourne Ports me quote the case of a young man in my electorate who bought a motor car on hire purchase. He did not read the small print on the contract and went off with his new car only to wake up later to the fact that his insurance premium was fantastically high. Sometimes the insurance premium is nearly twice or three times as high as that fixed by a reputable concern like the National Roads and Motorists Association, which readily comes to mind because of its decency in trading methods. I would like to show honourable members a contract which I have in my possession, under which a young constituent of mine paid a £59 insurance premium on a £700 policy for his car, with little or no rebate for an accident-free year, when the rate around the town for that was about £22 10s. -Order! The honourable member's time has expired. have been treated to a treatise on fringe that those matters were not associated with the bill except when the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen) mentioned two things in particular. The first thing was that he did not like life assurance companies, and he conveyed to the House that the Opposition would treat them rough. Next he told us that these companies, in effect, were sharks, and he said that the Commonwealth Government should start a life assurance company of its own. Surely the honourable member knows that some of the biggest life assurance companies in Australia are purely mutual and that all their benefits are shared by their beneficiaries. If the honourable member were also to make surance company he would find that the benefits given by that company are not as good as those paid by one of the big mutual life assurance companies which operates in that State. It is sufficient to say that the life assurance companies, in particular, have rendered a great service in Australia, and especially to the policy holders, to whom, One can dwell too long on what the",25,Income Tax And Social Services Contribution Assessment
65,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr Chaney).,,29,Income Tax And Social Services Contribution Assessment
66,Mr Bandidt (Wide Bay) [4.15],"We( Mr Crean) and the honourable member for Bradfield ( Mr Turner). Those two honourable members are at variance, and I think it would be worthwhile to examine in what way they are at variance. In the first place, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports had this to sayThis Government claims not to believe in conthat we should get rid of income tax in trols. It claims to support something that it calls our country. It means nothing of the sort. free enterprise. Its action now serves to highlight the fact that it is impossible always to hold necessarily to be complicated does not, in such pure theories. Sometimes one must choose between the private interest and the public good. On the other hand, the honourable member for Bradfield considered that this bill was the first step on the Government's part to perdition. What the honourable member for Melbourne Ports has overlooked is that there is a dividing line between complete freedom and anarchy; that it is essential to have order in a community rather than disorder. I suggest that we can believe in freedom of action by the individual and, at the same time, acknowledge that we must have laws which say, for instance, that we shall not drive on a certain side of the road. We should not give the individual freedom to drive, willy-nilly, on whichever side of the road he wishes to use; and so we have laws to regulate our freedom. Neither should we have freedom to do completely what we like. In fact, it is a well-established principle of our common law that we have freedom to do what we like, provided that we do not injure others; and so we have checks and balances on the freedom that every one looks to enjoy. Similarly, in the case of insurance, the Government has found it necessary to introduce checks and balances on the extent to which life assurance companies may invest in outside investments rather than help the Government along. The honourable member for Bradfield which proves very useful and desirable. raised one strange argument in support of his various contentions. He said that the life assurance, and I do not need to go into bill is so complex that one may fail to them in detail. It is surely unnecessary at understand it; and I take it that he implied this time for any one to have to argue for by that that because the bill is complicated very long to prove that life assurance is a it is no good. I direct the honourable memgood thing. But I suggest, in brief, that ber's attention to the fact that the income life assurance directly encourages saving. tax assessment legislation, as it already It helps families at a critical time-for stands, is a very long and very complicated example, when a breadwinner dies. It act. to understand. understand, but it has been drawn and amended from time to time for a definite purpose. It stands there as our law dealing with income tax, and the fact that it is very long and very complicated does not mean that the law is no good; it does not mean So the fact that this amending bill has itself, make the measure either good or bad. In fact, the bill is a good one because it restores to the Government a fair measure of the money which the life assurance companies and superannuation funds were diverting to other channels. I propose now to read what the honourable member for Bradfield said when he remarked that this measure was a step towards perdition. He said, as reported at page 1244 of "" Hansard ""What is repugnant to me about this measure is that citizens will be compelled to invest their savings, not in what brings in a good return or even a fair return, but at sub-economic and unfair rates in what the planners consider to be socially desirable projects. This is entirely repugnant to me. What the honourable member has overlooked is that this bill does not introduce an element of compulsion. What it does, purely and simply, is to give these companies a choice; and I would like to remind the honourable member that the extensive privileges of relief from taxation and the extensive benefits which have been given to the life assurance companies in the past were not given as a right. They were given as a privilege to those companies, for a purpose, and that purpose was necessarily the desirability of having as many people as possible save money and save it in a form There are many advantages regarding creates a reserve fund, and even if a policypolicy he can still borrow against it in time",29,Income Tax And Social Services Contribution Assessment
67,Mr Thompson,And it is very difficult holder takes out a whole-of-life insurance,30,Income Tax And Social Services Contribution Assessment
68,Mr Bandidt,"l t may be difficult toof need. To a degree, life assurance saves the Government social service payments, because if a man insures himself for sufficient coverage, perhaps by means of an endowment policy, when he reaches retiring age he receives enough from that endowment and thus does not have to draw on social service funds for a pension, or, at least, not to a great extent. Finally, life assurance creates an estate for a deceased person and so yields revenue to the Government. So from many points of view life assurance is very desirable. The Treasurer stated in his second-reading speechOver the last ten years, more than 60 per cent, of Commonwealth and State capital works expenditure has had to be financed ultimately from Commonwealth taxation revenue. For this financial year, the proportion looks like being nearly two-thirds. Surely it is obvious that our country needs a great deal of capital. The Treasurer then went on to sayThe life companies increased their total assets invest their money in what they consider to by £562,000,000 between 1949 and 1959. They increased their holdings of public authority securities by £81,000,000 but only £4,000,000 of this increase was applied to Commonwealth securities during that period. it is no reflection on the life assurance companies to say that they invested their money in that manner because they have a -duty to do the best that they can for their beneficiaries. The only trouble is that from the Government's point of view they have mot invested enough in Commonwealth securities and the Government, therefore, has found it necessary to introduce a measure which will encourage, not force, them to invest in this direction. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports stated that it costs Commonwealth revenue £44,000,000 a year for an investment of £100,000,000 a year in life -assurance. He stated also that it costs the -companies £25,000,000 a year to administer their affairs, but the honourable member foi Swan( Mr Cleaver) pointed out that those companies administered over £1,000,000,000 worth of insurance. member for Melbourne Ports looks at any authoritative figures he will find that the great life assurance companies, in particular, pride themselves on the fact that their -expense rate-the cost of running their offices each year-is very low. They handle a tremendous amount of business. But it must not be overlooked also that in addition to receiving £100,000,000 a year these companies also are creating an asset which, as I have stated previously, is of tremendous benefit to the people of this country. lt is sufficient for me to say in conclusion that in view of the fact that life assurance companies and the policy holders of those companies receive a tremendous benefit by way of taxation concessions, the time has come when the national interest must be considered and when something that was previously a privilege must be reviewed. That is exactly what the Government has done. The honourable member for Bradfield has overlooked the fact that the life assurance companies are entirely free to invest their money in any way they wish, even to the extent of investing in the fringe organizations to which the honourable member for Parkes referred. They are entitled to be the best interests of their policy holders, lf, under this legislation, the result is that it is better for the companies to invest 30 per cent, of their funds in public securities, then we may be sure that the companies, being quite capable of handling their own affairs, will invest in that direction. In fact, if they find it best to invest more than the 30 per cent, in government securities, they will do so. I see nothing compulsive in the bill, nor do I see anything repugnant to Liberal or Country Party principles. I cannot agree with the honourable member for Melbourne Ports who stated that it has become necessary to force life assurance companies to invest in any direction. This bill does not force them to do so. In fact, it encourages them to do so in an admirable manner pose of this bill is to provide encouragement or incentives to superannuation funds and life assurance companies to invest a If the honourable greater proportion of their funds in public securities.

In other words, the private citizens, cessions has realized that in the national those who rightly support private enterprise, interest the primary industries involved must would like to see enough money provided horror because it is proposed, by means of this legislation, to grant tax concessions to The Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt) has directed attention to the decline in savings I mentioned previously that the policy of or if we did not provide electricity and water services for the industries themselves and Every honourable member of this House for the public sector of the economy, so that public services can keep pace with the development of private industries. I believe, therefore, Sir, that it is essential in the present circumstances not only to increase the volume of community savings, but also to ensure that a larger and larger proportion of those savings is channelled into the public sector of the economy, so that public services can catch up with private enterprise throughout the country. I believe experience in the post-war years has shown that while production by private enterprise has caught up with demand, public services are still lagging behind to a considerable extent. Whether we are strong believers in private enterprise or strong believers in socialism, if we are realists and are willing to face facts we must support a policy which will ensure that our public services will always be adequate for the requirements of private industry, or at least that they will not lag too far behind. For these reasons I see nothing wrong with this bill, the purpose of which is to grant incentives, by way of tax concessions, to superannuation funds and life assurance companies that are prepared to assist the nation by investing a specified proportion of their funds in public securities. I believe that this is a principle that is wholeheartedly supported by the people of Australia, having been followed for many years in respect of a variety of Australian industries. Let us now consider the actual provisions of the bill before us. In the past, contributions to superannuation funds by private individuals have been allowable deductions for income tax purposes. Contributions by employers on behalf of employees, to the extent of £200 a year in each case, have also been allowable deductions for taxation purposes. The incomes of the superannuation funds themselves have been free from tax. This bill will not operate retrospectively so far as the superannuation funds are concerned. Tf they prefer not to take advantage of these legislative provisions they may disregard them. It is a purely voluntary scheme. If a fund remains outside the scheme, contributions to it will still be exempt from taxation. Contributions by employers will remain exempt. The income of the fund from its past investments will remain free from taxation. The only difference is that additional income from investment will become taxable, just as investment income by other organizations is taxable, if the fund does not invest to the specified extent in public securities. This is, of course, an income tax act, and the Government does not and cannot deal with capital funds. It has therefore decided to use the income of the superannuation funds for the year ending 30th June, 1961, as a basis. The Government then says: "" If a fund does not come into the scheme, its yearly income will remain free of taxation until it reaches the level of its income for the year ended 30th June. 1961. Income in excess of that amount will become taxable if the fund does not invest according to the prescribed pattern."" It further provides that if insurance companies invest in the required manner, which is believed to be in the national interest, the whole of their incomes will remain free of taxation. Trustees will still have an absolutely free choice in the interests of their beneficiaries. Personally, I believe that in the past some of them have acted most unwisely. They have departed from the common law principle of investing their money in trustee securities. One major superannuation fund recently lent £60.000 to a land company that subsequently went bankrupt. I believe it was about time, Mr Deputy Speaker, that some of these superannuation funds and life assurance companies were asked to stop and consider whether they have not been acting unwisely by investing so much of their funds in speculative securities. But the purpose of this bill is not to restrict the trustees in that way although I believe it will have the effect of making many of them think. The purpose of this bill is to give an incentive. In future, the trustees of a superannuation fund will have to sit down with pencil and paper and compare the return they will get from government bonds or local government securities with the return they are likely to receive from ordinary shares or other avenues of investment. They will have to take into account the tax concessions which are offered if 30 per cent, of their funds are invested in public securities. I do not regard that as a difficult thing for the trustees to have to do. I think it is very proper that they should do it. Their decisions will be accepted or rejected by their beneficiaries according to whether the beneficiaries believe their trustees have acted in their best interests. So, Sir, although I would most strenuously oppose a bill providing for compulsory control of insurance companies or superannuation funds, I can wholeheartedly support this biil because it is voluntary, and it is not retrospective. squeeze in it? and I suppose every time you offer an incensome of the concessions we have had in the tive you can say there is an element of past"". squeeze. The fact that we offer incentives to primary producers if they clear their land or make dams or build houses for their employees could be regarded as a squeeze in this bill. It is simply offering a pattern in a certain direction. They are not spendthat has been adopted by various governing that money perhaps on luxury motor ments in Australia over quite a term of cars and other things. So there is a very years, and I feel sure that when it fine distinction between an incentive and a is thoroughly and fully understood by the direction, but there is a difference.

I say again that I would sions in the light of the concessions and have been vehemently opposed to it had it advantages that are available under the been compulsory or retrospective in its alternative proposals. When we come to the life assurance comof the insurance companies, and as it deals panies, we find that under this bill they will with a matter by incentives, I believe it is a benefit tremendously. their superannuation funds have always support of members of this House and of been liable to taxation.

In other words, He stated his case on a matter of principle,. if a life company does not comply with the pattern of investment by investing 30 per cent, of its funds in public securities within a reasonable time, the life company will lose some of the benefits that it now derives. But when it is realized that these benefits are concessions that other companies do not have and that they are given to life assurance companies only because it is realized that they are carrying on a nationally desirable activity, I feel sure that the though we will suffer if we do not comply with this pattern, if we choose not to comI believe that there is nothing contrary to Liberal principles or national principles operation.

72,Mr Wheeler (Mitchell) [4.53],"Iand it is well established that on this side of the House, at any rate, any honourable member is entitled to express his views on what he believes to be his own personal principles. The honourable member for Bradfield displayed some courage in producing the arguments he did during the debate last week. If1 disagree with the honourable member for Wide Bay in his criticism, I must say that I envy him his mental capacity and his willingness to accept this bill regardless of its complicated aspects. ForI believe, Mr Deputy Speaker, that if there was ever such a thing as a political Oscar, it should be awarded to the member of the Parliament who is brave enough to say that he understands the bill. The bill itself comprises 23 pages, and as if that were not enough, it has an accompanying explanatory memorandum covering 33 pages. This is a most complex piece of legislation. It will be some time before the implications reveal themselves. I do not know any of my colleagues who has established a reputation as an actuary, especially as an insurance company actuary, skilled in assessing the probabilities of human life upon which life insurance contracts depend. This bill goes deeply into the field of actuarial calculations and here the limitations of the House must be manifest. Therefore, in the main, one's observations must be restricted to broad outlines of the purposes of the bill. It is all very well to say that the bill activities at high, and sometimes ruinous, touches only on the investments of life rates of interest. Naturally, these cheap insurance companies and superannuation money loans did not provide what was bodies, but these funds only emerged from needed. So, the Treasury tried, as a logical the complicated result of actuarial investigasequence, the principle of compulsion. tions and calculations. It is significant that the Commonwealth Actuary has been in attendance in the House during the greater tion, it seemed that the Government was part of this debate taking, as is the custom disposed, in November, 1960, to accept the of his calling, a morbid interest in the proproposal of compulsory loans being applied ceedings. A great deal of the difficulties to assurance companies and superannuain debating this bill come more from what tion funds. It is fortunate, indeed, that went before the actual presentation of the the Government changed its mind. Once bill than from what is in it now. The original proposal for compulsory kept on pressing for its extension to wider loans was unacceptable to me, as it was fields of operation. Before very long it to a large number of the Australian people. would have been applied to individuals. It The idea now adopted that tax concessions was noticeable that the Labour Opposition should depend on support for government preserved a delighted and expectant silence loans may not be objectionable in itself, but objections spring from the idea that it may be classified as compulsion in disguise. The question, therefore, may be asked, how did the Liberal Party, in the first place, become involved in such a dubious proposal as compulsory loans? The answer is, in my opinion, that we inherited from a previous Labour administration the socialistic fallacy that money must be cheap at all times. I have often protested against this idea in the House and outside it. It seems obvious that money, like anything else, is only cheap when it is not in great demand. In times of great expansion, when we need a lot of savings to finance capital expenditure, we must pay a good rate of interest to reward those people who have saved money. In other words, it is necessaiy' to make saving attractive enough to encourage people to put some of their earnings aside. It is as simple as that. If the reward is not sufficient, there is no purpose in saving. The Treasury, in its attempt to defy this elementary principle, heaped folly on folly for twenty years and brought the country to the brink of ruinous inflation. Instead of dealing with causes, it relied on controls to curb the effects. First, it put the banking system into a strait-jacket to prevent it from competing for what money was available. The result was the growth of an unofficial banking system, much less scrupulous and more aggressive, which financed a great deal of the community's Under the pressure of a difficult situathe principle of compulsion was accepted, I am sure that its advocates would have when the compulsory principle was proposed. There was no opposition from Labour and there is very little doubt that if ever Labour comes back to this side of the House compulsion will come back in a big way. Yet the very fact that a form of compulsory investment was proposed did have one good result. It forced some realistic thinking about investment rates, with a consequent rise in the rate offered on Government loans. As a matter of fact, one of the leaders of the insurance world, Sir Harry Manning, chairman of the Mutual Life and Citizens Assurance Company Limited, seems to think that, with the bond rate of 5i per cent, operating at the moment, this present bill is no longer necessary. He forecasts that bonds will attract a lot more of insurance money on their merits without any inducement by way of taxation reductions and without the veiled threat of compulsion. It must not be overlooked, however, Mr money in private superannuation funds is Speaker, that if ever the idea of compulsory investment is accepted, as it will be if Labour gains control of the Treasury bench, there will be no more Treasury loans at 51 per cent, interest. The socialist idea, as shown over the years, seems to be that the the requirements for controlled investment. bond rate should be about 3 per cent, at which figure the insurance companies would face the bankruptcy court because it has been established in the past that they are unable to live on such a low rate. Returning to the present proposal, as the rate now offered for government loans is in line with the rates that insurance companies are earning on their overall funds, it does not seem that they will suffer any adverse effects, especially as they are to be given some additional taxation concessions. It is true that some of their funds were previously invested in equities in which there was a chance of capital appreciation, whereas there is no chance of appreciation with bonds. However, the very great demand for equities in recent years has forced their prices up to a point at which they are not nearly so attractive as they were. By securine a sizeable investment in public loans by insurance and superannuation funds, the Government will relieve the pressure on the share and property market and the insurance companies will be able to get better value for part of their money which will eventually go into equities. Also, the difference in principle between the original compulsion and this present tax incentive scheme is very important. Whereas the compulsion principle, in the future, could have been extended to practically anything, the tax incentive scheme carries no such danger. The pressure can only be put on that very restricted class that gets substantial tax concessions. I must confess, however, that I do not like the principle even now. I would like loans to have their interest rates pitched at a point in line with the market at the time so that they would sell on their own merits without the inducements provided in the bill. Turning now to private superannuation funds, it appears that these have been given an important concession in that the measure will apply only to their new funds. However, there is a point I should like the Treasurer to clear up for me. Much of the invested in equities, and it seems that the capital accretion which will come from these existing investments, in the form of increased dividends and so forth, will be treated as new money and may come within I think that, morally, the Treasurer's undertaking to make the tax incentive scheme apply to new funds should mean that this accretion from old funds will be excluded. There is another point also. It seems that life assurance companies are to have the benefit of a graduated tax exemption scheme. If they fall below the level of 30 per cent, investment in government loans, their tax concessions will simply be reduced in like proportion. With private superannuation funds, however, it seems to be a case of all or nothing. If they fall below the 30 per cent, level, they lose the tax concession. If this is so-and I seek guidance on the matterI should like the Treasurer to consider giving them the benefit of the same graduated scheme as the assurance companies will enjoy. There is another aspect of the legislation to which I should like to direct attention. It may happen that, as a general consequence of the legislation, assurance companies will be obliged to alter their investment programmes in order to conform with the percentage requirement which carries with it the tax concession. 1 hope that in the re-arrangement of investment portfolios, advances by assurance companies for home-building purposes will not be disturbed, but I believe that this is a very grave risk inherent in the bill. I said earlier that this is a complex bill, and its effects are difficult to predict. The difficulties do not reveal themselves immediately, and we do not know what will be the bill's effect on general investment throughout the whole economic structure of Australia. The bill is designed initially to affect assurance companies and superannuation funds; but I am aware that, for instance, public utilities such as privately owned gas and electricity suppliers-whe n 1 say privately owned, that relates to public companies in which there has been investment by shareholders-ma y not come within the definition of statutory bodies, to which assurance companies may advance money and in doing so, conform with the 30 per cent, requirement. Those privately owned companies give a service in maintaining and extending gas and electricity supplies. There are not many such privately owned undertakings left, but there are some in New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia and elsewhere in the Commonwealth. Favorable consideration should be given to including them among the statutory bodies to which assurance companies may advance money and in doing so conform with the 30 per cent, requirement. To deny these private companies access to moneys lent by assurance companies would, I believe, be to retard progress in quite a number of places in Australia. SoI hope that some consideration will be given to bringing them into the class of statutory bodies under the act so that they may continue to borrow from assurance companies. I cannot overlook, Mr Speaker, the circumstances of the original announcement regarding this measure, which was made last November. I hope only that if the Government were badly advised in November and were not fully aware of the circumstances surrounding this matter of attracting money from superannuation funds and assurance companies into loan investment, it has taken sufficient precautions to rectify that lack of knowledge and lack of appreciation. I hope that it has taken pains to see that the practical issues involved are covered in the bill. I look forward to further enlightenment on this measure at the committee stage. rise to speak to-day I am conscious that this is virtually the first real speech to be delivered by me in this House because, as other honourable members will agree, the maiden speech that one delivers here is inevitably delivered in a semi-conscious or fully unconscious state, and one hardly knows what one has said. 1 am very pleased to make myfirstreal speech on this particular subject, which I regard as vitally important. Indeed, there could be nothing more important to the future development of our country-whic h is something that this bill aims at in a very practical and direct fashion. So far, this debate has been remarkable because our friendson the benches opposite have expressed general agreement with the principles of the bill, with one main qualification-that it does not go far enough. This leads one to ask: How far is far enough for the Labour Party? One comes to the inevitable conclusion that the only distance far enough for the Labour Party is the complete nationalization of insurance and other industries. In the short time. I have been a member of this House a feature of the debates on almost all the subjects introduced has been the plea by members of the Labour Party for the early nationalization of this nation's industries. This surprises me, because 1 would have imagined that, being able to observe the results of the tragic socialist experiments in the United Kingdom, New Zealand and other places, our friends opposite would have been more temperate in their claims for the complete nationalization of industry. In my early days herein fact, on the second day after my arrival -the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Crean), a gentleman whom 1 admire very much and whose speeches are always well worth listening to, very clearly expressed the socialist policy when saying that there was a basic cleavage between the philosophies of the various parties in the Parliament. I could not agree more. There is a great cleavage between the philosophies that we on this side hold-of freedom and",34,Income Tax And Social Services Contribution Assessment
73,Mr Chipp (Higinbotham) [5.10],"As Ichoice of business for the individual, indeed, of freedom of living itself-and the Labour philosophy of compulsion, confiscation, and confining controls. I have noted sadly this unbridgeable gulf which lies between us. I have noted also that another feature of debates since I have been here-and I say this rather sadly and perhaps in a naive sort of a way-is the manner in which some honourable members opposite attempt to make political capital out of all issues introclusion for two reasons. First, I do not duced in the House. I know that this is an election year, and we have heard the rumour that our friends opposite have been advised accordingly to be political all the time. Trying to be a political realist, I cannot in all conscience blame them for attempting to gain political victories in this House on appropriate matters; but on a bill such as this, whose basic principles they say they approve, we should not see such a deterioration of debate as we have seen in speeches such as that of the honourable member for Reid( Mr Uren), who delivered a eulogy of the Soviet Union, and that of the honourable member for Blaxland( Mr E. James Harrison), who alleged with doubtful taste that the excellent speech delivered by my friend from Swan( Mr Cleaver) was written by a Treasury official. In summing up, one might well say that in general terms the members of the Opposition agree with the principles of the bill, with the qualification that it does not go as far as they would like. The only voices that I have so far heard raised in disagreement have been the voices of two honourable members on this side of the House the honourable member for Bradfield ( Mr that I believe he ignored the chief reason Turner) and the honourable member for Mitchell( Mr Wheeler). AlthoughI admired the thoughtful and very sincere way in which both of these honourable gentlemen delivered their speeches, I must say that I find myself in complete disagreement with their conclusions. Indeed, one of the refreshing influences in this place -and they are said to be few, Sir-is the freedom of speech and the freedom of criticism which are open to honourable members on this side of the House. I now take upon myself the privilege of being critical of my very good friends, the honourable member for Bradfield and the honourable member for MitchellI hope in a constructive way. The main objection by the honourable member for Bradfield to the bill seemed to be that he believed that a principle of compulsion had been established. He concedes that the compulsion is very mild in form. His main fear-and the great point of his remarks-wa s that this precedent would make it easier for a future socialist government to nationalize and to interfere with the rights of individual companies. I cannot agree with this consee in this measure any compulsion in the real sense. I feel that it is based on gentle persuasiona very clever and ingenious form of persuasion-by the use of the tax instrument to divert funds into the very sadly neglected public sector of the economy. If one wanted to go on and make an analogy about compulsion, one could say that a civilized society should be organized, and if one pursued that to its logical conclusion one could say that there is a form of compulsion in traffic regulations and the like. As a precedent for the use of the tax instrument to divert funds for a specific purpose, one might well cite the provision in the tax laws which affords certain concessions to primary producers. The second reason why I cannot agree that this bill is a dangerous precedent is that I cannot believe, in all my naivete, that the Australian Labour Party or its representatives who sit opposite would need a precedent for the nationalization of an industry, and especially of insurance. My main criticism of the speech made by the honourable member for Bradfield is for this bill. That reason is the tremendous need for the diversion of funds into the public sector of the economy for the development of this country. We all know that private enterprise and the private sector cannot expand unless there is, on the other hand, an expansion of public works. Industries cannot be established or progress and new towns cannot be built witnout corresponding development of roads and the other public amenities that are so necessary to development in the private sector. The honourable member for Bradfield saidI know, of course, that we have a special problem of development, and I do not overlook it. . . . Later, he devoted a small portion of his time to dealing with it, but in my opinion he really did overlook this basic question of development and rather criticized per se the precedent created by this measure. What alternatives have been given by the critics of this bill? We all recognize the need for the diversion of funds into the public sector. When we think of taxation, we all see ourselves as paying a tremendous price in this generation on behalf of posterity. More than 60 per cent, of our capital works are financed out of tax revenue. Does anybody suggest that this percentage is too low? What is the reaction to this bill by the insurance companies, for which my honourable friends fear so greatly? There has been no violent reaction. I believe, as the honourable member for Sturt( Mr Wilson) stated so clearly, that this bill will greatly assist the life companies. Indeed, why should there be any reaction? The provisions relating to people who wish to take out life insurance and the provisions relating to the companies themselves are more favorable than is the law in any other country, according to the manager of a Birtish life company with whom I talked the other day. Let us look at the position of the life insurance companies briefly. In the ten years to 1959, the total assets of the life companies increased, as we know, by £562,000,000, of which only £81,000.000, or 14 per cent., was invested in public securities, and only £4,000,000, or less than 1 per cent., in government securities. This Government's measures over past years in providing for the deduction up to certain limits of insurance premiums paid by individuals have encouraged thrift. I believe that this Government has encouraged people to think in terms of their old age and to put away something for it. This encouragement and the provision of opportunities for the deduction of premiums have increased the prospertity of the life insurance companies. We must always remember that, for these reasons, they are custodians of public funds. What is this pernicious thing that the honourable member for Bradfield suggests we are doing to these companies? As the honourable member for Sturt has explained, this bill will be of great benefit to the life companies. Nobody has suggested-and in my interpretation of the repeated statements made by the Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt) on this question I have never implied that he suggested-that the life companies were guilty of any wickedness or had been doing the wrong thing. Being free agents, they have invested in the ways which they consider best for their policy-holders and for themselves the wealth that they have acquired over the years as a result of this Government's policies. Some people-and notably the honourable member for Mitchell, who mentioned it very briefly-hav e suggested that one alternative might be the use of the bond rate to solve this problem. History makes it very clear that increases in the bond rate as such can by no means be assumed to increase institutional investment in Commonwealth securities. For example, since 1949 the bond rate has been increased in steps from 3 i per cent, to 5% per cent. In about the same period, the total assets of the life companies increased by £562,000,000, of which only 14 per cent, found its way into government securities and less than 1 per cent, into Commonwealth Government securities. The counter argument which has been put, of course, is that the bond rate has not been raised high enough. Despite the increasing publicity which has been given recently to the value of the 2s. in the £1 income tax rebate on interest obtained from Commonwealth loans, there seems to be no general realization that even though the rates offered in the current loan range from 5i and 5 i per cent, they are the equivalent of interest rates ranging from 6 per cent, to Ih per cent, on fully taxable securities. Thus, a life company paying tax of 7s. in the £1 would need to obtain a yield of 6.2 per cent, from a fully taxable security in order to obtain a net yield the same as that obtainable from the new 5f per cent, securities maturing in 1981. There are not many countries in which governmentguaranteed investments with yields of this sort are available. It is good to remember the point of view of the borrower. Who are the main borrowers? A 1 per cent, increase in interest rates would cost the various State governments more than £4,000,000 this year and if continued into deduction from £300 to £400, to use his the future could cost, say, £8,000,000 next words, "" to encourage savings and thrift"". year and £12,000,000 the year after, as more loans mature and more money is free enterprise economy, and it is no narrow raised. I find this bill to be an extremely clever describe the proposals as a regrettable and ingenious piece of legislation which will departure from previous practice, holding benefit the life offices, be of long-term and within them the beginning of a growth that lasting benencial interest to policy holders may well become quite unwanted. It is to and will divert vital funds into those no avail any one of us saying, ""This does channels which provide the life blood of not go very far; it is not very revolutionary "". our nation's continuing development. gratulate my friend the honourable member by examining the policy of the Opposition for Higinbotham ( Mr Chipp), on the wellwith respect to insurance, which briefly and reasoned case that he has made out in nationalization of all insurance.

74,Mr Killen (Moreton) [5.26],"I conof the contention-that even though governments in the past gave concessions to life offices, they did not raise their voice about it; they preferred not to state the real reason, which was that the giving of concessions was to act as a stimulus. The contention is completely impossible to accept on two grounds. First, governments irrespective of their persuasion have no notoriety whatsoever on the count of lack of articulation when tax concessions are given. Very properly, the reason is stated plainly and for all to see. Secondly, the contention is at best hearsay and the Parliament legislating in 1961 should not be influenced by any unrecorded consideration of previous governments. A great deal of emphasis has been placed by my colleagues on the concessional argument. It could be argued with equal force of logic that any other tax concession was given originally in order to act as a stimulus for investment in government bonds. The widely understood view has been that the concessions were given to encourage thrift and saving. That understanding is open to modification, but it can only be modified by recourse to the record. On the other hand, the argument of concessions to life offices is a two-edged sword. What if life assurance and superannuation as an institution did not exist? There would be no demand to grant tax concessions either to the companies or to individuals, and that would represent a saving against revenue. There would be no contribution to revenue from life offices by way of the taxation they pay. There would be a profound increase in government responsibility in the social service sector. On this last aspect, this tentative situation emerges: The number of people, by virtue of age, eligible to-day for age pension is 1,075,000. The number of people excluded from the age pension by virtue of property and income equals 500,000. An estimated 80 per cent, of that exclusion has a relationship of sorts to either life assurance or superannuation. If you take those factors into consideration and carry the concessional argument right through so far as life assurance is concerned, the estimated total increase in yearly expenditure for age pensions alone would be £104,000,000. Having said that, I suggest that we should not lose sight of the fundamental point that the more people who become dependent upon the Statethat is, dependent upon the governmentthe more power tbe State exercises, and the aggregation of State authority can never come into being save by diminution of individual liberty. So life assurance and superannuation funds have been the means whereby many thousands of people have been able to save, to cultivate industry and exercise thrift, and this has meant less dependency upon the Government. In a secondary sense, if not a primary sense, life offices and superannuation funds have been not only the conservators of funds, but also the conservators of initiative and free choice. 1 oppose this legislation not on the ground that I am opposed to change, but because I am unable to find any parallel where a tax concession rests upon a declared percentage of an asset being invested in government securities. The 2s. rebate of tax on money invested in bonds is a direct incentive. It rests solely upon the fact that a person has bonds. But these proposals are not comparable because they postulate that the tax concession will run only if a stated amount is invested. The principle behind this proposal stirs one's imagination. What of the future? To-day, the concession rests upon the investment of 30 per cent of funds in government or semi-government securities. Plainly, in the future, the concession could rest upon the investment of 100 per cent. This mechanism, in the hands of a socialist government, could mean control over every life assurance office and every superannuation fund in the country. Certainly, as far as this Government is concerned, that anxiety does not arise, but I return to the point that 1 made when I began. Our action will not, to use the Treasurer's language, be any "" disincentive "" to a future socialist government. There is a mass of eminently respectable authority to suggest that the proposals, which I hope will be abandoned by the Government, will be declared invalid if they do become law and are challenged. Hitherto, the Constitution has been a barrier against socialization. But if you say to an individual, "" You will continue to get this tax concession if you do something"", if you stipulate some condition and circumstance in which he must involve himself, it would seem as though the taxing power of the Commonwealth becomes in fact the supreme power of the Commonwealth. It is interesting to recall that this exerpersisted with, I can only hope that some cise has been tried already. I think it was tried in 1908, and reference to it is to be found in the High Court judgment in what is known as Barger's case. I refer to an attempt made by the government of the day to impose excise duty on the basis of a particular manufacturer's employing people at a particular wage standard. The High Court ruled that this was not an act connected with excise, but an act relating to wages and hours obtaining in a State. That authority in Barger's case has never disappeared. It is still there to-day. Indeed, one High Court judge did use language to the effect that the long shadow of Barger's case stands out as a solemn reminder to governments not to go too far in using the taxing power, the defence power and the external affairs power. Many people have taken the view that the old doctrine that influenced the High Court in Barger's case died with the Engineers' case. That is not the position at all because, as late as 1947, the Melbourne corporation challenged the validity of the then Labour Government's action in compelling every local government authority to bank with the Commonwealth Bank. The old doctrine of implied prohibition came to light again on that occasion. Let me put one point to the House, and particularly, let me put it earnestly to my colleagues on this side. It is one thing to use the taxing weapon, but how it is used is another thing. I ask honourable members what would be their reactions if they were told in an amendment of the Income Tax Assessment Act that the concessions allowed for their wives and families would run provided they contributed 30 per cent, of their assets for the purchase of government bonds. To take a ludicrous example, what would be their reaction if the concession were to run only so long as they contributed £10 a year to the Australian Labour Party? The principle is the same. We are imposing a condition beyond the physical circumstances. There is no knowing where this sort of thing could end. If this proposal is valid, then it means that the taxing power of the Commonwealth is supreme, and the Australian Constitution, with its prediction of a federalist system of government, becomes absolutely worthless. In the past, it has been established that the taxing power is not unlimited, and if these proposals are enterprising soul will challenge their validity so that at least we may know where the High Court stands on the matter now. on the insurance business if there were no concessions allowed for annual subscriptions to government securities? able member's inquiry, and I shall examine the effect on insurance business later if I have the time, but I do say that I would much prefer that the taxing concession be abolished altogether to telling a person that he will get the concession only so long as he does something. I come now to the attitude of the Opposition towards the proposal. I think the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Calwell) put the Opposition's view fairly plainly in Brisbane a short time ago when he was asked what was the Labour Party's view of the proposal. At that time, he saidWell, we haven't made a decision on that yet as a party. But, if I can interpret the feeling as I have heard it expressed by party members, they would favour it. He was then asked, "" Don't you feel that it is interfering with private investment?"" His answer wasNo. I have said that if the Government does this sort of thing then there is a very good case for asking some of the big concerns like Ford's and Broken Hill and these other people to voluntarily subscribe to Government loans because they use power, they use the roads, and so on, and if they won't help to fill up the loans they either go without or they will have to be told that they must make some contribution. That is fairly clear. One of the ancillary arguments that has been used by the Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt) with respect to this legislation was the failure of life assurance offices to support government and semi-government loans. He said that, in 1939, 50 per cent, of life assurance funds were invested in government bonds. That is perfectly true. It is also true that, in 1939, there was no inflation. And when we come to 1949 and see that at that time 68 per cent, of tbe life offices' funds had been invested in government bonds, it must also be recognized that there was an extremely limited form of investment available to tbe life offices. I am a policyholder, as I think most honourable members",40,Income Tax And Social Services Contribution Assessment
75,Mr Crean,What effect would it have,42,Income Tax And Social Services Contribution Assessment
76,Mr Killen,"I appreciate the honorare; there are some 7,000,000 policyholders throughout Australia. The responsibility devolves upon those who preside over life offices to protect the investment of their policy holders. That responsibility runs to taking into consideration inflation in the currency, and I believe that that has been the practice in the past. I remain to be convinced that the present percentage of life office funds in equity shares is high; I do not believe it is. I refer now to the Insurance Commissioner's report for 1959, the latest that is available. The total assets of the life offices for that year were £1,120,811,062. Share investments totalled £64,161,078, government securities totalled £268,433,674, and semi-government securities £154,269,714. One of the features of the proposal contained in this measure is that to qualify for the maximum benefit-that is the benefit to be gained from holding Commonwealth securities in excess of 20 per cent -the amount of semi-government securities held on lst March, 1961, must be retained. There is an element of retrospectivity here which is not at all fair. I cite to the House the case of the Temperance and General Mutual Life Assurance Society Limited, which, in 1959, held 15.5 per cent, of its assets in government bonds and 33 per cent, of its assets in semi-government bonds. That ratio has not been disturbed very greatly. To qualify for the maximum benefit the T. and G. must, first, hold its existing investment in semi-government bonds; and secondly, it must increase its holding in government securities to over 20 per cent. In other words, an increase of approximately 4.5 per cent, must be made. The assets of the T. and G. in 1959 amounted to £6,800,000 or £7,000,000 must be diverted. This company has remarkably little room for manoeuvre. It holds £39,500,000-odd of loans on mortgages and £6,400,000-odd of loans on policies and debentures and unsecured notes amounting to £10,600,000. This element of retrospectivity is completely undesirable and I would hope that, even if my general appeal to the Government is rejected, at least some consideration will be given to an amendment of this provision at the committee stage. I come now to the question raised by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports F.3509/61 -R -[52 ] ( Mr Crean). If the proposals contained in the bill amounted to amending the Income Tax Assessment Act to remove concessions, I would have no quarrel whatever with it. But making concessions contingent upon a settled form of investment must give rise to anxiety. What of the proposals? What has prompted them? My friend, the honourable member for Higinbotham ( Mr Chipp), put his finger right on the cause when he said the proposals were promoted by the terrific rate of development going on throughout Australia. It is perfectly true that that terrific rate of development has been going on unabated; and in the last ten years some £2,000,000,000 worth of works has been undertaken out of revenue. It is the settled policy of all political parties in Australia that we should maintain this terrific rate of development, but plainly we should inquire how it can in equity be carried on by the entire community. 1 have reached a number of conclusions, and 1 pray for the patience of the House while I recite them. First, if the volume of works is too great for the volume of loan funds available, the alternatives are to reduce the volume of works, which on the most comprehensive grounds we do not want to do, or increase the volume of loan funds, which can only be done by making this investment more attractive in relation to other forms of investment. Secondly, to increase the rebate on Commonwealth loans would impose an extra burden on yearly revenue, but it would unquestionably increase investment in government securities, and would in the ultimate reduce the expenditure from revenue on works. Thirdly, I believe the Govern£152,600,000, and accordingly ment should give consideration to following the United Kingdom practice of stimulating bond investment by the lottery scheme. Fourthly, no doubt there is scope for adjustment of taxation concessions now given to insurance companies. This adjustment should be made on a direct basis and not on a conditional basis. Fifthly, there is abundant evidence that the conduct of works throughout Australia is done without much relevance to priorities. A Commonwealth-States works commission representative of the Commonwealth and States to act at least in an advisory capacity could produce beneficial results. Every government throughout Australia and every person in Australia must realize that we, as a nation, cannot go on indefinitely doing too much too quickly with too little resources. For the reasons that 1 have stated I find the proposals unwelcome. They represent, in my judgment, an abandonment of the concept that when a concession is given it is given for a reason and not on the basis of a condition. Sitting suspended from 5.52 to 8 p.m. A rather remarkable situation has developed in the Parliament, Mr Speaker, in connection with the measure now before us. The Minister introduced the bill and gave a lengthy explanation of it, and what do we find? Quite contrary to the usual procedure, according to which honourable members on this side of the House criticize measures introduced by the Government, the only opposition to the bill has been voiced by Government supporters. This leads me to remark on the fact that we frequently find this Government finally accepting policies that have been espoused and advocated by the Labour Party for years. Time after time, the Government produces legislation along the lines of policies put forward by the Opposition. forward? able member for Canning that the Labour Government, which was in office until 1949, enacted legislation limiting interest rates on loans and limiting the amount of money that insurance companies could invest in new companies or new shares. As a result of the Labour Party's legislation the proportion of the assets of insurance companies invested in government or semi-government securities was 68 per cent. That was a most satisfactory position, and it was brought about by the overall legislative policy of the Labour Government. What is the position now? The Treasurer ( Mr individuals, and practically every one of Harold Holt) told us in his second-reading speech that although actual figures were not available the proportion of the investment of these organizations in government securities would be only about 33 per cent. This shows how the position can deteriorate under a government that is all for private enterprise, a government that says that you can do as you like with your money, and make as much as you can out of it, without worrying about who will pay the piper. This Government does not care how high interest rates go. We have complained time and time again about hire-purchase companies offering interest rates of 9 and 10 per cent., and that people are investing their money in those companies instead of in government securities at 54 per cent., but all that this Government says is, "" We cannot do anything; it is the job of the States to control hire purchase"". I suggest that this is not entirely the position, and that this Government could take action to limit interest rates and to prevent an undue volume of capital being invested in undesirable directions. I have been rather interested, since this measure has been before the Parliament, to see how outside bodies have tried to influence the general public, claiming that the bili is inequitable, and that it represents an attempt to deprive superannuation funds and life assurance companies of the right to invest their money as they desire. It has been suggested that this legislation will rob such organizations of large profits that they could make on investments. It makes me smile a little to hear the Treasurer saying to these bodies, "" Invest 30 per cent, of your money and we will give you 54 per cent, interest on it as a long-term rate "". The rate of 51 per cent, is offered almost apologetically. Is it not a reasonable rate of interest? I say it is more than reasonable. I would reduce the rate if I had my way. Yet it is suggested that we are trying to prevent these organizations from earning as much as they can on their capital. How much do we want them to earn? Should we say that instead of 51 per cent, they ought to be able to get 8 per cent.? Is that what is wanted? If there are persons who want that, why do they not say so straight out? I have had letters of complaint about this legislation from various those letters has come from some person working in one of the private banks. The persons writing the letters give their addresses and the names of the banks for which they are working. I would suggest that these people have been influenced in large measure by the propaganda that has been disseminated, suggesting that the legislation is inequitable.",42,Income Tax And Social Services Contribution Assessment
77,"Mr Thompson (Port Adelaide) [8.0],",,44,Income Tax And Social Services Contribution Assessment
78,Mr Hamilton,When did you put this,44,Income Tax And Social Services Contribution Assessment
79,Mr Thompson,"I remind the honorSome few years ago, legislation was introduced in this Parliament to increase to £300 a year the maximum amount of life assurance premiums or superannuation fund payments deductible for income tax purposes. I was sharing an office in Adelaide with the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Clyde Cameron), whom I do not see in the House at the moment. A man called to see us and said: "" You can now invest £300 a year in an annuity or a superannuation fund and claim that amount as deduction from your income for purposes of taxation. It will pay you to do so."" Let me give the House a few relevant figures in this connection. Tn the case of a man whose income was between £2,000 and £2,400, the rate of tax would be 7s. Id. in the £1, so that he would save 7s. Id. on each £1 of the £300 that he paid to a superannuation fund or a life assurance company. A nominal payment of £1 represented, therefore, an actual payment of only 12s. l i d . , and the Government was losing 7s. Id. on every £1 paid. If a man took out more life assurance and contracted to pay an extra £200 a year in premiums, the loss to the Government would have been quite considerable. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Crean) cited statistics, and I shall not reiterate them. They showed that the Government is losing £35,000,000 a year in income tax because of this concession alone. He also showed that the life companies are saving another £9,000,000 in other taxation concessions. This makes £44,000,000 a year that the Government is losing by granting concessions to persons who are paying for superannuation benefits or life assurance policies. The total amount that is paid in premiums each year is about £150,000,000. About £50,000,000 is paid out again because of the maturing of policies or the death of policy holders. This means that the assets of superannuation funds and life assurance companies are increasing by about £100,000,000 a year, while the Government is losing £44,000,000 a year. Now the Treasurer is saying to these companies, ""Out of that £100,000,000 that you are getting every year we want you to put £30,000,000 into government loans; at least £20,000,000 in Commonwealth loans and £10,000,000 in loans floated by State and semi-government instrumentalities, such as municipal authorities. We are not asking you to make a gift to the Government. We are not going to take a compulsory loan without interest, but we want you to invest £30,000,000 of that £100,000,000 at 5* per cent."". In the light of that proposition, I am amazed at the statements that have been made in this debate. The honourable member for Bradfield ( Mr Turner) was cited as a bitter opponent of the bill on the Government side. My view is that the Government, in this measure, is going only a little way in the right direction. I would go further than the Government proposes to do, as all honourable members know very well. But if I did so, I would be accused of interfering with the rights of the individual. Supporters of the Government say that the private individual should be able to do what he likes. At the same time, if my wife wants to buy a dozen eggs she has to pay the price that is set by a government egg board. According to the supporters of the Government, that is not interference with the rights of the individual. IfI keep more than 30 fowls, I have to register as a poultry keeper. I have to get permission to sell the eggs that are produced, and I cannot sell them below a certain price. Ts that freedom for the individual? I recall that years ago when the Minister for Social Services( Mr Roberton) was a back bencher on the Government side, he complained bitterly because producers of dried fruits and other primary products were compelled to sell a proportion of their production under conditions that were laid down by the Government. Of course, the honourable member is a Minister now and he does not object to such practices. I have not heard any member of the Australian Country Party object to egg boards or the fixing of the price of eggs. I have not heard one of them object to a fixed price for the wheat they sell for flour. They agree with those practices, and I am not going to argue with them on that point. My argument is this: If supporters of the Government are prepared to condone interference with the rights of the individual when it suits their pockets, they should not harp continually on the freedom and the rights of the individual. If members of the Opposition advocate controls of that kind, we are told that we are socialists. Indeed, correspondents of some of the newspapers, commenting on this bill, are saying that the Government is carrying out some aspects of the Opposition's policy; and they object. That is why some of the hard-crusted supporters of the Government object so strongly to this measure. If they do not say it in so many words, they say it by their about the man on a higher income? The actions. They are saying in effectTo him that hath shall be given. Let us turn now to the net gain of invest the amount in tax concession bonds. £100,000,000.

WhatI am decrying is the tralian Mutual Life Insurance Company implication that less money will be made building, and similarly impressive buildings available for housing loans if the insurance belonging to other insurance companies. companies have to invest in government funds. It is about time the people woke up. I have told the House about an insurance agent who approached some honourable members, and I have referred to the tax concessions that can be claimed by a person with an income exceeding £2,000 a year. That is not an average case. Let us consider the position of the more ordinary person receiving a little over £1,000 a year. A person with an income of more than £1,000 but less than £1,200 will get a tax concession of 4s. 4d. in the £1 for every £1 he invests in life assurance. But what honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) spoke of persons who could save £500 a year and would be prepared to I propose to refer to the case of a man occupy the buildings. to them. They invest their money in the buildings. This bill is designed to limit the amounts invested by insurance companies in huge buildings and to encourage them to place 30 per cent, of their investments in Commonwealth loans. Buildings",44,Income Tax And Social Services Contribution Assessment
80,Mr King,The insurance companies,46,Income Tax And Social Services Contribution Assessment
81,Mr Thompson,"The buildings belongsuch as those built by the insurance companies require a tremendous amount of money. Let any one try to borrow £20,000 from a bank and see how much security is needed! One honourable member who is interjecting is a banker and he may know a lot about these things, but I know a little about what the banks do. I know the amounts they are lending and the profits that they are making. Generally speaking, our banks are fine institutions, but they require substantial security before they will imake a loan. For a loan of £20,000 a customer may need security of £50,000, or perhaps even more. Honourable members opposite who borrow in big sums will know that. In view of the fact that security required by the banks for a loan may be two and a half or three times the amount of the loan, one may well ask how the insurance companies can finance the construction for themselves of huge city buildings costing £1,000,000 or £2,000,000. They say that they invest their own money in these buildings and of course they get a handsome return by letting office space. The return from these buildings is tremendous. Certainly it is more than the 5 i per cent, payable on Commonwealth loans. Indeed, if the insurance companies could not get more than 54 per cent., they would not bother to build office accommodation. They would simply invest their money in government bonds and collect a cheque every half year. The objection that this measure may prevent insurance companies from helping people to purchase homes is only eye wash. If these institutions invest 30 per cent, of their money in Commonwealth bonds, the Government will be able to impose lower taxation than would otherwise be necessary. It is rather a sore point with some people that they have to pay taxation because loan money cannot be raised on the market. Therefore, I cannot understand the objections of some Government supporters to this measure. The States are clamouring for loan money and the Commonwealth is clamouring for loan money. We are bringing over 100,000 migrants a year to this country and a house is required for an average of every four of them. That means that immigrants alone need between 25,000 and 30,000 houses a year. We have to get the money to build those houses. Private enterprise is not able to provide them. How can we get the money? Honourable members opposite say, "" The Government should not try to get money in this way"". The honourable member for Moreton( Mr Killen) said that he would go part of the way or the whole of the way with the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Crean) if he wanted to do away with these taxation concessions altogether. But clearly if we cannot get sufficient loan money then people will have to pay more in taxation. We all know that. In effect, we are now saying to the insurance companies, "" Lend back to the Government at 54 per cent, the contributions made to you by the taxpayers -and of course by the Commonwealth Government in the form of tax concessionsor we shall have to obtain by taxation whatever amount we do not raise in loan funds. That amount will then not be available for contribution to your companies "". In reply to those who maintain that we should not interfere with people's right of investment 1 say that the world to-day is not like the world of 50 years ago. Poor countries such as Indonesia which have gained their independence are tending to take over foreign-owned investments and to run their own affairs. They simply say, "" Sorry, old boy, but we cannot pay you "". A few months ago I heard a broadcast by a medical man who had come to Australia from north Africa, where he had established himself on the land and done very well. He had got on very well with the natives, but he said that in a few years all the white people would be out of Africa; the black people would have their own country back. That is the general trend to-day, not because people are Communists and not because they are dishonest, but because they realize that they are all God's creatures. They realize that He did not grow the trees and provide the land and everything else for a select few; He did that for all the people of the world. We all have an obligation to the whole of the people, to all God's creatures, to the poorest child born in the slums as to the child born in the mansion with riches. To-night, one of my colleagues read out to me that somebody had died in Sydney and left £840,000. I said, ""What was he?"" He said, "" He was a company director "".

Honourable members opposite are interjecting now. They do not like to hear the truth. You gentlemen on the Government side are complete hypocrites when you talk about freedom. You want the freedom of dole queues. You prate about the evils of socialism, although you are the best socialists this country has seen for years, and you are doing it all under the guise of free enterprise. You are freedom fighters, all right-freedo m fighters of clay. You are limiting freedom all round Australia, and you have the nerve to criticize us for our belief in socialism. Mr J. R. Fraser -They are just undercover socialists, that is all they are. The Reserve Bank is a completely socialist institution, and the Government has strengthened it since it came into office. The honourable member for Higinbotham got all worked up during the debate, and his words have led me to deal with nationalization and socialization. The Government proposes to socialize assurance companies and superannuation schemes, in effect, by forcing them, by a very clever trick, in the form of tax concessions, to invest 30 per cent, of their funds in government securities. legislation. in handling the matter another way. We believe in going further than this. But you are the people who talk about governments keeping their hands off the rights of the individual, and of letting people have complete freedom, yet you are bringing in a bill like this to restrict freedom. You are actually trying to bribe insurance companies into lending money to the Government, because that is all this proposed tax concession really is. The honourable member for Moreton was right in what he said about it to-day. There are pages and pages of this bill. The number of words in the bill is staggering. There is also a 34 page document which the Treasurer had to issue to explain the bill to us, so involved and complex is it. After the draftsmen have burned the midnight oil to prepare this bill, after all the speeches have ended in this place and another place, ancl after the bill becomes law, what then? In spite of the fanfare of trumpets, the life assurance companies and the superannuation funds may still refuse to invest one extra penny in government securities. I wonder what the results of the bill wiil be in actual investments, because these organizations can stiil refuse, and in their present mood I think many of them will refuse, to invest in governmeni securities. It seems to me that this bill and all it involves-al l these words and the long explanation, are like using a bull-dozer to move a matchbox or, to employ another analogy, let me say that the birth pangs of the bill may be long and painful, yet the child may be stunted, weak and anaemic. The Government backed down on this legislation. Originally it was to be a coldblooded provision for a 30 per cent, forced loan from insurance companies and superannuation funds. But there was so much criticism of the Government by life assurance companies that the Government backed down and produced instead this measure with its conciliatory provision of a tax concession for assurance companies and superannuation funds which invest 30 per cent, of their funds in Commonwealth securities. In other words, those big firms and superannuation funds are offered a bunch of carrots on the end of a stick, as it were, to persuade them to invest in government securities. There are to be tax rebates in respect of investments in government securities. The Government has watered down the bill, which is no longer in the form in which it was first proposed. We on this side of the House agree that the insurance companies and the superannuation funds in Australia have become great vested interests. They have been very backward in helping the wider activities of the national government, and have come to regard the national interest almost as being something in another world. Indeed, investment has got right out of balance in this",48,Income Tax And Social Services Contribution Assessment

87,Mr Duthie,"I know, but we believecountry. Australia's national needs have often been by-passed by investment made purely in order to get higher and ever higher rates of interest. These investments have not taken account of the national interest. We believe that, in that respect, this bill is a move in the right direction. We believe that a re-direction of investment is urgently necessary in Australia, and in that respect, this bill has brought the whole matter to a head. There has been much talk about fringe banking institutions. These were hardly heard of a few years ago. Fringe banking is actually by-passing Treasury direction. Here again, we have a big slab of socialism. The Treasurer says, "" We have stated a financial and economic policy for Australia "". But we have this fringe hanking by-passing the Treasurer's direction and the control of the Reserve Bank of Australia and actually forcing the Government into measures of this kind in order to get control of the country's finances again. Yet we are told that private enterprise must be left alone. On this point, the Government and its supporters have shown themselves to be hypocrites. The private banks have established hireof their money in Commonwealth securities purchase branches and thereby encouraged and in the national interest. the development of a huge secondary banking system in this countrya development which has reached serious proportions. The banks have their representatives in hire Mr Speaker, this measure is a consequence purchase companies, land-trust companies of inflation. This afternoon, one after and insurance companies, and this great subanother of the Government's back-benchers sidiary banking system is almost completely quoted one statistic or another in justificabeyond the control of governments, either tion of this bill in complete ignorance of State or Federal.

Government supporters the last few years and is not prepared to have directed our attention to the fact that grapple with this secondary banking system although the investible funds of the insurthat is by-passing the direction of the ance companies have increased by Reserve Bank and the Treasury. This measure is a sort of belated effort by £4,000,000 of this has been invested in the Government to tackle inflation, which is Commonwealth securities.

It has allowed the fringe banking under a system of free enterprise in which empire to grow unchecked until it has they have the power of free choice have become a threat to the Commonwealth's looked soberly at the current investment whole financial structure. Even in this value of Commonwealth bonds which were measure, the Government is handling the quite a good investment in the days of the problem with kid gloves, because, as I said Chifley Government. The people who before, Mr Speaker, the insurance commake the choice under the system of free panies and the superannuation funds need enterprise now condemn Commonwealth not invest Id. in Commonwealth securities bonds. even when this bill becomes law. If they say that they do not want to make such investments, the Government cannot force them. It has offered additional tax rebates in respect of investments in government securities, but this bill will not require such investments to be made. As a result, the passage of this measure could be a waste of time and could bring back only a very small trickle of investment in government securities, although we need so much investment in these securities in order to undertake housing and national development programmes. For these reasons, I consider that this bill does not measure up to what is required. It represents only a flash in the pan and, as I have said, amounts to handling inflation with kid gloves. In every respect, this Administration is a government of fits and starts and half measures. It never takes hold of a problem with both hands and fights it to a finish. That is one of our criticisms of the Government's economic measures, of which this bill represents a part. So we support the bill, but only because it is a step in the right direction, for it represents a move to get these big financial empires to invest some £562,000,000 over the last ten years, only",49,Income Tax And Social Services Contribution Assessment

It is a question ment is no longer sensible. Earlier speakersI refer particularly to the cause of this legislation is the failure the honourable member for Higinbotham over ten or twelve years to arrest the prowar, when the insurance companies invested up to 50 per cent, of their investible funds in Commonwealth bonds. By 1949, the proportion had reached 68 per cent., but I leave out that year, because war-time controls and other factors operated in the intervening years. Commonwealth bonds were the only thing in which insurance companies could invest during World War From 1926 to 1939, the basic wage remained stable at about £4 5s. a week. There is a great suspicion that all governments throughout the world use inflation as a device for getting out of debt. inflationary methods, and have done so in the immediate post-war years.

This amendment is suggested because cases have come to our notice in which organizations would be compelled, unless this amendment were adopted, to offer rates of interest which could have an undesirable effect upon the bond market generally. Unless the organizations were prepared to offer those rates of interest, they may not be able to secure the funds necessary to carry on their operations at a satisfactory level. If they were compelled to offer rates of interest well in excess of those normally required to raise funds for these purposes, thc organizations would have to raise their charges against the consumers of these basic community services-water , gas and electricity. I think honourable gentlemen will regard the amendment as both reasonable and desirable. I am convinced that in the absence of such a provision, long-term borrowing by these organizations would not be practicable unless they were prepared to go on the market and offer rates well in excess of those which would normally apply to this class of borrowing. If they did not do so, they would no longer be attractive to the principal lenders, the superannuation funds and the life assurance societies which normally lend on long term. The Opposition adheres to its principle that public utilities ought essentially to be publicly owned and that distinct anomalies exist if a few remaining utilities are not publicly owned. Privately owned utilities are a declining race. I know in my own State of Victoria what were normally private undertakings in the gas and electricity fields have become public undertakings, but there are still a few residual examples in some of the other States. The North Shore Gas Company Limited, in Sydney, which corresponds largely with the Gas and Fuel Corporation of Victoria, is still privately owned, and from the point of view of the people of Sydney they ought not to be placed in a less favorable position than are the people of Melbourne merely because one organization is styled a public authority statutorily and the other, whilst a public utility, in some respects is still privately owned. Therefore, at this stage we would offer no objection to the amendment. amendment refers to water, gas and electricity. I ask the Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt) whether under the definition of water, money lent to State governments for irrigation schemes would be accepted by the Government when making a rebate to the insurance companies or superannuation funds. In other words, could insurance companies or superannuation funds assist with State irrigation schemes and still qualify for the tax rebate?

IfI may, I would without impertinence direct the right honourable gentleman's attention to the circumstance in which some life offices find themselves regarding the date of lst March, which is in the bill in a number of places. The fact of the matter is that, in order to qualify for the maximum concessional allowance, some major life offices have remarkably little room for manoeuvre. The percentages that I have are for the year 1959. They may have chanced last year, but I do not think they would have changed very much. An examination of the percentages shows a distinct contrast relatively between one life office and another. I cite in particular the Temperance and Genera] Mutual Life Assurance Society Limited.

100,Mr Killen (Moreton) [8.57],"I ask33 per cent, of its assets in semi-governmeni securities. Going to the other extreme, in a sense, the City Mutual Life Assurance Society Limited held 32.3 per cent, of its assets in government securiues and 2.8 per cent, in semi-government securities. I am sure the Treasurer will appreciate the point. To qualify for the maximum benefit, the Temperance and General Mutual Life Assurance Society Limited must, as it were, hug the percentage of its funds that it held as at lst March and must build up the 15.5 per cent, in government securities to 20 per cent. That 4.5 per cent, overall may not be very much, but in relation to its existing portfolio distribution, it means a great deal and the company has very little room in which to manoeuvre. I simply ask the right honourable gentleman whether he can give the committee an assurance that this aspect has been considered. If it has not been considered in all its ramifications, I would ask the right honourable gentleman whether the Government would consider the ramifications of this element of retrospectivity before the bill reaches another place. surer) [9.0] I can assure the honourable member for Moreton( Mr Killen) that not only has this whole subject been exhaustively examined by the Government, and by very senior and experienced officers of the Treasury, but we have also had the advantage of a good deal of discussion with representatives of the life offices themselves. I think I might almost say that, with the exception of the adoption of the general principle of the 30/20 ratio, which is a convenient way of describing the basic element in this legislation, the life offices have found the Government about as considerate as any government could ever be expected to be in seeking to make the transition as painless as is practicable under the circumstances. The spread of years which is referred to in the legislation is an indication of that. It might seem to the honourable member that these percentages require some fairly painful adjustment. I do not need to go back to 1939 or 1949 to show the remarkable change which has occurred in percentage investment, because even last year there was a very sharp movement in investment in company equities. These things do reveal that the life offices have rather more flexibility In this matter than perhaps some honourable members have expected up to this point. 1 assure the honourable member for Moreton that, whilst shaping the measure and conducting our discussions with the object of achieving substantially the result that the Government set out to achieve in what we believe to be the national interests, we have paid what we consider to be proper and sensible regard to the interest of the companies affected. When the honourable member for Moreton( Mr Killen) spoke this afternoon, he instanced the fact that whilst some of the insurance companies had the right in total as to the 30 per cent., there was some difficulty arising out of the 2 to 1 differential in favour of the Commonwealth as against a State. I think this simply highlights the difficulty the Government must encounter when it attempts to tinker with one thing without considering some of the other things involved. There are two reasons why the insurance companies have invested in iocal government securities in preference to Commonwealth securities. To begin with, there is a differential of one half per cent, in favour of the semi-governmental securities arising out of the fact that a tax concession of 2s. in the £1 is granted to investors in Commonwealth securities. In order to be able to raise money in the face of that concession, the semi-governmental rate has always been approximately one half per cent, above the Commonwealth rate. friend that that argument does not apply over all? rule, but it does apply to some extent. The point I am making is that when you begin to tinker with one thing without looking at some of the others, you are likely to get into difficulties. Another reason why some of the insurance companies have preferred local government securities to Commonwealth Government securities is that they have found, when taking into account the overall tax position as against the one half per cent, differential in favour of semi governmental securities, that it has paid them to invest in semi-governmental rather",52,Income Tax And Social Services Contribution Assessment
101,Mr Harold Holt (Higgins,Trea,53,Income Tax And Social Services Contribution Assessment

103,Mr Killen,Can 1 tell my honourable,53,Income Tax And Social Services Contribution Assessment
104,Mr Crean,"It does not apply as athan Commonwealth securities. Here again it has been purely a matter of tax calculations. A third reason is that the activities of some available for this process of adjustment, insurance companies are more heavily concentrated in some States than in others. Foi instance, the activities of the Australian Mutual Provident Society are more heavily concentrated in Victoria while those of some of the other companies are more heavily concentrated in New South Wales. Because of this, the companies concerned have felt a sense of patriotism about subscribing to local government rather than to Commonwealth securities over the years. I should think that on that point at least the Government ought to give some consideration to reviewing the question with a view to deciding whether, in the light of changes that are being made, this one half per cent, differential should continue and whether the 2s. rebate which applies to income from Government securities ought to be extended to future issues of semi-governmental loans also. I merely make that comment to the Government. It is time that some of these things which have existed for a very long time and for which there may have been very good reason some years ago were examined with a view to deciding whether, with the change of circumstances, the reason that existed originally still exists to-day with very much force, if any. I have not had time to consider the matter in great detail, but I throw out the suggestion to the Treasurer. No doubt this is something that would have to be taken up with the Loan Council which will be meeting shortly. I know that the members of the Loan Council have said on some occasions that they would prefer to borrow at one half per cent, less, but what stops them is that certain investors get a rebate of 2s. in the £1 if they invest in Commonwealth securities whereas they do not enjoy that cor.cession when investing in semi-governmental loans. Does that concession any longer serve as a useful barrier? In my view, if the 2s. rebate were extended to semi-governmental loars it might at least force down the semi-governmental rate by one half per cent., and that would be a desirable move. At least, the suggestion is worth considering. Treasurer) [9.8] -Let me add a word to of the life offices, and the figures which what I said earlier. I now have before me figures which I think honourable members will find illuminating. PerhapsI should have stressed the actual time which is lt runs from 1961 to 1971 provided the Commissioner is satisfied that a bona fide attempt is being made to meet the requirements of the legislation. There is a good deal of flexibility in point of time. 1 think the honourable member for Moreton was concerned whether there was enough flexibility in point of spacewhether they had the resources for this purpose. He may be a little comforted by the figures which I am about to quote. They exclude the assets of the Queensland and New South Wales State Government life offices and relate to the estimated holdings at ten-yearly intervals of ordinary preference shares by life oflices. 1 shall also quote the figures relating to 1960. In 1939 the total holdings out of Australian assets estimated at £224,000,000 were £3,000,000, or 1.3 per cent. In 1949, the total holdings were £18,000,000 out of total Australian assets of £404,000,000. The ratio then was 4.5 per cent. By 1959, the figure had risen to £69,000,000, or 7.3 per cent, of total Australian assets worth £926,000,000. In I960, the figure rose sharply to £99,000,000, or 9.9 per cent, of total Australian assets estimated at £1,000,000,000. If, in the one year, there can be that sort of movement in company investment, it should give the honourable member some idea of the scope which exists for this business of adjustment. I am not going to say that it is as easy in the case of one company as in that of another, but I am quite confident that the survey made by my officers and the discussions they have had with representatives of the life offices make this a quite practicable approach to this whole problem. The only other point I might make on this aspect of the measure is that it tends to reveal the rather freakish effect-certainl y not intended by any section of this Parliament when the legislation was originally passed-whic h the inbuilt discrimination in favour of investment in company shares, as I described it in my second-reading speech, has had on the investment policies",53,Income Tax And Social Services Contribution Assessment

After section one hundred and twelve of the Principal Act the following section is inserted:"" 112A -(1. ) The assessable income of a life assurance company, being a company in relation to which section one hundred and ten A of this Act applies, shall not include so much of each amount of income derived during the year of income from the assets included in an Australian statutory fund of the company or in any other fund maintained by the company in respect of the life assurance business of the company as is ascertained by applying to that amount the proportion ascertained in accordance with the formula , whereo a is so much of the calculated liabilities of the company at the end of the year of income as, in the opinion of the Commissioner, is referable to superannuation policies included in that fund; and b is so much of those calculated liabilities as, in the opinion of the Commissioner, is referable to all policies included in that fund. "" (2.) For the purposes of the last preceding sub-section, a policy shall be taken to be included in a fund if, in the opinion of the Commissioner, liabilities under that policy would be payable from that fund."". Treasurer) [9.12] I moveOmit sub-section (2.) of proposed section 112A, insert the following sub-sections:"" ' (2.) In the application of the last preceding sub-section, in relation to the year of income, in relation to a fund maintained by a life assurance company that has made an election that this subsection shall apply in relation to the company, being an election that has effect in relation to that year of income, the expressions "" superannuation policies"" and "" policies"" shall be taken not to include policies that are not Australian policies. "" ' (3.) The last preceding sub-section does not apply in relation to a fund in relation to which the Commissioner is of opinion that less than one-third of the value of b, as ascertained for the purposes of sub-section (1.) of this section in relation to the year of income, is referable to Australian policies. "" ' (4.) For the purposes of this section, a policy shall be taken to' be included in a fund if, in the opinion of the Commissioner, liabilities under that policy would be payable from that fund.'."". This amendment also follows as the result of some further discussions which we have had with representatives of the life offices. In my second-reading speech I outlined the general principles of this legislation. Among these were provisions that superannuation income could be made tax free and that the present deductions under section 115 could be increased on a sliding scale based on the extent to which public authority securities were held in excess of what has been called the 30/20 per cent, ratio. The amendment to clause 7 will enable companies which do not set up separate superannuation funds to make a more accurate determination of the amount of income relating to their superannuation business in order to determine the amount of income which will be exempt from taxation. Companies which set up separate superannuation statutory funds will be able to receive the fullest possible benefit from the revised section 115 by holding no more than the 30/20 per cent, ratio in their superannuation fund and applying additional holdings of public authority securities to their ordinary life statutory fund. Companies which do not decide to set up separate funds will have the adjustment to the section 115 deductions based on the proportion of their holdings of public authority securities to their total assets referable to their Australian business, including the assets held in relation to their superannuation business. The amendment to clause 9-and I will come to that in a HOLT (Higginsmoment but I thought it might be convenient to forecast it now-is designed to allow those companies the same benefits in relation to their section 115 deductions for which they could qualify otherwise if they decide to set up a separate superannuation statutory fund. This will give all companies the maximum incentive to build up their holdings of public authority securities. The precise nature of both amendments is set out in the supplementary memorandum which has been circulated to honourable members. -Whilst accepting the assurance of the Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt) with regard to the amendment that he has moved, I think it merely serves to indicate the inadequacy of this Parliament as a committee in dealing with this sort of thjng.

I only want to note that point. Mr Harold Holt -Nothing is involved which detracts from the measure. me assurance that nothing is involved which detracts from the measure, but it does serve to show how complicated this measure is; and even with all the deliberations which have taken place in the last two or three months since the matter was first mooted -and between last week when this bill was introduced and to-night when it has reached the committee stage-w e still have an amendment to make this thing more mechanically simple than previously. On behalf of the Opposition, I do not offer any objection to this amendment. We have accepted the principle that there ought to be a direction of insurance investment into more socially useful channels. We suggested, earlier, that rather than tie it indirectly to the taxation powers it should have been done directly some other way; and because ihe Government has chosen to do it this way, it has got into the sort of tangle in which it now is. I will enlarge on that point later, because the next clause which we are to consider to my mind must surely be the most peculiar clause in any act in Australia. I refer to Clause 9. I simply make the point, now, that we do not object to the amendment which we are now contemplating, because I accept the assurance that it clarifies what is intended to be done. It serves to show the inadequacy of the way in which we do things in Parliament at times. Amendment agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause8 agreed to. Clause 9.

On the night it was introduced somebody asked, "" Have you been brushing up your algebra?"" I was trying to follow the syntax of the speech and had not had time to look at the clause; but I can understand what was meant by that question because this peculiar formula begins on page 12 and continues on page 13. Consider, for example, the provision in proposed section 115(1.) (a) for a deduction in accordance with the formula 3ab (I plus d plus e minus /) -100c formula _?_f^L whichever produces the 100c, v greater amount. It is very difficult to deterto ask the members of this committee, after mine, to begin with, an amount at all. This simply shows the peculiar position you get into if you try to do indirectly what you ought to be doing directly. Earlier in the debate on this measure we the actuary is usurping the rights of the had a little bit of what I was going to call Parliament and that something should be breast-baring, but which I shall refer to as said against such a practice. expression of personal opinion by three honourable members, whose courage did not take them to the point of dividing on the bound to say to the committee, and parmatter. However, they showed that they ticularly to the Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt), thought the Government was moving in the that when I first saw this clause I thought it wrong direction. For our part, we do not was an absolute shocker. I went to my say it is moving in the wrong direction, but friend, the honourable member for Fawkner simply that it is going about things in the ( Mr Howson), who mastered in mathewrong way. If the Treasurer ( Mr Harold matics at Cambridge, and he was able to Holt) were really honest about this matter assure me that it was quite intelligible to he would admit that what the Government him. But when I found that my friend, the is trying to do is to induce insurance comhonorable member for Farrer( Mr panies to put 30 per cent, of their investFairbairn), was a little bewildered by it-and ments after 30th June into government he has some claim to be able to understand securities, either Commonwealth loans or the loans of State or semi-government instrumentalities. But instead of saying so straight out, the Government has tied in around this problem without putting such the income tax formula so that it can informulae as this into legislation. Lord only dulge in the luxury of saying that there is knows, I frequently inveigh against forms of no compulsion connected with the provdadministrative legislation, but I would sion, and that the scheme is a purely voluntary one. In my view, this is simply a piece of polite hypocrisy, which has resulted in these peculiar legislative difficulties. I ask honourable members to consider seriously where we are getting to with legislation of this kind. Look closely at these two or three pages of formulae in clause 9. As I have said, we have an amendment brought forward this evening to clarify what certainly is not very clear. I am prepared to accept the assurance of the Treasurer that it does clarify the position to an extent, but 1 suggest that it still leaves the position very obscure, because of the subterfuge that the Government has indulged in. Let me suggest a kind of competition. I ask honourable members who have been in this Parliament for many years to look through all the statutes of the Commonwealth and see whether they can produce a provision that resembles in any way the one that the committee is now discussing. or the There will be no prize for success in this quiz, but at least it should lead to some salutary examination of the procedures of this Parliament^ In my view it is absurd the little time they have had to consider the measure, to say seriously that they understand what this paraphernalia means.

113,Mr Killen (Moreton) [9.24],"I aminfinitely prefer regulations to be made under an act than to have this kind of mathematical mumbo-jumbo put into an act. Really and truly, this is quite pathetic. The bureaucrat, bless him-and 1 do not mean a blessing in any ecclesiastical sense-regard s the Parliament as something of a rubber stamp, but here is the mathematician rampant and the Parliament couchant. From here on it is the mathematician who will make the decision with regard to these provisions. Mr Harold Holt -Couchant, but not dormant or silent. people in such a position who have complained. Be that as it may, tbe fact of tbe matter is that if every member of this Parliagentleman as the honourable member for ment were to be set a problem based on tbe formula that we are now considering, I think it would be long odds on that the failure rate would be remarkably high. I hear many honourable members trying to suggest, by interjection, that I am wrong. Of course there are some people who find difficulty in fighting their modesty on questions like this. I know of one, two, or possibly three or four honourable members who may be able to solve problems that could be expected to arise under this legislation. In any case I would ask the Treasurer whether the administrative procedure which might be adopted under this section of the legislation has been considered. Would it not be preferable to achieve the result by regulation! I also ask, if I may do so without impertinence, whether the actuaries of the life offices were consulted in the preparation of these provisions. I have been informed that the intricacies of actuarial work are very great, and I would hate to have us put into an act something that would lead to endless disputation between the life offices and tbe Treasury. [9.27] I would not have bothered to rise had I not felt impelled, first, to refer to a point raised by my friend, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Crean) and, more particularly, to deal with one of the remarks made by the honourable member for Moreton( Mr Killen). The honourable member complained about the mumbo-jumbo that has been inserted in the bill,, and he proceeded to blame the bureaucrats, as he was pleased to describe them, for this kind of mumbo-jumbo. Every one knows, including the honourable member for Moreton, that it is not because of any fault on the part of the bureaucrats, as he calls them, that we are considering what I think is an almost outrageous piece of legislation. I give it this description because nobody, apart from a very few mathematicians, will ever understand it. I marvel that even an Einstein could work out these formulas. I must admit that most of my mathematics was learned counting sheep, but when I hear such a learned Moreton frankly admit that he looks upon this clause as nothing but mumbo-jumbo, I do not feel so bad about my failure to understand it. In any case I think it was most unfair of the honourable member to blame the bureaucrats. He knows very well that the persons who should be blamed are those occupying the back benches on the Government side of this chamber-and probably including the honourable member himself-wh o brought pressure to bear upon the Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt), who never intended, when these provisions were first contemplated, that such mumbo-jumbo should be used. When the right honourable gentleman said that he proposed to bring in legislation of this kind he made it clear, at any rate to me, that he intended to do so in a straightforward manner, that the legislation would be easily understood, and that he was going to come straight to the point and show clearly what he wanted. It is people like the honourable member for Moretonif he, personally, was not involved-wh o brought pressure to bear upon the Treasurer, who was forced to go to the bureaucrats and ask them to produce a provision to give effect, not to his wishes and not to their wishes, but to the wishes of the pressure groups in various electorates on whose behalf representations were made by their parliamentary representatives. I can well imagine that the bureaucrats would not be very happy about the Treasurer's request to get round what should have been a simple straightforward proposition in this indirect, politely hypocritical",57,Income Tax And Social Services Contribution Assessment

To suggest that it was their baby, and that they virtually forced the Parliament to accept this stupid piece of legislation is quite unfair, and completely opposed to the facts. Nobody knows better than do the honourable member for Moreton and the other glum-faced people who sit behind him and at his side that the people really responsible for this are not the bureaucrats but those, including the honourable member himself, who now criticize the bureaucrats for it.

123,Mr Daly (Grayndler) [9.47],"I remainIt is necessary to turn to the expert for details of the matters incorporated in this bill. How do we know that the hidden meaning of the algebraic expressions in this clause is not contrary to what the Government intends? For instance, I ask whether any honourable member is competent to understand the following sub-paragraph which appears on page 12 of the bill:(ii) the cost of the public securities (other than written into the bill so that they are capable Commonwealth securities) included in the of interpretation by members of the Parliaassets of the insurance funds of the company was not less than the cost of the ment.

I do not know companies something that it is not game what this clause is intended to convey to to announce that it is doing? The Treathe Parliament. I know that it is necessary surer is a man well versed and well skilled to rely on experts in these matters, but could in the art of politics, although in recent any member of the Government explain to times he has slipped in his approach to a few the satisfaction of electors or of any member things. He may be getting his own back of the Parliament just what that provision on the insurance companies through this means in terms of pounds shillings and pence legislation, and what better way is there to the life assurance companies or others to do it than under a formula like who will be affected by the legislation? I suppose that this is one of the most remarkable documents ever presented to the Parliament. It is written in such a way-n o avoiding telling the life assurance comdoubt deliberately-as to make it incomprepanies that this might cost them another hensible to honourable members, and I defy £500,000 or something of the sort? What the Treasurer, who has failed to explain satisfactorily much less complicated financial problems, to explain what the clause really means. As the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Clyde Cameron) asked, how can any member go back and lucidly, explain to his electorate the meaning of the items on pages 12 and 13 of the printed copy of the bill? I believe that such matters should be the bill would be more like an algebra textbook for use in high schools than anything else. I do not know what the Treasurer . he can alter it now, but certainly a lot of formula, if it prothings in the bill need explaining, and we have not had them satisfactorily explained exactly what h) means because the 100c experts know what it means, when we have such matters as those mentioned by the and details that even the honourable member TTHC; or for Moreton could not explain-and he is 100c 9ab it on this score. or the formula _ » 400c I do not want to put any sinister interpre3ab (1 + d) -r-j T ? Is this a sinister way of 100c ' better way could there be of doing this than by using the formula 3 e 100c What hidden meaning is behind that? How much is it going to amount to in terms of pounds, shillings and pence? If there is no sinister intention by the Government, why are not these provisions written in plain English instead of in algebra? These matters are well worth investigating. I hope that the Treasurer will enlighten the Parliament, if he can, by showing that there is no sinister intention in this clause. Why should this provision be in algebra? I suppose that this is the first time in the history of the Parliament that such a thing has been done. With other honourable members on this side, as well as Government supporters, I am concerned about the approach taken in the legisget the general drift of it, which I doubt lation. The Government's intentions in any measure should be plain so that honourable members may discuss them. They should not be shrouded in an algebraic formula, as they are in this bill.

I remind the honourable member that the Minister for Social Services is not -concerned with this bill. ing reference to the fact that he might write some such formulas into social services legislation so that the Government would he able to reduce pensions, or something of that sort. I ask the Treasurer to explain the whole of thefiguresshown in the clause in a way that will enable honourable members to explain them to their electors, to people in life assurance companies and to others who will be affected by the legislation. We should be able to explain to them that this is not the implementation of a gross socialistic plot by the Government to take more than it wants people to know it is taking. We should be able to satisfy the people that this is not an effort by the Treasurer to disguise the real meaning of the bill by using algebraic formulas instead of plain English. We should be able to satisfy ourselves and our electors that this legislation does not mean something entirely different from what is intended. surer) [9.55] -l t is obvious that some mem„5? bers of the committee, particularly some members of the Opposition, are getting a little good, clean fun at my expense and also, I regret to say, at the expense of a very hard-worked and able body of officers who have been assisting the Parliament in the presentation of this very difficult legislation. The taxation law which applies to the life assurance companies is, as a colleague has pointed out, one of the most complicated parts of the taxation legislation. There is nothing new about that. Indeed, that position obtained during the years when honourable gentlemen opposite occupied the treasury bench. that the honourable gentleman opposite has attempted to get. The really significant thing about the rather slap-happy discussion of this clause is that, with the exception of the honourable member for Moreton( Mr Killen), whom I exclude, those members who have been most vocal on the clause are, I believe, the members who paid the least attention to what was going on during the second-reading stage. It is quite obvious, Sir, that these airy and, I know, humorouslyintended references to what are somewhat slightingly termed "" the bureaucrats"" behind us, were only flippant. I hope that the gentlemen referred to will not take seriously what was, I think, intended to be flippancy only. We all have reason to be grateful for the labour and the skill which these men bring to the task of assisting the Parliament with such problems. But I say that those who have engaged in this somewhat flippant behaviour have quite obviously not done the bill or the officers concerned the justice of reading the explanatory memorandum which was produced at some pains to assist honourable members to understand the difficult and complicated provisions of the legislation. I have in my hand an explanatory memorandum on the bill and it runs to 33 closely printed pages. Obviously clause 9 is one of the most complex of all the clauses, because the explanatory memorandum on it runs to eight pages.

As my colleague, the honourable member for Sturt( Mr Wilson), pointed out, the people directly concerned with this legislation are taxpayers-in this instance the life assurance companies-and the Commissioner of Taxation. I can assure the committee that the actuaries of the life offices have been in consultation with the officers of the Treasury, the Life Offices Commissioner and the Taxation Branch, on the details of the legislation. Had the provisions been spelt out in words the bill would have run to several more pages. These people are accustomed to dealing with problems of this kind expressed in the manner in which they are expressed in the bill.

Honourable members who know arithmetic only and not algebra will see that at least the proportion of ^ still exists in the new formula contained in sub-section (1.) of proposed new section 115 of the act. The reason for the complication-and I think this should be reiterated-is that in future the benefit that existing section 115 of the act simply confers on all insurance companies will not be obtained unless the insurance companies do certain things. One of the things required of them is that they shall in future invest a minimum of 30 per cent, of their investible funds in government securities-2 0 per cent, to be in Commonwealth securities and 10 per cent, in local government securities.

As the honourable member for Melbourne Ports has said, if the Government's intention is to do a certain thing, let it say so explicitly. I want an explanation from the Treasurer.

It statesWhere, in relation to a life assurance company in relation to a year of income, the Commissioner This undermines the accuracy of the preceding sub-sections, so far as I can seeis of the opinion that the value of i, /"", k, I, in or n is abnormally high or abnormally low. having regard to all the circumstances and in particular to that value at any time or times during the period of twelve months ending six months after the end of the year of income, the Commissioner may determine the value of i . ;', k, I , m or n as the case may be, that shall have effect in relation to the company in relation to that year of income having regard to that value on such days during that period as are, in his opinion, appropriate in the circumstances. Let me now examine the idea that this is a vehicle of great accuracy. The Commissioner of Taxation, it appears to me, has conferred on him by this sub-section the right to decide in what way this provision shall be applied or even to interpret the exact meaning of the letters used in the formula in sub-section (2.) of proposed new section 115. Despite all the claims about the accuracy and the explicit nature of this proposed new section, sub-section (5.) contains phrases such as "" the Commissioner is of o p in i o n "" as the case may be"" and "" the Commissioner may "". Obviously, this is a let-out provision because the Government has found it impossible to draft some together, and agreed to. clause which requires the insurance companies to do what it wants them to do. If this is not an escape provision, what is it? I shall be happy to have it explained to me if the Treasurer can put it in simple terms. Mr Harold Holt -The honourable member should read the explanatory memorandum. but the explanatory memorandum, as everybody knows, is not the law enacted by this Parliament. Mr Harold Holt -Has the honourable member read it? I suggest that he has not. with explanatory memorandums or memoranda. The word preferred, I presume, depends on the university which one attended. The fact is that the laws as applied by the courts are the laws that are passed by this Parliament, and the intentions of the Minister, the Parliament, parliamentarians or the people whom the Minister so lovingly refers to as bureaucrats are not valid in courts of law. What is valid in courts of law is the bill as we pass it, and I believe that the draftsman and the people responsible for the measure ought to see that it is clear at least to the law-makers. The point that I make is not so much what the clause means as what it does not mean. In fact, is not sub-section (5.) of proposed new section 115 an escape provision under which the Commissioner of Taxation may determine all these things for himself if, in his opinion, the circumstances of the case make the investment by any particular insurance company abnormally high or abnormally low? If, as the Treasurer claims, this clause is explicit and the formulas are accurate, why use phrases such as "" abnormally high or abnormally low"", "" as the case may be"" and "" the Commissioner is of opinion""? In the classic words which the Minister's leader so often uses, you cannot have it both ways. Amendment agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to.

The Treasurer may cause Tax Concession Bonds to be issued under the authority of this section. Such Bonds(a) shall be of the face value of £20; and (b) shall be deemed to bear interest at a yearly rate fixed by regulation and computed compound for each financial year ended 30th June, no interest being reckoned for any period less than a complete year.

Any Australian citizen may claim as a deduction from his taxable income for any year the face value of up to twenty-five Tax Concession Bonds purchased by him during that year in accordance with this section. ' (5.) Tax Concession Bonds shall be non-transferable, except that in case of the death, legal incapacity or bankruptcy, of the holder they may be transferred to his executor, legal representative or assignee, who shall then be deemed to hold them in trust for him or his estate, and may present them for redemption in accordance with sub-section (7.) of this section, or may, during the lifetime of the original holder, transfer them in accordance with the terms of his trust. ' (6.) No security given over Tax Concession Bonds shall be enforceable at law. ' (7.) Any holder of Tax Concession Bonds shall be entitled at one month's notice to obtain redemption of any or all of them from the agents appointed by the Treasurer at their face value plus any interest computed under this section; provided that, except with the concurrence of the Treasurer, no such Bond shall be redeemable until thirty months have elapsed from its purchase; provided further, however, that Bonds redeemed free of accretion under the next succeeding subsection may be redeemed after eighteen months have elapsed since their purchase. ' (8.) The procedes of any Tax Concession Bond redeemed in accordance with the preceding subsection shall be deemed to be an accretion to the taxable income of the holder for the year in which such redemption takes place; provided, however, that within twelve months after marriage a holder may obtain redemption of up to seventy-five such Bonds free of accretion, and also that within twelve months after the birth of a child a holder may obtain the redemption of up to fifty such Bonds free of accretion.

As I intimated when I foreshadowed this amendment at the second-reading stage, it is mainly a machinery amendment which is calculated to give effect to the purposes which I endeavoured to explain at that stage. The purpose of the first part of the proposed new section is to allow a taxpayer to deposit up to £500 with the Treasury for any term which he desires, such a deposit to be a deduction from the depositor's taxable income in the nnancial year in which the deposit is made and to be an addition to his taxable income in the nnancial year in which it is withdrawn. The other part of the proposed new section contains purely machinery provisions ancillary to the main purpose. My objective in including it is to show that this can be done easily and without involving any great expenditure on administration or other matters of that character. One important point I was hoping to make is that in case of marriage a taxpayer can withdraw up to £1,500 free of accretion and in the case of the birth of a child, £1,000 free of accretion to his taxable income. The machinery I have provided would be of great value to the person starting out in life, who very often is somebody Thc CHAIRMAN -Order! I have examined the new clause moved by the honourable member for Mackellar and I consider that, insofar as it proposes the issue of bonds, which is in effect the raising of loans, it goes beyond the scope of the bill and the principal act which relate only to the imposition, assessment and collection of a tax upon incomes. On the ground, therefore, that the new clause proposes to introduce matters outside the scope of the bill and the principal act, I have to rule that the proposed new clause moved by the honourable member for Mackellar is out of order. ruling, Mr Chairman.

This proposed new clause, which will not come into operation until a date to be proclaimed, is contingent upon the issue of bonds, and the provisions for the issue of the bonds in detail are severable from my main purpose, being mainly machinery, and could be provided in the drafting of a separate bill dealing with the issue of the bonds. ThatI think However, I believe it is an amendment of gets rid of the objection in respect of form quite considerable sociological and economic to which you drew attention, Sir. I believe that this is an important provision. I again stress that the great weakness of the Australian economy, the weakness that occasions the necessity for the bill we have before us, is the chronic deficiency of savings. The clause as I have moved it is designed to increase the facility of saving, particularly among the junior members of the community who may be expected to save in anticipation of marriage. They will obtain great benefits from so doing, if this provision be accepted, but I make no apology for that. I believe that we should be doing whatever will help young people to save and whatever will give them a corresponding benefit from saving. They are not, however, the only beneficiaries. Although the young people may obtain the greatest benefit, they will not be the only ones to obtain benefit. This will particularly help those who desire to save in their years of higher income in preparation for retirement. It is not suggested that in this case, or indeed in any case except subsequent marriage or the birth of a child, those savings should be simply a deduction from tax. It is suggested that the tax be deferred and that the benefit be given in that way. subscribed under the provisions of this ranges of income. I suggest that many people in the younger age group who are enjoying high earnings but have little responsibility at that stage may be very glad of the opportunity to save, perhaps not the full £500 but some £100 or so each year so that they will be able to deduct it from their income for taxation purposes and to draw it to set themselves up in a house or to meet the inevitable expenses that follow the birth of a child. This amendment breaks new ground. importance, and I commend it to the committee. [10.17] I am sure that the Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt) would like to hear my remarks before deciding what attitude the Government will take on this matter. I have given careful thought to this amendment. Whilst in some respects I think there is something to be said for the proposition, I see a very serious weakness in it.

137,Mr Clyde Cameron (Hindmarsh),"I am sure that the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) will seek leave to withdraw the amendment because of the absurdity of it. When the honourable member remembers that the rate of tax of some taxpayers is as great as 13s. 4d. in the £1-the y are the taxpayers who need concessions least of all -h e will realize that the benefit to them will are costing £9,000,000a total of be a saving in tax of £336 6s. 8d. a year. However, a working man would need to go without many things if he were to save £10 a week. The benefit even to a married man with a wife and family, whose tax rate may be only 3s. in the £1, would be infinitesimal when compared to the benefit obtained by the well-to-day person who could set aside £500 out of an income of, say, £20,000 or £30,000. I do not dismiss this proposition as being silly. I do not dismiss it as being devoid of merit. Had the proposition suggested somefigureand debarred the rich man from getting more benefit per £1 than the poor man would get, then, speaking personally-thi s has not been considered by our party yetI would see very little wrong with it, as at present advised. Indeed, if it were possible to provide for a flat rate, I would see great merit in it. To the extent that the idea is something of £400 plus the rebates on the £500 pronew, I congratulate the honourable member posed by the honourable member for for thinking it out. This is one of those Mackellar. occasions when, taken away from communism, the honourable member is capable of lifting himself out of the rut and putting forward quite worthwhile ideas. However, this idea falls to the ground for the reasons Mackellar. We do have a problem with that I have stated. Personally, I shall have our teenagers.

The Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt) merits serious investigation. If the Labour has pointed out that the allowable deduction Party were in office, it would tighten up the of up to £400 for insurance payments and superannuation contributions is already costing the Government £44,000,000 a year. The tax rebates to ordinary taxpayers -polic y holders and contributors to superannuation schemes-ar e costing £35,000.000 and those made to companies contributing to employees' superannuation £44,000,000. When the Chifley Government left office, the maximum amount allowable was £100. Actually, this proposal suggests a hand out to the wealthy section of the community. The man who is earningy£l,000 a year and sacrifies a great deal in order to invest £400 in an insurance policy enjoys a rebate of only 400 times 3s., whereas a man in the top income bracket enjoys the benefit of a rebate of 400 times 13s. 4d. The difference there is great enough, but if we add to the £400 the £500 proposed by the honourable member for Mackellar, then, assuming that the person on the lower income was able to save £500 in a year, his total benefit would be only 900 times 3s., whereas the man in the tOT income bracket would benefit to the tune of 900 times 13s. 4d. In other words, it would cost us, the taxpayers, £600 to subsidize the wealthy, on the present rebate I do not ridicule the suggestion put forward by the honourable member for of surplus money spend it on non-essentials.

Personally, I shall oppose the amendment that has been proposed. As a matter of fact-and I say this frankly to the TreasurerI am very critical indeed of the present allowance of £400 to holders of insurance policies because I feel that £400 is far too high a sum. It should be reduced greatly. I agree with the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr tages that would accrue to men on higher Clyde Cameron), who has suggested that if the proposed amendment provided a flat figure, giving an equal benefit to rich and poor alike, it would be more equitable and more in line with the Labour Party's thinking. committee should recognize that the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr will have to face the taxation that will be Wentworth) has brought to us at least some original thinking. It does not surprise me that honourable members opposite, who show such great animosity towards the honourable member for Mackellar, are not very impressed with what he has presented, but we ought to take a moment or two to recognize some of the very sound basic thinking which the honourable member for Mackellar has presented. If, because of the limitation of time and the limitation of assistance available to him in drafting his amendment, the proposal is not sustained by the committee, let me express the hope that this basic thinking, this original thinkwhich I am sure should attract the atten; ng which comes before us through the initiative of the honourable member, will not be discouraged. In the past we have had other instances in which, in all sincerity, the honourable member has submitted proposals worthy of serious consideration by this chamber. I do urge that this committee recognize that on this occasion the honourable member has brought forward a proposal which contains some very good points. Those honourable members opposite who do not always find it possible to get exhave just spoken have entirely overlooked perienced assistance when an amendment that this proposal would provide for the of this kind needs to be drafted. I for Commonwealth Government a loan fund, one will support the honourable member an amount of money which could be used for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth), and I hope to offset any loss which might accrue he will persevere with this idea. I know through a reduction in taxation revenue. I that the Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt) has am impressed with the fact that the honoralready had this matter investigated; and able member suggests bonds of a face value he will advise us in a moment of the points of only £20. In reply to a question I he has clear in his mind in regard to it. addressed to him, he was emphatic in his insistence that in his estimation bonds of such a small face value would prove an attractive investment to many young people. As their incomes increased in the early days of their working lives, their savings would enable them to take up still more bonds of a face value of £20. One honourable member opposite referred to the advanincomes. He failed to take into account the provision which the honourable member for Mackellar included in his proposal, and under which, whilst an investor obtains the benefit of a reduction of his taxable income by £500 if he invests that amount or more in one year, when he cashes those bonds, if the money so derived by him is not used for certain specific purposes, he levied as the result of including the cash so obtained in his assessable income. I repeat that this point is entirely overlooked. Mr Clyde Cameron -But why benefit the rich man who gets married, as against the poor man who gets married? might well be looked at. And this is the point upon which the proposal may fail. Let me not forget to remind the committee again that the basic idea of this amendment holds a great amount of merit, tion of the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Clyde Cameron) and other members.

141,Mr Cleaver,"On this occasion, withI hope the basic idea will be looked at on another occasion so we can get the benefit of it. able member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) is to be commended for the idea he has put forward to-night because it is designed for one purpose only, and that is to encourage savings. The honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Clyde Cameron) and the honourable member for Reid( Mr Uren) misrepresentedI do not say maliciouslythe proposition put forward by the honourable member for Mackellar. The actual cost of the proposition would be very little. The honourable member for Hindmarsh said that the rich man who pays tax at the rate of 13s. 4d. in the £1 would gain two-thirds of the amount, which is limited in any one year to £500; but that would apply only to the year in which the investment was made. When the investor withdrew the amount it would have to be brought in as income. Although the honourable member for Mackellar did not say so, I realize that if the rich man invests over a period of years and then dies, his estate will have to bear the tax on that amount; so there would be no ultimate cost to the community. The honourable member for Hindmarsh 'said, in all sincerity, that if the rich man marries he would gain 13s. 4d. in the £1, which is a greater amount than the small man would gain. Without trying to assume a halo. I sincerely believe that in a case like that it is better that some of the undeserving vide for the future and unfortunately do should aet the benefit than that the deserving not save a large enough proportion of their should miss out altogether; and the fact that we might help the few who are favourably placed is no reason why the proposition should be knocked on the head, because it would benefit many less fortunate individuals as well. Under the scheme envisaged by the honourable member for Mackellar the real gainers would be young couples, because they would certainly want to cash their bonds. They would gain in the year in which they married and also in the year in which they had a child. For these reasons-eve n though there may be some corners to be knocked offI believe the scheme is worthy of commendation and I would like the committee to consider it favourably. gratulate the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) on the thought he has put into his amendment. One of the weaknesses of the bill before the committee is that it does nothing to increase the general savings of the community. Its effect is to transfer savings and capital from the private sector to the public sector; and most of us feel that that is essential because the public sector undertakings are lagging behind the production of the private sector. The honourable member for Mackellar feels, as many of us do, that what is clearly needed is something to increase the total savings. I feel that the Treasury has not shown sufficient imagination in the last few years in meeting the market needs of the investing public. Bonds, generally, have remained in the same form and pattern over the last ten years and they do not meet the needs of the investing public. The one exception to that was the special bond issue. It was something entirely new. It met the needs of a certain section of the community and has been highly successful. The proposal of the honourable member for Mackellar is also new, and it is designed to meet the needs of another section of the community. I believe every thinking person in the community realizes that one of the greatest inflationary pressures exists among the young members of the community, who, unfortunately, do not save enough to provide for the necessaries that are consequent upon marriage. As young people with high wages they fail to prowages to enable them to purchase homes or furniture on marriage. Consequently they have then to borrow large sums, very often at high rates of interest, and thus saddle themselves for many years, if not for the rest of their lives, because they do not save sufficient during their younger years. The suggestion of the honourable member for Mackellar is that we should give some encouragement and some prize to the young people of the community who are prepared to save and receive a benefit as the result of their savings, either on marriage or on the birth of a child. So we find that the theme behind the proposal of the honourable member for Mackellar is that if people save they are entitled for tax purposes to",69,Income Tax And Social Services Contribution Assessment

146,Mr Harold Holt (Higgins,"TreaThe honourable member for Mackellar has produced a particular method of obtaining this result. Members on' both sides of the chamber have directed attention to what they believe to be weaknesses in his proposal. There may be some force in the objection that apparently the proposal would give not only a greater incentive but also a greater return to a person in receipt of a higher income than to a person on a lower income. How far does the committee or do honourable gentlemen opposite wish to take that line of argument? There are other elements in our taxation provisions which in net terms give a better return for savings or from taxation deductions to people who are in receipt of higher incomes. Do honourable gentlemen opposite propose, for example, the abolition or a modification of the present form of deduction for a wife and children because it has the direct effect of giving a greater cash benefit to the person who receives a higher income than to the person who receives a lower income? T prefer to believe that we have worked out a taxation scale which, although it bears more heavily in terms of the cost per £1 of income on the person who enjoys a higher rate of income, provides, when it comes to the matter of deductions, a proportionately greater benefit. Over the whole period the process averages out in a way which I believe accords with the sense of social and economic justice that exists in the community. At any rate, the policies which we have adopted in that regard have been endorsed, we claim, by the electorate during our period of office. I do not dismiss out of hand the scheme wonder that any young people are able to that has been proposed by the honourable marry at all. member for Mackellar because that objection to it has been raised.

I read this morning's "" Sydney Morning Herald"" and I am indebted to the writer of the leading article for the description of the measure that I have just used. The second reading debate was very interesting, but now we are dealing with a proposition which certainly has novelty but is only a variant of a proposal that the Australian Labour Party has advanced over the years in respect of marriage loans which could be extinguished upon the birth of children so that ultimately young people may be helped to establish their homes and be relieved of the burden of debt which they have to incur to-day when they enter upon the marriage state. I do not accept the descriptions of young people which some honourable members of advanced years have uttered to-night. I do not believe that our young people are purseproud. I do no believe they have very much money to throw away or that they are as irresponsible as some honourable members depict them. In my opinion, most young people have to save very hard before they can put a deposit on a home. They have to strive very hard before they can even think of accepting the responsibility of marriage. When we think of the activities of the land speculators, the house-builders and all the other exploiters and legalized thieves there are in the community, it is a The honourable member for Mackellar has tried to help his Government out of a able member would later forget all about his proposition.

A good deal of thought would have to be given to such questions as what would happen in the case of a person who had subscribed to a loan and perhaps had died before the date of maturity of the loan or after some claim had been made. The honourable member would not expect the Treasurer to give a definite acceptance to-night, nor could he expect the Government to accept the proposition even during the lifetime of this Parliament-and , of course, the Government will not be here to accept anything after next December. On behalf of the Opposition of to-day, I am happy to tell the honourable member that if he manages to survive the wrath of the electors, as few of his colleagues will, the incoming government will doubtless give some consideration to what he has put forward. The honourable member for Mackellar will not mind my saying that we very often agree with some of his propositions. We admire his tremendous energy. We think he does produce ideas and propositions that merit consideration. On other occasions, however, we think of him as merely a brilliant eccentric. We disagree with the manner in which he flogs the issue of communism and unity tickets and similar issues. To-night, however, he seems to have contributed something that contains at least the germ of an idea. The Treasury ofncials and taxation ofncials will no doubt examine it in some detail. committee was having a helpful and quite an amiably conducted discussion on this proposal until the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Calwell) pushed his lugubrious frame into the debate and endeavoured to belittle the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr amendment was proposed. If the honorWentworth). The Leader of the Opposition should take into account what was said by his own followers during the debate on the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Mackellar. The honourable member for Reid( Mr Uren), in the most explicit language, agreed with the honourable member for Mackellar that there were many young people in the community to-day with a good deal of money that they did not put to the kind of use to which it could and should be put. Then the Leader of the Opposition came in, crying poor in his usual fashion. Dearie me, it is a pity he cannot speak in more cheerful vein once in a while. The fact of the matter is that the honourable member for Mackellar put forward a proposal that met with generous support on both sides of the committee. Then the Leader of the Opposition came in and wanted to pare a bit off here and a bii off there. He tried to make out that the honourable member had pinched his idea. Well, although some of the ill-informed critics have suggested that we are hard up for ideas, let me assure the Parliament that we are not so hard up that we have to turn to the Labour Party ro find ideas to pinch. Let me suggest to the Treasurer that between now and the time when the Budget is prepared the proposal put forward by the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) should be seriously considered, having in mind that there are many honourable members on the Government side who earnestly support it. the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) on a television programme a few weeks ago and heard him outlining this scheme. However, I do not think it is fair to ask the House to consider an amendment of this kind at such short notice. I believe the Opposition should have been given copies of the amendment some time last week, at the latest, so that we could have given it proper consideration. There are many aspects to be considered. First, what would be the cost to the Treasury? Approximate figures could have been obtained by the honourable member for the information of members of the Parliament, and could have been cited at the time the able member's amendment involves additional cost to the Treasury, will the extra amount be found by way of indirect or direct taxation? These are questions that must be answered. There is another point that should be considered. It is quite true, I suppose, that some young people spend their money indiscriminately on non-essentials. On the other hand, there are many who spend their money on actual necessaries. One must always realize, too, that if spending",72,Income Tax And Social Services Contribution Assessment
148,Mr Killen (Moreton) [10.53],The,73,Income Tax And Social Services Contribution Assessment
149,Mr Cope (Watson) [10.55],"I watchedin the community is curtailed, there will be fewer essentials bought, and this will cause unemployment, which is a problem that we are trying to overcome at the present time. It may be said that young people are spending too much on beer, or that they are buying too many milk shakes. To curtail expenditure in either of these directions would mean a loss of revenue to the Government on the one hand, by means of reduced excise collections, or on the other hand a loss of income to the dairying industry. All these questions must be considered before we jump in and accept a proposal of this kind. What would be the cost to the Treasury? That is one question. What would be the cost to the Australian economy generally? That is another question. Would it mean further unemployment? Let me remind the committee that the young people involved in this proposal are the ones who keep industry going. Do not let anybody kid you that they are not. These young people are mainly responsible for keeping industry going. They are the ones who are spending the money at the present time, and if their spending is significantly reduced we will see a great deal more unemployment in Australia. In any case, I believe that before presenting an amendment of this kind the members of this Parliament should have had more notice of it. We should have been told what the cost would be. If the acceptance of this proposal were to result in considerable cost to the Treasury, where would the extra money come from? Would taxation be resorted to in other directions? These are the matters that should be explained. If we cannot have adequate notice of an amendment of this kind it is of little use to ask for Opposition support. [10.58] -It appears to me that some honourable members have been carried away by the speech of the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth). He spoke about young people being able to save money, and what could be done by the judicious use of this money, but I can see that his proposal goes a little further. Proposed new sub-section (3.) of the amendment says:The proceeds of any tax concession bond which is redeemed shall be deemed to be an accretion to the taxable income of the holder for the year in which such redemption takes place. Then he goes on with certain provisions regarding a bondholder wMo marries. Consider the case of a man earning £5,000 a year. He may say: "" I am to retire at the end of June and I will be taxed this year on £5,000. I will take up £500 worth of bonds and will then be taxed on only £4,500. Next year I will have very litde income. I have my capital and the interest that will come from it. My income may be only £1,000 a year. I can then redeem my £500 worth of bonds, and I will be taxed on £1,500 for the year. This, however, will be better than paying tax on the total income of £5,000 in the previous year."" I think the honourable member can follow my reasoning on that. It seems to me that this amendment would be an open invitation to any person on a fairly high salary, who will be retiring on a lower income, to say, "" 1 will subscribe up to £500 now, and next year 1 shall draw it, while paying a lower rate"". That is an instance of what can happen when a matter like this is put before us before we can give full consideration to its implications. I agree with the Treasurer that this is a case where consideration would have to be given and an investigation made. The honourable member proposes that subscribers be issued with a bond. I do not know whether it is intended that that be an interminable bond, to go on forever or for the life of a subscriber, or whether after a certain period it would cease to have value. If it applied only for a period of five years and the subscriber did not marry for seven years, he would be out of luck, because the amount would accrue to his income after five years. The converse of the case of the man on a big income who reverted to a low income would be the case of a man who had a higher income at the end of five years. If there was an accretion to that income, instead of making a gain he would be penalized. In all the circumstances, I do not think that the committee can accept the proposition without further information. The honourable member for Mackellar gave no idea of the cost in taxation revenue in any year. When a budget is presented, the Treasurer describes a certain measure, saying that it will return a certain amount",73,Income Tax And Social Services Contribution Assessment

Is he able to say whether Cooper indicated that he wished to see those profits re-invested? 4. Is he also able to say whether Cooper brought back from Japan plans for a soap factory and wished to start a timber mill? 5. Did Cooper meet with a complete lack of support in these endeavours; if not, what support was given to him? 6. Will Cooper be allowed to remain in New Guinea at the end of his sentence? able members questions are as follows:1. Yes. 2. Cooper was associated with the Madang Association of Native Societies Limited in a supervisory capacity and during the period of his supervision reasonable profits were made. 3. No. In any case the disposal of profits is a matter for decision by the Association. 4. Cooper brought from Japan a pamphlet about soap machinery. The Administration has no knowledge of any proposals Cooper may have advanced for a timber mill. 5. Cooper discussed soap manufacturing proposals with senior government officers and was encouraged to put forward detailed proposals but did not do so. 6. No. The Administrator's Council has advised that he should be required to leave the Territory. Papua and New Guinea-World Health Organization Assistance. Mr Cairns asked the Ministerf o r T e r r i of the United Kingdom and United States, the tories, upon notice1. Has the Administration of Papua and New Guinea refused direct aid from the World Health Organization? 2. If not, what direct aid has been received, accepted or proposed for acceptance? 3. Is he able to say whether the Administration of the British Solomon Islands accepted World Health Organization direct aid which has already resulted in anti-malarial spraying of at least half the island by professional teams? 4. Will the Administration of Papua and New Guinea accept this aid; if not, why not? 5. Does the Administration of Papua and New Guinea propose to continue with spraying by villagers? 6. Is this form of spraying ineffective and dangerous because its inefficiency allows surviving mosquitoes to build up resistance? 7. Do estimates exist which show that this method would take up to seventeen years to cover the Territory? able member's questions are1. No. 2. Direct aid has been accepted in the form ot fellowships for the training of medical personnel on the basis of two or three fellowships annually for several years. 3. No, but it is believed not. Some anti-malarial spraying has been done in the British Solomon Islands Protectorate by the Papua and New Guinea Department of Public Health to ensure that there is no transmission of malaria into an area in Papua and New Guinea controlled by spraying. It is believed that this spraying has been more extensive than any done in the Protectorate by the World Health Organization. 4. The Administration of Papua and New Guinea does not intend to accept additional aid from the World Health Organization in malarial control. It has the potential to establish its own Territorywide programme, though in many areas local technical information still has to be accumulated. 5. No. All spraying is now done by professional teams. 6. No, although it is more expensive, because extra supervision, extra spray and extra pumps are required. 7. No. Extradition Treaties. Mr Whitlam asked the Ministerf o r External Affairs, upon noticeWhat action has been taken on the report which the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs made in October, 1956, relating to extradition? able member's question is as follows:After careful consideration, and after an exchange of views and experiences with the 'governments of some other countries, including those Government decided against the termination of the treaties mentioned in the committee's report. It felt that safeguards existed to provide adequate protection to individuals, and it also had very much in mind its declared policy that it would not entertain a request for extradition, unless it were thoroughly satisfied that such a move was not being sought for political purposes. I take this opportunity to reassert this policy and to assure all former residents of the Eastern European countries concerned living in Australia that they are now under the protection of the Australian Government and Australian law in this respect. No extradition treaties have been concluded by Australia since the committee's report was made. As to the committee's recommendations that in certain cases the onus of proof should be altered by amendment of the Extradition Act, the Attorney-General has decided that a review should be made of the act, and the committee's recommendations are under consideration in this connection.

Will it be necessary in the near future to provide finance for the maintenance of Oakey Airpo-t in Queensland? 2. Has the Department of Civil Aviation examined proposals for the establishment of an airport closer to Toowoomba: if so, what were tbe results of the investigations? 3. As the question of airport facilities in or near Toowoomba concerns the Toowoomba City Council, could consideration of additional expenditure on the Oakey Airport be deferred until after the forthcoming council elections so that the matter can be considered by the new council? honourable member's follows:1. It is anticipated that additional resealing of one of the runways at Oakey will be necessary in the 1961-62 year. 2. A nurnber of proposals for an aerodrome closer to Toowoomba, including one in an area near Charlton have been closely investigated in my department. No aerodrome site, suitable for a city with the size and potential of Toowoomba, and r'nser to it than Oakev. has been found. 3. Expenditure on the maintenance of an aerodrome is related to the condition of the facilities at the aerodrome and the requirements of the aircraft which use it. I could not agree to maintenance work being deferred as you have suggested. The situation is, however, that the maintenance is planned to be carried out with funds expected to be available during the 1961-62 nnancial year and this could not therefore be before the beginning of July. If, before the end of the the financial year, the Toowoomba City Council desires to submit proposals concerning an airport for Toowoomba other than at Oakey, I would be willing to have them examined.

Discussions arising from the agreement have been held with the Japanese from time to time, the last occasion being the Tokyo discussions in October, 1960, and I refer the honourable member's attention to my statement of 28th October in this regard. Timber. Mr Cleaver asked the Minister for Trade, upon notice1. Is his department giving specific attention to that portion of the recent Tariff Board report on the timoer industry which recognized the disability in respect of transport costs which affects the Western Australian section of the industry? 2. To permit the suppliers of timber in Western Australia to compete on equal terms for the interstate demand for timber, will the Government sympathetically seek a suitable formula for subsidy assistance to meet the freight costs involved? honourable member's questions are as follows:The question of freight on Western Australian timber and the possibility of a freight subsidy to assist the Western Australian industry was invesUgated by an interdepartmental committee in 19S8. The committee's investigation followed the Tariff Board's report dated 22nd April, 19S8, which drew attention to the question. The committee reported that a freight subsidy was not justified, for two main reasons: (1) A Commonwealth subsidy on Western Australian timber shipments would discriminate against timber industries in other States. (2) It would be difncult to justify a subsidy limited to timber and not extended to other products shipped interstate. The Government accepted the committee's findings. A careful re-examination of the whole matter in the light of the Tariff Board's latest report on the industry has not shown that there are any new factors in the situation that would warrant a change in the Government's earlier decision. European Common Market. Mr Ward asked the Minister for Trade, upon notice1. Can he say whether the United Kingdom Government, in its negotiations for an arrangement with the nations comprising the European Common Market, offered to modify or abandon what is known as Imperial Preference? 2. If so, what effect would a departure from questions are as the practice of Imperial Preference have on Australian export industries? 3. Was the Australian Government consulted before the United Kingdom offer was made? 4. If so, what stand did the Government take? able member's questions is as follows:The United Kingdom is at present engaged in what it has described as exploratory talks to ascertain if a basis can be found for what it could regard as a satisfactory form of association with the E.E.C. countries. The United Kingdom has emphasized that these talks are exploratory only and in no way constitute negotiations. As I said in reply to a question on 13th April"" This Government has always said that we believe that it would be desirable, in the interests of greater political cohesion in Europe, that the United Kingdom should be joined with the great western European industrial and trading countries; but we have added that we believe this should be done only on terms that would not impair the vital interests of Australia."" We have at all times emphasized to the United Kingdom Government the importance which we attach to being kept informed and consulted. I refer the honourable member to the statement which the Prime Minister made in the House on l l t h April and to my own reply to the question on 13th April. I mentioned then that there would be a meeting of senior officials in May to explore the situation. Melbourne Airport. Mr Pollard asked the Ministerf o r the Interior, upon notice1.

Do shipping freights represent 40 per cent, of the value of meat exported to Greece? 4. Is it a fact that, although the GreekAustralian Line will accept Greek drachmae in respect of freight payments, Conference Shipping member's questions are as Lines will not do so? 5. If so, does this result in the Greek Government being able to buy only 60 per cent, of the meat it could purchase from Australia? 6.

168,Mr Mcewen,"The answers to thementioned by the honourable member is not unreasonable if based on the f.o.b. value of the product. 4. I understand that this is so. 5. As there is no determined import ceiling for meat imported into GreeceI am unable to give an opinion as to how a saving in foreign exchange from freight would influence imports of meat into that country. 6. The only reason that would prevent an Australian exporter from shipping meat in the Greek-Australian Line would be that the exporter is party to an agreement not to do so, but to ship in the terms of his contract. (See my answer to point 3 of the third following question.) Shipping. Mr Daly asked the Ministerf o r Trade, upon notice1. Is it a fact that the Greek-Australian Line's ship "" Patris"" has available 183,000 cubic feet of refrigerated cargo space? 2. Can he say whether restrictions placed on shippers by the Conference Lines have resulted in this space being practically empty on return trips from Australia? 3. If so, what action does he intend to take to prevent these restrictions and ensure that this cargo space is fully utilized by Australian exporters? able member's questions are as follows:1. Yes. 2. I understand that all cargo space available on the "" Patris"" has not been filled, but I cannot say whether this was due to action on the part of Conference. I am, however, further informed that very little cargo was offered for the eleven sailings made by Conference vessels to Greece last year. 3. See my answer to point 4 of the second following question. Mr Daly asked the Ministerf o r Trade, upon notice1. Can he say whether an order was recently placed by an Athens car dealer for Holden cars, and whether arrangements were made for them to be shipped on the Greek-Australian Line ship "" Patris ""? 2.

Was this action taken on instructions from the British Shipping Conference? 4. Does this body dictate the basis and ship on which the goods must be transported? 5. If restrictive practices are used, what action does he intend to take to eliminate them? able member's questions are as follows:1. I understand that this was so. 2 and 3. I understand that the shipper, who was a signatory to a contract with Conference, was reminded by Conference of his contractual obligation to ship by Conference as that body was able to offer a suitable sailing. The shipper subsequently cancelled his arrangements with the Greek-Australian Line. 4. No. See my answer to point 3 of the following question for the basis of Conference arrangements. 5. See my answer to point 4 of the following question. Mr Daly asked the Ministerf o r Trade, upon notice1. Is he able to say whether the Conference shipping lines have used restrictive Uade practices to keep non-members such as the Greek-Australian Line out of business? 2. Have the Conference lines threatened to refuse to carry goods of any company using the Greek ships or non-Conference line vessels? 3. Are increased freight charges, the forfeiture of loyalty payments, and other penalties imposed on shippers using the Greek-Australian Line ship "" Patris"" or any other non-Conference line ship? 4. If restrictive practices are used, what action does the Government intend to take to eliminate them? honourable member's questions are as follows:1. To answer the honourable member's question would involve a legal judgment on the actions of the companies concerned. It is not customary of make such judgments in reply to parliamentary questions. 2. I have no knowledge of such an attitude on the part of the Shipping Conference concerned. 3. Exporters who are signatories to freight contracts negotiated under the auspices of the Australian Oversea Transport Association agree to grant exclusive rights to Conference vessels to carry their exports to the United Kingdom and Continent. In return the Conference shipping lines agree to provide a regular service to meet the normal requirements of exporters at stable rates of freight for at least one year. An exporter in breach of this undertaking is required by the contractual arrangement to which he has subscribed to pay the higher freight level which applies to non-signatory exporters, and there is provision for such higher freight rates to be applied retrospectively to shipments already carried in that contract year. If Conference vessels are not in a position to lift the exports of a signatory to these contracts within a reasonable period the exporter is able to ship by any non-Conference vessels that are available without incurring a higher freight rate or penalty. 4. See answer to 1 above. There has been no request to the Government from the Federal Exporters Oversea Transport Committee (the producer/exporter body of the Australian Oversea Transport Association) to vary the existing contract system which has been in force in the AustraliaUnited Kingdom/Continent trade since 1930.
