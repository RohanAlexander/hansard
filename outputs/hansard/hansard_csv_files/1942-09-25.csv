18,Mr Chifley (Macquarie,"Treasurer )In presenting the budget, I informed honourable members that the Government would introduce a bill for the establishment of a mortgage bank department of the Commonwealth Bank at an early date. This bill gives effect to that promise.

Already, the Government has taken action to reduce interest rates over the whole range of finance. WhereverI am not able to give to honourable insurance trustee companies, whilst I At the moment, there are certain manpower difficulties that prevent any rapid expansion of facilities through the falling upon the hank in connection with financial matters associated with the war, has created very real difficulties in the way of giving any extension of existing facilities. Turning now to the Government's proposals in connection with the hill itself, it will be seen that the Mortgage Bank will b© a department of the Commonwealth Bank, and be under the control of the Bank Board. In order that the purposes of the Mortgage Bank departMortgage Bank might function effecment it is proposed thattively it ia essential that it should have experienced, efficient and economical management, and that it should obtain funds at the best available rate so that it can, in turn, lend at reasonable rates of interest. The Government considers that in the Commonwealth Bank it has an established institution, capable of successfully carrying out the functions of the Mortgage Bank. The board's personnel includes men well acquainted with rural problems. The bank has a widespread system of branches and agencies, and many of its officers have already had experience of the kind only lend to persons engaged in farming, of loan which the Mortgage Bank is agricultural, horticultural, pastoral or intended to make. Mortgage Bank will be kept quite disof primary production as the bank thinks tinct from the central bank functions of fit. The loans shall be made upon the the Commonwealth Bank. The present security of a mortgage on an estate or bill proposes the creation of an entirely interest in land as follows:separate department to provide appropriate long-term lending facilities. Strict safeguards have been framed to prevent the assets of the general bank from being used in the business of the Mortgage Bank department except to a very limited extent.

The Mortgage Bank department may However, the new grazing operations or in such other forms (a) An estate in fee simple; (b) Any estate or interest in land held under any State Act relating to Crown lands; or (c) Any estate or interest in land held from the Crown or the administration in any territory being part of the Commonwealth. A special prothe amount that money lent is used to pay the borrower. Where a borrower misapplies money lent to him by the demand. By this means it is hoped to further mortgaging or charging his estate mortgaged. It is proposed that loans shall he made for periods of from three to 35 years, and that the bank shall fix the terms and conditions of such loans. Where loans are for long periods, it is possible that a condition may be included in the mortgage deed for amortization payments. Loans through the Mortgage Bank are not intended to provide working capital, as it is considered that ample provision already exists for short-term advances. Provision is made in the bill that loans shall not exceed 60 per cent, of the value of the property, or £4,000, whichever is the less. It is not practicable to fix for all time for advances to co-operative societies, nor the rate of interest at which money may l>e advanced by the department, and consequently, rates will he left to the bank to determine. The Government hopes, however, that it will be possible for the bank to make loans at about 4 per cent, per annum, plus suitable amortization payments where applicable. Such a rate would be an improvement on the average rate at present charged by lenders on first class mortgages, and it is anticipated that the lower rate charged by the Mortgage Bank department will have a general tendency to reduce the mortgage interest charges made by other institutions and private lenders. As the Mortgage Bank will not be run primarily for profit, it is not expected that any appreciable amount of profit will be earned. Provision has been made in the bill for all profits to be credited to a reserve fund in the mortgage bank department. Moneys in this fund will be available only for the purposes of the department. As the Commonwealth Bank will incur certain overhead expenses in the management of the Mortgage Bank department, and possibly receive moneys that may be properly allotted to that department, the bill provides for an allocation of such portion of the general receipts and expenditure of the bank as the board considers is referable to the department. Provision is also made for investment of any surplus funds, although it is expected that investible surplus funds will be very small at any one time. In fact, the probability is that the departor interest in the property ment will usually have some advance on daily balance from the general bank. Asi t will inevitably take the Commonwealth Bank some time to complete its organization of the department, it is proposed that the act, if passed, shall come into operation only when proclaimed. In view of the many amendments that have been made in the Commonwealth Bank Act from time to time, and the consequent difficulties in connection with the numbering of sections, as will be noticed in the section numbers in this bill, steps have been taken for the renumbering of the sections of the act. uNo specific provision has been made for ordinary home building, the reason being that under the reconstruction plan, housing will be undertaken as part of a much .bigger scheme. The general principles of this measure ha/ve been approved by all parties in this House, so that any differences of opinion will be in regard to detail only. The Government is prepared, if honourable members so desire, to refer the bill to a joint committee representing all parties, in the hope that the combined wisdom of honourable members will produce a satisfactory measure. adjourned.

22,Mr Fadden (Darling Downs,"Leade rtlie community, so that the people are bidding against one another for a limited supply of goods, some form of legislative action must be taken to prevent black marketing. However, the bill requires careful consideration, and possibly amendment in the committee stage, in order to remove the fear that business people of sound reputation and integrity may be implicated because of misdemeanours with which they have had nothing to do. A business of moderate size, with branches all over a State, or even the Commonwealth, presents a problem. It would, be a physical impossibility for those in control to watch the actions of all their employees in all parts of the country, and. it would, therefore, be unfair to make them responsible for those actions. It would be equally illogical and unfair to render Ministers of the Crown liable at law for the delinquencies of departmental officers, including juniors, who perform acts of administration all day and everywhere. provision for that possibility. that assurance. The bill may make criminals of reputable businesspeople, large and small, whose honesty has been proved by years of trading. Under this legislation men of unquestioned honesty may be imprisoned for technical offences which they were una'ble to prevent. In making that statement, I do not wish it to be thought that I have any sympathy for the dishonest trader who takes advantage of existing circumstances to profiteer and create black markets. For those persons, imprisonment is not an adequate penalty. But we must safeguard the innocent trader who may become liable for prosecution as the result of an action of an employee. The bill may cause business people of untarnished reputation, in selfprotection, to step down from their offices in order to avoid exposing themselves to the risk of being imprisoned for a technical breach. That would not be in the best interests of the community. By the application of harsh laws, the Government can endanger the prospects for postwar rehabilitation, which must depend to a large degree upon the continued honest conduct of thousands of businesses, large and small, to provide employment for Australians. It is impossible for men in charge of even small businesses to regulate to a precise margin the rates of gross profit on trading over a period of weeks or months. Until stocktaking verifies the results, they cannot know exactly what gross profits have been earned, over millions of separate transactions. Changing conditions, fluctuating prices, and a scarcity of commodities cause profit margins to vary from hour to hour. Yet traders with an unblemished record may become criminals in the eyes of a nation as the result of the application of this legislation in a harsh or partisan manner. The bill is aimed at the "" blacketeer "". who works in the dark and who is hard to discover. With this man, the Opposition has no patience. He should be prosecuted with the utmost rigour of the law. The operations of the bill, however, will inflict hardship and injustice upon the decent and honourable trader whose transactions are above board, but who may be unable to be personally responsible for the actions of his employees, no matter how. careful he may be in issuing instructions to them. Under the trading conditions of the past year, many traders have found it impossible to avoid an increase of turnover, because of the pressure of public spending power. Honourable members will recall the manner in which the public rushed the shops a few months ago and demanded goods which, in many instances, traders did not desire to sell quickly because of replacement difficulties. Moreover, in some cases where substantial profits have been made, the trader does not get the benefit because those profits are subject to taxes totalling 18s. in the £1. The trader merely becomes a collector of revenue for the Crown. It is unfair to make the operations of the bill retrospective to the 20fch February, 1942. About that time, the Governmentforeshadowed its intention to take all profits in excess of 4 per cent, on capital employed in a business. Not until the end of July were traders advised by government announcement that this plan would not be put into effect. Until then, they could only assume that they were, in a large measure, collectors of revenue for the Crown. Now, legislation has been introduced which may make criminals of",16,Black Marketin Gbill 1942 Second Reading
23,Dr. Evatt,-That is so. We shall make,17,Black Marketin Gbill 1942 Second Reading
24,Mr Fadden,"I am pleased to havebusiness people and their employees because they earned substantial profits in past months. In many instances, they were unable to prevent that profit-making and were even advised by the Government that all profits in excess of 4 per cent, would not belong to them. Whilst the Opposition does not disagree with the principle of imposing the most severe penalties upon any trader who is guilty of profiteering during the war, it has a definite responsibility to protect the honest and honourable man who may be victimized by this legislation. For that reason, I shall move at the appropriate time two important amendments to the bill. There should be no political association administration of the Prices Regulations. with the administration and control of this most important, far-reaching and, in certain circumstances, dangerous legislation. A committee comprising representatives of the Attorney-General's Department, the Prices Branch, and the Department pf Trade and Customs, or the Bationing Commission, should be appointed to decide whether certain traders should be prosecuted. If that course were adopted, the whole matter would be removed from the atmosphere of political control. This committee would conscientiously weigh all the circumstances, including government policy, and have regard to changing conditions since the outbreak of war. Opposition propose that the committee shall have authority to prosecute? would recommend to the Attorney General that action be taken against a trader. The committee would remove from the right honourable gentleman an onerous responsibility, and the possibility ourselves to the fact that present-day conof being accused, of political partisanship ditions differ greatly from those of the in connection with the launching of prosecutions. My second proposal is that profits earned by traders shall be regarded as the amount which remains after the deduction of income tax, so that traders may not be branded as criminals for earning profits that are taken by the Crown. the Opposition mean that the public shall pay the income tax of traders? else is paying the tax to-day. In the final analysis, the producer and the worker pay all taxes. During the budget debate, some honourable members referred to companies that made profits of £40,000, after providing for depreciation totalling £17,000. Those statements must not be accepted at their -face value. From the profit of £40,000 must be deducted taxation, and the net profit may be only £20,000. For that reason, the basis for determining "" blacketeering"" should be the amount that remains after the deduction of income tax. lent reason why the Attorney-General should adopt my suggestion to appoint a committee. The Prices Commissioner knows all the facts. gentleman means that, before prosecutions are launched, those circumstances should be considered. agrees that this legislation is necessary. At a time when our manhood is fighting so that we may hold the title deeds to this country, any profiteer or "" blacketeer"" should be shown no mercy. Even imprisonment is not an adequate punishment for such a crime. I have some knowledge of the circumstances that have led to the introduction of this bill. For some time. I was in control of the Prices Commission, and was instrumental in "" declaring "" a number of profiteers. Whilst this legislation is necessary to strengthen the hand of the Prices Comanissioner, we should not blind early days of the war when the Prices Commissioner, by "" declaration "", made effective use of his powers. The changed conditions call for legislation of this character. The Government by its failure to withdraw surplus money from the community has created the position which warrants such drastic action being taken as is provided for in this legislation. The introduction of this measure has also been made necessary by the irresponsible",17,Black Marketin Gbill 1942 Second Reading

The fact that the people have more surplus money than ever before has enabled them to anticipate rationing, and the resultant heavy purchasing has had the effect of creating unbranch staff are men of high capacitynatural prices with consequent extra high' profits. Earlier in this war, as Minister for Trade and Customs, I had occasion to declare eighteen butchers. The fixation of the price of meat was foreshadowed, and, immediately, there was an attempt by those butchers to profiteer. The Prices Commissioner took action which resulted in the declaration of those butchers, and they were brought under control. This power of declaration, however, is only half effective, because, sometimes, it conbelieve that it could have been made fers a lasting benefit on the trader who is effective. The substance of it was declared. of declaration, and what effect does it have! declaration is to put tbe whole of the prices under the control of the Prices Commissioner. He orders the refund to the public by means of reduced prices of the. extra profits earned by the trader concerned. benefit on umsenipulous traders, because reduced prices attract more business. But the reputable trading, firm regards declaration as. a blot upon its escutcheon that can never be erased. declaration is only effective on scrupulous traders, whose offence may have been brought about by chance. It is sound business to buy in the lowest market, and to seE in the highest, but the zeal of some a bill of this kind. Profiteering cannot departmental managers to do that has sometimes landed their employers in trouble with the Prices Commissioner. Withf u l l appreciation of the situation, mum war effort. That there are among the Prices Commissioner has often given most sympathetic consideration to cases in which offences have been committed by inadvertence. Another difficulty about the process of declaration is that, whilst it confers benefit upon unscrupulous, traders, it imposes great strain on the Prices Comtraders should be warned rather than missioner and his staff. Commissioner has never had a staff sufficiently strong to be equal to the strain that must be imposed upon it by efforts to keep prices down. Every State branch of the commission and the central office have been working at a great disadvantage. The Prices Commissioner has been required to police the vast commercial interests of this community with an inadequate staff. The members of the the Prices Commissioner himself is a man of outstanding ability-bu t all the capacity in the world could not stem the tide of rising prices in the absence of sufficient officers to do the work. The Prices Commissioner has always been behind in the race. While I was Minister for Trade and Customs, I discussed with the Prices Commissioner a plan whereby he would be clothed with some additional powers. It had disadvantages, but I that the Prices Commissioner should work hand in glove with the Commissioner of Taxation. I believe that, if the Prices Commissioner had access to taxation assessments, his job could be more effectively done. I believe also that the Prices Commissioner should be empowered to impose fines for breaches of the prices regulations in the same way as the Taxation Commissioner is able to fine delinquent taxpayers. The fines would go That procedure confers, a into Consolidated Revenue and thereby assist in financing the war. I have always wondered why that power has not been conferred upon the Prices Commissioner. It has been effective in the hands of the Therefore, Commissioner of Taxation, and I believe that it would be equally effective in prices control. I agree entirely with the necessity for be condoned, especially now when we are fighting for our very existence and straining every nerve and sinew for the maxius those who are so devoid of instincts of decency and patriotism as to exploit the nation in its hour of trial is deplorable. Their operations must be stamped out by the use of the most rigorous punishment.

34,Mr Bbennah,What is the' procedure,19,Black Marketin Gbill 1942 Second Reading
35,Mr Harrison,"The effect ofwar was that magistrates were too inclined to treat each case charged before them individually and to impose low fines as a warning. It would have been sufficient for the first few cases dealt with to be treated in that way as a warning to others, but, when the warning was not heeded, the highest penalties should have been exacted. Fines are not sufficient in a great number of cases. History shows that people who have tried to control prices have been treated most unfairly by the community. It is on record that some have been shot for their failure to keep prices down to a reasonable level. I am not suggesting for a moment that such an unseemly fate awaits our own Prices Commission. We are not living in days like that now, but we are living under a heavy strain, and no person should be allowed to intensify that strain by exploiting the earnings of the workers. This legislation which is designed to prevent that exploitation is commendable. I am in agreement with the amendment suggested by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Fadden), and when the bill is in committee I shall direct the attention of the Attorney-General to some aspects of this measure which need further consideration. It is crystal clear that, if the sometimes acts considerably in his favour. Government will not draw from the community the surplus money in its possession, the people will attempt to spend that money, and the result will be competition amongst them for the reduced quantity of goods available to them, and a consequent rise of prices. This legislation will help to check that rise. There are two ways in which to reach tflie mountain crest of surplus money, the short way right to the top and the long way by a winding path. I should have liked the Government to take the short cut and, by means of taxation and deferred pay for the citizens, curtail the spending power of the community, but it has preferred to take the more circuitous route, and I shall do my best to help it on its journey. my approval of this bill to prevent black marketing. In times of stress, such as those through which we are going, when the ordinary methods of supply and demand cannot be allowed to operate because of governmental restrictions, transport difiiculties and other reasons, I think that the most demoralizing factor is the activities of those people who are so devoid of national honour that they will attempt to sabotage the efforts of the Government in trying to equalize supplies in the community. One of the most effective controls that we have imposti since the outbreak of war is. price fixing under the control of the Prices Commissioner. The Prices Commissioner ha* attempted to do a fair job of work by allowing the commercial community to operate free from fear that his powers would be used unfairly, but he has been limited in his control by virtue of the fact that he is subject to the limitations of the National Security Act, and the fines or penalties that may be imposed under that act are either ridiculously small, or so large, with regard to detention, that magistrates are unwilling to apply them with sufficient severity. In attempting to impose a penalty that fits the crime the Prices Commissioner has had to have recourse to forcing offenders to return to purchasers all profit made beyond that which is allowed under the regulations. This acts very unfairly. Instead of penalizing the offender, it A trader who has made large excess profits and is forced to return the money to subsequent purchasers, obtains, in effect, a free advertisement. towards goodwill. his goodwill by offering goods at lower prices. That is a penalty on his competitors who have observed the law, and it is bad enough, but a secondary effect of it in war-time that should not be overlooked, is that, instead of his actions helping the supply situation they have a contrary effect, for goods are offered to the consuming public at ridiculous prices. The public, naturally, is always ready to buy at bargain prices. This is serious in respect of goods in short supply. The Attorney-General has provided sufficient safeguards in this bill to enable the Prices Commissioner to deal with offenders. Looked at narrowly, the penalties appear to be somewhat dangerous, for, in certain respects, the provisions of the criminal",19,Black Marketin Gbill 1942 Second Reading

There should be some means of studying, before proceedings are actually instituted, whether an offence has been intentionally or innocently committed. I agree with the Leader of the Opposition, too, that all possible steps should be taken to remove the administration of this law from the sphere of party politics, so that there can be no suggestion whatever of victimization in any prosecutions. The remarks of the Leader of the Opposition concerning the retrospectivity of certain provisions of the bill also deserve careful consideration. It is unfair to put into operation provisions of this kind of which the trading community had no warning whatever, particularly as such heavy penalties have been provided. It is human nature to bargain. The right to swap a horse on the best terms obtainable may be said to be a basic principle of trade in the British Empire, and, under existing conditions, we are taking away that right. It takes time to educate traders on such alterations of practice. Such changes come slowly to the knowledge of the general community. Whilst there may have been some glaring offences against the prices regulations, the majority of the prosecutions have been for minor breaches. MT .

It would be unfortunate if anything were done at this stage to destroy the spirit of goodwill that has been displayed by the trading community at large towards the Prices Commissioner, for he has a difficult job to do. I am pleased, that, offences against rationing have been dealt with in this measure. Rationing and the control of prices and marketing are closely interwoven. Black markets arise primarily because there is a shortage of goods and a surplus of spending power, and because controls are not applied at the right time and place. Some honourable gentlemen seem to have an erroneous impression that the main purpose of rationing is to reduce the spending power of the people, and thereby make more money available for loans and taxation. Rationing may have that effect, but its chief purpose is to ensure that goods in short supply shall bef a i r l y distributed over the community and that people who have time and money at their disposal shall not be enabled to hoard goods in short supply to the disadvantage of other people in the community. Rationing is required to meet shortages, whether they be real or artificial-that is whether they he due to goods not being produced, or to positive government action to cause a shortage. Shortages may be caused by a limitation of manufacture, or by transport difficulties. Every one knows, for example, that there is no shortage of sugar in this country.

44,Mr Hutchinson (Deakin) [11.42]. Must Be Dammed. During The Income,"The money is there, and the urge to buy is there. All human beings are liable to yield to temptation, ously, no matter what restraints may be applied, there will be a tremendous demand for available goods. We know that under the uniform taxation scheme, in Queensland, the Government relieved people earning up to £1,000 a year of as much as £37 in taxes. In such circumstances, there is a high premium on dishonesty, and to guard against breaches of the law, extremely harsh penalties must be provided. I admit that this must be done, but I hope to God that a lot of ordinary, decent, honest people will not be caught in the mesh of this bill. I know of a woman in a Victorian country town who has engaged in black marketing. Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt) will be able to find details of the case in the files of his department, if he so desires. The offender had been an honest woman all her life, but yielded to the temptation to make illicit profits. Only this cursed set of conditions has caused her to break the law. I hope that thousands of other small tradespeople like her will restrain themselves from breaking the law. These penalties remind me of conditions in Great Britain hundreds of years ago or in Nazi Germany to-day. The honourable member for Henty( Mr Coles) was right. There is a falling quantity of goods and increased purchasing power. This may lead to the offences which this measure is designed to prevent. These conditions beget the People cannot buy the luxuries that they want in the ordinary way to-day, because the supply is insufficient, but there are homes in which before the war the total income would be about £5 a week and to-day is £20 or £30 a week because the members of the families are working overtime at well-paid war jobs. I can understand the urge of these people to buy better furniture and all the little luxuries that all of us like to have in our homes. The urge is natural. People cannot obtain some classes of goods in the ordinary way because of short supplies, but they have the incentive to evade the prices regulations and compete in the black markets for those goods that are available. In considering these conMr Hutchinson. ditions, one cannot help saying, ""Well, while that is the position we are not and obvisoundly or definitely balancing the budget. We are not getting the money that we require for the war."" We know surely that, in the post-war period, we shall want to unleash spending power in order to set the wheels of civil industry in motion. Then we shall expect the thousands of families who are to-day in possession of a vast amount of purchasing power to use their resources to build homes, to furnish them, to buy wireless sets, refrigerators and so on. We shall want that to happen in order to provide means of employing the thousands of men who will return to civil life from the war services. During tMs period of war, we must be oareful to The prevent uncontrolled increases of our costs and prices. We must not forget that the work of post-war reconstruction will be undertaken against a background of conditions laid down by the Atlantic Charter. If that charter means anything, it means that trade will be made to flow freely. That being so, any country that allows its cost levels or price levels to escape control owing to some easy but misguided financial policy will be confronted with many grave problems. It will add to its difficulties not only during the war but also in the post-war period. Australia can avoid this danger by the use of a little common sense and by withdrawing from the people, for the time being, the excess purchasing power which they now have and putting it aside so that it can be used black-marketer. sensibly after the war. If the money be taken now and held for them till after the war, they will benefit considerably. They will be able to buy goods, the manufacture of which will re-establish industry in a prosperous condition. I sincerely hope that some of the things which might arise from this bill will not occur. I hope that there will be very few cases in which the penalties prescribed will be enforced. The bill provides for imprisonment, without the option of a fine, for terms up to twelve months, and, when a conviction is recorded, the offender will be obliged to post a notification to that effect on his premises. These measures are necessary only because we have created conditions which encourage black marketing. I shall support the bill, but I have little enthuhead office, Canberra, but none to persons siasm for any policy which creates such a set of circumstances and makes imperative the harsh penalties provided in this bill. -On e thing that has been a ridiculous failure in the war-time organization of the Commonwealth has been the administration of the price-fixing system. It is offenders, even for what has been done well known that large business concerns have escaped in the circumstances which were detailed by the Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt), because the prosecrion of such firms, with their complex business organizations, was too difficult to underI take. They have not only, escaped conviction, but have also been rewarded for their offences in the way described by the I have the latest regulation, I am not honourable member for Henty( Mr Coles) in relation to the Myer Emporium Limited. That firm was told that it would escape prosecution if it returned to the public, by means of reduced prices, regulations and cannot understand them? the excess prices which it had charged. The result was that the firm was given a tremendous advantage over its small competitors. The policy adopted by the Department of Trade and Customs, which is responsible for the administration of prices control, has caused the ruin of a great number of small trading concerns. My observation of the administration of the prices law has been that usually some small person who has been selling tomatoes, for instance, in excess of the fixed price, at the Sydney markets in the sight of God and man, has been prosecuted and convicted, whereupon the department figuratively thumps itself upon the chest and says, "" Look at the effectiveness with son who, since the 20th February, has which our prices control works "". The only persons who have suffered under prices control are small traders. This bill represents an attempt to deal with the problem of black marketing. say what I consider to be the real effect of the system of prices control. It is like most things that are being done to-day. centralized in Canberra, and there is no delegation or diffusion of responsibility through the States or the municipalities. There is delegation to and diffusion among certain subordinate officers at the who have to be in contact with the public and public opinion. I have always held the view that our great failure in this war has been the failure to use as agents of the Commonwealth such representative bodies as State parliaments and municipal councils. The bill provides elaborately for the prosecution of prior to the enactment of this legislation; for breaches, not of a statute, but of regulations. A mass of regulations has already been made by the Commonwealth. There are particular matters in which am interested; yet, I am not able to say what the law is in respect of them. UnlessI am sure that able to advise clients upon the industrial laws of the Commonwealth. What, then, must be the position of an ordinary member of the public who never sees the As a matter of fact, there are inconsistent provisions in our regulations. There are regulations containing provisions which one would naturally expect to find under some other heading. The people of this country do not regard regulations with the same degree of respect as they have for the statute law; and they are not able to ascertain the provisions of regulations with the same degree of certainty as they can ascertain the provisions of statute law. This measure does not itself insist that there shall have been a contravention of regulations, but merely relates to action "" not in accordance with "" regulations. All sorts of different offences are mentioned in it. Any perdone any of the things mentioned shall be liable to be prosecuted, and new offences may be created by new regulations made under this law. If the offender be prosecuted summarily Before1 discuss it, let me and be convicted, the punishment is to be not less than imprisonment for three months in respect of an individual; and if he be prosecuted Everything is upon indictment, the punishment is to be imprisonment for not less than twelve months. The Government considers that by severity of penalty it will achieve results it has failed to obtain in the past.",22,Black Marketin Gbill 1942 Second Reading
45,Mr Blackbuen (Bourke) [11.57].,"It complains of the lightness of the penalties imposed by police magistrates. The magistrates have considered that the offences warranted light penalties. Is it likely that convictions by juries will be obtained, when they will know that the result of conviction for an offence which public opinion very often does not .condemn will be imprisonment for twelve months? The attempt to have men sent to gaol for offences which public opinion, on the whole, does not condemn, will make very difficult the securing of convictions. The bill says that no man shall be prosecuted unless the Attorney-General consents to .that course being followed; and the right honourable gentleman may not consent until he has received a report from the Minister administering the regulations. Here there will be another bottle-neck at Canberra. The Attorney-General being the person named as the authority that has to consent to the launching of a prosecution, I should say that the right honourable gentleman will not be able to delegate the authority to prosecute. If that be not the intention, then mention of the Attorney-General would appear to be an idle safeguard. A person charged with the offence of selling, in contravention -of the regulations, tomatoes, butter, jam or peaches cannot be prosecuted even summarily unless the Attorney-lGeneral has bad; before him a report upon the matter from the Minister, and has authorized the prosecution. The effect will be that there will be no assurance that persons operating in a big way will be prosecuted. undertaken where conviction will be easy to obtain. If it be thought necessary to give retrospective operation to the act, I conceive it to be reasonable that the consent of the Attorney-General should be necessary in respect of offences committed before the passing of the act. I believe, however, that if it be provided that the consent of the Attorney-General shall be necessary in respect of every prosecution, very few prosecutions will be launched. The main fault that I find is that the bill does not describe the offences that are to be so heavily punished, except by reference to regulations. Moreover, it provides in clause 3 that, by subsequent Mr Blackburn. an addition may be made to the number of offences, because it says. "" and includes any other act or thing done or omitted to be done, or any conduct in contravention cf the regulations which is declared by regulations made under this act to be black marketing"". The bill, if enacted, will authorize the Government to make regulations providing for new forms of black marketing; and when such regulations shall have been made, any person who breaks them will be liable to the very severe penalties provided. I do not regard this as an effective way of dealing with the problem of black marketing and the enforcement of price control. Price control can be effectively enforced by the delegation of authority and control to representative bodies such as State parliaments and municipal councils. The cause of our trouble is the bottleneck at Canberra, and that will be intensified by this legislation. I do not consider that this measure will prevent black marketing. The effect will be that a number of persons engaged in small businesses, who foolishly take advantage of the position-as the honorson) has described-wil l find themselves taken before police magistrates and sent to gaol for three months, and there will not be a real attempt to control the large profiteer. A measure of this sort should plainly set out the actual offences with which people may be Prosecutions will be charged., so that any person may know what the law attempts to forbid, instead of having to look through regulations, which he knows are changing every day. No one can be sure of what the regulations contain to-day. As the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Rosevear) once said, every day a sugar-bag full of new regulations arrives. That would be ridiculous but for the fact that new crimes are daily being created and new penalties provided; and the people whose conduct i? being regulated are quite unaware of what is being done. of the general principles of the bill.

That would be an impossibility. understanding what is meant. for Bourke has very clearly stated that it has been impossible for people to know exactly what the regulations contain. Regulations are issued on a wholesale scale. After all, this legislation is to apply not only to the big companies but also to small businesses, and these latter are not in touch with the regulations that are issued from time to time. One of the most serious features of the bill is that the act is to operate retrospectively to February last. A little calm reflection must convince the Attorney-General that that is not altogether a fair proposal. Some time ago the Government issued a regulation which stated that certain action was to be taken in connection with the control of prices, and fixed a date at the end of February. another regulation was issued, which informed the trading community that on and after the 1st July, 1942, the rate of profit was to be fixed at 4 per cent. that. does. WhatI am concerned about is the unfairness of the provision that the act shall operate retrospectively to February. body who is honest. persons who had no intention to commit a breach of the prices regulations.

Only those actively concerned in the management of the business will be affected. These will have to show that they had no knowledge of what was done, and took reasonable care to prevent it from happening. That is a very reasonable provision. However enthusiastic we may be in regard to certain legislation, we would be very unwise to rush it through without giving it our consideration. It is the duty of Parliament to examine the details of measures of this sort. The bill provides for th* posting of notices outside the business premises of persons or companies convicted of an offence. Certain premises are occupied by more than one class of business. Who the guilty party was, will have to be made very clear; because it would be unfair to other persons carrying on business in the same premises if there were merely a general notice intimating that a conviction had been recorded for the offence of black marketing. I take it that the notice, would make it very clear Subsequently who was the guilty party. As the honourable member for Bourke pointed out, one of the greatest difficulties in connection with price fixation in places remote from Canberra is the time involved in obtaining decisions. I realize the difficulties encountered by the price-fixing authorities, and I suggest that it might assist matters if more authority were delegated to the Deputy Prices Commissioners in thp capital cities. This would be appreciated by the public, and would, in the end. be of great assistance to the department itself.

60,Mr Jolly,"That is satisfactory.the suggestions of the Leader of the Opposition. gratulate the Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt) and the Government upon this measure, which is a clear indication that the Government proposes to deal firmly with the evil of black marketing. The introduction of this bill will do much to allay uneasiness in the minds of the public, and to prevent them from continuing to be the victims of racketeers as they have been in the past. I believe that this measure will become historic. It is the most far-reaching measure of its kind that has been introduced in any part of the Empire or, for that matter, of the world. In New South ""Wales, during the last Avar, the Government took steps to prevent profiteering, and a special department was set up to deal with the matter. However, the evil developed to such tremendous proportions that it got completely out of hand. An official, who was connected with the work, told me recently that no fewer than 25,000 cases were recommended for prosecution, and when the identity of some of the offenders became known, the Government was embarrassed.. I trust that the Attorney-General will not find it necessary to approve of anything like so many prosecutions under this measure. I do not think that he will, because this legislation should act as a deterrent,, just as capital punishment acts as a deterrent, in respect of the crimes to which it applies. Conviction for black marketing will mean practically tbe extinction from business of the offender, because,, apart from the fine or imprisonment imposed, the odium attaching to conviction' will be very great. I cannot understand the statement of the Attorney-General regarding the treatment of the Myer Emporium Limited by the Prices Commissioner. This is what the Attorney-General saidThe recent declaration of the Myer Emporium Limited is a case worthy of special attention. The firm in question is tlie largest retail estabmany small traders have been prosecuted. lishment trading in a single centre in Australia. A careful investigation disclosed an increase of about 3 per cent, on the pre-war average gross profit margin charged by the company on all goods sold during the first two years of the war. Owing to the large turnover of the company this meant an excess profit of approximately £250,000 during the two years over and above what the profit would have been had the gross profit margin operating in the pre-war year been observed. It is important to note that the excess charge on individual transactions was very small, estimated to be less than twopence on each transaction. There were, however, over 40,000,000 transactions involved, and the problem was whether to prosecute the company or to "" declare"" it and thus to ensure that the excess profits were returned to tlie public. To have prosecuted the company effectiveJr would have meant proceeding on an enormous number of small transactions. If 100 instances had been chosen, tlie total excess profit would probably have been less than f l . In my opinion, the amount involved is not the main consideration; it is the principle that is important. For instance, a person who overcharges on the sale of matches would overcharge by only a very small amount on each transaction, but his offence would, nevertheless, be a serious one. The fact that, in the case of the Myer Emporium Limited, 40,000,000 transactions were involved, was no reason why the firm, should be let off without punishment. On the Attorney-General's reasoning it would appear that the greater tbe number of offences the less the risk of suffering punishment. I do not know why the Prices Commissioner did not prosecute the Myer Emporium Limited. It was no punishment to make the firm restore to the public the amount by which they had been overcharged. On that principle, a burglar, even when caught,, would be merely required to return the goods he had stolen. should realize that, there was no legal power by which the Treasury could impound the. £250,000 which represented the amount by which the Myer Emporium Limited had* overcharged the public. The position has been corrected in this measurenot understand why the Prices Commissioner did not prosecute Myers on a certain number of selected cases, just as Had that been done, a heavy penalty might have been imposed. I suggest that, before the Attorney General accepts the suggestion of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Fadden) to set up an outside advisory committee",26,Black Marketin Gbill 1942 Second Reading

63,Mr Morgan,"Nevertheless , I canto consult with the Crown Law authorities regarding prosecutions, he should consider the matter very carefully. It is claimed that such an advisory committee would be free of political bias, but we have no guarantee of that. Presumably, the members of the committee would be drawn from the business community; and if so, they would, no doubt, have political leanings. I believe that the matter should be kept in the hands of the Attorney-General's Department. The Crown Law officers are free from political influence, and they understand the legal principles involved. a committee on the lines suggested by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr rent and I believe that it will achieve Fadden). It will be representative of the various agencies mentioned by him, and its duty will be to report to me. Final responsibility will rest with the Attorney-General, but he will have the assistance of the committee. obvious that action under this provision must be confined to flagrant cases. On that understanding, the Leader of the Opposition has agreed to facilitate the expeditions passage of the bill, which is regarded as urgent. it will be physically possible for the Attorney-General to consider all the cases that may arise. Therefore, I suggest that his authority in this connection might be delegated to magistrates, or district court judges, in the various States. They would understand the principles of law involved; they could sift the evidence, and decide whether or not prosecutions should be launched. This would l if t a great load off the Attorneyof rationing without delay, not only General. I realize that this bill is intended to have a deterrent effect. Unfortunately, there are always persons in every community against whom it is necessary to provide penal measures. However, I look forward to the time when we shall have a better social system under which people, instead of living on one another like parasites, will live for one another. I agree with the views that have been expressed by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Fadden) and other speakers regarding the necessity for stamping out black markets. I have no objection to the principles of this bill. No patriot will disagree with legislation which attempts to abolish profiteering and to protect the public against black marketing. Nor have I any objection to the penalties which are prescribed, provided that, in the administration of the bill, the penalties are applied only to people who deserve to be punished. I hope that severe penalties will not be inflicted on people who do not deserve the stigma that will attach to their name as the result of prosecution. I sense that this measure is intended largely as a deterthat purpose. But, whilst the bill is intended principally as a deterrent, the machinery for launching prosecutions is always there, and it may happen that at a future date people who do not deserve It is to be stigmatized as "" blacketeers"" will suffer. If the bill operates fairly and achieves the purposes for which it is designed, a great service will be done to Australia. I make that statement because I regard the future as more important than the past. On one matter I disagree with the honourable member for Henty( Mr Coles). He expressed the view that rationing should be confined to merchandise in short supply. The honourable member and I see this matter differently. He has far more experience in merchandise than I have, whilst I may have a wider financial training than he has. I expect that the Government will be obliged to extend the present system to ensure that goods in short supply shall be fairly distributed among the public, but also as an adjunct to its financial policy. Unless taxation be extended to the lower ranges of income, or a system of post-war credits be introduced in the near future, the only means by which the Government will prevent the public from spending money so freely will be increased rationing. The more rationing is extended, the greater will be the opportunity for black markets. Ration coupons are a new kind of currency. I do not criticize them, because they are necessary. In my",27,Black Marketin Gbill 1942 Second Reading

66,Mr Spooner (Robertson) [12.30],""" pin ion, rationing should he extended; but there is a danger that when the coupon system is more widely applied greater opportunities will be created for black marketing. For that reason, I view the future with concern, and I welcome the bill because it should prevent the exploitation of the public. The Leader of the Opposition expressed the hope that care will be exercised to ensure that no injustices shall be inflicted upon traders. I have listened carefully to the replies which the Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt) has given from time to time to questions about black marketing, and I am sure that he is alive to the need for circumspection. The Attorney-General declared that at a later stage he will remove the provision to make the operations of the bill retrospective to the 20th February, 1942. It is possible that in the course of administration people may be penalized for something that they innocently did injustices w i ll be inflicted. Previous speakers mentioned that last February the Treasury announced that profits in excess of 4 per cent, upon capital would be absorbed by taxes. In other words, the trader would be acting as an agent for the Grown. A few weeks ago that plan was abandoned. honestly believed that the excess profits would be absorbed; by taxation, it is diffiauthority other than Parliament. As I cult to understand how he can now be charged with malicious intent in making profits. We all understand what is meant by "" blacketeer "". He is not the honest trader whose books are open to any authorized person to examine. "" blacketeer "" works underground. If this bill abolishes black markets, it w ill be a wonderful addition to the legislative enactments of this Parliament. But it will not be successful in all cases. I advocate the introduction of another bill which will assess excess profits. I have never agreed that one official, no matter how capable or experienced he may be, should he empowered to determine what constitute excess profits, and that Jones or Brown had been dishonest in earning profits in excess of a certain percentage. That is contrary to my conception of the principles of taxation and justice. Parliament should define excess profits, and Mr Spoon«r. the Government knows f r om my attitude towards its taxation proposals that I shall raise no objection to t i e most severe legislation, provided it is specific. 1 submit that suggestion to the Attorney General for serious consideration. I realize that the proposal cannot be given effect at short notice, but it would be a valuable adjunct to the bill .now under consideration and would give to the trading community a feeling of security. Today, business men are very uneasy. Each fears that unconsciously he may have committed a breach of the -law. But he is not. a "" crook "" who unconsciously overcharges the public. He may have fought his way uphill, and earned tlie reputation for being an honest businessman. He is anxious to preserve that good name. He will not know, u n t i l the close of the half year, whether he has made a few thousand pounds more than he thought he was making, but he does not intentionally defraud the public. He should not be branded as one who had robbed customers months ago. T hope that no in war-time. Specific legislation would a.llay that uneasiness. Parliament should authorize the Commissioner of Taxation to administer a law which defines excess profits and authorizes the excess to be collected for the Consolidated Revenue. I agree with the statement by the honourable member for Bourke( Mr Blackburn) If the trader that it is wrong that the profits of a trader should be determined by any do not know the Myer Emporium Limited, I can speak impersonally on the matter. Some time ago, the press reported that this firm had made excess profits totalling £250,000, and had been The compelled to refund the money to the public. That imposed no penalty upon the Myer Emporium Limited. Assuming that, these were excess profits, the £250,000 should have been paid into Consolidated Revenue for the purpose of helping to finance the war effort. £250,000 to the public, the Myer Emporium reduced the prices of many goods and was thus able -to undersell its competitors. ordinary paradox.

If the price of an article is fixed at a certain figure the seller knows his responsibility. I have a great deal of sympathy for the businessman who does not know exactly what is required of him, and who fears that legislation now introduced may describe as an offence an act that he committed months ago. I welcome the bill, and the assurance of the Attorney-General that he will appoint a committee to assist h i m to administer it, I do not share the views of the honourable member for Reid( Mr Morgan). In my opinion the number of prosecutions will not be large. The intention is not to punish a men who charges a few pence more than he should for an article. The Prices Commissioner will deal with him. The purpose of the bill is to hit the man who deliberately creates a black market. The Prices Commissioner need not think that I am criticizing his work, because I am only desirous of being constructive. examine the Prices Branch, and increase the strength of the organization. The system of price control is most important. It involves the industrial structure for the future, and the administrator of this legislation should have at his elbow officers of great experience and training. I do not think that those officials have always been provided, or that their number is sufficient to-day. deserves the urgent attention of the Government. Sitting suspended from .12.^5 to 2.15 p.m. I congratulate the Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt) on the work, of which we have seen some evidence inrecent, sittings of this sessional period, and on the work, of which wo know from the announcements made by him and the Prime Minister( Mr Curtin), in connection with the Statute of Westminster and the proposed referenda bills, to which he has been Buti t was certainly the giving his attention since his return from abroad. This legislation is very necessary. One thing that can create discontent, and maybe disaster, upon the home f r o n t is public feeling that some persons in the community are able to make money out of the war effort. There is a well-grounded feeling that some will emerge from this war richer than they were when the war started. The German defeat in the last war was, according to history, due to the economic collapse of Germany on the home front, or, in other words, the collapse of the morale of the German people, as much as to the defeat of the German armies in Prance. Legislation of this sort, if enacted earlier, would possibly have saved Australia from the experience of having cases like that of the Myer Emporium Limited flaunted before this Parliament and the country when the fate of the nation was really hanging in the balance. This firm, as every body knows, was enabled to make huge profits out of the war situation and was obliged to hand back only the amount which it had wrongf u l l y taken from the people-not , of course, to the people -from whom it was actually taken, because that would be physically impossible, but to the public at. large. The fact that it was made The Government should to disgorge that sum gave to the Myer Emporium the very great advantages, to which honourable members have drawn attention, not only over their competitors in Melbourne, but also over their competitors in their particular line of business throughout the Commonwealth. The honourable member for Henty( Mr. Coles) said that the Myer Emporium received £250,000 worth of cheap -adverTbe matter tising. It could not possibly have got such a good advertisement by paying a like sum for it . I am afraid that this h-gislation, admirable as it is in its general intent, will not enable this Government to obtain a conviction against the Myer Emporium for anything it did",29,Black Marketin Gbill 1942 Second Reading

The bill contains a valuable safeguard requiring the approval of the Attorney General to any prosecution. It could happen, if this legislation were passed without such a provision, that a number of very small people would suffer penalties under the proposed act while the bigger game would escape. That, of course, would not be satisfactory to the general public, nor would it be equitable. As far as the legislation aims at preventing wholesale exploitation of the public it is very good. Insofar as the smaller people are concerned, I hope that the Attorney General will continue the practice of prosecuting them under the National Security Act, so that the lesser penalties pronot believe that a person must go without vided under that act will be inflicted for minor offences. The penal clauses of this legislation should be reserved for the wholesale exploitation of the public and for flagrant, deliberate, and continuous attempts to flout the wish of Parliament and the nation that there should be equality of suffering and deprivation as far as possible. This involves doing without some things, first, in order that the soldiers might be supplied with what they need, and, secondly, in order that as far as possible the community at large might obtain the things necessary to maintain health and sustain life. I hope that there will be little need of prosecution, and that the very fact that the legislation is on the statute-book will be sufficient deterrent to prospective and actual malefactors. I do not think that the inflation or threatened inflation referred to by the honourable member for Deakin( Mr tunate mother of nineteen would, if this Hutchinson) is the root cause of black marketing. Black marketing, whatever of it there is-and I do not know that it is so very widespread after all-is largely caused by the destruction of small businesses during the rationalization process enforced by the Department of War Organization of Industry. The son all people, feeling that their opportunity for livelihood is vanishing, are prone to save as much as they can from the threatened wreck. I do not think that tbe average small business man who Mr Calwell. has been guilty of overcharging is deliberately anti-social in his outlook. He might feel that his action, after all, could never be so bad as that of the big emporium which was able to rob the community of £250,000 and, by way of penalty, was only required to repay its excess profits. I hope that householders will not be made subject to this legislation. There was a case in a police court in New South Wales yesterday of a mother of nineteen children 'being charged with stealing. She pleaded in extenuation that she had to try to provide for that large faanily, that she could not obtain the things she wanted otherwise, and that she had to have recourse to a breach of the law. Though it was a breach of the law, in my opinion it was no moral offence. I do if there is a superfluity of goods in the possession of other people. My views as to the morality of a lot of offences that are legally punishable may be different from those of a lot of other honourable members. ber enunciating a new principle of morality? . a man and his family are starving because he cannot get work, he is entitled to take his needs. The community has no right to starve him or to keep on the statute-book rotten laws which do not give him the light to work. I think that work is an inalienable right and, if the community will not give that right to a man, he is entitled to obtain the necessaries of life by what is legally regarded as theft. This unforbill were law in its present form, be liable to be sentenced to three months imprisonment if the act which she committed had been an act against any one of the econmic organization regulations. Of course, in such a case, the Attorney-General would not launch a prosecution; but we should not have on the statute-book a law which says that a person must be punished for an offence and not have the law administered. If she were found guilty, the magistrate would have no alternative but to sentence her to three",30,Black Marketin Gbill 1942 Second Reading

If she were, found! guilty and this legislation were in force in its present form, she would have to go to gaol for three months. Such a penalty in such circumstances would be an outrage on public opinion. I do not. want to see maladministration of justice or laws passed which the public conscience will not agree with. This bill should be passed', but several clauses might be amended. I think that the woman whosecase is now before the court in New South ""Wales should be congratulated upon the fact that she has reared nineteen young Australians at a time when many women much better situated economically have preferred bridge and golf parties and the like to the performance of a natural and national duty. Unfortunately, the economic regulations of February last are not well understood by the community. I doubt whether the regulations are known to one-tenth of 1 per cent., of the comimun-ity. It is unfortunate that tlie divided powers of the Commonwealth Parliament and the State parliaments do not enable this Government to do more by legislation and less by regulation. I hope that the day may not be far distant, when the Commonwealth Parliament will be clothed with far greater powers than it. has and that it. will pass legislation rather than the Executive make regulations-of which we have seen,, figuratively,, bucketstwelve, and I believe that it did the ful. They cannot be read in their entirety by members of this Parliament who are so busy these days. So many of them, too, are amendments of previous regulations, and honourable members cannot spare the timeto keep tracing back for the original regulations in order to understand the purport of the various changes. the act, too. So many regulations and able gentleman consider that we have amendments of regulations have been promulgated since the original National real need-and I press this upon the Attorney-General-for a consolidation of all regulations, issued to date. I . hope that he will instruct departments to arrange for all regulations issued by them to be consolidated immediately, so that honourable members, will be able to advise those of the many thousandswhom they represent-the average member represents something, over 60,000 people -wh o seek advice as to what the regulations really mean. If it ibe difficult for the honourable member for Bourke( Mr Blackburn),, with his legal training,, to advise his clients, how can we laymen make even a guess at the meaning, of some of the complicated regulations which have been issued? I am sure that the Attorney Geneial, indefatigableas he j is in the discharge of his duties, will listen sympathetically to the appeals of honorable members. As the honourable member for Bourke has said, there is no popular respect for regulations. They are not. treated, in the same way as acts of Parliament, and it is desirable that, as far as possible, their provisions should be made the subject of bills so that honourable memberscould move for their amendment, instead of having to take the more drastic action of moving for the disallowance of the whole statutory rule, as is necessary now. continuously. that. The United States Congress refused to disperse in 1941 when the President wanted it to doso. It sat. for eleven and a half months out of American nation a great benefit by doing so. As the honourable member for Bourke has said, it is much easier to get things done when Parliament, is sitting than when it is not sitting. The British House of Commons sits much more frequently than does this Parliament, and if that can be done in a war zone where there are far greater perils and difficulties than there are here, we could endeavour to",31,Black Marketin Gbill 1942 Second Reading

78,Mr Paterson,"Does not the honordone a lot of continuous sitting this week'( subject to certain qualifications with regard to this series of sittings. It is not desirable that we should have such long continuous sittings as we have had this week, and it ought to be possible for Parliament to observe reasonable hours, even if that involved an extension of the sessional period by a week or two. I hope some day to see an amendment oi the Standing Orders to prevent either House of the Parliament from sitting for longer than twelve hours continuously. That would certainly not harm the nation. The difference between this bill and the bill which was introduced by i: previous government, is that its provisions are made retrospective in regard to actual crimes that have been committed against the nation. The honourable member for Warringah ( Mr of previous over-charging. It should not Spender), when he was Minister for the Army, introduced a bill to amend the Defence Act, which made certain act which had not been offences when they were committed two or three years previously, acts of conspiracy and punishable. At that time, the Labour party, under the leadership of the present Attorney-General, endeavoured to amend the bill. Unfortunately, it became law without amendment. That legislation was introduced for the purpose of dealing with two firms in New South Wales which had been accused of anti-social acts. Both firms were prosecuted under the act, but, in spite of the fact that the cases went to the High Court, and then, strangely enough, down to suburban courts, the Government was unsuccessful and the legislation was ineffective. The Attorney-General's proposal to create new penalties for acts which were punishable but which took place prior to the introduction of this bill is inspired by the failure of magistrates to impose adequate penalties under the existing law. He complained with just cause of the attitude of magistrates in lightly penalizing persons who had been guiltv of acts which could have had grave consequences to the nation. But there is a weakness i ' his case. It is that those firms which have already been convicted, and punished with minor penalties, will not besubject to further action by the Commonwealth, whereas those which escaped prosecution for acts committed between February last and the present date wil be unfortunate enough, if they are prosecuted, to incur the higher penalties. WP may find that big firms will escape with penalties of £5 or £10, or whatever finewere imposed on them, whilst smalle:people will be sent to gaol for three months. The public conscience would not approve of that, and I do not believe that the Attorney-iGeneral desires to brim'; about that state of affairs. We cannot prosecute the Myer Emporium Limited for what it has done, but we can restrict its sales in the future so that it will not be able to get the great number of coupons that it is at present getting as the result of the reduction of prices which it has been compelled to make on account be allowed to secure or maintain that advantage over its competitors. That was never contemplated when the Government compelled it to give back to customers, by means of reduced prices, the sum r £250,000 which it had unlawfully received by way of excessive prices. The Prices Commissioner may be able to take some action under existing regulations to give effect to my suggestion. If so. that firm would be prevented from con tinning to benefit by its misdeeds. The Attorney-General might well accede t' the request made by several honourable members to eliminate the retrospective provision in the bill. The passage of this legislation will emphasize to magistrates the serious view which the Parliament takes of acts which are offences under the Economic Organization Regulations. Therefore, it is logical to assume that they will take a more serious view of offences which come before them in future. In these circumstances, retrospectivity is not of great importance, and I ask the Attorney General to agree to the deletion of the clause which gives retrospective effect to the bill. I hope also that the right honourable gentleman will agree to eliminate clause S. This clause is unsatisfactory to me. It statesAny person who does any act or thing preparatory to tlie doing of any act or tiling the",32,Black Marketin Gbill 1942 Second Reading
79,Mr Calwell,"My remarks aredoing of which would constitute the offence of black marketing shall be guilty of the ofl'enue of black marketing. With all due respect to the persons who drafted that clause, I say that it seems to be perilously close to the offence under the Japanese penal code of "" harbouring dangerous thoughts "". People should not be prosecuted merely for an attempt to do a thing which will become an offence. The title of this bill is, "" A h ill for an act to provide for the prevention of black marketing "". One of the casualties in this war, as in every war, is the English language. In every crisis, we start to murder the language by conjuring up new phrases or concocting words which seem to express the views or emotions of the moment. As the Attorney-General has said, "" black marketing"" cannot be found in any dictionary. The language is not so poverty stricken, that we have to invent such words and phrases as "" blacketeering "" and "" black marketing "", any more than we had to invent "" p r o fiteering "" during the war of 1914-18. German"" strafe "". the last war we borrowed many foreign words. In legislation of this sort, we ought to pay some respect to the purity of the language and not lightly introduce words that are harsh and certainly not euphonious. We might extend the austerity campaign to this matter. I introduced the subject of the treatment of the Myer Emporium Limitedi n this House before any other honourable member, and it is strange that, at the moment when I was protesting against the failure to impose any penalty on the firm, the Minister for Trade and Customs (Senator fCeane) was cial view as to why the company should not be prosecuted at all. Whether the official view was right or wrong, public opinion did not sanction it , and this legislation will be more in accord with what the people belipve to be the right attitude to adopt towards firms and persons who are guilty of the acts enumerated in the bill. probably, that there will not be an overwhelming number of prosecutions under this measure because the seriousness of the war situation has now impressed itself upon the people. In my view, what happened immediately after Japan entered the war was not so much the result of criminal intent as of carelessness and a certain amount of justifiable ignorance of the law ou the subject. The publicity which the Minister's speech has received in the daily pres3 w i ll cause any who may be contemplating offences to think twice. I hope that in the administration of this measure the authorities will be more concerned about the present than about the past. prove of the general principles of this bill, though I agree with the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) that the title leaves something to be desired. Such a title as "" Commodities and Services Exploitation B ill "" would be more dignified. I regret that the Government has been so slow to meel certain requests that were made many months ago. The much neglected report of the Joint Committee on Profits which was presented in October, 1941, contained words like ""blitz"" and the following paragraph :Schedule"" 1) "" to this report contains a list T h a t is so. During of prosecutions instituted against traders, and the result of the prosecution in each case, f t has been represented to ua that the penalties imposed are on the whole lighter than the offences justify. We do not feel it would be proper for us to criticize decisions reached by judirial authorities in relation to matters us to which they are the ultimate judges, but we think that where deliberate breaches of the regulations and orders are proved, it is iu the public interest that sueh offences should be regarded as grave breaches of the law, and treated accordingly. Seven months ago, in March, 1942, the committee, in its second report, made the following observations:In schedule "" D "" to this report we set out -tating in the Senate the offidetails of prosecutions between August, 1941, una the third day of March, 1942.

We entertainsome doubts whether the serious nature of offences against the regulaThe Attorney-General will find, tions is f u l ly appreciated throughout the community, and we think that this is reflected in the comparatively small penalties which at times are imposed.

The fixed penalties prescribed for offences I turn now to the .second-reading speech of the Attorney-General, which may give rise to the impression that business firms in Victoria have been the chief offenders in profiteering. We all have heard a' great deal about the case of the Myer Emporium Limited. Of the thirteen cases cited by the Attorney-General five concerned Victorian firms. that account. Joint Committee on Profits included a list of the first 45 prosecutions in Australia. Of these 32 concerned firms in New South Wales and thirteen firms in the other five States.

The honourable member for Melbourne referred to the retrospective character of the legislation. Retrospectivity is a dangerous principle to apply in such a measure as this. I am glad that the Attorney-General has intimated that he will accept the suggestion made by the Leader of the Opposition for the appointment of an independent committee to report upon cases. The placarding of guilty firms introduces a very old principle of punishment. It is a return to the medieval practice of branding criminals on their forehead with a red-hot iron. If placarding should prove successful in preventing war-time offences in relation to marketing it could possibly bo applied in some other ways. non-unionists to wear a button? minium tag through their ears. that employers and employees found are rather savage. A fine of £1,000 on conviction by a magistrate and £10,000 on conviction after indictment are extremely severe. The evidence submitted to the Joint Committee on Profits indicated that some business people, including proprietors of small country stores, had considerable difficulty in understanding the Prices Commissioner's averaging system. The whole capital of such firms might not be £10,0.0.0, j e t such a fine would have to be -imposed on conviction after indictment. The case of the Myer Emporium Limited shows that extremely complicated questions arise in relation to big firms. I have been told, at second-hand, that officers of the Prices Commissioner are now entering the departments of big -business firms witb the object of obliging the firms to make restitution of excess profits. Some cases of real hardship have occurred. I have in mind .an Adelaide firm which was convicted of an offence. Its directors aTe a most honourable body of men. That firm has not made excess profits. In fact, it has been so jealous of its reputation for fair trading that it has not been able to pay an ordinary dividend to its shareholders for a number of years. The Prices Commissioner involved that firm in the loss of hundreds of pounds by his arbitrary action in relation to the price of tea, of which commodity the firm had large stocks. Later the firm was prosecuted and severely fined because it slightly increased the price of matches. My last information about it was that it was facing a world-shaking problem in relation to the price of carraway seed. The recent history of meat prices in Adelaide gives food for thought. A few weeks ago the Prices Commissioner pegged the retail prices of meat in the metropolitan area of Adelaide, but took no action in respect of the price of meat in country districts. Owing to the shortage of stock, the country butchers advanced their prices, and city butchers were required to pay lOd. per lb. for lamb which",34,Black Marketin Gbill 1942 Second Reading

89,Dr. Price,"I intended to suggesthad to be sold at the pegged price of 8d. The result was that the public had to be satisfied with low-grade meat, although city butchering firms were losing from £20 to £25 a week. Ill-considered action may give grave inducement to so-called profiteering. Finally, a meeting of 350 butchers was convened to consider a proposal to discontinue operations. At the last moment the Prices Commissioner agreed to increase .the price of meat by Id. per lb., and the firms were able to continue trading. AlthoughI agree with the general principles of the bill, I wish to make reasonably sure that their application will not create a bureaucratic tyranny backed by savage penalties. I am glad that the legislation will deal with coupon frauds. opinion in the clothing trade that frauds are being perpetrated in respect of clothes coupons. It is being said openly that clothes coupons may be purchased in Sydney for 12s. 6d. a sheet. I hope that the Government will investigate these statements. If they were proved to be true action should be taken against offenders. Because of its importance I wish to say a few words about the futurea subject, referred to by the honourable member for Robertson ( Mr Spooner). The Prices Commissioner, the Joint Committee on Profits,, and many business firms, are muck more concerned about the future, than about the present. The poat-war period will probably be one of falling prices. The Prices Commissioner has intimated that in such circumstances he intends to apply his averaging system with a downward tendency. That will lead to more danger of fraud than exists at present. To help firms through this dangerous period, when ruin may face many of them, the Joint Committee on Profits, after receiving a great deal of evidence from business people, advised the Government to take: steps to apply a proportion of current business profits to premises of theperson or firm concerned the accumulation of post-war credits, instead of taking the money in a straight-out tax. Labour members on the committee were so impressed with the strong case that was made out for postwar business credits that they signed the wise, passers-by may conclude that the report on the subject. I hope that the committee's recommendation will receive the careful consideration of the Government. WhilstI agree with the bill generally, I hope that some of its provisions will be amended. It is particularly desirable that the danger of a bureaucratic regimentation of business supported by a complicated system of control involving severe penalties shall be countered by wise parliamentary action. Hitherto the great majority of the trading community has co-operated splendidly with the Prices Commissioner. This point was dealt with as follows in the last report of the Joint Committee on Profits :We think it fair to say that the trading community in general' has displayed a readiThere is a strong ness: to co-operate with the Commissioner and his staff which is commendable and. has contributed in no small measure to the smooth working of an extremely difficult undertaking. In view of that statement the Government would be most unwise to sacrifice the goodwill of traders by harsh injustices. If business people are assured that they will be fairly treated their present co-operation will doubtless be continued. approve «f the bill generally. Every body recognizes the necessity for and the value of it. Such legislation is long overdue. Being unacquainted with legal procedure, I cannot determine whether any person, having been convicted of an offence, will have the right of appeal. I am particularly interested, because employees may be placed, in a false position by unscrupulous employers laying on. them the blame for any offence committed. relation to this, matter will be those that apply to all Commonwealth law,, namely, there will exist practically all the appeals that are open under State law. The provision that notice of a conviction shall be displayed on the business is absolutely necessary. The proposed heading to such a placard is ""Black Marketing Act"".

I am concerned about rhe proposal to broadcast particulars relating to offences and convictions. Under it, grave injustice may be done to innocent persons. The notice published in the (lazette should be the only statement That should go over the air. The right should not be given to any commercial broadcasting station to deliver a homily to the relatives of employees of the firms convicted.

They did not know exactly ply. what limitation was to be placed on the trained, and are not allowed to operate profits that they could earn; nor did the Prices Commissioner and his staff. Government utterances led them to believe that their profits were to be limited to 4 per cent., and that they would merely be receiving agents for the Taxation Commissioner in. respect of all profits in excess of that rate. The bill implements some of the recommendations of the Joint, Committee on Profits, of which I am a member. That committee made its first report in October last. It then mentioned the difficulty which the Prices Commissioner and his staff were experiencing. That was due in no small measure to the neglect of this .Parliament to enact legislation giving effective control over prices. The Prices Branch has been functioning under reguevery week. I learned from my Prices Commissioner and hi3 staff were called upon to educate traders, merchants. manufacturers, and the public as to what was expected of them. I agree with the honourable members for Bourke( Mr Blackburn) and Melbourne ( Mr Calwell), that statutory enactments should be substituted for many of the regulations iu order that the people may understand what is required of them. The honourable member for Bourke said that price fixation had been one of the ridiculous failures of our wartime legislation. I am not quite sure what he meant. I regard it; as one of the outstanding administrative departments operating under war-time legislation. I wish that some of the other war-time effective as the Prices Commissioner and his staff have been in carrying out the enormous task assigned to them. Memof our policy, the task Members of the staff are well",36,Black Marketin Gbill 1942 Second Reading
93,Mr Marwick (Swan) [3.5],"I supbers of the committee found that, theyoutside until they are thoroughly competent. The staff consists mostly of qualified accountants, and each, man is becoming a specialist in the particular branch that he has to investigate. As a member of the Joint Committee on Profits, I place on record my appreciation of the wonderful service they are rendering to this country. I welcome this legislation, because it will deal with the wholesale profiteer and racketeer. I sincerely hope that those convicted of minor offences will be dealt with as they are at present. Because he fails to understand the regulations, a man may easily, though unconsciously, commit a breach of them. If there has been any failure of the administration, it would be entirely wrong to lay it to the account of officers of the Prices Branch. Rather should it be directed to those members of the judiciary who have dealt with prosecutions, because of the trivial fines they have imposed for what has been regarded as a serious offence. The statement of the penalties in this legislation will act as a deterrent such as has not existed in the past because of the leniency of police magistrates. I am pleased that the Attorney-General is prepared to accept the recommendations of the Leader of the Opposition. gratulate the Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt) on the introduction of this measure, which Only by such means may profiteering and black marketing be prevented. As previous speakers have pointed out, persons convicted in the past have been treated far too lightly. Evidence placed before the Joint Committee on Profits disclosed a large number of cases of not only overcharging but, also fraudulent practice with the object of covering up overcharges that had been made. The fines imposed were unquestionably too light. The Attorney-General has cited one of the worse cases, that of R. Donaldson and Company, jute merchants, of Melbourne. This firm had two convictions recorded against it in respect of jute prices, and one conviction in respect of false returns. In each case, a fine of £5 was imposed, with costs amounting to £3 3s. I understand that the officials were engaged on their investigations for five months, checking the practices of the firm in order to obtain details that would enable them to launch a prosecution. The cost to the Government amounted to hundreds of pounds. Yet the total amount of the fines was only £15. That was entirely inadequate. Goods had been purchased prior to the war, and in an endeavour to mislead the Government inspectorsthe books were falsified in certain respects. Other cases of a similar nature were brought to the notice of the Joint Committee on Profits. The maximum penalty of a fine and imprisonment would be the just desert of a firm acting in that manner. I hope that if a firm is found guilty of such practices it will be dealt with severely under this measure. In this way, its punishment will act as a deterrent to others who might be tempted to offend. If the act be fearlessly administered from the start, I do not think that there is any danger that the Attorney General and his staff will be called upon to investigate a large number of cases. Indeed, it will probably be found that one will be able to count the number of offenders on the fingers of one hand. Thepractice of "" declaring "" a firm which has overcharged the public was never of much use because, although the firm was ordered to reduce its prices so as to return to the public an amount equivalent to that by which the purchaser? is long overdue. had been overcharged, the trouble was that the money did not go back, to those from whom it had been taken. Unscrupulous firms were disposed, to take the risk of detection and punishment, because the profits derived from overcharging were usually greater than the fine that was imposed. This matter was investigated by the Joint Committeeon Profits, which recommended that the amount by which a firm overcharged the public should be confiscated to the Treasury. That is now provided for under this measure, and thus one of the strongest inducements to profiteeringwill be removed. Indeed, it has been argued that it was no punishment to "" declare"" a firm, and to compel it to reduce its prices. For instance, a wholesale house which was compelled to reduce prices would probably secure increased business from those who were on the",37,Black Marketin Gbill 1942 Second Reading
94,Mr Clark (Darling) [3.12],"I conlookout for cheaper goods. In any case, I do not think that those firms which have been "" declared"" have suffered much as a result. I do not agree with the honourable member for Melbourne that clause 8 of the bill should be omitted. The clause was inserted to deal with such firms as Donaldson and Company, which tried to falsify their books so as to be able to sell at a higher price. In my opinion, the falsifying of books may be a more grievous offence than that of overcharging. There can be no doubt of guilty intention when books are falsified, whereas overcharging may be an honest mistake. which the honourable member refers could be dealt with under the Crimes Act, apart altogether from clause 8. This bill has met with the almost unanimous approval of the House, and any objections raised have been in respect of minor points only. I oppose the suggestion of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Fadden) that a committee should be set up to advise the Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt) regarding prosecutions. There is already sufficient prospect of delay without the setting up of still another committee. I speak as one who comes from a distant State, and I know that it would make for delay if the particulars of an offence committed in Western Australia or in northern Queensland had, after being reported to the Attorney-General, to be then investigated by a committee. I believe that the Prices Commission has done very valuable work; but it has, of course, like most of the other authorities set up since the war, made mistakes from time to time. The Deputy Prices Commissioner in Western Australia told me recently that he was snowed under with work, and that he could not get sufficient staff because the great assistance to me. In all instances military authorities had called up his men. Repeated complaints have been made in Kalgoorlie that certain firms have been overcharging the public, and. receipts have been forwarded to the pose to adopt was put forward in Deputy Prices Commissioner in Perth the first place by the Leader of in support of the allegations. He, howthe Opposition, and iconcurred in ever, replied that the matters were too by several other speakers, notably the trivial to justify action. I regret the necessity for a measure of this kind, because he is a poor sort of man who will, at a time like this, take advantage of a scarcity of goods in order to rob his fellow citizens. Unfortunately, however, such persons exist; hence the need for this legislation. General) [3.27] -in replyI thank honourable members on both sides of the House for their reception of this bill, and their suggestions for its improvement. I believe the bill will act as a deterrent, as it is intended to do. After consideration, I have decided to adopt two of the suggestions which have been put forward. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Fadden) suggested that, before a prosecution was launched under this legislation, and before the Attorney-General gave his consent to it, he should be armed witb an independent opinion on the facts for and against a prosecution. I appreciate what the honourable member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr Johnson) said about the possibility of delay, but I believe that a little delay at that point might prevent the perpetration of an injustice. I assure honourable members that, once a prosecution is decided upon, the proceedings will be very swift indeed. This measure will be reserved for clear-cut cases, and for bad cases. I have told the Leader of the Opposition that I propose to accept his suggestion. However, we cannot appoint a statutory committee for this purpose. I undertake to appoint a committee which will be representative of my own department, and of two other departments -probabl y the Prices Commission, and the department affected by the proposed prosecution. Action will be taken when this committee recommends to the Attorney-General that the case ia of sufficient gravity to warrant proceedings under the act. This procedure will, I believe, be a safeguard, and will be of the facts will be investigated carefully before proceedings are taken. The other suggestion which I pro-",38,Black Marketin Gbill 1942 Second Reading

97,Dr. Evatt (Barton,"Attorneyhonorable member for Henty( Mr to prevent black marketing, by deterring Ooles). It has to do with the retrospective provisions of the bill. Whilst the proposal of the Government can be justified in principle, there are factors which make the deletion of the retrospective provision advisable. It is not as if persons who committed offences against the regulations prior to the passing of the bill will escape. They can still be dealt with under the National Security Act. If , as I hope, the bill becomes law -without delay, magistrates -will probably take a more serious view of some offences than would be indicated by the cases that I cited yesterday. In committee, I shall submit an amendment for the purpose of bringing the measure into force from the day on which it receives the Royal assent. With suggestions for the control of prices I shall not deal at any length, the Prices Commission has had a most difficult job, and on the whole, it has done ing words:"" come into operation on the day good work for Australia. The suggestions of honourable members will receive careful consideration. Of course, the scope of the bill is not confined to the prices branch, but extends, for instance, to rationing. Broadly, it relates to all the schemes which control the economic life of this country in these days of restrictions. cover attempts by traders to undercut their competitors? that may be covered, but I do not propose to express an opinion upon the matter at the moment. The honourable member for Boothby (Dr. Price) criticized the term "" black marketing"" in the title of the bill. But the term is not created by the bill; it already exists. It has come into use as the result of actual trading operations. Honourable members will recall that in the last war, the word ""profiteering"" was coined.

I am sure that honourable members will desire me to express to the father of the House, the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) their felicitations upon his attainment of his 78th birthday to-day. The right honourable gentleman, as I have said, is the father of the House, but he had a parliamentary career before he came into the Commonwealth Parliament, and, uninterruptedly for 48 years, he has been a representative of the people, in either the Parliament of New South Wales or the Parliament of the Commonwealth. The facts of his career are so well known that I shall not dwell upon them, but I am confident that all honourable members will join with me in congratulating him upon having passed another milestone. We extend to him our sincere good wishes for very many happy returns of this day. of the Opposition) [3.46] -In endorsing the sentiments voiced by the Prime Minister( Mr Curtin), I express on behalf of the Opposition an appreciation of the kindly thought which prompted him thus to signalize the 78th birthday of our Deputy Leader, and Leader of the United Australia party, the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes). The right honourable gentleman has spent in public life more years than I have Deen on this earth. He has had a picturesque career. Australia is his adopted land, but none could deny that he has proved himself to be one of the best Australians [30] that this country has had. I visited the right honourable gentleman this morning, and it was gratifying to find him happy and reading the morning paper without the aid of glasses. That he is in full enjoyment of his faculties we all know; in fact, he is more alert than are many honourable members of this House, and I include myself. The right honourable gentleman is a national institution. He has had experiences, industrial and political, that very few men have shared. He has worked in most of the industries of Australia and travelled by all means of transport from wagon to aeroplane, and his journeys have taken him not only into the remote outback of Australia over dusty and sandy tracks but also to many place. overseas. I am confident that all honourable members wish that he may be spared to enjoy many another birthday. I welcome the privilege of associating myself with the Prime Minister( Mr Curtin) and the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Fadden) iu wishing the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) many happy returns of the day, and of paying tribute to his long record of distinguished public service. The right honourable gentleman has been an Australian legislator uninterruptedly for nearly 49 years. The Prime Minister has referred to him as the father of the House. He might almost be called the grandfather of the House, for the nearest approach to his record of continuous service in Parliament is the 23-year term shared by the Minister for Munitions ( Mr Makin), the honourable member for Forrest( Mr Prowse) and myself. Other honourable members have had longer service than we, but not without interruption. I have been closely in contact with the right honourable member for a great many years, both in active opposition and in collaboration, and I am able, perhaps better than most, to speak with authority about, his service to this country. The right honourable gentleman has been a notable fighter for better conditions, especially of health and work, for the people. He has also been enthusiastically devoted to the cause of constitutional reform. In the last war, as Australia's representative",41,Third Reading
