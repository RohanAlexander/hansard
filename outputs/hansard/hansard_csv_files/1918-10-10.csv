I should like him to be more specific in his complaint. cases of the kind referred to. everything is topsy-turvy, there is bound to be a great deal of dissatisfaction with departmental administration, but I do not feel justified in going over the head of the Department until I know what the complaints are. gentleman will find tbem in the correspondence between honourable members and tbe Defence Department. that correspondence. If honourable members will, in some co-operative way, give me an idea of tbe nature of the complaints, I shall undertake to inquire into tbem. UntilI obtain more specific information, I cannot make a definite promise to do any particular thing. Prime Minister( Mr Watt) find that tbe Defence Department is full of complaints, extending over the last two years, about deductions from the allowances of soldiers' wives and widows in consequence of penalties imposed at the Front. Does .the Acting Prime Minister consider thatfinesimposed at the Front in consequence of misconduct by a soldier should be visited upon tbe wife or widow who allowed her busband to enlist on tbe supposition that she would receive so much per day during his absence? of such long standing, they should not be popped, without notioe, at a Minister who is not in charge of the Defence Department. The matter may be simple, and Cabinet bas been dealing with one phase of the question this week, and has settled it, I think, to the satisfaction of all concerned. But I cannot be expected to be familiar with all tbe'details of Defence administration. I shall make inquiries, and give an answer to the honourable member .later. Minister seen in one of the morning papers the statement that the Commonwealth Government is taking control of all the woollen mills of Australia? Is that statement true? If not, has any departure been made in connection with the Commonwealth control of the woollen mills? rect. The Defence Department informs me that various causes connected with the war have created an increased demand for clothing material for Australian Imperial Force purposes, and the Business is considering the beBt means of meeting that increased demand. For that purpose the members of the Board are. in conference with the woollen manufacturers on. the subject. the necessity for increased production by the Australian woollen mills for military purposes, will the Acting Prime Minister endeavour to induce the mill-owners to work at a little higher pressure, so that the local demands to i their products also will may be satisfied as far as possible? able member's suggestion to the Minister for Defence. that tbe sugar crop of 1918 is short of Australian requirements, and the probable shortage of tbe J919 crop, is it the intention of the Commonwealth Government to insist on the terms of sub-section c of clause 1 of the current agreement between it and tbe Queensland Government for the purchase of raw sugar? the honourable member refers is probably that under which the Queensland Government undertook not to erect more mills . during tbe period covered by the agreement? inserted in the agreement to protect the Commonwealth against financial loss in tbe event of this year's crop adding to the surplus carried over from last yeaT.

COAL FOE POET AUGUSTA. the question asked yesterday by the honourable member for Dampier( Mr orable member's questions are as folGregory), as to the steamship Yarra being unable to discharge a cargo of coal This steamer arrived at Port Augusta at 2.30 p.m. on Friday, 26th September, with 2,797 tons of coal on board for delivery to the Commonwealth and State railways, &c. Immediately on arrival discharge was commenced, and continued up to the time of the engine drivers' strike. The vessel then had on board 500 tons of coal. The Inter-State Central Committee communicated with the CommonState Railway Department to ascertain if it would be possible for the 'balance of the coal on board to be taken delivery of at Port Augusta. On receiving a reply that it was absolutely impossible for further coal to be landed, as all trucks were full, and the lines congested, the Inter-State Central Committee gave instructions that the vessel should proceed to Adelaide and there deliver the balance of her cargo of coal. The alternative to this would have heen to allow the steamer to remain idle at Port Augusta for an indefinite period, which could not be permitted under present conditions. MAIL CONTEACTS.

What are the agents' fees, freight, and"" all other expenses and charges paid for deliverside, and formerly Parliamentary Secretary to ing 1 ton of molybdenite to the British Government? orable member's questions are as follow:1. The price paid by the British Government for Australian molybdenite is 1003. per unit for ore basis 85 per cent. MoSj at the producing centres, the Imperial Government paying all the costs and charges between the producing centres and London. The Commonwealth agents are paid 1 per cent, export agency commission, and, where actually earned, a collecting agency comimission of l i per cent. The duty of the Commonwealth Government, as agent for the Imperial Government, is to purchase the mineral and deliver same to the steamer. The charges from f.o.b. steamer to London are not available to the Commonwealth Government. Minister, upon notice1.

Will the Acting Prime Minister state now, or at any time, and, if so, when, during the life of the present Parliament, what are the views of the Government on Empire Trade, and what legislation is contemplated to give effect to the said views? orable member's questions are as follow:1.

No single eligible men have been retained in the Central Audit Office. In the Naval and Military branch of the Audit Office there are two single eligible men employed temporarily. One is a supervisor, whose services it is desirable to retain on account of his superior qualifications. He supports his father, and one of his brothers has been killed in action, and one is serving at the Front. The other is a boy aged nineteen, receiving 5s. a day. Prime Minister, upon notice1.

It is not considered necessary to withhold they were serving on Gallipoli. executive approval for the reason that, in making appointments to the Public Service, preofficer was evacuated wounded and sick, in ference is given to returned soldiers, and the June, 1915. seniority of a soldier, for purposes of promotion, is based on the assumption that he passed the examination first held after his enlistment. The claims of officers who have enlisted and are still abroad are always fully considered in the making of promotions. It is considered that by these means effective preference is given to returned soldiers and officers who are still abroad. Minister for Defence, upon notice1.

If so, and in view of the fact that this corporation is said to be directly interested in buying ores as cheaply as possible, will the Government, in the interests of the industry, remove the alleged'monopoly which it is stated has been created? Mr ""WATT The Thermo-Electric Ore Reduction Corporation has been appointed Commonwealth agent fbr North Queensland. This corporation manufactures practically the whole of the tungsten powder used by the British Government. The corporation, at the instance of the Imperial authorities, has equipped works and laboratories, and has captured the business in ferro-alloys formerly in the hands of the German Metallurgical ""Works. It is now the largest manufacturer of tungsten powder and ferro-tungsten in the world. I am unable to state what profit it makes in England on its manufactures, but it is not considered likely that the Imperial Government would permit excessive profits to be made. The Thermo-Electric Ore Reduction Corporation pays the rates fixed by the Commonwealth Government for wolfram, &c, and it has no interest .whatsoever in the price paid for these concentrates. The Government is satisfied with the existing arrangements. Minister for Defence, upon notice1.

If so, what is the reason for this discrimination ? 3. In view of the relatively small number affected, and the consequently small increased expenditure involved, will the Minister favourably consider the extension of the matter so as to include the relatives of soldiers residing outhad neither a court martial nor a court of side Australia? orable member's questions are as foland the information will he supplied as low:1.

Will the Minister state whether the regulation to the effect that any liquor dealer supplying intoxicants to members of the Australian Imperial Force in uniform, after 6 p.m., will be liable to prosecution, is still in operation in Queensland? 2. If so, will the Government consider the advisability of cancelling such regulation, which is considered to be an undeserved stigma upon members of the Australian Imperial Force, or, as an alternative, close hotels to the public generally at 6 p.m.? MT. ""WISE -The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. The District Commandant has been instructed to issue an order under the War Precautions Regulations prohibiting the sale of intoxicating liquor in Queensland to soldiers in uniform after 6 p.m., and this order is still in force. 2. The Government has issued the regulation in the interests of the soldiers, and do not regard it as a stigma upon the soldiers.

How many have been sent to prison? obtained, and the honourable member will be informed as early as possible. . Minister for Defence, upon notice1. Whether the Minister has issued regulations prohibiting individuals posting newspapers to soldiers at the Front? 2, If so, will the Minister explain his reasons for so doing? able member's questions is as follows :The regulation has not yet been issued; but it has been announced in response to representations made by the responsible military authorities overseas, that, owing to transport difficulties and the general conditions obtaining at tlie Front, it is becoming increasingly difficult to guarantee delivery of newspapers posted to individuals. Particularly in the case of daily papers, it is stated that they are generally out of date, and therefore useless, on arrival -Statutory Rules 1918, Nos. 244, 245. It was decided by the Army Administration to enlist the aid of the Australian Comforts Fund and the Red Cross Society, and these bodies have for some time past been working in close co-operation with them, with a view to the bulk supply of Australian newspapers. The Minister is informed that they are now sending forward large quantities of all weeklies to every unit of the Australian Imperial Force, including hospitals, and contributions of such papers would be welcomed by the patriotic bodies mentioned. It should further be explained that, apart from the special consideration which is thus being shown to the natural desire of Australian soldiers to obtain their own newspapers printed in their own country, the Army Administration have made arrangements for the supply of various publications of interest. For example, the Ansae Bulletin, containing news specially cabled from . Australia, and the British Australasian, a weekly issue of information regarding Australians and Australian affairs generally, are being distributed widely to the Australian troops. As is well known, these papers contain copious extracts of matters of interest from papers in all the States. An organization known as the Camps Library also supplies books and magazines to all Australian units. At the same time, if it is desired to send any particular news item to an individual soldier, this can, of course, be effected .by making a cutting or extract from the newspaper, and sending it by letter post, a course which, it tc the soldier. .

The remarks I have to make on this measure may be made now or on the second reading, if the Committee so desire. the matter discussed now, because I am wholly opposed to it . view when I spoke of advancing the B i l i to the second-reading stage, which I suggest is the proper one at which to debate the B ill as a whole, leaving the details to be discussed on the schedule. This tax is proposed as part of the new taxation which is rendered necessary by the in creasing bills for interest on war loans, war pensions, and repatriation. reason of the Government for introducing this and the Postal Rates Bill early is that the tax and new rates cannot be collected until the Bills are passed, and the earlier we get the measures through the larger will be the harvest for the financial year. Other Bills, such as the Land TaxB ill and the Income TaxB ill , may be passed at greater leisure, because they operate retrospectively for the whole financial year; but I ask due celerity in the consideration of the Postal RatesB ill and the B ill now before, us, because the amount of revenue depends on how soon they are passed. Honourable members are aware of the conditions of taxation at present in regard to entertainments. Tickets at the price of 6d. and under are not liable to the tax, and tickets exceeding 6d., but not exceeding Is., pay I d . , and l £ d . for the first 6d. above I s . ; and so on with a | d . increase for every 6d. The proprietors of the establishments who sell these tickets, in variably, I understand, pass the tax on to the purchasers of the tickets. I gave certain figures in the Budget speech showing that the number of amusements is increasing, the taxable entertainments for 1917-18 being 2 per cent, more than in the previous year, 1916-17. In 1917-18 this tax yielded a revenue of £245,890, but in the present-year, without allowing for the increased rate, it is expected that the return would be only £205,000. The' taxation officers estimate ' that this decrease will be due to ths curtailment of horse-racing and entertainments at stadiums generally. U p to the present, as I have explained, 3d. and 6d. admission tickets have not been taxed, arid the effect of the motion, and the B ill which will be based on it , is that all admissions up to, and inclusive of, 6d., w ill henceforth pay a tax of I d .

To-day wealth is being accumulated by the few in Australia at a much greater rate than at any period in our history. Those who have taken an interest in matters of taxation know that the time to tax a community is when it is wealthy, and not when the war is over, and when loan moneys cease to be expended, and hundreds of thousands of people who are receiving payments from the Defence Department, the Navy Department, and other Departments which are furnishing the necessities for the war will cease to draw that money which now enables them to contribute something towards the cost of the war.

146,Mr Boyd,"W h y talk such ""tripe""?honourable members opposite have suggested that there should be an increase of 33^ per cent, on the more expensive theatre tickets. The charges for admission to our theatres to-day are f a i r l y high. If a young fellow in ordinary circumstances proposes to take his best g i r l to the theatre, will he take her up in the gallery, where he can secure a seat for Is.? with him. into the reserved stalls, where he has to pay 7s. 6d. for a seat on a Saturday night, and 63. on other evenings. To increase this tax proportionately on the higherpriced tickets would be to impose an undue burden""=on such men. An increase of 33$ per cent, on the higher-priced -theatre tickets would press more heavily than would such an increase upon tickets of admission to a concert given, say, by Madame Melba, for which a man would pay a guinea each. The taxation of 3d. tickets will injure no one. A man who can afford to give his child 3d. for a picture-show ticket can just as well afford to pay 4d. for that ticket. If , as the result of this taxation, it should be necessary for -a man to deny himself something, then let him follow the advice so often given by the honourable member for Brisbane( Mr Finlayson), and take a glass of beer less per week. member say it would be as easy for a man with six children to find 4d. for each of them to go to a picture show as it is for him to provide each of them with 3d. ? dren if they went one night a week less to the picturo shows? The income tax has gone up to 8s. I d . in the £ 1 , and there is a prospect of a further increase in the future. Taxation is to be in creased to raise an additional £6,000,000 next year; and as our interest bil l on the £80,000,000 that we' are borrowing each year goes up, further taxation must be imposed on the incomes of the people, whether they be derived from personal exertion or from property. In view of all these circumstances, »urely it is not unfair to say that those who patronize picture shows and othei forms of entertainment shall contribute something to the revenue of this country, which is today more prosperous tban it has ever been. can be no doubt that additional revenue must be raised by the Government, b u t my experience is that honourable membersare always prepared to "" tax the other fellow."" I do not object so strongly to the tax on 6d. tickets, but I certainly think it is unfair to impose a tax on the 3d. tickets sold to children. When I was a youngster, I had to work very hard. I had no chance for recreation or sport of any kind. member is having so much of it now. increasing relish for . sport. In this respect, I am like a poddy calf, which ispractically starved unti l it gets strong enough to b u t t its owner over, so that it may put its head into the bucket and obtain for itself the milk it requires. When I was young, I was very much in* the position of the poddy calf, and as soon* as I got my nose into the bucket I kept it there. I thank the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Sampson) for his cheap sneer as to the claim of the Opposition side of the House that they represent the working classes. The hardest taskmaster* I have ever met are those who have themselves sprung from the working classes. No wonder the honourable member forget* the workers to-day, since he sprang from a working-class father and mother. Bethe honourable cause lie wants no pleasure for himself, he proposes to deprive other people's youngsters of a little cheap amusement. I agree with him, however, that soma films are not fit to be seen by adults, let alone children. If a man is receiving £ 3 per week-ther e are many in Australia who receive less-and has a number of children to support, it is difficult for h i m to provide much in the way of pictureshow money for his little ones. It is a curious fact that the poorer a man is, and the harder he has to work, the larger is his family. I wonder how the honourable member for Grampians ( Mr Jowetty would have managed if he had had to rear his family on the same amount of money that I had. Every sixpence that I and my wife earned between us had to be turned over half-a-dozen times before wa could decide how it should be spent.

The proposal of the honourable member for Capricornia was that the 6d. tickets should pay a penny, and that the 3d. tickets should pay £d., but, as we know, under the present Act, these two classes of tickets are in no way affected. There is no doubt that in the future money will have to be found to a very much greater extent than up to the present. Thank God, the newsboards today tell us that one more of the enemy has made submission, and I think we can fairly see the beginning of the end. However, if the war ceased to-morrow, I believe that, before we have cleaned up all its horrors and effects, the war debt of Australia will be somewhere about £300,000,000, which, at 5 per cent.,-means an interest bill of some £15,000,000 per annum. Not only will the capital wealth and income of Australia have to be taxed, but I am afraid that we may have to tax even the necessities of tlie people. 1 children shall not wear boots! to pay our way-and we are-ther e is no country niore fitted than Australia to do so. right quarter. shall get it in the right quarter; the debt is extremely large, and the mesh of the net will have to he much smaller than hitherto. When drastic taxation is necessary it is better to tax the luxuries, sports, and amusements of the people rather than their necessities. The Acting Prime Minister( Mr Watt) has -given some figures relating to similar taxation in England. The taxation that has been put on wealth in the Old Country has surprised the whole world. The income tax, the land tax, and all direct taxation there, is excessively heavy; in the case of amusement it is :-The 2-|d. ticket pays a tax of id., a 4d. ticket pays Id., .a. 7d. ticket pays 2d., a Is. ticket pays 3d., a 2s. ticket pays 4d., and so it goes on, until the 10s. 6d. ticket pays Is. 6d. Will any honourable member say that the people of Australia are not in a better position to pay such taxation than' are the people of England to-day? in England the taxation rises gradually on the higher-priced tickets, which is not 1)1x6 C3.SG llGrG and I hope that before the Bill is through Committee we shall have placed more taxation on the higher-priced tickets. by the Acting Prime Minister. what the Acting Prime Minister suggests; if we tax the 3d. ticket of the child, there ought to be a higher tax on the higherpriced tickets. An appeal has been put in for"" football teams, but both onlookers and players ought to be quite satisfied to pay something for the men who are fighting at the Front on their behalf. The suggestion made by the honourable member for Maranoa( Mr Page) is a practical one, and I hope it will be seriously considered. Nobody wants to tax the afternoon amusements of the "" kiddies.""

What the Government lose on the 3d. tickets we can easily make up by increased taxation on the higher-priced tickets; indeed, we can more than make up any loss sustained in this way. Will any one say that the howling throngs at the stadiums, where people are boxing who ought to be boxing somebody else in another part of the world, ought not to be made to pay a fair amount for their amusement? I am not here to suggest what people ought to do, but I cannot think it is altogether an advantage to the community for young children to attend picture shows in the evening.

As we have appointed censors for that very work, I cannot see what is to hinder them from insuring that the matinee pictures shall be of a better class than many which have been shown lately. My objection to the Government's proposal is that it taxes the mother in the home, where every penny of expenditure must be studied. If a mother has three or four children, ranging in age from -three to ten or twelve years, they will all desire to go to a picture show, and the mother who can refuse them is Tare. But I know that the tax they are paying for tickets for children, evenunder present -circumstances, strains the monetaryresources of the home, and to add even Id. to the 3d. tickets of the children is a big -consideration to a mother who already -spends many an anxious evening trying to make ends meet. -question that, though wages are high, it is a hard struggle for the thrifty mother -of a family to keep out of debt.

I do net think that there is any person in the community who is -hit so hard to-day by taxation as is the mother of a family, and I feel sure that no honourable member wishes to increase her burden, if it can possibly be avoided.

I regret that I cannot support the suggestion of the honourable member for Maranoa, because I agree with the honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr Nicholls) that, whilst the exemption of matinee tickets may be beneficial in the cities, it will be of no benefit in a mining town like Broken Hill, where, especially since the 6 o'clock closing of public houses, families simply flock to the picture shows in the evening. The mines work three shifts, and women, who must attend to the requirements of their husbands, or, perhaps, a few boarders, have no opportunity of taking children to picture shows in the afternoon. family generally takes charge at the picture show. some cases, but if tlie honourable member has attended many picture shows at night he must have seen that nobody in particular was in charge of the majority of There can be no the children. The proposal of the honourable member for Maranoa will be of no advantage to the people in mining and country towns.

I regard this as a serious matter, inasmuch as it affects one of the forms of amusement mostly patronised by the great bulk of the people who under the present circumstances To-day wages are nominally large, but those who are receiving them have very little left the baker, and the grocer. Now the Government propose, that the householder shall be further penalized through his children's amusement. Honourable members know that the mother of a family would deny herslf almost anything rather than prevent her children from getting some cheap recreation.

243,Mr Mathews (Melbourne Ports),"There can be no doubt that honourable members of the Opposition represent the poorer section of the community, while the Government and their supporters represent the plutocrats. This is not only a brutal, but a contemptible increase of taxation, and many of those who have discussed it appear to have not the slightest conception of tihe position of the workers to-day. We are here to get the best that we can out of the world, as well as to give to it the best that is in us; and I hold that the child of a working man has as much right to recreation, amusement, and luxury as has the child of the wealthiest man in the country. Like ""the honourable member for H in dmarsh ( Mr Archibald), I represent a division where there are far more children than in any of the more Conservative electorates of the Commonwealth. There are in my constituency dozens of families of eight and nine children, not one of whom is over fourteen years of age, and tbe fathers of the<=e families are earning an average of about £ 2 5s. per week. they employed at? These men cannot afford to pay for highpriced amusement tickets. While some honourable members shows, I regard them as having a high educational value. When I get a night off I always go to a picture show. able member prefera Charlie Chaplin film? I do not go. We are told that the morals of the children are sapped by what they see at picture shows.

It is an amusement to many women to show other women at church that they have better hats than their neighbours. Chanter) I think that is beside the question, ruling, sir, but I remind you that the amusement of the workers' children is being attacked and condemned. I knew a g i r l once, and her idea of amusement was to go to the cemetery and read the poetry on the tombstones. WhatI am trying to show is that the main or only amusement of the workers' children should not be attacked. In my opinion, these picture shows do not have the bad effect on the children that some honourable members would make us' believe. There is a section of our community whom nothing can amuse-wh o are blind and deaf to any for m of amusement-and because of this they would prevent other men's children from obtaining healthy entertainment. It is a damned pity we cannot tax that crowd What are -that is MI have to say about it ! member must not use expressions of that kind. condemn picture of poor fathers, who earn a very small wage, ought not to be deprived of this means of entertainment.

To them the picture theatre represents the main, if not the only, for m of amusement, and, in my opinion, instead of being restricted, the picture shows ought to be extended. In deed, if we were civilized, there would be a gymnasium in every locality, where T h a t is what I am the children of the workers could build themselves up.

At times like the present, we must he ready to concede a great deal; but in this case we are .being asked too much I have not forgotten what I d . meant to me when I was a youngster, although I was one of a small family. In the poorer communities the picture show provides tbe children with their chief amusement. It has not been, and I think cannot be, shown thai, the Government has drawn upon other avenues of taxation to an extent which justifies this tax. Some honoraMe members'have pointed out that there is not a tax on tea. I venture to say that a tax on tea would not be so burdensome as a tax on 3d. tickets would be to poor persons with large families. To my mind, the proposed tax is grossly unfair. A man with a family of four, if he went to the pictures weekly, would have to pay a tax of 4d. on the children's tickets, and 2d. on his own and his wife's tickets, whereas his next-door, neighbour, with, perhaps, only one child, or no children at all, would escape much more lightly. It is impossible to avoid the imputation that this is a tax on children, and I am not prepared to give a vote to increase the difficulty of those who are trying to bring up children decently. On the contrary, we should do all that we can to lighten their burden, and the Commonwealth and State Governments will have to give attention to this matter of devis25 per cent. ing means for encouraging our people to take upon their shoulders. the burdens of parentage. such a time as this, when the need of population is accentuated by the war, a proposal such as that under discussion should be made by the National Government.

A great number of those who are at the Front have reserves are being put aside shows that left behind them wive3 aud families. Their children are without their father's company in the home, and at night many a mother finds it convenient to take her offspring to the picture show for amusement. Why should we specially tax those who have allowed their home life to be broken up in the interests of the country? It is unfair to put a tax on the amusements of the children. I represent a large metropolitan constituency, and I know that the numerous picture shows in my district are well patronized by children on Saturday afternoons and during the summer evenings. Yet it is proposed to tax the children's admission tickets at the Tate of 33$ per cent. 3d. for admission to a night show? could get the revenue that it needs from some other source. There is no statesmanship about the present proposal. The public has not asked for this taxation; and when it was last proposed, a majority voted against it. I have here a list of firms which, since the war, have increased their reserves enormously. For instance, the reserve funds of Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Company were increased last year from £294,817 to £498,530. their excess profits. in Great Britain. take all but 20 per cent; we take all but But the trade of some British concerns is enormous.

Those people, when they realize that the interest bill will have to be paid, will recognise that a scheme which promises to earn annually millions of pounds for the revenue, and to place war bonds into the hands of hundreds of thousands of people, who will thus be given a strong interest in maintaining the stability of the country's finances, if for no higher motive than self-interest, is one that they cannot afford to neglect. Many people who hitherto were strongly prejudiced on this matter have thawed considerably, and, to my certain knowledge, now admit that they can see no. moral objection to the proposal. I hope that the Treasurer, instead of, as the Bulletin says, "" putting everything on the k i d , "" will see that the chap who selfishly takes advantage of the high rate of wages, but refuses to marry, though willing to speculate, is made to pay his share. benefit only the single man, because, as the honourable member for Calare( Mr Pigott) has shown, whilst wages have risen, the cost of living has increased, and that increase is borne by the married man only.

I have always fought for taxpayers with families. They pay heavy taxation, and their expenses have been greatly increased since the outbreak of war. Most honourable members on the Opopsition side use as the spear-point of their argument the fact that the children of the soldiers will have to pay the tax. As honourable members on both sides seem to think that tbe children of soldiers should not be taxed, I ask the Treasurer to exempt them, and also the children of married nurses who are serving with our Forces.. -An accepted principle in regard to taxation is that it should always be imposed on people best able to bear it, and aa the proposal of the Government is to tax lower-priced tickets, which are undoubtedly those mostly used by the working classes of the community, means placing taxation on those least, able to bear it, I am deterred from giving it my support. membeT would strongly support a bachelor tax? m is brought forward accepting the principle which I have laid down, I promise to give it my support. This is the third occasion on which an entertainments tax has been before the Chamber. I opposed the proposal of the 'honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Higgs) to impose a tax upon 6d. tickets. I opposed the proposal of the honourable member for Grey( Mr man in the community who cannot pass Poynton) to tax 3d. tickets as well as 6d. tickets, and my regret was that even Is. tickets were not exempted; but how. that a tax is imposed on Is. tickets, I am prepared to allow it to stand, though my objection still holds good in regard to 3d. and 6d. tickets. Although the major portion of the expenditure on small-priced tickets is in connection with picture shows, this proposed tax will affect an enormous number of socials which are run by small societies, not for the purpose of making a profit or even to gain some particular advantage for the institutions which hold them, but purely for the sake of encouraging a social feeling among members of the societies. The tickets are sold at a nominal figure merely to cover actual expenses. The gatherings are not profit-making concerns, but are fulfilling a useful function in the community, particularly in these times when we need all the fraternal feeling engendered it is possible to get. This tax will press very unfairly, not only on the children, but on their parents. It will not be paid by the children. It must he paid by the parents. The fathers and mothers will pay not only the tax on the children's tickets, but also the tax on their own tickets; and if, through unfortunate circumstances, parents should be unable to pay | O the tax imposed on the children's tickets, then they will be equally unable to pay the tax on their own tickets. Compare this proposed tax with the taxation on the higher-priced tickets. I do not attend theatres very often, and I cannot speak with any authority on the matter, but I have not noticed that the higher-priced seats have been less patronized since the imposition of this form of taxation. It does not seem to have made tbe slightest difference to the attendances in the stalls, dress circle, and boxes. The the honourable men who are to be seen in the higherpriced seats in the theatres mostly follow some commercial or .professional pursuit, and consequently they are in a position to recoup themselves for the extra tax they have to pay, because they can pass it on to their customers or clients. As a matter of fact, they look upon the purchase of theatre tickets as part of their regular expenditure in their affairs, and consequently they collect it from their customers. From whom can the working man collect the tax? He is the only it on. He must either pay the tax or do without entertainment. The argument which the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Richard Foster) has applied to the workers-that if they cannot afford to pay this tax they can stay at homeshould also be made to apply to the man who pays higher prices for seats in the theatre.

311,Mr Fin,"LAYSOW -If a bachelor taxworker3 of this particular tax, I am prepared to give him my support in an endeavour to secure the necessary revenue by increasing the tax payable on the higher-priced tickets. By doing this, we would not be laying ourselves open to the charge that we are putting an increased tax on the poorer people out of proportion to the tax which those people who are better able to bear it have to pay. Sitting suspended from 6.S0 to 7 -45 p.m. cumstances I contend that the healthy amusements of the people are not fit subject for taxation. It is an entirely wrong principle to select the recreations of the people as a means of revenue. It is accepted that relaxation from ordinary toil is necessary. The Arbitration Court, in fact, has established the principle, and, in estimating the cost of living, it has taken into consideration such items as'recreation. bread alone. water. him, too! ber think picture shows are healthful? ment is just as important as ordinary physical recreation may be. There may be education of a character which is healthful, and also that which is neither healthful physically, morally, nor mentally. When I say that ordinarily the recreations of the people should not be a source of revenue I am immediately confronted with the fact that these are not ordinary circumstances. Rightly or wrongly, we have now decided that people who can afford to have amusements in time of war can afford to pay the tax; and, if they desire to evade paying, it is competent for them to forswear the luxury of amusements. It is a sound principle in time of war to confine taxation as much as possible to luxuries.' It is when we tax the necessities of life that the pinch is felt. In time of war we can dispense with a number of things which, otherwise, would be looked upon as perfectly legitimate, so far as our means of entertainment are concerned. It has been suggested that one satisfactory result of the imposition of this tax, especially upon the 6d. ticket, will be that it will hit a large number of people who patronize cricket and football matches. If it is intended to impose additional burdens upon such people, this is rather an unsatisfactory method. Persons who pay 6d. to see a football match will not be deterred by having to pay an extra penny. If it is desired to make it uncomfortable for them to go to football matches there are other than financial ways of getting at them. The fact is, this is purely a revenue-producing proposal, and, from that point of view, may have its advantages; but, in securing revenue from those who can afford it, we not only penalize them, but a number of other people who have not equal opportunities of recreation. It must be recognised that the people from whom the Government are to draw this revenue are the people who can least afford to pay any increased taxation at present. We cannot be oblivious of the fact that the working classes are staggering under heavy financial burdens. They are carrying a load which, under ordinary circumstances, they should not and would not be expected to shoulder. We are proving every day that it is the working class that pays th© expenses of a war, and gets the least advantage from a war, whether the nation concerned wins or loses. It is notorious that th© only people in the country to-day who ar© making money, and whose incomes have advanced, are the people who can afford to pay for their seats at a theatre up to 10s. and one guinea. The same argument does not apply, even proportionately, to the people who can afford to do no more than attend a picture show. cordance with fact. ordinary observation and intelligence. If it is revenue the Government require, there are people in the community who can afford to contribute that revenue, and who can do without their entertainments if they wish to evade paying this tax. Those are the people who pay 4s., 5s., 10s., and even up to 20s. for a seat. tax 33 per cent, all round?",51,Chairman Hon J M The Treasurer Proceeding On His Way I

The compulsory measure in respect to the purchase of war loan bonds will make distinctions. tax. ment applies to all taxes. If the honourable member desires to live like a wild man in the bush, he need pay no taxes; but we have to recognise that the people desire to live as human beings in a social community, and that they are entitled to such recreations as they are able to pay for. And their ability to pay for relaxation should not be determined by those who can afford to pay big prices for their amusements. They are not in the position to understand what is a reasonable thing for the people who cannot afford to buy costly seats at a show. We cannot have equality all round unless there is equality of circumstances, demanding a proportionate equality of sacrifice. There ar© enormous numbers of people who are "" hard u p , "" compared with such gentlemen as the honourable member for Grampians ( Mr Jowett). The whole method of taxation, if equitable, must be based on the recognition of the principle that those who can afford to pay should pay, and that those who cannot afford to pay should not be asked to pay. The people who are to be asked to pay this tax are already carrying the burden of the community in unreasonable proportion. The people who cannot afford to pay it have, in the ordinary course of l if e, to count every penny; and now they must either accept an additional burden or give up relaxative amusement. gument there should be free picture shows, free circuses, and free publichouses. nising the fact now that the country should provide healthy amusements for the people wrong with the public-bouses. It is only I am prepared to the stuff they sell. Taking the broadest view to-day, this tax is going to h it people who cannot afford to pay it , and the people who can afford to pay it are not going to be penalized at all. Among people who have anything to do with the working community, it is recognised that there are two nights in the week, particularly, when mother, father, and the children go to the picture No man need pay it . theatre. In many working centres the The same arguweekly pay-day falls upon a Friday. Sometimes the pay is on a Friday night, and then the picture show is patronized on the Saturday night. But, surely, the National Parliament can engage in more important duties in regard to taxation proposals than in trying to penalize the children. Many honourable members in their juvenile days had few opportunities for amusement. Some of us as children had little; if any, pocket money, but, like the honourable member for Maranoa( Mr Page), as one who as a youngster did not enjoy these privileges, I do not wish to deny to those who follow us that amusement and recreation which are part and parcel of the life of the rising generation. Without the opportunities for recreation and amusement which they have enjoyed, our soldiers would not have acquitted themselves as they have done. I have never seen an objectionable film exhibited in any picture show that I have attended in this or other States.

There are thousands of homes in Australia where at the week end the husband hands over to his wife his week's wages, less a day's pay, which he has lost, perhaps, through sickness. The loss of that one day's pay means that there is no picture show for the children that week. Even when the f u l l wage is brought home, if one of the boys wants a pair of boots No one has or a pair of knickers, that extra demand upon the family purse means that the children have to be deprived of their righ t to a little amusement. When this is the position in thousands of homes in Australia to-day, why do honourable members opposite persist in overloading with taxation the workers, who have such a hard Economists all tbe Lloyd George imposed a similar tax on much poorer people? top crowd as heavily as he has done, it will be all right. Treasurer, who is usually strong in argument, advanced this afternoon a paltry reason for the imposition of this tax. He to impose any additional told us that the people would have to this year.

It has been insinuated that honourable members upon this side of the chamber are opposing the Bill for electioneering purposes. can. lie against me. I emphatically protest against tlie children of the poor of the community being taxed 33$ per cent, upon their 3d. tickets for admission to picture shows, whilst the rich landholders are allowed to escape with a tax of only 20 per cent. This proposal is absolutely an infamous one. try will not be taxed 33$ per cent, upon their picture show tickets. anxious that no tax should be levied upon the 6d. tickets. I believe that' that would be quite fair. But it is obviously unjust that the children of the poorer section of the community shall be required to pay a tax of 33$ per cent., whilst the wealthy landholders, who are piling up their millions at the expense of the people, are allowed to escape with an impost of 20 per cent. Wide Bay said that this is voluntary taxation, inasmuch as no person need attend a picture show. In reply, may I be permitted to remind him that no person need own land. To my mind, the speech delivered by the honourable member for Ballarat was the most effective criticism that has been launched against this proposal. While thousands of our fellowcountrymen are fighting at the Eront, and freely making the supreme sacrifice, the children whom they have left behind are about to be taxed, to the extent of 33$ per cent., upon the little entertainment which they can get at the picture shows. Hitherto South Australia and Tasmania have imposed no tax upon 3d. picture show tickets, but when the Commonwealth taxes those tickets I have no doubt that -the States in question will follow its example in oppressing the poor. The proposal embodied in this Bill is estiurday night. Under this Bill these permated to yield £275,000 per annum. That amount is to be wrung out of the people who patronize the very cheapest form of amusement obtainable in this country. What has been the action of picture show proprietors in our midst? Everybody knows that they have freely advertised our war loans, and have also made constant appeals for recruits, without any payment whatever. Night after night these appeals are thrown on the screens. Contrast their conduct with that of the patriotic newspapers, which charge No such charge up to 25s. per inch for advertisements relating to the same subjects. Yet the patrons of our picture theatres are to be penalized by this unfair and discriminating tax. The Government are after the widow's mite. The honourable member for Perth said that Ministers had found themselves in a difficulty at the end of the year, and consequently had to resort to further taxation in this direction. May I suggest, that the poorer classes of this community find themselves in a difficulty to make ends meet soon after each payday? Cotton, for example, has increased in price from 3d. to 7$d. or 8d. per reel since the outbreak of the war. The cost of every household requirement has increased, so that poor people are at their wits' end to know how to live. Yet the Government are now attempting to rob them by imposing an additional tax of 33$ per cent, upon their amusements,in order to prevent the taxation of those who The honourable member for are making millions sterling out of the war. I protest against this Bill on the ground that it is unjust to apply such taxation only to the poor people of this country. It cannot be denied that the 3d. and 6d. patrons of our picture shows comprise the very poorest classes of tbe community. These are the people who, owing to the war, have been put to sore straits to provide themselves Avith the necessaries of life. The purchasing power of the sovereign has decreased by 30 per cent, or 40 per cent., and in such circumstances are we justified in levying this tax upon the very poorest section of the people? There are many soldiers' widows who have been left with families whose only amusement consists of a visit to a picture show on Satsons will be taxed to the extent of 7d. per week. It has been urged that in country districts there are very few persons who purchase 3d. tickets. But throughout my own district the number",57,Pairs

379,Mr Charlton (Newcastle) [8.52],"is exceedingly large. I could quite understand a proposal to tax people who are in affluent circumstances, but a proposal to tax the amusements of the poorest section in our midst is quite a different matter. In their desire to obtain revenue, the Government are going to levy an impost upon people who cannot even get the necessaries of life . pire that condition obtains. but that fact is no justification for this Parliament loading those who are least able to bear taxation with more than their fair share, especially in a country like Australia, which is richer than is any other part of the world. able member for Wide Bay w ill direct his attention to the rich profiteers of this country, he w ill be rendering the State better service. tion asked why it is proposed to increase our land tax and our income tax. own opinion is that the income tax should be made to pay the entire cost of the war to Australia. sons who are paying income tax are better off than they ever were before, because they have been able to make inordinate profits by reason of the increases which have taken place in the price of the necessaries of life. justify the taxation proposed in this B ill .

That is grossly unfair. A trifling addition to our income tax would yield the £275,000 which the Treasurer estimates he w ill obtain from the taxation of these tickets. If the cost of living had not been allowed to increase so materially since the outbreak of war, the same objection might not be urged against the B ill . But during that period the cost of living has risen by 40 per cent. What is the position of a soldier's wife whose husband is fighting for our liberties today? She is not receiving a larger amount than she did formerly. The soldier is being paid only 5s. per day apart from his deferred pay of Is. per day. Let a soldier be as careful as he likes, fie must have at least Is., and should have 2s., a day to spend. Notwithstanding the increase in the cost of living, we have If the honornot increased the pay of our soldiers or the allowances of their dependants.

Our men have shown their loyalty to the country, to the Empire, and to the Allies by risking everything in their defence, so that we may remain bere in security, yet we do not hesitate to pile taxation on I repeat that nobody can the dear ones whom they have left behind. Parliament should be above taxing the 3d. ticket which gives the child admission to a picture show.

How can we expect the manhood of this country to respond to appeals to patriotism when those who have gone to fight find that in their absence we are overloading their loved ones w i th taxation. content So many things have been done since the war commenced which are prejudicial to the interests of the men who are serving with the colours that there is a great reaction against recruiting. No one is more anxious than I am to obtain recruits, but I know that we have done many things which have told against recruiting. I get many letters from mothers containing complaints in regard to separation allowances administration, and I know what their feelings will be when they find that it will cost them 6d. or 7d. a time more to send their children to a picture show. In many cases the tax will prevent the children of such mothers from going to the pictures. There are many other sources of taxation of which the Government has not availed itself. If there were not, it would be a bad thing for us. The Acting Prime Minister( Mr Watt) has told us that each year we must be prepared for additional taxation. If there were no other source of revenue than the taxation of picture theatre tickets, our position would be a bad one. As a matter of fact, there is much wealth yet untaxed. The wealthy should have contributed more towards the cost of the war from the very beginning, and the Government should have borrowed less. Those who have benefited by the increase in prices should contribute more towards the expenses of the war. In all countries there are persons who benefit by a war. We hear about price fixing, but in my district the fixing of the prices of meat has made that article of food 2d. per l b . dearer. The poor have little for which to thank this Parliament. Instead of assisting the poor, we assist the rich. Those who are rearing cattle, or growing wheat and wool, are doing well; but instead of requiring them to find the money necessary for the war, we tax the poor to get it . It is proposed to increase the income tax by only 30 per cent., and to put a tax of 33$ per cent, on picture-theatre tickets. In New South ""VVales earn before the war; but the position of the poor grows persistently worse, and will continue to do so while the war lasts, because the purchasing power of money is diminishing. Sooner or later, we shall be forced to give consideration to the claims of those who are not well off. It is surprising to me that there should It will create discontent. be a majority in favour of taxing 3d. and to increasing the taxation of higher-priced tickets; but 3d. and 6d. tickets should be exempt from taxation. ' Legislation of the kind proposed will injure the Government in the eyes of the people. I shall strenuously oppose the B ill , and in Committee will test the feeling of honourable members in regard to its various provisions, so that there may be a record of the names of those who vote for the taxing of 3d. and 6d. tickets. the first time since I entered the House that I have heard the Opposition in f u l l blast on their particular electioneering stunt. We have heard to-night, ad nauseam, their expressions of sympathy with the poor children, of the widow, and of the soldiers' dependants whom this tax will prevent from going to the picture theatres. I could not help wondering what the children did years ago, when there were no picture shows. How was it that honourable gentlemen opposite managed to grow up so happy and prosperous, with a childhood in which picture shows were unknown. L e t us go into figures a little to study the effect of the Government proposal. It is estimated that a tax on 3d. and 6d. admission tickets w ill yield £275,000. That means that £1,500,000 is paid for admission on 3d. and 6d. tickets. There are in Australia about 1,000,000 children between the ages of four and sixteen. If the proposed tax will fall wholly upon the children, each child between those ages must visit a picture show 100 times a year, or twice a week. We know that many thousands of children do not go to the pictures twice a year. Therefore, to make up the average, we must assume either that the children in the big cities go to the picture theatres about five times a week, or that the tax falls not wholly upon cbildren, but largely upon adults.",59,Pairs

I have some children who are rather inclined to be picture fiends. If they go to a picture show more than once a week they are unfitted for school the next day,and completely unfitted for the training they ought to have. If this tax does nothing else .than restrain some of the younger children from going to picture shows four or five times a week it will do good work for Australia. I have shown by a few figures that, after all, children will not be deprived of tiie little pleasure of going to a picture show. Picture shows are not an absolute necessity, although I grant they give great pleasure. We are all anxious to give the children pleasure, but the children of ten years ago did not have this particular form of it , and they grew up just as good men and women as the present ones will. There is, therefore, not such a lar^e amount of reason in the argument the Opposition have put up with such fervour. I think they believe it , but they did non have exact figures, and the figures I have ing at decent people. given them will show them that there if not quite so much in their argument as they thought. In dealing with this question the workers' share in 'this war must be taken into consideration.

439,Mr Boyd,"W ill the honourable gentle*the Cabinet consisted of Ministers who had been Ministers for the Navy during the period covered by the Royal Commission m their report? Ministers, two of whom had been Ministers for Defence during the period covered by the report. I have just been informed fey the Secretary to the Prime Minister's Department that he has received a cable to say that Sir Joseph Cook concurs in the decisions of the Government. When we are asked to vote such a large sum of money as is' covered by the proposed SupplyB ill we should be given some information as to how the moneys we are asked to vote are to be expended. If , for instance, we take the Works and Railways Department, we do not know what is being done by that Department. A lump sum will be voted for works at the Federal Capital site, and we do not know how the money is to be expended. The other day I asked the Minister responsible what tbe officers of a particular staff were doing, and I was told that they were "" w o r k in g out details."" What details ? We do not know. It has been the practice in this House all along to vote lump sums for various works, and Parliament has no control whatever over the expenditure. I do not know how many staffs there are in the Works and Railwavs Department. Colonel Owen has a staff, Mr Bell has a staff, Mr Griffin has another staff, and, I believe, the Defence Department has a further staff engaged in connection with works. We do not know how the money is being expended. know. lump sum is put. down for works at the Federal Capital. There is, I believe, a big staff employed there, but what are they doing, and what are the other departmental staffs doing?

I say that the Departments are overstaffed, and no economy is being practised in them. find, acording to the Budget papers or the Estimates, that a little time ago a gentleman was appointed to advise the Government in regard to matters in Canberra. During my term in office, I found that a gentleman, at a charge of £7 7s. a day and expenses, was giving advice to the Government which should have been given by the foreman of works at CanI t consisted of three berra, if he was properly qualified for his position. I should like to know whether it is the same gentleman who is giving advice to the Government now. able gentleman refer ? to tell the Acting Prime Minister privately. I do not wish ""to mention any names here; but I speak by the card and what I am saying is absolutely correct. I am sure that honourable members generally desire to know how the money they vote is to be expended. The Government should"" treat honourable members with more respect, and give them some information in connection with a SupplyB ill . They cannot make the excuse that they did not know that a SupplyB ill would be necessary, because they have known that it would be i m possible to carry on without passing a SupplyB ill . Why should we be asked to vote £4,500,000 without being informed concerning a single item of expenditure? One would think that the Government were spending their own money. No one would believe that any' Government would ask a National Parliament to vote £4,500,000 without knowing what the money was to be expended for. I intend to agitate for some information before I give my vote for further expenditure in connection with the government of the country. I quite understand that the want to public officers' salaries have to be paid, but we do not know whether increases in those salaries are proposed. We saw, in connection with the famous report on the Navy Department, that a claim was 'made upon the Department for something like £30,000, and a member of the Ministry compromised by paying £25,000. We should know who made the claim, what was the basis of it , and why a member of the Government agreed to pay £25,000 of t h e amount claimed. We know that in connection with the Defence Department there has been exI penditure which will not bear the light of day.

The departmental reply to my represenpartment informed me thatIt has been clearly pointed out that it is immaterial where the accommodation is built provided it meets the full requirements for military patients, and the State or other authority is prepared to take over the buildings That does not meet one point put by me to the Department.
