The right honourable gentleman will see that a large block of Molotov appears on the front page, and printed on the inside pages in the English section are a special article on the annivorsary of the Young Communist League of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, numerous references to, the Greek Communist party and a cartoon depicting the United States of America as a warmonger.

Mrs. BLACKBURN-When the Government gives its attention to increasing social service benefits, which I presume it will do when preparing the Estimates of Expenditure for the next financial year, will the Treasurer take into special consideration the claims of pensioners who are either too aged or too feeble to earn anything to supplement theii pensions and those invalid pensioners who, by It is reason of total incapacity, are prevented from, supplementing their pension? Will the Government make a clear statement concerning the right of invalid pensioners to earn money, because at present there seems to be a conflict of opinion on that point? Will the Government consider making any increased payments operative from the 1st July next? by the honourable member has received consideration by the Government during the current financial year and in the aggregate very substantial increases have been made. However, I cannot promise that any special review of pensions will be made with a view to increasing payments. Certain minor aspects of the pensions scheme may be reviewed, as the Minister for Social Services has already indicated. The incidence of the means test on invalid pensioners has been considered by the Government on a number of occasions. In vestigation Has disclosed that 80 per cent, relaxation of the means test. Concerning the, remaining 20 per cent., proposals have been considered at various times that some kind of means test should be applied, to invalid persons who are in receipt of incomes-som a of them receive substantial",10,Special Adjournment

12,Mr Calwell,"The expenditure issigned on behalf of the Australian Government was that immigrants to this country under the displaced persons immigration scheme would be required to serve for at least twelve months in employment provided for them. The position was later rectified, and, for the great majority of the displaced persons already in Australia and for all displaced persons arriving in the future, the undertaking is for two years. from Mr Dickson, the Minister for Building Materials in the Government of New South Wales, in which he has advised me that the production of wire netting, galvanized iron, &c., doing everything it possibly can do to is primarily the responsibility of the Australian Government and that that Government, at the time when the States took over the distribution of controlled materials within the States, agreed to retain the responsibility for production and distribution among the various States. In view of that stateand to increase the production of thes? ment by Mr Dickson, will the Minister representing the Minister for Supply and Development say what action the Government has taken to increase the production of galvanized iron, roofing iron, steel posts and wire netting, of which there is an extreme shortage, and which are urgently needed by primary producers and housing authorities? by the honourable gentleman which he has attributed to a Minister -of the New South Wales Government, requires some qualification. At a referendum in 1944, this Government -asked for power over production, but, Unfortunately, it was not given that power. Therefore, it is incorrect to suggest that the Australian Government has any power over production. It is true that during the war and for some time after the cessation of hostilities, the Australian Government controlled, not the production of these materials, but the allocation of them among the States. In 1945 it was agreed that the Australian -Government should continue to allocate certain constructional materials, including wire netting, on a basis to be agreed upon by the States. The Government of New South Wales and all other State governments of the Commonwealth, were parties to that agreement. In the meantime, the power of the Commonwealth even to distribute these materials, let alone to control production of them, has waned owing to the fact that the war has now been over for a considerable time. Recently the Australian Government suggested to the State governments that, because the Commonwealth no longer hap authority under the defence power of thp Constitution to impose upon the manufacturers of these materials a certain form of distribution, the State governments should endeavour, in the near future, to make their arrangements with regard to them. The Australian Government itassist in increasing the production of these materials. The Minister for Immigration has offered to make available to the Government of New South Wale."" displaced persons for employment in certain industries. In that way it is hoped to break some of the bottlenecks materials in the near future.

Whai is the approximate rate payable? have reinsured their properties under the war service homes insurance scheme, but I cannot inform the honourable gentleman of the exact number that have done ao. The amounts that are paid by ex-servicemen under the scheme are paid into a trust fund or pool, from which claims 1 are paid. The approximate rate charged at present is 50 per cent, of that charged by tariff companies.

Minister's attention to a statement in to-day's Sydney Morning Herald alleged to have been made by Mr J. Healy, the general secretary of the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia, in which Mr Healy said that the federation had received no request from the Government to nominate two new members to the Stevedoring Industry Commission and that it had not been informed officially that its representatives on the commission, Messrs. Healy and Roach, wore to be removed from it. Has the Government requested the federation to nominate two new members to the commission and, if so, has receipt of the Government's acknowledged by the federation? Has the federation been informed officially that the appointments of Messrs. Healy and Roach as members of the commission have been cancelled? Is a statement which appeared in the same newspaper that the commission had given permission for a. stop-work meeting of members of the federation to be held next Wednesday in Sydney, correct, and, if so, under what authority was this permission given, work meeting mentioned in the newspaper as the commission would appear not to be an ordinary monthly stop-work be able to function when it is short of meeting ? two of its members? report referred to by the honourable memits sitting and functioning properly.

I presume that it is ready to be sent now or that it was sent yesterday by the Minister. The position as it stands should, I consider, be clearly understood now by the federation. Mr Healy clearly understood what the Government's intention was in respect of the commission, because he sent me a telegram protesting against the Government's action as it had been at that stage announced in the press, from which I assume he had his knowledge of it, unless, of course, he had been informed of the position by the Minister for Shipping and Fuel. I replied to Mr Healy's telegram, as I do to all telegrams, as a matter of courtesy, and informed him quite clearly that the reason for the action was that it was impossible for the commission to operate if its member? were not prepared to co-operate. There is much matter in the honourable member's question which can not be eommunioation been clearly answered at the moment I should say that the commission could not operate unless it were properly constituted, or in other words, unless its six members were available to sit on it.

On a number of occasions discussions have been held on a services level, and partly on a ministerial level, regarding the degree to which a Pacific pact might involve cooperation between the services. I believe that it has been generally understood that certain facilities at our disposal would always be available to the United States of America; and it is most probable, too, that certain services which the Americans might possess would be made available to us. At this stage I cannot go into all the details of the various discussions which have taken place from time to time. During the last month the Secretary of the Defence Department has been to the United States of America, where he has had discussions with representatives of the American Government, including the Secretary of State and other officials as the result of arrangements which I made. Those talks did not relate specifically to the possible, arrangefrom an urgent telegram which I have ment of any pact. The attitude of the United States of America since the conclusion of hostilities has been that it will not enter into any fixed agreement with respect to the Pacific but will devote its attention primarily to Europe and the rehabilitation of European countries, whilst matters associated with the Pacific might well await attention until the problems in Europe have been worked out. As soon as I can do so, I shall have a statement prepared on the matters raised by the honourable member. Mr ""WHITE -What about Hong Kong? lished in the press regarding Hong Kong, and, naturally, fears have arisen in the T5] minds of some people of a possible attack upon Hong Kong. I believe that some of the reports are greatly exaggerated. For instance, between 2,000 and 3,000 British subjects have refused to leave even Shanghai, and British subjects throughout the areas which have been overrun by the Communists in China have expressed their intention of remaining. They have indicated that they do not wish to be removed. The position is much the same in Nanking. The Russians were the only foreign nationals who wanted to get out of that city. Thus the position is rather complicated. The question of rendering assistance in respect of Hong Kong has not been raised. The Australian Government has agreed to a request by the United Kingdom Government to divert the liner, Georgic, temporarily from the immigration trade to carry about 2,000 dependants of British servicemen from London to Malaya. No request has been made with respect to the evacuation of British subjects from Hong Kong. gentleman considered sending Australia's new aircraft carrier to Hong Kong? those lines was made to me when I was recently in Great Britain. question to the Minister representing the Minister for Shipping and Fuel arising received from the chairman of the Gladstone Harbour Board dealing with shipping services at that port.

If Australia does not exploit this latent resource, it is certain that other countries will be interested in doing so. We already have some indications of this. The Government considers that the experience that will be gained in the operation of a shore station will prove valuable at a later stage, when, it is intended that whaling activities shall be expanded if the early results appear to justify such expansion. Preliminary inquiries are being made abroad in regard to modern whaling technique and the availability of suitable vessels, plant and machinery as well as expert personnel. It would be necessary to engage a proportion of skilled men from overseas, and it is considered that the types of men who would be selected would prove an asset to the country if they should decide to remain here with their families. The development of a whaling industry in the less populous spots on the Australian coast would be a progressive step in the Government's decentralization policy. It is proposed that the first station shall be erected on the Western Australian coast, but the most suitable spot has not been finally determined. It is expected that a moderately sized station with three chaser vessels should catch about 600 whales in a season. ""Humpback"" whales, which are protected in the Antarctic under the international Convention, are plentiful in Australian latitudes and can be taken there. Australia has been represented at several international whaling conferences and has subscribed to the International Whaling Convention of 1946. The first Mr Pollard. meeting of the International Whaling Commission arising from the 1946 convention will be held at London at the end of this month and the Director of Fisheries of the Department of Commerce and Agricralture will attend. The Government has introduced the bill because it believes that Australia should not delay any longer in entering the whaling industry. As I mentioned earlier, there has been no real attempt by private enterprise to develop this industry on a proper scale and the Government considers that the only sound and practical alternative is to establish it as a government enterprise with a relatively moderate beginning that will allow for such development in nearby waters or in the Antarctic as may appear justified from the early experiences. It is proposed to set up a small commission of three to establish and manage the industry, and it is intended that the chairman shall be the executive member of the commission on a full-time basi&.

44,Mr Lemm0n (Forrest,"Minister forAct 1013-1947, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for investigation and report, viz.:-Erection at Prospect, New South Wales, of a wool biology laboratory for the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization. The laboratory is required to provide specialized research facilities of a kind that are not available at present in Australia. The absence of such facilities precludes a commencement being made on a number of important new lines of investigation. The project will be undertaken in three stages, the first and second stages to be carried out by the Department of Works and Housing, and the final stage, comprising the supply and installation of specialized equipment, by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Eesearch Organization. The first stage envisages the construction of a feed store, two sheep houses, workshop and garage, and fleece and shearing building, whilst the second stage provides for the erection of the main laboratory, the boiler house, and examination and climate control building. A permanent type of construction is proposed having mainly brick walls, although in some instances, they will be of reinforced concrete, particularly dwarf walls and partitioning of the pens. Floors generally will be of reinforced concrete with some sections having timber flooring. The estimated costs as at October, 1948, were £99,500 for stage 1 and £224,900 for stage 2. These estimates do not provide for the cost of the work envisaged in stage 3, namely, the supply and installation of specialized equipment by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization. I lay on the table the plans of the proposal. Question resolved in the affirmative. Debate resumed from the 19th May course, we all know there have been some (vide page 118), on motion by Mr increases in prices and values, but, Thut the following paper be printed:Brief Review of Australia's Manufacturthe number of persons employed in manuing Economy in the Post-war Period. -The contents of this paper, which the rested. But the value of production is no Minister for Post-war Reconstruction index to output, although the figures ( Mr Dedman) presented to the House on certainly look good on paper. For that the 25th November, 1948, caused a revulsion of feeling in the minds of not only members of the Opposition, but also the general manufacturing community. The fact that the Government did not provide an opportunity for honourable members to debate this paper earlier than the ISth May, calls for comment. I have been wondering why the paper, which is so grossly misleading and of such a specious nature, was presented to the Parliament last November. However, I can well imagine the President of the General Assembly of the United Nations, Dr. Evatt, saying to the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction. "" One of the objectives of our Charter is full employment. Other countries will be interested to know how Australia is progressing under the present Government's policy of full employment. Can you prepare a paper for overseas consumption that is based, not on the real facts of our manufacturing industry, but on matters so closely allied to it that a good impression will he created abroad ?"" Probably for that reason this viciously misleading paper has been presented to the Parliament, and I have no doubt that copies of it have found their way to the International Labour Office and the United Nations, and have been used extensively by those organizations. Some of the contents of tlie paper are most deceptive. A typical extract of that nature is the following:The value of factory production in Australia during 1946-47 was an all-time record at £412.945,000-doubl e the figure for 1938-39. Due to increase in prices this comparison alone exaggerates the story, but, for the same years, the number of factories increased by 29 per rent, to 34,767. and persons employed in manufacturing increased by 42 per cent, to 803,698. The Minister for Post-war Reconstruction had to give some explanation of the qualified it by saying, in effect, "" Of briefly, the fact is that the number of factories has increased by 29 per cent, and facturing has increased by 42 per cent.""",19,Reference To Public Works Committee
45,"Mr Harbison (Wentworth) [11.20]. Upon That Statement, The Minister Has","reason, the Minister has quoted values instead of production. It is true that the ing figures relative to the situation have volume of factory production from 193339 to 1946-47 increased by approximately 43.3 per cent., but that figure does not disclose an increase of production per worker in our factories. The greater volume of production is due, not to an increase of production per head, but to an increase of the number of factory employees. Thus the position is entirely different from what the Minister would have us believe it to be. According to my information, factory production has increased by 43 per cent., but at the same time the number of factory employees has increased by 43 per cent. Therefore, the position is static. It is interesting to note that the Government states that the number of persons employed in manufacturing increased by 42 per cent, in the period 1938-39 to 1946-47. I have used the figure of 43 per cent, which, I undertion of those statistics there has been stand, is the correct one. The Government has preened its resulted in a further decline.

Honourable members will remember that the speech delivered by the Leader of the Opposition dealt particularly with this aspect of the matter. recreant to its trust, and if it believes at all in a policy of increased production, it should do something more than render mere lip service to that policy. It has done nothing whatever to encourage initiative under the system of free enterprise which has meant so much to Australia in the past, and which, incidentally, has been responsible for the development of industry, to which the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction paid such extravagant tribute in the document before us. If the unpleasant facts which I am now stressing had been publicized when this document was released six months ago, they would have created some real interest in the minds of people overseas and those for whose consumption the document was designed. Because the real facts of the situation have been withheld for a period of six months, it is exceedingly difficult to correct the false impressions which arise from the speciously misleading statements contained in this official document, and honourable members know how difficult it is to overtake a lie. Let us consider the Government's real policy concerning production. It stands convicted out of the mouths of its Ministers. I shall deal first with the statements of the Prime Minister, because 1. believe that we should deal first with the head of the Government. In reply to his repeated appeals for greater production, I suggest to him that it would be better for him to appeal not by mere words but to show by action what he proposes to do to implement his policy. On the 16th and 17th October last year, the Prime Minister called a conference of trade unionists at Sydney Trades Hall to discuss the need for greater production. Mr Day, a representative of the rubber workers, asked the following question: ""When production reaches the stage where there are surpluses, how will the Government take up any unemployment? "" That is a question which comes right from the heart of the workers. So often other members of the present Government and the "" red "" wreckers of the country have said to workers: "" Go slow, brother; do not work yourself out of the job. Do not create surpluses, because if you do you will find yourself The Government has been on the industrial scrapheap"" that Mr Day very rightly asked this important question of the Prime Minister. It is very enlightening to consider the answer made by the Prime Minister, because it was most revealing. It was to the effect that under the enlightened policy of the Government, infatuated with its socialistic enterprises, there must inevitably be a regimentation of industrial labour. In other words, labour must be directed. It is only reasonable, and when the worker feels that he is liable to be regimented and directed, that he may no longer be a free unit in the industrial community, that he will say: "" I will have none of it. I shall not produce to the stage where I shall be directed into other employment"". That will inevitably be the reaction of the workers to the Government's production policy. The set pattern of that policy is clearly defined in the answer made by the right honourable gentleman to Mr Day. The right honourable gentleman saidNo guarantee can be given to anybody that they can stay put in a particular industry, but there will be work for alL It is realized that there will have to be transfer of workers, and in many cases transfers of whole communities to other forms of work. The most that any government can do is to see that there is work for everybody. I am quite certain that everybody will not be able to stay at home, because there will have to be transfers of labour if there is going to be expansion. I am not going to fool any one in that regard. It may even involve a plan of movable towns to provide reasonable living conditions and amenities while big projects are in progress. There we have the answer. What the Prime Minister said was, in effect: ""We shall have to regiment and conscript labour. It does not matter whether you are an engineer, if you are required to peel potatoes at Alice Springs then you will go to Alice Springs and peel potatoes "". tortion of what the Prime Minister said.",21,Hbdman
48,Mr Dedman,"That is a gross disreport of his statement again for the Minister's benefit. It readsI t is realized that there will have to be transfer of workers, and in many cases transfers of whole communities to other forms of work. naturally, the transfers w ill be voluntary. Minister listen to this portion of the Prime Minister's remarksI am quite certain that everybody will not be able to stay at home, because there will have to be transfers of labour if there is going to be expansion. Is that not complete regimentation and conscription of labour? Following the publication of the Prime Minister's remarks, the Postmaster-General (Senator Cameron) immediately came forward and stated, in effect: "" H a l t ! This w ill cause some trouble in unionists' ranks and amongst the workers when they realize that they are to be regimented and directed here, there and everywhere"". In his mind he asked himself, "" ""What is the answer to the Prime Minister's forecast? The answer is to ensure that production never reaches the stage where there is a surplus "" . In effect he invoked the old adjuration: ""Brother, do not work yourself out of a job "". ""What he actually said wasWorkers have nothing to gain and everything to lose by increasing production beyond what would be necessary to maintain themselves and their families. What a policy of despair in this country where people are talking of expanding our industries! What a condemnation of the Ministerf o r Post-war Reconstruction, who dared to publish this specious, misleading paper for consumption outside Australia! A statement of the Prime Minister's views should have been issued along with this paper now before us so that people outside Australia, for whose consumption the paper was intended, could understand the technique for increased production envisaged by the Government. General also had the following to say:Increasing strike action, however, by workers nowadays in most countries in the world would indicate that the danger of producing surpluses is being realized by them where the necessary provision is not being made to raise their standards of living and I shall read the to provide for co-operative and peaceful trading among the nations. Coal-miners, for example, have few, if any, illusions about the matter. His remarks are reported in the Melbourne Argus of the 6th November, 1948. In his statement he actually pinpointed the coal-miners, whose inadequate production is the substantial cause of our The n let the failure to increase our industrial output. The Postmaster-General seized the opportunity to make capital out of the Prime Minister's remarks. H is advice to the workers was, in effect: "" Y o u are liable to be directed, of course, but you can avert that by going slow. Remember, do not work yourself out of a j o b "" . There was, of course, an immediate reaction in the ranks of the Australian Labour party outside the Parliament. On the 16th January this year, Mr. McAlpine, the federal president of the Australian Labour party saidWe cannot have full employment unless we have a balanced economy. It is necessary to have man-power control in the interests of working people especially. Employers will not release men they do not need for the time being, fearing they will not be able to get them later. If workers were directed elsewhere to continuous and greater output national prosperity would be increased. The Australian Labour party was endeavouring to bring its members into lin<with the policy propounded by the Prime Minister, In the Sydney Morning Herald of the 4th March, 1949, the Prime Minister is reported to have said, at a meeting of the Federal Parliamentary Labour party in Canberra, when discussing the Snowy River project, that, if necessary, an organization similar to the war-time Allied Works Council should be created. The creation of such organizations would mean the regimentation of labour and the direction of men to work upon projects such as the Snowy River scheme. On that occasion the right honourable gentleman was, in effect, repeating the eariier statement that he had made. I should regard The Postmasterthe establishment of an Allied Works Councili n time of peace with a great deal of fear because I believe that we can trace the present go-slow policy and the 60 per cent, production of the average worker to the conditions that were associated with the Allied Works Council during the war period. It is well known",22,Hbdman
49,Mr Harrison,,23,Hbdman
50,Mr Dedman,Voluntary transfers,23,Hbdman
51,Mr Harrison,"that the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction stated that only approximately 45 per cent, efficiency could be expected from workers under the Allied Works Council. That was a direction to the workers to go slow. The men who returned from the Allied Works Council to industry have continued to work on that basis. If the Allied Works Council were to be resurrected, we should have a continuous go-slow policy amongst the workers of Australia. Could they be blamed for it ? If men are to be uprooted from their homes, directed into callings that may have no appeal to them, and regimented and controlled, can they be expected to give of their best, to wax enthusiastic in their jobs and to do the things that are necessary to derive the full benefit from their employment? In order that we may judge the effect of the 43 per cent, increase of factory employment and of the vast increase of the number of Australian factories, I propose to examine the production of one or two very important commodities that are essential to a healthy community. There is no need for me to dilate upon the acute shortage of homes. That shortage is an indictment of every government in Australia. Many young married couples are forced to live with their relaslightly while the production of gas stoves tives or in one miserable room, in which they must rear their children and try to achieve some form of home life that will make them good citizens and contented with the married state. How often are marriages broken because of the close proximity of married couples to individuals who are not congenial to them? One of the greatest problems that can confront any government is the housing of its people, but, in spite of all the flapsteel from local ores. doodle and poppycock in this document, which is designed for outside consumption, we find that the production of the ordinary house brick, an article which is essential to building, has decreased. Brick production in 1947-48 was 19.8 per cent, less than in 1938-39. We have not even maintained the standard of production that was achieved in pre-war years. Having regard to the great need for homes, it might have been expected that the Government, especially in view of the increase of factory employment and of the number of factories, would concentrate upon the production of essential materials such as bricks. Instead, although the number of people employed in factories is greater than it ever has been, owing to the go-slow policy, the production of bricks has been, the production of bricks has decreased by 19.8 per cent. It is impossible to obtain corrugated iron for the roofing of houses. Terra cotta tiles have been an important item in the roofing of houses, but although there is a greater need for home-building than ever before and notwithstanding that the number of factory employees and factories has increased, the production of these articles was only 5 per cent, greater in 1947-48 than it was in 1938-39. There is no need to emphasize the importance of Portland! cement in home construction. The production of Portland cement has increased: by only 12 per cent. Although the manufacture of fuel stoves has increased by .& per cent., the production of gas stoves has 1 decreased by 10 per cent. It is true that the production of electric stoves has increased, but an electric stove is useless if electric power is not available. The electricity shortage has increased the demand for stoves other than those using electricity, but we find that the production of fuel stoves has increased only very has decreased by 11 per cent. In the document that we are now considering the following passages appear:Australia's resources of raw materials weTo developed-for example, coal, iron-ore and some of the non-ferrous metals. Transport facilities were improved . . . Australia's iron and steel industry now has six blast and 21 open hearth furnaces with an annual capacity of about 1.75 million tons of Those statements are designed to create the impression that Australia has achieved the maximum possible output of steel, that we have developed our resources of raw materials and have established the necessary blast furnaces and open hearth furnaces for the manufacture of steel. Steel is, of course, a major factor in the construction programme of any country. The position is that we are now importing steel from Belgium and expecting to import it from France at prices greatly in excess of the prices of Australian steel. In a recent press statement, the Prime Minister said that the governments of Australia would have to pay the difference between the price of Australian steel and the inflated prices of overseas steel, so that Australian production could be maintained. In spite of all the flowery phrases that are contained in this document, the Government is aware that the production of steel in Australia is only 58 per cent, or 60 per cent, of the possible output. development of our resources of raw materials is, of course, just plain ballyhoo. The vital point of any present day argument is that our raw materials are not being developed, and that that is so far the very simple reason that coal is not being mined in sufficient quantities to make development possible. The Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Holloway) warned us in this chamber in March of this year that the volume of the production of coal and steel would have a decisive effect on the levels of employment during the year. He warned us, but what did he do to bring about at least normal production of those commodities? He said that losses in recent weeks were matters of serious concern in that their effect would ultimately be spread over practically every field of employment. Let us examine the figures relating to coal production, because we heard something the other evening from the honourable member for Boothby( Mr Sheehy) in this respect. Coal is basic to the development of our industries. That is well known to the subversive communistic element in the community. munists sabotage the coal industry they need not worry about other because they will have gone a long way towards stifling production generally in Australia. duction in New South ""Wales last year was nearly 700,000 tons less than it was in 1939, although in the same period employment in the coal industry rose by more than 20 per cent. That is characteristic of other industries. There was also a 43 per cent, increase in factory employment, but a 20 per cent, decrease of production. number of persons employed in the coal Mr Harrison. industry was 18,046, the highest number employed in the industry since 1930. Last year strikes caused a loss of more than 2,000,000 tons of coal. It is true that in that year we had a gain of about 1,250,000 tons won from open-cuts, but that production was more than offset by the loss of 2,000,000 tons caused by strikes. In his statement the Minister spoke of improved transport. The New South ""Wales Government Railways last The reference to the year received only 89 per cent, of its coal requirements. About S,000 trucks were out of action. The railways did not have sufficient coal to l i ft the whole of the wheat crop to the seaboard. Yet the Minister in his paper states that transport facilities were improved. Well, save the mark! If 8,000 trucks are out of action and we cannot even move our wheat crop to the seaboard, and have not sufficient coal to maintain our ordinary transport difficulties, how can it be said that our transport facilities have been improved? This is the most speciously misleading paper that has ever been presented to this Parliament. I turn now to the iron and steel industry. The position of this industry is fairly heartening on paper, in the terms that the Minister has used. But the outlook is pessimistic if we examine the facts associated with the industry. The iron and steel industry, which is so vital to the building industry, was the greatest sufferer from last year's coal shortage. It consumed 17 per cent, of all coal used, but received 10 per cent, less than in 1947. As a direct consequence of coal The Comshortages this industry is working at know that if they can approximately only 6.0 per cent, of its capacity. I suppose that last year it was industries, worked at about 26 per cent, below its capacity. The steel shortage, as all honourable members must know, hits at Underground coal proalmost the entire range of Australian industry. Employment depends upon steel production. \Exlcnsion of time granted.""] Australian industry and employment depend upon steel as a basic material. It is essential particularly for housing materials and fittings, and also for the manufacture of, for example, the machinery used to make bricks, household In March last, the appliances, electrical goods, galvanized iron and fencing materials. The railways cannot do their job effectively because of tbe shortage of steel for fishplates and rails. Steel production is dependent entirely upon adequate supplies of coal and not upon the fact that we have such and such a number of blast furnaces and open-hearth furnaces in existence. Production is dependent upon full use being made of the furnaces that we have. Sow dependent steel production is upon the coal output was indicated by the Prime Minister last February in this chamber when he said, in answer to the honourable member for Moreton( Mr it is impossible to get a sheet of copper or Francis), that whilst the maximum capacity of steel-producing plant in Australia was 1,750,000 tons, it was expected this year to produce only 1,250,000 tons. He admitted that coal was the major consideration in increasing steel production. Australian requirements of steel in all its forms have increased by nearly 50 per cent, since 1939. Local authorities, railways, and manufacturing concerns have been compelled to import steel from overseas sources. to the Minister's notice here that Australia is the only steel producing country in the world to register a decline in steel production. That is stated by ao less an authority than the United Nations Statistical Branch. It said that the present steel production in Australia is about 348 lb. per head of population. I do not know why they deal with it in that way but what they show in relation to Australia makes a very sorry picture. The figures show that the per capita production in the United States of America is 1,180 lb., in Belgium 1,124 lb. and in the United Kingdom 572 lb. Our steel output of 1,278,000 tons in 1947-48 was less than three-quarters of the total potential production and slightly less than what we produced in 1946-47. I do not desire to deal with the position as we find it in the various steel centres of New South Wales, such as BrokenH i ll and Port Kembla, but it may be well to point out that at the moment, in Port Kembla, only three of four openhearth furnaces are being used. This will affect all the users throughout Australia of steel produced at Port Kembla. The coal shortage will cut steel production at Lysaght's works near Port Kembla by 2,096 tons this month. The shortage of steel, which is primarily due to a shortage of coal, is preventing workers from producing to their full capacity. The sheet metal industry is important; it employs scores of thousands of men, and the value of its output is very high. In the main, it uses copper sheeting, hard and soft rolled aluminium sheeting, galvanized iron, &c. The Minister for Post-war Reconstruction spoke of the healthy state of secondary industries in Australia, but aluminium or galvanized iron until twelve months and sometimes eighteen months, after placing the order. For galvanized iron, which is used for a hundred different purposes, it is necessary to establish a priority before being supplied. Even after a priority has been established, it is necessary to provide special motor transport to convey the galvanized iron from the works to where it is to be used because ordinary transport facilities are not available. It is worthwhile bringing How does this situation affect industrial employees ? The employer, knowing that sheet metal is scarce, does not press his employees to work to their full capacity. If they did, he would run out of material, and would have to stand the employees down, thus running the risk that he would lose them to some one else. Therefore, he blinks at the go-slow policy in his own workshop. Indeed, he may aid and abet it, knowing that in the present extraordinary circumstances, he will be able to get such a high price for his products that it will cover the loss of production arising from reduced output from individual workers. The shortage of basic materials has created in industry a cancerous growth of ""go-slowism"" of the kind preached by industrial saboteurs, and accepted by employers for the reasons I have stated. The industrial body in Australia is unhealthy. It has accumulated some fat on which it ia living. The number of factories and of employees has increased, but the body is unhealthy. The statement which the Minister has placed before the House is unworthy of him and the Government Obviously, it was designed for consumption outside Australia. Perhaps it was intended to help the President of the United Nations organization, Dr. Evatt, in his mission overseas. Ori t may be that it was meant for consumption by the International Labour Organization. The Government must be condemned for not allowing the statement to be debated immediately after its presentation. It delayed the debate for six months, thus preventing the people from learning the facts. Mrs. BLACKBURN (Bourke) [12.5] Much of the debate on this subject has turned on the probem of building homes. The honourable member for Boothby( Mr during the war. The number of marISheehy) made some pertinent remarks -on the subject, and expressed the opinion that, in order to have a virile population, it was necessary to provide proper housing for the people. I commend him for jfbat expression of opinion. He might 'have added that it is, and always has heen, the policy of the Labour party to provide adequate housing for the people. -Is there a shortage of homes? If so, are we overcoming the shortage by post-war building, and can we see the end of the shortage ? What was the pre-war position regarding housing, and what is the present position? Very recently, a claim was made that 140,000 homes had been built in Australia since the end of the war. No doubt, that figure is correct, but at the end of the war there was a shortage of at least 300,000 homes. And how many homes did we need? Since the end of the war-that is, during the same period in which we built 140,000 homes-ther o have been 210,000 marriages in Australia. If we built 49,000 homes last year, as I understand was claimed by the honourable member for Wilmot( Mr Duthie), we did not, on those figures, improve the overall position regarding housing. I propose to discuss the figures for Victoria because they illustrate what is happening throughout the whole of Australia. It was claimed by the Minister for Housing in Victoria that, before the war, the average rate of home construction was 6,500 a year, but that last year more than 13,000 homes had been erected. He said that, at the end of two years, the housing problem in Victoria would be solved provided they could maintain a building rate of 15,000 homes a year. He also claimed that the housing shortage was a war-time problem, and that there was no shortage before the war. Well, what do the figures show? If , as he claimed, the average rate of building in Victoria before the war was 6,500 houses a year, the figures relating to marriages are illuminating. For instance, in each of the years 1935, 1936 and 1937 there were more than 15,000 marriages in Victoria. During the war the average marriage rate in Victoria was over 21,500 a year. In one year in which there were 29,000 marriages only 500 houses were built in Victoria. Of course, we were not building homes riages exceeded 21,000 in 1946 and 20,000 in both 1947 and 1948. When we remember that the shortage prior to the end of the war was at least 80,000 houses, and probably in excess of 90,000, it is clear from the figures that I have just given that the shortage has not been reduced during the last two years: In the light of those figures it is not reasonable to suppose that we can overtake the pre-war shortages in two years and, at the same time, meet current needs for houses. We are not overcoming the housing shortage. In 1943 the Government appointed a commission to report upon the housing position at that time and also housing requirements during the post-war period. That commission in its first interim report stated. . . a dwelling of u good standard and equipment is not only the need hut the right of every citizen. Whether such dwelling is to be rented or purchased, no tenant or purchaser should be exploited by excessive profit. The commission on page 6 of its report also statedThere are many reasons why we considered it essential that, in Australia, definite Government action should be taken to house the people in cities, towns and rural areas. The principal reasons are: (1) That Government enterprise more than private enterprise, is able to offer more liberal terms and conditions of housing. (2) Private enterprise, even before the war, when building was less costly did not supply a sufficient number, nor, generally, a reasonable standard of dwellings for the low income group. (3) After the war, the building industry will need to overcome the pre-war housing shortage, replace sub-standard dwellings, offset slum clearances, fulfil the normal demand for new dwellings, and undertake repairs and maintenance, which have been neglected because of war-time restrictions.

It has always been prepared to remain in Canberra and continue sessions so long as members of the Opposition parties are prepared to stay here. Therefore, there is no truth whatsoever in the allegation that the Opposition has been prevented for six months from debating this subject. As to the review itself, I expected that honourable members opposite would have said something with respect to its form, and would have at least commended those who compiled it. The review is an extraordinarily fine piece of work, but all that honourable members have had to say about it is that it is a one-sided document put out for political propaganda purposes. Of course, all of us know that a. general election will be held towards the end of the year. Honourable members opposite having nothing else to put before the electors have raked around pvcrywhere in an endeavour to dig up something that might be used to discredit the Government. I repeat that this review is an excellent piece of work. The allegation made by honourable members opposite that it is a piece of party propaganda is not substantiated among industrialists who are concerned with the matters with which it deals. The Australasian Manufacturer, a journal which, as every one knows, is not pro-Labour in its outlook, had this to say about the reviewTranscending in importance every other document released within the Commonwealth during the past week was that tabled in the House of Representatives at Canberra by the Dedman. This was a "" review of Australia's manufacturing economy in the post-w'ai period "".

The article deals in detail with the review. Service, he endeavoured to mislead the . Government ? extract from it. The Minister should ignore all interruptions. Australasian Manufacturer regards the report as an excellent piece of work and believes that what it contains is true. For the benefit of the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr White) I shall again read portion of the passage which I just read. It readsThe. . . review of Australia's manufae turing economy iu the post-war period . . . graphically outlines the vast advances made by Australia in the manufacturing field between the period September 1945 and Jun» 1948. Dealing with other reviews published by the Division of Industrial Development the same journal had this to sayEach of the subjects has been handled ih expertfashion and will, without a shadow of doubt, be of incalculable benefit to Australian and overseas industrialists. The reviews fill a long-felt want in the industrial life of Australia and do so at a moment when its effective filling is a matter of paramount national importance. I could fill at least a page of Hansard with extracts of that kind, which have been culled from newspapers which are generally anti-Labour in their outlook, commending the Government for undertaking this work and for the vast expansion that has taken place in manufacturing between September, 1945, and the present time. So much for the form of the review. Notwithstanding that it is an excellent review, not one honourable member opposite has paid any tribute to the work that has gone into its preparation and compilation. ber for Fawkner( Mr Holt) took the opportunity of the debate on this subject to make a vicious attack on the Public Service of this country.

To-day there are more houses to to the number of Commonwealth public servants he added employees in the public services of the States and municipal employees. He attempted to convey the impression that this Government is responsible for the very large number of public servants throughout the country. Dame ENID LYONS -That can hardly be described as a vicious attack on the Public Service. attack. This is the Parliament of the Commonwealth and not of a State, and in citing thosefiguresthe honourable member for Fawkner implied that one in every four of the working population was employed under the auspices of this Government, which is completely untrue. strued as a vicious attack on the Public Service? by the honourable member for Balaclava was that public servants are idling away their time. That cannot be described as anything but a vicious attack. time! He did not say that. such as the honourable member endeavoured to make the people believe many public servants would undoubtedly he idling away their time. I propose now to deal with the housing position, a subject which was very well dealt with by the honourable member for Boothby( Mr Sheehy). The honourable member for Fawkner said that the housing record of the Menzies Government in the last year before the outbreak of the war constituted an all time record. I particularly noted his words, and I immediately obtained the true figures from the Minister for Works and Housing( Mr Lemmon). The number of houses built throughout the Commonwealth in 1939, the year referred to by the honourable member for Fawkner, was approximately 40,000. Last year the number of houses built throughout the Commonwealth was, in round figures, 50,000. Thus 10,000 more houses were built under the Labour Government last year than in the best housing year during the rdgime of the anti-Labour governments before every 100 persons in the population than ever before in the history of Australia. The same sort of situation exists in relation to housing as to electricity and power generally. A part of our housing problem arises from the general prosperity which the people are now enjoying. Old peopledo not like to live with their married sons and daughters, nor do young married couples want to live with their parents. The young people have the necessary money with which to build their own homes and they are doing everything possible to secure them. The fact that there are more houses for every 100 persons in the community to-day than ever before does not mean that we should not continue to do our utmost to build the greatest possible number of houses. Mr Harrison interjecting, The honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Harrison) was granted an extension of time in order to complete his speech. He should have been able to say all that he wished to say within the time given to him. I ask him to extend to the House the courtesy of listening to the Minister in silence. Interjections are disorderly, and if the honourable member does not cease from interrupting I shall take action against him. which I propose to deal is the gross distortion by the honourable member for Wentworth of a statement made by the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley). The honourable member said that the Prime Minister, in explaining how the Government's full employment policy would be carried out, had said that what virtually amounted to regimentation of the workers would be necessary. That is absolutely untrue and it is easy for any one who knows anything about the Commonwealth Constitution to see just how untrue it is, because, as the Constitution stand?, the Commonwealth Parliament has not the power to regiment workers.

68,Mr Dedman,"The next matter withconstitutional power to do so. Obviously, the honourable member was trying to mislead the House and the country when he made that assertion. Time after time, both the Prime Minister and I have explained that the pattern of employment in this country has arisen out of the demand for goods and services. If that demand changes at any time, and there is a decline in employment in one industry, those who lose their jobs must transfer to other industries. The object of this Government is to onsure that, at any given time, there will be more jobs offering in the community than there are workers to Ell them. The Government intends to carry out that policy. That does not mean, however, that people will not have to transfer from one industry to another. Such transfers are taking place continually. For instance, blacksmiths used to be in great demand in the days when horses were widely used in our transport system, but, with the growth of motor traffic, the number of blacksmiths has declined. A transfer has occurred from that type of employment to the motor engineering industry. Those changes in our economy are occurring all the time. They must occur unless our economy is to be static, and, of course, I do not need to go so far away as the a static economy must mean a declining standard of living. The Government certainly has no intention, even if it had the power, to regiment the workers in any particular industry. All that we are concerned with is to make certain that we so plan the economy of this country that there will be more jobs offering than there are workers to fill them. The workers themselves, by their own free will, will decide what jobs they will undertake. Eveni f transfers from one industry to another are necessary, that will be a much happier position than that which obtained when the Deputy Leader of the Opposition himself supported, or was a member of, governments which, by economic pressure, regimented large numbers of workers in this country on the dole. I should like now to say something about the issues that were raised by the I.eador of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies). The right honourable gentleman said that the greatest menace to the manufacturing eoonoiriy of this country was communism. I agree that communism is a great if r . Dedman. menace, but I agree also with the statement made from this side of the House from time to time that the real way to combat communism is to show that democracy can work. I am pleased to note that manyother people in the community support that view. I have before rric a report of a speech made by Mr Justice Douglas, a member of the Supreme Court of the United States of America, dealing with this very problem. Speaking of communism, he saidTlie remedy on the domestic front is a relatively easy one if we have tlie will and faitb to adopt it . A t home we must put an end to the shameful practice of branding every one a Communist who espouses a liberal reform or promotes a programme for the underprivileged. We must E ut an end to attacks on those who read leftist literature. We should no more ban the Communist literature than we should bar medical students from studying cancer. The political antidote to communism is effective democratic government. This can be achieved not'by giving the underprivileged alms or opiates but by practical measures which recognize the human rights of all citizens and raise the standard of living at all levels of society. United States of America to find support for the views of honourable members on this side of the chamber. Speaking at an Australian Country party conference in Victoria a couple of months ago, the then Leader of the Australian Country party in that StateI believe that he is still the leader-issue d a challenge to the Premier, Mr HolHvay, to bring down legislation making it an offence for a Communist to hold office in any organization in Victoria. In the course of the debate on that proposal, a very prominent member of the Country party in Victoria, Mr Isaac Hart, said, according to a report published in the Melbourne Age on 17th MarchMrI . Hart (Trentham) said unless the non-Labour parties had a strong programme for the working classes, Australia would continue to be a good breeding ground for Communists. Developing this theme, MrH a r t caused uproar when he said Mr Chifley had done and was doing more for the underdog than Mr. Menzies. Mr Chifley was lookins after the working man. Communism only thrived where the working classes were ill-treated. If they were looked after, the ground would be cut from under the Communists' feet. f t would take a considerable time to deal adequately with this subject. The Leader of the Opposition, in a most subtle manner, endeavoured to create the impression that the aims of the Communists and members of the Australian Labour party were identical. I deny that completely, but unfortunately I have not time to argue the case at length. I shall reserve my remarks on that matter until a later occasion. difference? fall into any trap that the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Turnbull) likes to set for me. I shall put it this way: The honourable member will admit that the Government of the United Kingdom is more socialistic than is the Government of Australia. That is evident from the programme that has been undertaken by the Government of the United Kingdom. The programmes of both governments, of course, are related to the constitutional powers within which they must remain. Under the Commonwealth Constitution, neither this Government nor any other government in the federal sphere has power to socialize anything. The honourable member speaks often about the need to aid the people of the United Kingdom; but I remind him that when he criticizes the legislative programme of the so-called socialistic governments of the Homeland, he is criticizing the people of Great Britain themselves, who have, by a majority, elected that kind of government. However, I have not time to deal with his problem at greater length to-day. The plain fact is that the Communist party is out to destroy the Australian Labour party. I have many figures at my disposal. Twice since I have contested the constituency of Corio T. have had a Communist candidate standing against me. I believe the influence of the Communist party in Australia is declining. The first time a Communist stood against me, he gained approximately 4,000 votes in an electorate of about 50,000; on the last occasion, the Communist candidate polled a smaller percentage than he had on the first occasion. The same applies to Newcastle. The Communist menace in this country is undoubtedly real, but the party's strength is not so great as it was some time ago. That the aim of the Communist party is to destroy the Labour party is shown to be true throughout history, because, wherever the Communists have gained power in continental Europe, the first thing they have done has always been to destroy the SocialDemocratic party, which is the equivalent of the Australian Labour party. I shall deal with this matter at greater is the length on another opportunity. The review sets out the position of the manufacturing industries of Australia. We have more than doubled the value of the production of manufactures since 1938-39. It is true that there has been some rise of prices, but the latest figures show that, since 1938-39, the cost of living has risen by only 49 per cent. So, if we have a 100 per cent, rise in the value of output and only a 49 per cent, rise in the costs of living, we still have a 50 per cent, rise in the value of output. happy! happy are members of the Opposition, because they know that this review sets out a record of achievement by the manufacturing industries of this country of Australia with the assistance and encouragement of the Government that makes it certain that they will find it very hard to defeat the Government at the next general election.
