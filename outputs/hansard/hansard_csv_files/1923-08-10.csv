TJ' I have heard a great deal in. this Chamber about the necessity for assisting the primary pre-d'ueers.

This: letter is the outcome of negotiations with. an. Eastern firm, with a view to opening up a market forAustralian, meat, and paiticularlv meat produced in the Northern Territory. A t the time the negotiations were opened, the Government had a freezing' works in the Northern Territory, and. it was anticipated that itsuse would be ot considerable benefit to pastoralists. in . enabling tbem to puttheir meat on Eastern markets.

5,Mr Bruce,"The answers to thesuch 'as the police .force, which, is nearly as big .as the .army, the prisons, the hospitals, &c -who has also a monopoly of the 'medical At the present time a contract is let to a local firm that slaughters here as required. That is not satisfactory, as the cattle arrive in very poor condition, and there is no feed to fatten them. Were it not that the Government has closed its freezing worts this trade could loe .undertaken at once with very beneficial results to' the primary producers of the Northern Territory. If the Government will not carry on its freezing works in the Northern 'Territory it should let some one else do so. I should like to refer., in connection with a proposed vote of £3,000 for the -maintenance of destitutes and lepers, to a. matter of considerable importance. Honourable members, are probably -not aware of the inhuman treatment meted out to lepers in the Northern Territory. On an island not far from Darwin a station for lepers has been established. There are from ten to fifteen persons of loth sexes at that station. It is located on a low-lying island in the harbour that is infested with mosquitoes and sand flies. These lepers are just tipped on to the island and left there. There are Chinese, half-castes, and others, and they are interbreeding. A t low tide they can easily get ,to the mainland, and they frequently -do iso, and may thius convey the dread disease from which they -suffer throughout the Territory. that .the offspring of lepers, no matter to what (extent the parents have teen affected by the disease, are io all intents and purposes free from it, but it reappears in ithe third generation. is so, the disease may fee spread throughout Australia. ' It is inhumane on the part of the Federal Government to establish a -station of this kind, and then leave it absolutely uncontrolled. I understand that a visit is paid about once a month by a medical man from the"" mainland, but beyond that there is no supervision. It is the duty of the Government to attend to this matter at -once. difficulty of proper supervision arises at present from the fact that apart from the quarantine doctor, whose work is , confined to duties connected with his Department, there is only one medical -man in the Northern Territory. On the Estimates are two amounts of £550 and £100 for the Government Medical Officer, imports live-stock, and practice of the entire Territory. He must find it unprofitable to attend to the lepers on the island seeing that he has a more remunerative practice on the mainland. It is obviously the duty of the Government to insure proper supervision over the leper station. It is not sufficient to place a sum of £3,000 on the Estimates and then leave the unfortunate sufferers to 'attend to themselves. The treatment of Oialf-castes is another problem in the Northern Territory. Young girl's in employment are brought, in contact with the public through the employers, away from the influence of the matron of the compound, and invariably before they are sixteen years of age they are returned to the compound in a state of pregnancy, and often diseased. The matron ""has made numerous appeals to be allowed to segregate the half-castes and give them domestic training. Better handling of the half-caste boys is also necessary. 'The Public Works Depart. merit and other Government services in the.Territory could be effectively utilized for the training of these boys. The only solution of the half-caste problem that I can suggest is the training of both sexes until they are old enough to inter-marry. The present system practically condemns the half-caste girls-to a life of prostituI am told tion, and Government neglect condones it. The report of the 'matron of the compound should receive more consideration, and, as she has vast 'experience of the natives, and understands the requirements of the -half-castes particularly, her advice should If this 'be acted upon. Another desirable reform is the introduction of definite regulations governing the employment of natives. I assure honourable members that Mrs. Harriet Beecher'Stowe, who, in Uncle Tom's Cabin, exposed the ihorxors of negro slavery in America, would shudder if she could know -of-the conditions imposed upon the natives in tihe Northern Territory. The system of The employment is to collect natives regardless of sex, and take them .to -various works. They are given clothes while they are at work, -and when the job is finished they are deprived of them and sent back to the bush. Should a cattle ! man decide to annex a black boy's lubra he does so by force. J 'have known of a boy whose lubra had been stolen by a white man, to track the abductor until he came upon his camp at night, and then to recover the woman. He was then chased by horsemen and captured, chains were hung round his neck, he was tied to the stirrups, dragged alongside the horse for miles, and finally flogged. that are possible under the present administration of the Aborigines Act. admit that Mr T. J. Beckett administered the Act in a most humane spirit, but because he was fearless and had the courage to inform the Administrator of abuses and of reforms that would be to the benefit of the natives and prevent cruel treatment by their employers, his position was abolished. His was not an isolated case. Any official in the Northern Territory who has the courage of his convictions, and dares to condemn the prevailing order of things soon finds that he has lost his position. On the Estimates is an item of £350 for the printing of the Northern Territory Gazette. ""We hear a lot about the Treasurer's desire for economy, and I propose to show where a further saving could have been made if honesty prevailed in the administration Some time ago tenders were called for the printing of the Northern Territory Gazette. Two were received, one from an office with an obsolete hand-setting plant, and the second from an establishment with a linotype and complete up to-date plant necessary for the economical and efficient production of a newspaper. The price tendered by the latter was £200, and by the obsolete printing establishment £350, and on the advice of the Administrator the higher tender was accepted. successful tenderer to do as good work as his rival, but the latter had had the courage to expose many anomalies and shortcomings in the, Northern Territory Administration. a contract Avas let for the pi'inting of the Gazette for £150 more than the price at w^iich it could have been more efficiently produced in another office. Personal considerations should not influence the Administration; should be the governing factor: The unsuccessful tenderer was prepared to offer a most substantial guarantee, but a viniWr. Nelson. dictive Administrator ,had decided that he should not get the contract, and it seems to be the invariable practice of Ministers in Melbourne to be guided by the Administrator. I use the word "" vindictive"" deliberately, and I refer honourable members to the report of a Queensland Royal Commission, comprisThose a_re the abuses ing three Judges, which unanimously found some years ago that the gentleman, I who is now Administrator of the Northern Territory was tyrannical and vindictive. He is not the type of man who can best promote the development of the Territory, and I think the Government might seriously consider the abandonment of the present system of administration. I advocate the substitution of an Advisory Council. The Territory might be cut' into four divisions, each of which should elect a representative to the Council. In this way a ful l measure of representation would be given to all interests in the Territory. The expense of that system would be far less than the present cost of administration. The Government is paying the Administrator a salary of £1,500 per annum and expenses, and it proposes to create a Land Board at a cost of £2,000 of Departments. or £3,000 pei' annum. I claim that it would be in the interests of the Northern Territory if the position of Administrator were abolished and an Advisory Council established, of which the Government Secretary should be chairman. At its inception the Council should comprise four members, and I do not suggest that the representation should be on a population basis. I am not wedded to the democratic principle of representation where the development of a big unpopulated area like the-Northern TerriIt was impossible for the tory is involved. Full representation should be given, to all interests, irrespective of the number of people in each division. Of course, as the Territory advanced, and population increased, the For that reason only representation should be adjusted accordingly. I hope that in the interests of the development of the Northern Territory, Parliament will seriously consider the appointment .of such a Council, which would be cheaper and more effecefficiency tive than the present system of administration. Parliament should direct also that intending settlers in the Territory shall be exempt from taxation for a number of lack of facilities, and the perpetual years. great loss of revenue, because at the known settlers' teams to be on the banks present time the receipts are small. of a river for three months awaiting the I put forward this suggestion solely as arrival of boats.

Many honourable members admit that re-organization is badly . needed. Complaints are made in the public press nearly every day that we are obtaining the wrong class of settlers. It is generally admitted that we have no proper arrangements for the supervision of immigrants, and that the methods of selection are most unsatisfactory. spite of that, we are to be asked to agree to the expenditure of large amounts of money on immigration, without any undertaking that improved methods of handling the situation w ill be adopted.

If honourable members the manner in which the Government prowant certain items reduced or removed pose wantonly to expend public moneys from the Estimates altogether they must give reasons. Very little opportunity for that is afforded by this motion. The acceptance of this motion will really prevent honourable members from properly carrying cut their duties. The only reason for asking us to spend £60,000,000 between now and to-morrow morning is that the Prime Minister may close Parliament before he leaves these shores to attend the Imperial Conference. When the ex-Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) wished to attend the Imperial Conference, he made arrangements for Parliament to continue sitting. Why does not the present Prime Minister do that? Is he afraid of his colleagues? Surely he does not suggest that they are incapable of carrying on the affairs of the country during his absence. If so, he thinks In very little of the Treasurer, who is supposed to be his right-hand supporter. Surely the Treasurer could control affairs if he had a pair for the Prime Minister. Are there no other honourable gentlemen in the Ministry who are capable of leading the Government during the absence, of the Prime Minister? What about fche Attorney-General? What about our For that reason I old friend, the Minister for Trade and Customs? Are they not capable? Yet it, is not fco be.

The general discussion on the. Budget does not in any way assist us in dealing with particular votes, seeing that there is no opportunity then to move amendments. There is a heavy public debt, and it is generally admitted that there ought to be reductions of expenditure in certain directions. able members who support this motion are shirking their duty to the' country, and for this they are responsible to their constituents. We on this side have a clear conscience. The onus and responsibility for the action of the Prime Minister this morning rests on him and his supporters. In the last Parliament the discussions on the Estimates saved tlie country half-a-million of money, but today we are deprived of the opportunity to reduce them by Is. It is absolutely impossible to effectively deal w i th the Estimates with the guillotine hanging over our heads. If the whole two hours is taken up in the discussion of one item, then not only that item, but all the other items in the Division must be voted on at once. Is this responsible governmenb as we know it ? I venture to say that it is as we know it , but it is a new departure in people of Australia expect their representatives to give their time and attention to the work of the country, and that work includes the curtailing of expenditure as f a r as possible. We shall in the time at our disposal do our utmost to focus attention on certain questions, and we hope that the common sense of honourable members on all sides will lead them to support any proposal we make if they think it a just one. Sir. W . M .

When my then Leader( Mr. Fisher) was in England, I was l e f t in charge. But even that Government, riotwithstanding that it had a majority in both Houses of this Legislature,' never attempted, as this Government is attempting, to weaken the functions ""and interfere with the rights of the representatives of the people. Such a motion as that now before us is without parallel in the history Honorof the Commonwealth, and I never heard of such procedure in the House of Commons, the Mother of Parliaments. The right of members to discuss and control the public expenditure is the foundation of the people's liberty. W it h o ut that right, what is responsible government? While we control expenditure, we control the Government; we hold in our hands the affairs of the country, and can direct the course of public policy. The Prime Minister insists, I understand, that this afternoon two Departments of the Estimates must be disposed of. He has told us how many hours and minutes were occupied in discussing the Budget. Although the right honourable gentleman is a newcomer in this assembly, he cannot be utterly ignorant of the fact that on previous occasions any attack made on the financial proposals of a Government has been on the Estimates. The ""responsible government."" The Budget is a sort of preliminary canter, and, as the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr. Charlton) said, anything practical must be done on the Estimates. The Budget debate is mere criticism, availing much or little, but in .itself effecting nothing. One hour spent on the consideration of the Estimates is more profitable to the country than twenty hours spent on discussing the Budget. Ministers claim that they took office to restore responsible and representative government, to give the people's representatives the opportunity to control the public expenditure, which, according to the Treasurer and his supporters, had been taken away from them by previous A d ministrations. The present action stamps the Government and its supporters for what they are. For my part, I shall oppose this motion. HereI can do nothing; but where I . can do much I shall do it . not complain of what the Government is doing, for the time will come when we -on this side will have a n opportunity to Minister is not in that happy position, get somebody eke "" in the neck "" ; and I can imagine some honourable members squealing when that day comes. do as this Government is doing. Dr.. MALONEY I hope we shall. tion to tihe statements of the Prime Minister( Mr Bruce), so that they may not pass -without challenge. The right honourable gentleman has pointed -out to the House, and the country, that a longer time has been devoted to the discussion of the Budget this session than on any previous occasion. That is not our fault; in any case, the Prime Minister has a mutual responsibility, seeing that he adroitly allowed his followers to occupy time, and thus drag out the debate. Having done that, he proposes to make the time devoted to the 'more important Estimates the shortest -on record -The Treasurer has used an unparliawere devoted to the Estimates last year. ing. The last thing I would do would -be to complain. I take what is coming, and hit back when I can-that is my motto. I can quite understand the Prime Minister taking up his present attitude. My Leader( Mr Charlton) has suggested that there are honourable gentlemen opposite who could take over the control of the -Government in the absence of the Prime Minister, .and that Parliament could well proceed with business while he is away. But my Leader is wrong. Parliament could not be carried on in the absence of the Prime Minister. self, there is no ability on the front bench; in his absence the Government does not exist. His following has no capacity of thought, speech or action; it is only through the Prime Minister that it can speak, and in his absence it cannot live. have always had at least one or two -members capable of taking command. On the occasion to which the ex-Prime Minister( Mr W. M . Hughes) referred just now, he was left on the front bench I was left on the back bench. In his absence the right honourable member, when Prime Minister, could rely on you, Mr Sydney was leading 1 a Labour GovernSpeaker, on the present Prime Minister, and also on the then member for Richmond( Mr Massy Greene). The present Prime and we can only 'extend to him our hearty sympathy. No man now associated with the Prime Minister is capable of conducting the business of the country, and so he has no alternative but lo close Parliament while away. Well, we can only enter our protest, and this we do. We shall speak as long as we are permitted, and when the knife falls, we perish! surer) [12.10] -It is interesting to hear, on the floor of the National Parliament, such expressions as have fallen from the lips of the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr W.

39,Dr. Earle Pa'ge,"The presentment. However, on the present occasion there has been the most-prolonged debate on the Budget that ever took place in the Commonwealth Parliament. Practically thirty hours have been given to the discussion, and honourable members know that Ministers deliberately refrained from speaking in order that the opportunities of honourable members should not be curtailed. Then, again, it is proposed to devote twenty-four hours to the consideration of the Estimates, and to this the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) strenously objects. of the honourable gentleman similarly objecting last year. the Estimates to be postponed, and, failing that, I let them pass. I remind honourable members that last year we voted on the Estimates £2,000,000 more than is proposed on the present Estimates, and in five hours and seventeen minutes. by the Prime Minister will be approved by the general community as quite proper in the circumstances, and as insuring to every Department a definite allotted time to enable its items to be debated. that this has never been done before. The right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr W. M . Hughes) says that such a thing is unheard of in the history of Parliament. I have noticed every time the honourable gentleman speaks that he has the most conveniently short memory of any man I have ever heard of. When the right honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Watt) was Treasurer in the right honourable gentleman's government an exactly similar motion was put in this Chamber, and was withdrawn only to enable the honourable member for Bass( Mr Jackson) to make a statement. I have explained the true position, and it is just as well that the House and the public should know it. Treasurer has charged honourable members on this side with hypocrisy, and he has given the best possible example of hypocrisy in his own speech. -The honourable member may not refer to a phrase which, on exception being taken to it, has been withdrawn. [95] honourable gentleman talked with his tongue in his cheek. When the Government, under the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr W. M . Hughes), put the Estimates through in the last Parliament in five and a half hours, no one protested more strongly than did the present Treasurer. He stood in the Country party's corner, and exuded wrath because the Government were rushing through votes for the expenditure of public money. He accused the ex-Prime Minister of lack of consideration and of nearly every political crime in the calendar. He charged his present leader with the same things. Many of his gibes were directed against the present Prime Minister. He is now backing up the right honourable gentleman in the course to which he previously objected, in order to let him get away to the Old Country, where he will do no more good than he did at the recent Conference with The arrangement proposed State Ministers. It is said that thirty hours have been spent on the Budget debate. I can say, perhaps with greater freedom than others, that that is not a long time to spend It ' is suggested on the Budget, because I did not myself occupy a minute of that time. I admit that when a number of speeches have been delivered on a Budget there is a good deal of repetition, and some time may have been spent in that way: I have never attempted to waste the time of Parliament, and I frankly admit that at certain times a Government is justified in limiting a debate. I admit that the guillotine may sometimes be fairly applied to curtail a general debate. I make the admission, because if I were on the Government side I would so apply it , and what I would do on the Government side I will not protest against from this side. But we are here dealing with an entirely different proposition. I sat silent through the general debate on the Budget, because I felt that what I had to contribute to a discussion on the finances of the country might, perhaps, be better left until we were actually voting the money to be expended. Now the Government propose to give honourable members twenty four hours to discuss the Estimates. We are asked to rush through Estimates of",22,Pairs

My Leader, in speaking on this motion, suggested that the time taken up in discussing it would necessarily be deducted from that the Government propose to place at our disposal for the consideration of the various items of the Estimates. W it h that spirit of conciliation and moderation which makes the honourable gentleman the power he is in this House, he invited some of us to withhold further criticism of the motion now before us. I do not view the position quite i u the same light. my duty to meet abuses when they arise. This motion represents an abuse and invasion of the rights, not to mention the privileges, of the members of this House that ought to be met and fought at every stage. If the public do not understand or appreciate our point of view, it should not be our fault. I do not agree that in the day to come, when we will have, opportunities to give effect to our purpose, we must indulge in reprisals on the lines pursued by the Government. If I were a member of a M in isterial party twice as strong and much less composite than the party opposite, I would not advocate the policy which is bringing the present Government into discredit. .We have had a general discussion on the Budget. 1 do not know that any honourable member on this side was given the special privilege of speaking twice upon it , but I do know that many honourable members on this side did not speak upon it at all. I am one of those who, by reason of the representations made to us, refrained from discussing the Budget. I did not say a single word in the general discussion, relying upon the promise that ample time would be given to debate the details of the Estimates. It is an offence against the intelligence of honourable members for the Prime Minister to say that the limitation of debate is proposed on the ground that the Estimates are an urgent measure, and that a reasonable time is to be. allotted for their discussion on that basis. Ho knows, as does every other member of the House, that it is not a question of the urgency or otherwise of the Estimates, though it would be absurd to say that they are urgent, the real purpose being that the right honourable gentleman may desert his place in this country and in this Chamber to go abroad upon a mission which, by comparison with the interests involved in the Estimates, is a very minor matter. The Prime Minister ironically interjects, "" Hear, hear,"" as if what I am saying were the acme of absurdity. I believe that the' right 'honourable gentleman sincerely believes that he can serve the interests of this country better by taking counsel with persons abroad than by remaining in Australia and attending to his duty as' a responsible Minister of the Crown; but I do not agree with him. While the honourable member for BourkeI conceive it to be ( Mr Anstey) was speaking the Minister for Works and Railways( Mr Stewart), continued to say ironically, "" Hear, hear,"" when it was pointed out that apparently the honourable gentlemen seated behind the Government cannot-be trusted to carry on the business of the country in the absence of the Prime Minister. He might gracefully have remained silent, because if ever there was a party which showed its incapacity, lack of initiative, and determination not to accept one atom of responsibility, it is the party now sitting behind the Prime Minister. No t one ray of light has the Minister for Works and Railways let in upon any discussion in this Chamber. Last year he sat in the Corner, claiming to have a measure of courage and independence, and to be in sympathy to a large extent with the Labour party's views and aspirations. He was the sworn enemy and critic of the Government of which the present Prime Minister was a leading light, but. as soon as his palm was touched by a g if t from the enemy he became the Prime Minister's most docile and silent follower, acquiescing in everything he does, and endeavouring to heap ridicule upon those persons w i th whom he professed to be in sympathy when he was an independent member of the House. And so it is with other members of the Cabinet. The Minister for Defence( Mr Bowden) introduced two Bills to the House, and the Prime Minister said, ""Por God's sake, say no more,"" and we have not seen t those measures since. Now, apparently because they have formed no ideas, or if",24,Pairs
51,Mr Speaker,The honourable mem,25,Pairs
52,Mr Brennan (Batman) [12.25],"they have formed any they have not the courage to express them, honourable members opposite are satisfied to so parcel out the discussion of the items on the Estimates that the House may be able -to go into recess in time to enable the Prime Minister to catch a steamer for the other side of the world. If he must go, let him go. We cannot stop him. Honourable members opposite have, as they are so very fond of boasting, "" the numbers."" The Nationalist party went to the country as a strong body-not a composite party, but an independent party-and came back without the numbers. The Government obtained their numbers by association with those gentlemen of the Country party who had done their hardest to drive a dagger into their hearts when they were engaged in a contest before the people; but as ""soon as they saw that their safety and seats depended upon accommodating themselves to the views they had attacked, they did it, and to-day they are able to make the proud boast that they ""have the numbers."" divested themselves, and in respect of which they have left themselves naked, and unashamed, are the principles which they advocated before the electors. That is the reason why honourable members opposite have ""the numbers"" that is the process by which they obtained them. Do not we, in our protest to-day, represent at leasthalf the people of Australia? If it is oontended that we do not, add to the numbers represented by members of the Opposition those represented by the honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) who made his protest today; the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Watson), who made his protest last night, and those other honourable gentlemen who have expressed their opposition to the closing of Parliament, and it will be found that the Prime M'nister is deserting his post in flat opposition to the expressed opinion of a large majority Against that procedure I shall make my protest at every opportunity; I shall not wait until 4 o'clock this afternoon. shall not consent to this arrangement by the Prime Minister of what we should do, what we should say, and what we should think. honourable gentleman is young in politics, Mr Brennan. and his experience is slight. He has a pliant and passive majority behind him, but he has yet a lot to learn, and the first lesson must be that, having made a long and tedious speech, and having taken all the time he required, and expected everybody to listen to him as though he were expounding the Gospels-havin g uttered those words of gilded wisdom, he has not said the last word that can be said on public matters of importance to the people of the Commonwealth. [12.36] -As I have no desire to come into conflict with the Chair at this early stage, I shall not apply to the Treasurer the words of his accusation against the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr W. M . Hughes), but I cannot help thinking that the Treasurer's criticism of the ex-Prime Minister applied equally to himself. It is very interesting to hear the Treasurer abusing the right honourable member for The things of which they have North Sydney, and vice versa. There is a good deal in what each says of the other; each is right on most occasions. But to-day the right honorahle member for North Sydney has more merit oh his side than has the Treasurer. I should like <to recall to the Treasurer's mind a very interesting speech he made last year in circumstances similar to those of the present moment. The right honourable gentleman has a very short memory, but in the last Parliament he applied to a proposal, similar to that which the Government are adopting to-day, words of condemnation much stronger than have been uttered this morning by the Leader of the Opposition, and the honourable members for Yarra( Mr Scullin) and Batman( Mr Brennan). On that occasion, the honourable member for Cowper, from his seat in the Corner, delivered a well-merited rebuke to the Government of the day. He was then in a position of the people. to express the opinions he held; he is no longer able to do so, he must do exactly as he is told, like any little school-boy I threatened with punishment if he does arbitrary not behave himself and learn his lessons. That speech was very apropos of the present situation. The honourable member The right for Wimmera( Mr Stewart) had moved a motion that the debate on the Budget",25,Pairs
53,Mr Parker Moloney (Hume),"and Estimates should be postponed u n t i l after the elections, and he was very eh> quent in his argument that the Estimates' should not be bludgeoned through the Housei n a hurry. I have never heard the word ""bludgeoned"" used more often than it was by honourable members in the Corner at that time. Leader of the Country party, the present Treasurer said:The amendment of the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Stewart) has for its object the postponement of consideration of the Budget until after the election. The Chamber is now thoroughly disorganized, and is practiof the Prime Minister to bludgeon the cally moribund. Many honourable members have already left to catch their trains for distant States. Yet, in a denuded Committee, itemized expenditure, amounting in all to £62.000,000, has come forward for debate. Such a position is not fair to this Committee, or to the taxpayers, or to the public at large. On a similar occasion three years ago, when the Government of the day wore preparing for an election, although there was a Government majority of about twenty members, the Treasurer did not "" push"" the Budget debate or rush, the Estimates thorough in a couple of days. The Government secured three and a half months' Supply and went to the country; and then, upon the re-assembling of Parliament, they introduced the Budget. Tl-e same course might well .be adopted now. Honourable members are weary after an all night sitting. Not one of us desires to sit again throughout the night, but it appears to me that that course 'will be absolutely certain if the Government force us to oontinue. In such an event we will not be able to give fair and reasonable consideration to the ways in which this huge sum of money is to be spent. I urge the Minister for Defence( Mr Greene) to consider the request of tlie honourable member for Wimmera. His amendment has been moved only in order that our position might be made plain. The honourable member for Wimmera will be quite prepared to withdraw his amendment if the Government will acquiesce in his proposal. And, thereafter, honourable members of the Country party would willingly permit the necessary Supply Bill to pass through all stages, practically without discussion; and, as there are still a few more Bills to be more or less formally dealt withbut to which we would not be abie to afford reasonable consideration if an all-night sitting lenge the various items of the Estimates, were agaiin inflicted-the Government would do well to signify their acceptance of tbe suggestion. Almost all the members from distant States have either left Melbourne or have booked their berths to depart to-morrow. Such of the business as still remains to be disposed of, apart from the Estimates, could be facilitated. And, altogether, I commend to the Government the example which they set themselves on the eve of the last general election. The honourable gentleman protested on that occasion against the rushing of the Estimates through the House, and another honourable gentleman sitting with h i m in the Corner said: Year after, year, the Estimates have been bludgeoned through, but we succeeded two And the then sessions ago in extorting from the Government a distinct pledge that such a procedure would no longer he followed. It is a burlesque on parliamentary procedure and a political debauch to deal with the Budget and the Estimates under these conditions. This is a political debauch on the part Estimates through this House. He said previously that he would allow two days , for this discussion. That arrangement is now to be destroyed as, according to h i m, the Estimates must be through by 4 o'clock to-morrow afternoon. -The honourable member's time ha0 expired. I desire to emphasize the Labour party's protest against the disgraceful method which is being adopted by the Government to bludgeon through this House Estimates providing for an expenditure of public funds amounting to £61,896,098. This procedure is extraordinary, in view of last night's arrangement, that the Opposition should curtail their speeches. In my case, the time of debate was shortened from one hour. and thirty-five minutes to half-an-hour. The supporters of the Government should hide their faces in shame. The Government may expect from me as a private member uncompromising hostility in debate. It has outraged all canons of political decency, and in return will receive that treatment such disgraceful conduct merits. They are depriving members of this House-the responsible representatives of the people-of the opportunity to chaland to receive an explanation why certain expenditure is proposed. The Government's action tends to destroy the reputation of Parliament, and to impair the influence of responsible government. -The time allotted to this discussion under the Standing Orders has expired.",26,Pairs

I do not say that members .of Parliament do no work during recesses. I do say, however, that we are not justified in spending forty-one weeks of the year away from this House. Ib must be clear to honourable members that, at this time especially, we should exercise every care in our expenditure so that all' possible relief from taxation may be afforded the people. It is idle for the Prime Minister, or any other honourable member, to talk about us having had a free discussion of the Budget. It is the right of all honourable members to give expression to their views on a Budget. That does not solve the difficulties. not possible for us, in the time at our disposal, to deal in detail with the items in such a way that we can effect economy. It is our duty, but no opportunity is given to us, to reduce expenditure, and to use the pruning knife when the circumstances warrant. The majority of this Committee, at a meeting held elsewhere, have decided to limit our discussion. I believe that that action was taken to stifle discussion for fear certain disclosures would be made which would not please honourable members. Every reason exists for suspicion that motives such as these have influenced honourable members. We shall not be able to' say all we think on the matters that come before us, because time will not permit it.

If an opportunity were open to me to discuss the details of the matters I have in mind, I should not be addressing the Committee as I am.

Certain honourable members, however, on the Prime Minister's suggestion, have agreed to other arrangements. In all my political experience I have never known such action to be taken. In caucus, the Government and their supporters have decreed that we shall sit right on until Saturday at noon.

84,Mr Charlton,"If we did getto England! I feel pretty sure that if he, or any other honourable member, were to contest his seat on that question he would be badly beaten. In the next two weeks ill-digested Bills will be rushed through one after the other, with the in evitable result that amending measures will be necessary in the future. Surely Parliament does not regard its duty so lightly? that the exacting work imposed on honourable members seriously affects their health. Who is to blame? Usually we sit three days a week, but latterly we have been sitting five, and now we are asked to sit right on into the sixth. Three days a week is ample when we take into consideration the nature of the work. 1 know there is a general impression outside that the duties ""of a member of Parliament are confined to the Chamber, but that is not so, for we have to work every day in the interests of our constituents and the country. What w ill be the result if we are called upon to sit six days a week? Of course, it is easy to suggest that the extra work does not matter much, seeing that we shall shortly be in recess, but the mischief is done while we are here overtaxing our strength in an unwholesome atmosphere. I have learned from personal experience that mental work is very different from manual work. In my younger days I could do a hard day's manual work, and rise fresh the following morning.; but that is not the case with such work as we are called upon to do here. If we have to expend our mental energies, why not do it under reasonable conditions, so that we may give of our best? When we are overworked, we have not the clarity of mental vision that is necessary in a deliberative assembly of this kind. We should do everything in our power to insure that our efforts are efficiently applied, for the problems that face us require the gravest consideration. Honourable members are too prone to think that, because their party is in power, all they have to do is to give the Government loyal support. The result is that Bills are introduced, suggested perhaps by departmental officers, and passed into law without proper consideration. We are too easily led by other persons who may not themselves have given proper consideration to the measures introduced here. We are here for the purpose of probing proposals made by the Government to the bottom, and seeing that legislation is passed in the interests of the country. That duty can only be performed if ample time is given honourable members to deal with every matter brought forward. ' It cannot be done if the business of Parliament is rushed through as now proposed. It is idle to censure the Government unless we are It can be said with some force prepared to do our part. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ( Mr Watkins) -The honourable gentleman's time has expired. BeforeI call upon the next speaker, I should like to say that in accordance with the reference to the Committee, the time allotted for the consideration of the Estimates for the Parliament and for the l'rime Minister's Department extends u n t i l 4 o'clock. I think in the circumstances that it would be better if I were to put to the Committee the proposed votes for these two Departments at the same time, so that items included in the Estimates for either might be discussed in the time at the disposal of honourable members. This course would not preclude any amendment upon items in the Estimates for the Parliament. tion of that course. It has always been the practice, in considering the Estimates, for the Committee to take Department after Departmejnt, There is now no justification for putting the proposed votes for two Departments before the Committee at the same time. I confined my remarks to the first Department, that of the Parliament, and I say we should dispose of that Department before the vote for another is put to the Committee. Notwithstanding the action of the Government, we are not going to permit the guillotine to be used against us in that way. The TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN. I have not proposed anything of the kind. The honourable member has misunderstood me. has linked up the first two Departments, and only the first two, in the Estimates, but the Committee should not be guided by that.

90,Mr Lazzarini,"If we are givenin nearly every case a speaker on this side on the Budget was followed by one on the other side, they are as much responsible for what took place as we are. It is most improper to apply the guillotine to the Estimates. To ask this Committee to sit continuously from 11 o'clock this morning until noon to-morrow, and in that time to vote away £60,000,000. of the taxpayers' money, is preposterous. One particularly questionable part of the timetable submitted by the Prime Minister is that for the Defence Department, one of the most contentious sections of the Estimates, . in which hundreds of thousands of pounds is being wasted. It is to be discussed between 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. to-morrow. Those are the hours when honourable members will be most tired, and the Government proposal is as brutal as the military system which the Government are bolstering up with the amounts shown on these Estimates. I suppose that the Estimates will be disposed of according to the time-table, but honourable members opposite will find it difficult to explain to their constituents their action in closing the mouths of the of disbursement of public moneys. The erstwhile Country party is now part and parcel of the National party, which represents "" big business "" and its methods, and I hope that next time its members go before the electors they will have the decency to describe themselves as Nationalists. the last three-quarters of an hour we have listened to the solemn complaint of honourable members opposite that they are allowed no time to make complaints, I have been waiting to hear from them of what items in the Division before the Committee they desire to complain. If there are items which are being ""smuggled"" through-in black print upon white paper-it is full time we heard about them. If the speeches which have been delivered on this Division are to be regarded as a model, I shall owe an apology to the Committee for venturing to call attention to some items in the Division of 'Parliament which call for consideration. There is an item on the Estimates for ""temporary assistance, including typists for members."" I suggest that more typists should be provided for members while the House is in session. With the present staff it is difficult for members to handle with reasonable promptitude and efficiency the large quantity of correspondence which .they receive. The telephone service in the building is very unsatisfactory. It may be that the demands upon the telephones are too great; but I suggest that there should be direct lines from this building to the exchange^ because frequently members have to wait for connection with the exchange through the switch. I have no doubt that the switch attendant does his best; but is anything gained by carrying all lines through the switch ? The loss of time that results through the absence of direct lines means serious inconvenience and impaired efficiency. Mr O'KEEFE (Denison) [3.7] I move That the vote be reduced' by £1. I take this course as a protest against the premature closing of Parliament, and the insufficient time allowed for the consideration of matters of the gravest public imrepresentatives portance, including the expenditure of the people in regard to the over £60,000,000 of public money. The honourable member for Kooyong( Mr Latham) objects to honourable members on this side of the Chamber daring to occupy time in a general discussion. It is impossible in the short time allowed to us by the Prime Minister to discuss items in detail, and we are compelled to resort to a general discussion in order to voice our protest against the autocratic action of the right honourable gentleman and his servile followers. The honourable member for Kooyong mentioned the difficulty that members have in attending to their huge correspondence in the time at their disposal. That, in itself, is a reason why Parliament should not be asked to sit day and night to suit the convenience of the Government. I hope that, by this amendment^ we shall have an opportunity of letting the people know that their representatives, who are paid a reasonable salary to attend to the country's affairs, are being gagged by the Government. If I were sitting on the Ministerial side, my allegiance to my party would be strained to breaking point if the Government attempted to close my mouth, as the present Government have closed the mouths of their supporters.

Although the High Commissioner's office is controlled by the Prime Minister's Department, I think it is fitting to discuss it in connection with the Estimates for Parliament. I hope that the Prime Minister, while he is in England, will find time to discuss with the High Commissioner the question of immigration. 1 do not know whether it is the duty of the H i g h Commissioner to keep a watchful eye over the class of immigrant being sent to Australia; but if that is part of his responsibility he is not carrying out his job, because many of the immigrants who have arrived during the last few months are not likely to be an asset to this country. Very many criticisms have been published throughout Australia regarding some of the new arrivals. I do not know whether the whole of the H i gh Commissioner's time is occupied in attending banquets, but if he is responsible for the selection of immigrants the Commonwealth is not getting much value from his services in that regard. Includedi n the Parliamentary Estimates are many items which couid profitably be discussed at some length, b ut I would not object to a limitation of the debate on this Department and that of the PrimeM in ister if the discussion of other Departments with wide Ramifications were not to be so seriously curtailed.

We are not allowed a reasonable time i u which to criticise the items of expenditure. The honourable member for Franklin( Mr Seabrook), I know, would like to discuss many items in these two Departments, but his mouth is closed.

The people of Australia are groaning under the burden of heavy taxation, and they will be looking to the national Parliament for a fair and reasonable explanation of the items on the Estimates. What chance shall we have to explain to our constituents why the expenditure of any particular Department has been in flated, reduced, or dispensed with altogether? This Parliament is composed of men who have come from the four corners of Australia to frame a national policy and the laws under which the people have to live, and under which they are to-day paying dearly, and no barrier should be placed in the way of a reasonable criticism of the Estimates. Seeing that the schedule involves two Departments, and that the time allowed for their discussion wil l expire in about forty minutes' time, I ask the Chairman whether honourable members are entitled to deal with the two Departments?

""We are desirous that a vote shall be 'taken on each item, and I do not, therefore, in tend to to take up more time than is necessary. I must, however, again protest against the attitude adopted by the ' Government in rushing the Estimates through without giving honourable members an opportunity of debating the expenditure proposed in connection w i th the different Departments. The( Mr Bayley) -When the honourable member for Hunter( Mr Charlton) raised a point. of order a few moments ago, I overlooked the fact that we were in Committee. On reflection, I recall that the practice in Committee differs from that, in the House.

The TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN That can be done when the amendment has been disposed of. 1 desire to support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Reid( Mr Ooleman), because I recognise that the proposed increase in invalid, and old-age pensions is quite inadequate. Honourable members should put their political feelings aside and record their votes in support of the amendment. The Government have an accumulated surplus of £7,475,000, and there is nothing to prevent them from utilizing £2,000,000 of this amount to increase the weekly pension by 5s. On many occasions the members of this party have moved in this direction, -and I sincerely hope the amendment will have general support. understand that provision has been made in the Estimates for an additional payment of 2s. 6d. per week to invalid and old-age pensioners, who now receive 15s. weekly. duced to liberalize the conditions. pelled in this instance to support the amendment moved 'by the honourable member for Reid( Mr Coleman). Members who were in the Housei n 1918 w ill remember that I opposed the payment of a pension to the late Chief Justice of the H i g h Cburt, Sir Samuel Griffith, for reasons which to me seemed quite sound. On that occasion I said that I would not be a party to being generous in that way before being just to those who had stronger claims on our generosity. I regret exceedingly the speech delivered logical in his statements, and who thinks so clearly. I was astounded at the arguments he adduced in support Of his contention that an increase should not be granted. One reason which he submitted in support of his argument was that in other parts of the world less generous provision than exists in. Australia is made for the invalids and old people. It is no satisfaction to one who is livin g just below an amendment is the "" bread-line,"" and .who asks for an in 1 crease that will take him just above it,-to be told that there are people in other countries even worse off than he. Another argument used by the honourable member for Boothby was that any money available to provide an increase in old-age and in valid pensions ought rather to be spent in developing the resources of the Commonwealth. I , for my part, would refuse to spend a penny in the development of Commonwealth resources while there were those having a claim upon us who were living below the "" bread-line."" Invalid and old-age pensions were first granted in 1910, when the rate was fixeH at 10s. per week; and I have been informed by the Commonwealth Statistician that it would now require 17s. lOd. to purchase what 10s. would buy in 1910, so that when we have granted an extra 2s. 6d. per week we shall be paying 4d. per week less than we paid in 1910. I desire to direct the Treasurer's attention to an amending In v a l i d and Old-age Pensions Act passed in September, 1921, I to enable the blind people of Australia to obtain the f u l l invalid pension, provided the amount, plus their earnings, did not give them more than the basic wage of £ 4 5s. per week'.

For the ""last thirty years, I have taken a keen interest in the blind people of Australia. through sympathy, been able to appreciate to some extent, at least, their limitations, but since I became a member of the brotherhood of those who walk in darkness, I know more fully what those limitations are. I am anxious that everything possible should be done to put them on an equality with those who are not so handicapped. The blind man in possession of his other faculties is able to take his place as a citizen and assume the obligations of citizenship, and I trust that in the near future these men w ill get the f u l l benefit of the pension whatever their earnings may be. If that is done they will be placed on terms of equality-so far as that is possible-wit h their fellow citizens who are not -so handicapped. Under the existing A ct only those permanently incapacitated by sickness or by blindness are eligible for the pension, if their incapacity occurred whilst in Australia, or they were brought to the Commonwealth before they were three years of age. limitation works very hardly. instance, on old men, one of whom is sixty-four years of age, and came to the Commonwealth when four years old. He has been in the Commonwealth for sixty years and is still working at his trade in the Institution, but because he did not come to Australia before he was three years old he is ineligible for a pension. The other man, who is now fifty-five years old, has been in the Commonwealth for thirty-eight years, and he, too, is in eligible for the same reason. In order to meet such cases, the Act should be amended so that a blind person who has come to the Commonwealth after reaching three years of age, should, if he continues to reside in the Commonwealth for twenty years, become eligible. That condition would be sufficient to prevent persons from coming here to derive benefit in this way. BecauseI realize that anything short of an increase of 5s. per week is inadequate I intend to support the amendment. surer) [4,43] -The Government full y realize the position in which invalid and old people are placed, and have attempted to deal with the matter in the most sympathetic manner possible. We are not I have always, merely providing for an increase in the rate, but for the first time since invalid and old-age pensions have been paid, a determined effort is being made to remove the anomalies which have been found to exist in administering the Act. When an amending B ill is introduced next week I shall be able to deal more f u l l y with the question, and explain how the conditions are to be made more liberal. The present proposal involves an additional annual expenditure of £1,250,000. This is a recurring expenditure, and our finances must be adjusted in order to meet the annual cost. In ratio to the cost of living, the proposed increase in pension w ill be the largest since 1909-10, when the first old-agepension legislation was in troduced in Australia. A t that time the pension was 20s. per fortnight. The Act was amended by the Labour party in 1912. A t that time the pension of 20s. was 3s. 3d. less than the equivalent in 1909-10.

In 1916 the rate was increased to St. Kilda-road, there are two 25s. a fortnight, but, on the basis of 1909, the pension should have been 28s. 3d. to meet the increase in the cost of living.

The old-age pension should be substantially increased. The pensioners, since 1914, have not re? ceived a sufficient increase in ratio to the cost of living. The present pension is by no means adequate, and it leaves the recipients nothing but a bare existence. Even then they need the support of people who are charitably disposod to them. If the Government can afford to grant large subsidies to industries, they should be prepared to grant an amount that w ill make the evening of l if e happier and easier for the aged pensioners.

165,Mr Makin,"A precedent has, Ithe attention of the Treasurer to a very grave injustice that is being done to certain members of the Public Service under the Superannuation Act , which was passed last year. A Board was appointed, and it has given a ruling in respect to military staff clerks to the effect that the definition of "" service"" for these clerks means service since the passing of the Defence (Civil Employment) A ct 1918. The effect of this ruling is that their term of service is regarded for purposes of superannuation only, as five years, although some of the clerks have been permanently employed in the Service for the last thirty-four years. ' One of them, whom I know personally, joined the Postal Service many years ago, and was transferred to the Defence Department on passing an examination, but under the ruling to which I have referred this officer is regarded as having only five years' service. In every other respect, the officers are treated on the same basis as members of the Public Service generally. I believe that the ruling is unsound, and, if it is, the Treasurer should have the matter rectified. ruling, the Act should be amended, as Parliament never intended that there should be differential treatment for these particular are working side by side with other clerks in the Department, some of whom reached the salary of £320 before the war. an honorary commission, and were classified as officers. of service is computed, not from the time of the passing of the Defence (Civil Employment) Act, but from the time they received their commission. Thus, we have all the clerks with honorary commissions enjoying the f u l l privileges of superannuation. clerks are over the age of t h i r t y years, they are required to take all the units of pension to which they are entitled as at the rate for age, whereas if it were not for the ruling they would be allowed to take four units at the rate for the age of t h i r ty years, .and the balance of their units at the rate for age. These latter are the rates ruling for those who have had ten years' service. tion a few concrete cases in the Department, and I can supply the names of the officers if the Treasurer wishes to have I draw them. The first case is that of a major, who is fifty-six years of age and has thirty-three years' service. He is entitled to seven units. His contribution is £ 2 Is. 5d. a fortnight; but if he were a clerk his contribution, according to the ruling, would be £ 3 16s. 8d., instead of £ 2 Is. 5d., making a difference of £ 1 15s. 3d. a fortnight for the nine years he still has to serve. The increase m the contribution for the nine years would amount to £ 4 1 2 8s. 6d. I now take the case of a captain, who is forty-six years of age and has thirty-one years of service. For his seven units he contributes £ 1 2s. l i d . a fortnight. If he happened to be a clerk, he would have to pay, under this ruling, £ 1 13s. 2d., a difference of 10s. 3d. a fortnight for a period of nineteen years, making a total of £ 2 53 2s. 6d. more than he would have fco contribute if itwere not for this r u l ing. The next case is that of a major, aged forty-seven years, with twenty-five years' service. For his eight units he contributes £ 1 8s. l i d . If he were a clerk, he would pay £ 2 Os. 6d., a difference of l is . 7d. a fortnight, and for the eighteen years he has still to serve the If it is not an unsound increase would amount to £ 2 70 18s. A captain aged forty-three years, with twenty-two years' service, contributes for seven units, for which he pays £ 1 Os. 8d. officers. They a fortnight: A clerk without a commission would be required to pay £ 1 7s. l i d . for the same number of units, or an additional 7s. 3d. a fortThe latter, automatically received night, and in the twenty-two years of remaining service the extra payment In these cases the term would amount to £207 7s., apart altogether from interest on the money.

He is entitled to seven units, costing £ 3 8s. 7d. a fortI f military staff night. If he were 'an officer or an ordinary member of the Public Service, he would have to pay £ 1 18s., a difference of £ 1 10s. 7d., making a total increased payment of £397 l is . for the remaining ten years of service.

The young men ride their bicycles to the city, and the girls are clearing out to domestic service, also to the city. I suggest that the Treasurer somewhat relax the law so f a r as country districts are concerned. Those of us who haye had experience of assisting at country entertainments know the difficulties under which the promoters work. I referred last night to some hard cases that have cropped up under the Superannuation Act, and I should like to now make some further reference to them. The Act has proved to operate very harshly in the case of the widows and children of a few public servants, who, after agreeing to take certain units, unfortunately died between the proclamation of the Act and the date on which the -first contribution had to be paid. result, their widows and children have been left in a most unfortunate position. The Board considers that it cannot legally pay anything tothose people who are suffering from a double misfortune, in as much that they have lost their bread-winners, and are now dependent on charity. The position arose by no means through the neglect of the deceased public servants of their dependants. Had 'these men remained in the State service, from which they were transferred, they would haye enjoyed the benefitsof the State Superannuation Acts. their State rights were safeguarded, and those who came from States where there was no superannuation came, of course, automatically under the Commonwealth Act. I am hot personally acquainted with any of these people, of whose misfortune I happened to hear quite incidentally. -have, however, had some experience of a State superannuation, and 1 know that in New South Wales, where cases of the kind occurred, a remedy was applied. I understand that the Government has the matter under consideration, but, as yet, has not decided to take any action sooner than, perhaps, a year or two hence. The people affected are few in number, and the expenditure involved, if justice be done, can be only small. Further, I impress upon the Government that, by dealing liberally with these people, no precedent can be created, for similar cirI cumstances cannot again arise. The Government should either agree to indemn if y the Board, for payments which equity demands shall be paid to these people, or the Government should itself act. I feel sure that the instincts . of humanity will prompt the Government to do something for the widows and children of old and f a it h f u l servants. It must be remembered that the Commonwealth Superannuation Act was long promised and long delayed. For that I blame no one, but only say that if the delay had not occurred this misfortune would not have overtaken these people. am glad that the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) has called attention to the position of the military staff clerks under the Superannuation Act. By the ruling of the Superannuation Board these clerks are placed in an abnormal position,.of which, I am sure, many honourable As a members have no idea. The military staff clerks are employed in the terms of the military regulations, and become members of the Permanent Forces, attesting at the outset for five years, and then re-attesting. I understand that the observance of that regulation has been neglected, and many have been irregularly employed, some for over twenty years. This irregularity is not at all a fault of the clerks, but is due to the Department. They were under the Defence Civil Employment Act 1918 u n t i l that Act expired twelve months or six months"" On their transfer, all after the end of the war, when they reverted to the position of members of the Permanent Forces. It has now been ruled by the Board that they became permanent employees only when they were brought under the provisions of the Defence Civil Employment Act, and I that, therefore, they have not had the ten years' service' necessary to bring them within the operation of the Superannuation Act. The ruling of the Board concerns primarily section 35 of the Superannuation Act, which provides that "" any employee who has been in the Service for at least ten years,"" and has attained the maximum age for retirement,, shall, on retirement at -any time after the passing of the Act be entitled, to a pension in accordance with his salary. The important words are "" any employee",45,Paths

173,Mr Latham (Kooyong) [ 5 . 2 7 ],"Iwho has been in the Service for at least ten years."" "" Employee"" is defined, in section 4 as a person who is employed in a permanent capacity by the Commonwealth, and who, with certain exceptions, ia by the terms of his employment required to give his whole time to his duties. ""Service"" is defined as ""service under, or employment by the Commonwealth."" I understand that the Superannuation Board agreed that these clerks are ' ' employees""; that is to say, that they are now employees in a permanent capacity. The Board, however, has ruled , that they have not been in the Service for at least ten years. ""When we tur n to the definition of "" service"" we find nothing requiring that the service shall be in a permanent capacity as is required in the definition of "" employee."" It appears to me that there is a great deal to be said for the view that persons who now are employed in a permanent capacity by the Commonwealth, and who have been in the service of the Commonwealth for at least ten years-that is to say, who have served under the Commonwealth for at least ten years in a permanent or any other capacity-fal l within the terms of section 35. I suggest to the Treasurer that he obtain the opinion of the Solicitor-General, or such other opinion as he may think proper. If that opinion should uphold the ruling of the Board, I support the suggestion of the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) that consideration be given to the introduction of an amending B ill to leads to that result ought to be revised. do what I feel satisfied must have been the intention of Parliament when this Act was put through. There is one other matter to which I desire to refer briefly, and that is the issue of amended assessments by the Taxation Department. That Department from time to time issues amended assessments in 'cases in which it thinks that further taxation is payable. Until the amendment of the Income Tax Assessment A ct was passed last year, there was no time limit placed upon the issue of amended assessments. In the case of war-time profits tax and land tax I think that that is still so. sult is that taxpayers are placed in a very difficult position, on account of the reconsideration by the Department of earlier decisions. I propose to give one example, which w ill be found on reference to the Commonwealth Law Reports, to show how this practice operates. A citizen of Melbourne, who was a merchant, bought a quantity of wheat scrip, and after a time re-sold it , making a profit of £1,850. In order to ascertain his position in regard to the payment of income tax, he went to the Department, where he saw a responsible officer, and inquired whether he would have to pay income tax on that amount. He was told that he would not. "" We l l , "" he said, "" I can spend it freely?"" The answer was, "" Yes."" "" But , "" he said, "" I want to make sure of my position. What can I do?"" He was advised to attach to his income tax return a memorandum informing the Department that he had made this profit but had not included it in the return. He adopted that course and was assessed for income tax on a sum that did not include this item of £1,850. He then fel t free to spend the money, and did so. Two years afterwards the Department reconsidered the matter, changed its mind, and issued an amended assessment. He protested, but uselessly. The matter was the subject of litigation in the H i g h Court of Australia. That Court held that the first opinion of the Department was wrong and that its latter opinion was right. He had to pay the tax and the costs of the appeal. I submit that that is not a proper position in which to place any citizen of the community. A system of legislation and administration which Let me give another example. A firm in this city, a number of years ago, placed the whole of its position before the Commissioner of Taxationi n relation to war-time profits taxation, and obtained from the Commissioner a letter stating that no war-time profits tax was payable in respect of the profits of the firm. The head-quarters of this firm were in France. It remitted its Australian profits to France when the exchange was about 30 francs to the £ 1 . Either last year or this year the Department changed its mind in this case also, and has been seeking to obtain payment of war-time profits tax from, this firm. The reThat is a tax of, I think, 75 per cent, of the excess profits. . The money was remitted to France, where it was liable to taxation at a similarly high rate. To get that money back from France, when the exchange is about 70 francs to to the £1, will result in a tax upon it of at least 150 per cent.

I could quite easily indulge in a tirade against the* Government. I must content myself with reading a letter which I have received from the honorary secretary of the Australian Telegraphists Unioni n Perth. It is dated 5th June, 1923 and 2 saysDEAR SIB, I have, :hy direction of the Westralian Branch Committee of the Australian Telegraphists Union, to address you on the subject of the Superannuation Act, and the manner in which it has affected the dependants of some of our late members, with pension rights, in contradistinction to the way they would have <been treated had they come compulsorily under the provisions of the Act, and not under a West Australian State Act. In a general sense the Superannuation Act provides (section 38) that where an employee, having ten years' service, dies between 31st December, 1920, and 5th January, 1923, a pension is payable to his widow and children. This applies in all States. However, later on (section 51 to 58), the Act'makes special provision for employees with pension rights, apart from, and existing prior to, the Superannuation Act, to transfer or convert their rights, or to come under the Act for the limited purpose of a pension for their widows or children. This part of the Act was evidently designed to prevent employees being entitled to two pensions upon retirement, and it was thought wise to provide that .persons with pension rights already in existence must convert same, or only come under the Superannuation Act under certain conditions. This is only just; but as section 38 of the Act provides that all employees dying after 31st December, 1920, and before having an opportunity of taking advantage of the Act, should leave a pension for his widow, it is thought to be only right that this should apply alike to those who had The Act should also be made to pension rights as well as to others. However, section 51, which was designed to prevent payment of two pensions to one perI son, has had the effect of nullifying clause 38 as far as oflicers with previously existing rights are concerned, and has affected widows and families of our late members, who had long and meritorious service, in an adverse manner, simply because the employees died before they bad an opportunity of coming under the provisions of the Superannuation Act. In Western Australia, all officers who joined the .Service prior to 1st January, 1901, are entitled to a' pension at sixty, and during the prescribed period five such officers died.

Representations have been made, and we are informed it is proposed to amend the Act in the direction desired.

I remain, yours faithfully, (Signed) J. W. SMITH, Honorary Secretary. P.S I herewith enclose copy of letter received by us from Mr Ross, President of Superannuation Board, stating the probability of the amendment mentioned. Enclosed with that letter was the following communication from the president of the Superannuation Fund Management Board to the Western Australian branch of the Telegraphists Union:Dear Sir, I desire to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant, on the question of the rights of widows of deceased employees to pensions under section 38 of the Superannuation Act. The question as to whether section 38 of the Act applies to the widows of employees who, during their service, had pension rights, has been very fully considered, and I am sorry to say that I cannot agree with your contention that both from the spirit of the Act and from its legal aspect the right extends to the widows of employees with pension rights.",49,Paths
181,Mr A. Green (Kalgoorlie) [5.50],"I agree with you in the view that the widow of an employee with pension rights, who receives no consideration in respect of the death of her husband, should receive the same treatment as the widow of an employee without pension rights who dies in the Service. Tlie matter has not been lost sight of, and the question of amending the Act in the direction desired is now under consideration. Yours faithfully, (Signed) President. am sure he will deal most sympathetically I know every one of the men referred to in the letter, and have worked with them for fifteen or sixteen years. I , like them, was entitled to a pension at sixty years of age, but I abandoned it for politics. They have done excellent work for the Post and Telegraph Department and the Commonwealth of Australia, but because they were entitled to a pension under the State Act, the anomaly now exists that they are not entitled to a pension at all. surer) [5.55] -Regarding the question raised by the honourable members for Yarra( Mr Scullin), Capricornia ( Mr. Forde), and Kooyong( Mr Latham) regarding anomalies in the operation of the Superannuation Act , I can say at once that the Government has no desire to perpetuate such anomalies. If they are being perpetuated by a fault in the Act, that fault was unobserved by the last Parliament when it dealt with that legislation. I assure honourable members that the Government will at once obtain the opinion of the Solicitor-General, and, if such anomalies are possible in the interpretation of the Act, will take steps to remove them and place the public . servants mentioned on the same footing as others. introduce an amending B ill ? these auomalies were not brought under my notice prior to this debate. AlthoughI am the Ministeri n control of the Superannuation Board, I have no knowledge of the grounds on which the Board has acted. honourable member for Kooyong, I gather that it is largely a matter of interpretation, and can be solved to a large extent without making an amendment of the Act. the Government will consider very favourably the representations. The Western Australian cases are in quite a different category, and it may not be necessary to amend the A ct to make it applicable to them. Regarding the collection of land tax, which was referred to by the honourable member for Bass( Mr Jackson), the Commissioner already has discretionary power in that regard, and has assured me that he tries to meet, as far as possible, F. Ross, the circumstances of different cases. I with all matters brought before him . The honourable member for Barton( Mr. F. McDonald) has referred to the position, under the Superannuation Act, of widows and orphans of Commonwealth servants who have been transferred from the States. I cannot see that the Act can operate in the way suggested in respect to the widows of public servants who died quite recently. That interpretation can apply, it seems to me, only to public servants who died before 31st December, 1920. An examination of the number of cases that would be affected by any f u r ther retrospection of the Act has actually been undertaken by the Superannuation Board.

Even the State police have asked us to make inquiries on their behalf, and in all ninety-five inquiries of this nature were Reporting Branch of the Attorney-Genemade. The total number of investigations carried out by the branch during the year is 2,S53, and this resulted in the recovery of revenue to the extent of £9,791, or more than the salaries of the officers. In addition to the recovery of that revenue, information was supplied to the Customs and other Departments which led to the recovery of an additional £6,121, making a total of £15,912. By concentrating the investigations in one branch, efficiency. and economy have resulted. The honourable member for Hunter( Mr Charlton) drew attention to the fact that the salaries chad increased from £6,010 to £6,947; but that increase is entirely due to the regular increments under the Public Service regulations. There has been a large decrease in the vote for contingencies. The expenditure for contingencies last year amounted to £7.903, and the estimate for 1923-24 is £7,857.' The work that has been done by this branch has been most helpful. understand that, instead of giving the investigation work of the Commonwealth to the State detective offices, CommonVealth servants have been appointed to do it. There are many cases in which it would be undesirable for the Commonwealth to have to seek favours from the States in investigating suspected breaches of Commonwealth laws. I draw attention to the necessity for providing better accommodation for the High Court, particularly in Melbourne. In Sydney a building is being erected by arrangement with the State authorities of New South Wales. The provision in Melbourne is quite inadequate and inconvenient. On some occasions the Court has to work under bad conditions; it should have every facility and convenience in carrying out its important labours. So far as I am aware, there is no provision yet proposed for the High Court at Canberra, and apparently it is not intended that the Court should begin it3 career there simultaneously with this Parliament. with the Victorian Government for a Court-house in Melbourne. that. On page 81 of the Estimates, the ral's Department is dealt with. The figures cover the remuneration of reporters who, I understand, are engaged largely in reporting the proceedings in the . Courts. That work was formerly done by private individuals, and I should like to know whether the establishment of a separate Reporting Branch has led to any saving. There is also an item of £6,000 for "" Tribunals under the Industrial Peace Act."" There has been only one tribunal dealing with the coal industry, and it does not appear to have been a conspicuous success, if we may judge by results. It would be interesting to know how £6,000 is to be spent in the coming year on this tribunal.

This is a recurring expenditure. Honourable members on my' side of the House have long had, something more than a suspicion that these are our old friends, the Commonwealth Police, appearing under the new trade name. 1 am satisfied that that is so. To-day, as heretofore, the Attorney General( Mr Groom) explains that these men are merely civil officers engaged in altogether harmless, and, indeed, profitable, investigations on behalf of the Customs and other Departments of State. As a matter of fact, those of us who still have a lively recollection of the history of the last decade remember with pain that it, was the pleasant custom of the Government during the war to send those gentlemen to public meetings to take notes of what was said by those who differed from members of the Government on international questions.

If those persons are not paid by the Commonwealth, by whom are they paid ? I say deliberately that I have little doubt-becaus e there is a strong prima facie case in this regard -that those investigating officers, or gome of them, are private detectives, still -used, as in the days of old, by the Commonwealth Government for the purpose of keeping an eye on public men in the discharge of their public duties. member say that my statement is wrong?

After all, it is not a mere matter of money or of the amount of money. Running through the whole list of items one finds a large number of important matters of principle and policy, any one of which might very properly, and very profitably, have to itself the consideration of the Committee for several hours. One of these is the policy of conciliation and arbitration. Although the Prime Minister( Mr Bruce) proposes by force of arms to close down this National Parliament in a couple of weeks' time, all he has done on this subject is to make a speech which outlined the policy of the Government,.and, incidentally, tended to show that he knew very little about it . Apparently, there is to be no legislation during this session on conciliation and arbitration. V honourable gentleman to forget so soon some of the things he has said on the question. Quite recently, from his place in Parliament, referring to my Leader( Mr Charlton), he saidOur old The honourable gentleman did not devote himself in the least to the industrial question itself, or to tbe troubles from which Australia. I happen to know that is suffering owing to the duplication and overlapping of authority in the industrial field, but he merely offered a few remarks withregard to State instrumentalities, and contended that the trouble could be overcame by the Commonwealth acquiring full industrial power. In other words, he contended, as the very basis of conciliation and arbitration, that the Australian power should be a free instead of a strangulated power. The Prime Minister, in his speech, which, as I have said, was obviously ill-informed, paid not tribute whatever to the work that has been done in connection with arbitration by that great Judge, Mr Justice Higgins, who for so many years presided over the Court. The right honourable gentleman said not one single word of recognition of the outstanding public services of that gentleman, ""nor did he seem to realize that, at I find that, in the the moment he was speaking, some 568,000 persons were working under awards of that Court throughout the Commonwealth. Instead, referring to the alleged duplication of that and other tribunals, he said, with cheap criticismWe have the most appalling overlapping of jurisdiction in the whole of our industrial legislation, and no man knows where 'he is. Unquestionably the Prime Minister does not know where he is in connection with conciliation and arbitrationThe Commonwealth Parliament is hamstrung under the Constitution, and has no real power. I shall show in a moment that the declaration that the Commonwealth is hamstrung, and has no real power, is really a Labour phrase. That is just exactly what we, perhaps, in somewhat extravagant language, have told the people of Australia in connection with the various referenda. "" Our position is almost a hopeless one. Three attempts have been made to induce the people to I cannot allow the right accept this change "" ; that is, to give the",53,Attorney General S Department
199,' Mr Geoom,It is quite incorrect.,54,Attorney General S Department
200,Mr Brennan,"Does the honorableCommonwealth f u l l industrial power. The Prime Minister concludedRather than achieve nothing, and come back to the position in which we have been for many years, of asking tlie people to sanction a change, to which they would not agree, we made an attempt to come to an arrangement with the States by which we could define areas within which the Commonwealth and the States would each have full industrial power. I have made these quotations to call attention to the fact that they are, if true, a dreadful indictment against the right honourable gentleman himself and his political friends. He has spoken of the three attempts that have been made to give to the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration an enlarged and truly national industrial power. There is no need for the right honourable gentleman to despair in this regard. If , as one would assume from the terms of his dolorous speech on the subject, he really wishes to extend the ambit and power of the Court he has only to whisper as much across the table to my friend, the Leader of the Opposition. Once political parties are agreed on the matter here, I venture to say that there w ill not be the slightest difficulty in securing, by means of a referendum, and rapidly at that, an amendment of the Constitution in regard to industrial powers. The thing is half done already. The Country party has ""come to heel"" as docile associates of the National party. This is a composite Government. "" looters""-as the Country party described the Nationalists, have joined hands with the "" paralytics""-as the Nationalists described the Country party. The members of these two parties, at all events, can be relied upon to give solid support to anything agreed upon by the Government; and, as the Labour party over quite a long series of years has been endeavouring to emancipate the Commonwealth Parliament in regard to many things, including arbitration, if the Prime Minister( Mr Bruce) really meant what he said, his ideas could easily be put into effect. Nobody, however, really believes that the right honourable gentleman desires to amend the Constitution in that way. only f a i r to say that there were in this Parliament in the past men of standing, although not associated with the Labour party, who believed that conciliation and [96] arbitration could never be a useful indus*trial engine until the Commonwealth Parliament had power to legislate fully upon it. One of those is the right honourable gentleman who now occupies the Speaker's chair. He made a declaration from his place in Parliament to that effect. Another is the present Chief Justice of Victoria, Sir William Irvine, who then was the honourable member for Flinders. These men, belonging to the Nationalist party, with the clear Australia vision which has characterized the Labour party in this regard for so many years, have publicly declared more than once that the industrial situation can never be clarified until the shackles or manacles -^whichever one chooses to call themhave been taken from the Commonwealth Parliament. The Prime Minister has outlined a proposal in regard to which he is not going to legislate, as he will be too busy tripping elsewhere, and on which he is not going to trust his colleagues to legislate, because he does not regard them as being capable. I do. I think that the Commonwealth Attorney-General( Mr Groom) knows more about the subject than the Prime Minister. If he could only breakdown his natural modesty, conjure up his native courage, and assure the Prime Minister that he will not tolerate being placed in a back seat, something might be done. The proposal, if you please, is to make a selection of a certain group of industries, The which are called Federal industries, and are peculiarly Federal in their character; such, for instance, as shipping and shearing -It has been suggested that coal mining might possibly be included in the list, and that the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court in respecb of all other matters should be effectually and finally removed. That, of course, in itself involves an amendment of the Constitution if it is going to cure the duplication, so far as it exists, of which the Prime Minister complains. If there be not an amendment of the Constitution, then either the overlapping will remain 'as at present, or, alternatively, an arrangement can be made with the representatives of the States that there shall It is be no overlapping, legislation being passed by the States to that end. That, of course, could be done at the present moment without Commonwealth legislation of any kind, if the State3 could be induced to do it . With an amended Constitution, Government limited power over Pederal and power to regulate industry, amongst other things, would include the power to regulate prices and so on. for Kooyong necessitates that where power is given to legislate in industrial matters it should be full power. Parliament directly, or it might utilize Courts of Conciliation Boards, as it pleased. is impossible. posal has no chance of success, because the Premiers, with the exception of the Labour Premier of Queensland, are Statebound and show no inclination to agree to an arrangement under which the Commonwealth trial power over any industry. the first practical objection. is that the Labour party and those for whom it speaks would not agree to it. The it because, from their point of view, it would go too far. not agree not go far enough. would not be so base as to agree to any further abrogation of powers with regard to industry. proposal of the Commonwealth ment is to take the manacles off the Parliament in order to put it into hobbles. It proposes to take away from the Commonwealth Parliament more than it proposes to give to the same Parliament. is a retrograde proposal, and is antinational. and my fellow members of the Labour party would not for a moment Let it be understood that it is proposed to give the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation over a 'distinctly limited number of industries-not industries which are necessarily the only ones of a Federal character -but industries listed arbitrarily by the Government, nominees. no hope of solving the practical culties with which present in regard to arbitration. grant of power contained in the Consti-. tution relating to conciliation and arbitration is couched in terms short and simple; that is, the grant of Mr Hrennan. however, the power in relation to conciliation and arbiproposes to ask for untration for the settlement of disputes industries, extending beyond the limitsof any one which, State.

Under the Landlord and Tenants Act, when notice to quit premises is given, the tenant is not required to pay further rent, but the Government maintain that they have power to .enforce the payment of rent to date of quittance of premises. I have a similar case of two elderly sisters, who occupied a shop and dwelling for twentytwo years.

These people have asked me to state their case to the Government, but I might just as well appeal to a, marble statue in Fitzroy Gardens. the Act does not provide for such cases as these, I urge the Honorary Minister( Mr Atkinson) to give consideration to them, and if nothing is done, at least, at some future date, to alter the Act and make it more in accord with the spirit and wish of this Parliament. I personally interviewed the former owners of these properties.

I call attention to the proposed grant of £200 to the Hermannsburg Mission Station, which was established on the Finke River, in 1887. The station comprises 1,000 square miles of excellent country. When the war broke out the payment was stopped, because it was suspected that 'the man then in charge was a pro-German. When members of the Public Works Committee were visiting the district, the Minister for Home and Territories wired to ascertain whether we thought the subsidy should be renewed. For several reasons we replied in the negative. One reason is that the station was not being worked as it should be. It comprises, perhaps, the finest country south of the He is a man Macdonnell Ranges, and, although it is well-watered and splendidly adapted for cattle-raising, only 1,000 head of cattle are carried.

I brought this matter up the other evening, and was greeted w i th ""Hear, hears "" from Country party members. I want to see in which way they vote to-night. All over Western Australia, but particularly in my electorate, vast areas are being cleared, and made ready for the plough. There is an area, at least 50 miles wide by 150 miles long, which men are clearing. New settlement is springing up, and the settlers desire to know what the rainfall has been in certain years in order to determine whatthey may safely plant. Applications also have been made from long-established centres in my. electorate. In the farming portions of that electorate, a good deal of feeling exists in regard to this matter. What are the honourable member for Forrest( Mr Prowse) and the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory) going to do? I should like honourable members to know what somo of the present Ministers thought last year in regard to the cutting down of the expenditure on this branch.

Something nnust be done forthwith.. Questions upon this subject were submitted Last year the exten days ago by tlie Leader of .the Country party (Dr. Earle Page) and myself. Dr. Earle Page is now Treasurer, and he is responsible for cutting down this vote by £20,000. A great deal of space is taken up w i th the speech delivered by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Chapman), but I desire to read to the Committee the remarks then made by the present Treasurer. The honourable member saidI hope that further inquiry will be made by the Minister in regard to the circulation of weather reports.

I hope that the honourable member for Kalgoorlie ( MrA .

The amount provided last year for that purpose was £52,000, and I presume that fact has placed the honourable member under the misapprehension that there has been a reduction of £20,000. fact, that is not so, because an arrangement has been come to w it h . the Postmaster-General's similar service w ill be rendered this year at half rates. £28,0U0 this year will give a better service than did £52,000 last year. is no intention to reduce this very useful and necessary service, MrA . GitEEN There are to be no more meteorological stations established in the Commonwealth during the year. member certainly did say that the Commonwealth Meteorologist had informed him that no new stations were to be established, because the money for such had not been provided. As a matter of fact, the expenditure is practically confined to the transmission of telegrams, and the establishment of stations does not cost anything. The honourable member's contention, therefore, is not a sound one. Earlieri n the day the honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Nelson) urged the reinstatement of the j u r y system in the Northern Territory, giving as a reason that the natives had been rehearsed in the evidence they were to give at trials. Mr Justice Ewing, in a report, mentioned a case in which natives who were to give evidence were rehearsed for some days before the trial. That happened about the year 1913. The Government, however, did. not abolish the jury system for that reason, but because they could not obtain convictions for cattle stealing and similar offences. of the Committee. [Quorum know that there are any guilty persons there? on the evidence adduced, that the juries ought' to have convicted in many cases in which they refused to do so.

That Ordinance said that indictable On offences against any law of the Territory other than those for which the punishment was death were in future to be tried by a Judge without a jury .

I received a letter, in reply to a request made by me last year for the provision of more of these stations. When honourable members of the Country party were talking about the injustice to country districts! by closing the weather-reporting stations, I wrote' a letter on the subject to bhe Department. statedThe reduced amount provided for the current year does not allow of any further additions to the number, and consequently the request, in common with similar requests from other centres, cannot be acceded to at present. These are official replies from the Departr ment. A f t e r the receipt of that letter, I asked the Treasurer, OB moticer-Whether, in view of the widespread desire in country districts for an increase in the number of daily reporting weather stations, he is prepared to provide additional funds for this purpose ? He stated, in reply,, that the matter would be considered in connection with the forthcoming Budget. the fact that we now have the Estimates before us, we are still receiving official replies to the effect that no provision is made for any additional expenditure in this direction. conditions in my electorate are different from those in any other electorate. In every country electorato there is aa outcry for an increased number of these stations. When their number was reduced by the previous Government some time ago, no one was louder in his condemnation than the present Treasurer (Ur. Earle Page),'and some of those honourable members who are now, associated with hi m in the Government. have received recently will show the Treasurer that there are still people in the country who are looking to him , in view of the speeches he then made, to. provide the facilities asked for. The following is part of that letter:I was under the impression that it was the expense of the telegrams in connection with these reports that.was being used aa an argument against them. I am hopeful that, according to the tone of your letter, the Treasurer, being a country member, will realize the necessity of such reports, espepially hi yiew oE the reported huge revenue received from It is not postal services. That-is typical of many letters which could be quoted bo show that people in country districts are expecting the Government, m view of the condemnation of the previous Administration by its members, to do something in this regard, The honourable member for Echuca( Mr. H ill ) knows that this is a live question in country districts. It is not'too much to ask that the Treasurer, and others, should act up to the criticisms which they launched against the previous Administration. 1 need not go into the merits of The official reply the question. We all realize the necessity for the stations in country districts. They are an important part of the lives of the people There are indications of widespread antagonism in the country to those who promise these things but do not grant them. In illustration ot this feeling, I might point to the Daylesford election which was held yesterday, when the candidate who went to the electors under the banner of the Country party was placed well at the bottom of the poll. That is an indication of what members of the Government may expect when next they appeal to those who elected them to this Parliament to do Notwithstanding something more than their predecessors did. The amendment moved by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie provides an opportunity for honourable members on the other side to let the Government see that I do not say that the unless it does' something it may expect serious consequences later. They should consider the amendment, speak upon it , and let the Government know in no uncertain way by their votes that these stations, which are important to the people in the country, should be provided. to say a word with regard to the electoral proposals of the Government. submit that while an amendment of a proposed vote is before the Chair, honourable members must confine their remarks to that amendment.

So far as the amendment is concerned, it appears to me that we have been treated to a storm in a teacup. aware of an apparent large difference between meteorological stations last year, and the proposed vote for this year. Knowing that it was a v e r y important matter to the country generally, I consulted the Postmaster-General( Mr Gibson) regarding it . His explanation was quite simple, and I discovered that, so far from there being a reduction, there was an increase. MrA .

The amount provided stations was £47,452, and this year it is £29,150. The reason is that the Postmaster-General has reduced the cost of telegrams to press rates or half the preexisting rates, so that the £29,150 represents £58,300 under the old system. If we can obtain an ' increased service at a reduced cost, so much the better. I know that the actual expense of establishing weather stations is ' little or nothing.

The present Minister for Trade and Customs in the last Parliament ably dealt with this matter. He saidIf the gentleman .who has been responsible for cutting off the weather reports is to be tlie judge as to what .will be an efficient service, we have come to a pretty pass. But apparently the policy generally adopted is, "" If we want more , money, Jet us tax the primary producer, the man on the iland in isolated back-blocks."" I want to know who has been responsible .for cutting off these reports. . . . According to the Treasurer there has been no saving effected. The Government seem to .be run by the Departments.

The Minister was congratulated on that statement by other members of this The then Honorary Minister Minister for Home, and Territories in this House, in reply, saidThe only action originally taken by the Government in this matter consisted in giving into the Meteorological Department penditure to an amount strictly within their allowance, which amounts to £52,000. That indicates that the Government were curtailing the expenditure on the Meteorological Department by reducing the number of flood-warning stations and weather stations. Since my election to this Parliament, I have urged the Government to establish in the country districts flood-warning stations, but I haye met with little success. A station is urgently required at Emerald, in Central Queensland.

W it h our big coastline, we need to possess an aerial service. While that is patent to everybody, Australia is expending its money in the old way, not recognising that the preparations for defence should be carried out on different lines. discussion that took place in this House prior to the close of the last Parliament, which led to the reduction of the Defence Estimates by at least £500,000. The expenditure last year was £3,409,167. The proposed vote this year is £3,425,829. There appears to be a tendency to slightly increase the expenditure, whereas if the service were properly organized, it should be decreased. Australia cannot afford to expend £3,500,000 on defence unless it is absolutely necessary. quiry should be appointed, composed not entirely of military men, to ascertain the best means of def ence-if we must provide for defence in these troublesome times -and what expenditure is necessary to establish it and put it into operation. Then we should know to what expenditure we ought to commit Australia.

We should retrace our steps. A sum of £2,500,000, in addition to this proposed vote is being placed to a reserve for defence purposes. That practically means that there w ill be at the disposal of the Government this year for defence purposes An a little under £6,000,000 when the Estimates have been passed. The strange thing is that that sum of £2,500,000 does not appear on the Estimates. It is mentioned only in the Budget speech. A* report issued by the Ministerf o r Defence( Mr Bowden) statesI well remember the The Present Influence of International Affairs on Australian Defence -The chief factor affecting Defence considerations at the beginning of 1922 was the Armaments Conference at Washington. Tho agreements reached by the nation's representatives there assembled gave promise of relief from the -heavy burden of defensive preparation, and induced the retrenchment of activities -reflected in tlie Estimates for 1922-23. But the bright hopes then raised have not been completely fulfilled. Tlie League of Nations, also, to which all eyes arc turned in hopeful expectation, has not yet attained that influence in. international affairs which would justify A Board of In . prudent and responsible authority in neglecting those precautionary measures of defence that are requisite to a nation which aspires to worthy ideals, and seeks, not outside aggression, out an unmolested development within its own borders. That gives the pessimistic view. In season and. out of season some honourable members talk of danger. I am thankful bhat I have never in this Parliament raised my voice against another nation. A t times I have had to sit here, w i th my feelings very much disturbed, because some honourable members have adopted an attitude of antagonism to other nations, particularly to Japan.

Our defence expenditure should be reduced to the lowest possible figure coosistent with safety. The Estimates that we have before us are framed, in the first place, by the heads of the Military Department, and each branch of the service attempts to make its own section appear to be the most important. In regard to our aviation corps, I draw attention to the following paragraph in the Minister's report: There is no doubt that air transport will take its place in the near future as normal commercial public utility, and the in creased speed of communication between cities and towns, far-distanced as they are in Australia, will assist, not only the general development of trade, but must inevitably become a factor in ameliorating the conditions under which so many of our settlers now labour. It is fully realized that, whilst civil aviation is of high potential value, it , at the same time, is also a method of enormously amplifying serviea air power in case of necessity. It has been said that service aviation must be the spear-head, civil aviation the shaft of our air effort, and this aspect is receiving close attention both in the siting of the various routes that have been approved and in the courses of instruction that are provided for pilots, both civil and military. That emphasizes a point to which I think we are not paying sufficient attention. Our Defence Ai r Force could be used to a very much greater degree for civil purposes. so far. something, but I believe we could do a great deal more. I think that we are not doing right in subsidizing private companies to carry mails. Our aviation forces should be connected in some way with the Post Office, and should be used to a greater extent than at present to carry mails to remote parts of the country, such as the Northern Territory. The pilots could be trained with a view to rendering dual service. In time of war they could be withdrawn from civil Quite a little duties and sent out to sea to meet any approaching enemy. as reserve men.

The Labour party does I hope not advocate the expenditure of money in piling up implements of war, which may become obsolete and useless; but we pointed out that the factory at LithgowA could be adapted, at very little cost, to the production of farming implements and tools.

Bub the influences behind Krupps took obher means bo achieve their purpose. They secured the control of a semi-inspired Government newspaper in Paris. Immediately that newspaper published a series of scare articles, and induced the French Government to add another year to the period of service for their conscripts. This policy caused considerable uneasiness in Germany, and after five or six weeks the German Chancellor after producing extracts from this paper in Parliament, was able to get his Naval Estimates through without a dissentient vote. This game is going on all the time. It is part of the military system. Militaristic advocates point first to the weakness of their own country, as in our own case, and invite the attention of hostile nations, and then, having made the people thoroughly alarmed, they are able to secure parliamentary approval for the expenditure of huge sums of money for military and naval defence purposes, when, as a matter of fact, the preparations, in many cases, are for the means of offence. Another matter to -which I desire to direct attention is the action of the Defence Department in publishing advertisements in the educational journals of at least two of the States-Ne w South Wales and South Australia-invitin g teachers in country districts to secure recruits for the Australian Navy, and offering a bonus of JBl for each recruit obtained through their agency. The teachers are advised that the publication of the notice is suffithe occasion arose, they could be emcient authority for them to constitute themselves agents to shanghai the youth of Australia, willy nilly, into the Aus* tralian Navy. As honourable members know, next to. the parents, the schoolmaster . or school-mistress exercises the greatest influence upon the youth of any country. Ib is probable, of course, that a number of lads may desire to enter the Navy, and probably, also, their parents would have no objection. On the other hand, many parents strongly object to the idea of a naval career for their lads. This might be the very last calling which they would like to see their boys adopt, and it is abominable that the influence of school' teachers should be exercised to direct any boy's attention to the Navy as a profession. When the romance has gone out of the life, lads engaged by the Navy will find it very difficult to get out. I do not want to say anything against the teachers. In their ranks are numbered some of the best men and women in Australia. Members of my own family are in the Education 'Department of my State, but my point is that the teachers should not be authorized tobecome recruiting agents for the Navy. I wonder if this principle is going io be extended. I wonder if recruits arts to be secured in the same way for that other and very dangerous arm of defence, the Australian Air Force, for which, I imagine, it will be difficult to secure recruits. perience. Candidates are rushing to get into the Air Force. ciple is entirely wrong. The teachers should not be bribed in this way to secure recruits for the Australian Navy. With the exception of, perhaps, the amount that may be necessary for organization, I am opposed to expenditure for Air Defence. The amount in the Estimates for this purpose might, with more advantage, be devoted to the development of aviation on the civil side. Men engaged in that important work would be doing this country a real Service by helping to open up and develop out-back areas. At the same time they would be receiving valuable training in the air, and, if ever ployed for air defence. They would be just as effective as if they had been trained on the military side.

But on looking at the figures, I find that the amount allocated to bhe Naval Forces is nearly double that allocated to the Military Forces. Leader of the Opposition that our M i l i tary Forces are regarded by the Government as the first arm of defence is not borne out by the proposed expenditure. The Leader of the Opposition also stated that Australia should be defended principally by air-craft and submarines, but the latter can only be considered i u conjunction with the naval policy of the Commonwealth, which is in a state of uncertainty u n t i l the result of the I m perial Conference is known.

During the past twelve months drastic retrenchments have 'been carried out in the The Leader of Australian Permanent and Citizen Forces, tbe main reasons for which were based on the hope that the fulfilment of the terms of the Conference held at Washington, and the general stabilization of the world situation, would render such measures justifiable. 2. It is hardly necessary for me to point out that such hopes liave not been fulfilled. Nevertheless, the people of Australia have accepted, and still accept, the denuding of their The claim of the defences with a complacency which would be difficult to comprehend were it not that the factors inducing such complacency are well known. These factors are, shortly, as follow(i) Tlie geographical isolation of Australia, and the fact that, in all her history, she has never been even threatened with invasion. (ii) A sublime faith in .the -powers of the British Navy. (iii) An impression, for which the traditions established by tbe Australian Imperial Force in the late war are entirely responsible, that the Australian youth can be transformed into an efficient soldier in a few weeks. 3. As regards .the first and second factors, the advance made during recent years in tlie naval and air forces of foreign Powers is gradually diminishing the security afforded by siderably reduced, and modern naval requirements include docks and other essentials not at present available for operations for the defence of Australia. Tlie very isolation oi Australia, so far from being a cause of security, is to-day a source of danger, and the experience of the late war, particularly in the maintenance of sea combo self-contained in every possible way in some months at least in the event of attack, I am nob referring 4.

Bravery is of little account when untrained men are opposed by modern aims. numbers in India and in China, but those countries are practically defenceless because their. people are untrained.

Even sergeants and sergeants-major had to undergo instruction before, they could obtain commissions at the Front. The training proceeded continuously. opinion of honourable members opposite that we should not have even the nucleus of a training battalion, so that a few men might keep themselves acquainted with, what is going on, and abreast of military developments and equipment. the report for the drastic retrenchment that has been carried out isAn equally erroneous impression that the 300,000 men who comprised the Australian Imperial Force arc still available. On this aspect the Inspector-General saysFour years have elapsed since the Australian Imperial Force was demobilized, and it is nearly nine years since it was first raised. Its value, as a potential reserve is therefore fast diminishing. In any case, the following figures speak for themselves:Of the 320,683 all ranks who embarked from Australia only 140,762 were discharged as medically fit at the termination of their services, and at least 20 per vent, of the rank and file were over the age of thirty-one years on date of enlistment. In any case were 300,000, or even 140,000 men available, they would be of no value without the necessary armament and munitions. The fifth reason stated in the report isTo The universal feeling that the late war was a "" war to end wars,"" and, as it was won, there is nothing further to fear. SirH . G. Chauvel remarks in this connexionI asked the Leader of Loth as the people of Australia arc to abandon' this idea, it must be obvious to those who study the world conditions of to-day, or who have any knowledge of the world's history, that, until some other means than war are definitely established to provide for national aspirations There are enormous and tlie overflow of surplus populations, it is still necessary for every nation to be prepared to defend itself against aggression. Those are the five points emphasized in the report which has been made public recently. The writer is a gentleman who . has kept himself quite up to date. In view of the necessity for training men, I regret that the Minister has seen fit to cut down the Defence vote on the m i l it a ry side. The report of the Inspector-General shows that he has been hampered in his work and has not been able to keep the staff efficient on account of 'shortage of funds. The report by the Ministerf o r Defence indicates the same thing. The Inspector-General states that on account of the ""stinginess"" and meanness in last year's vote, no field artillery practices could be held. The field artillery is a But it appears to be the most important arm of the service. The Minister refers to munitions in his report. He saysUnfortunately the financial situation has not permitted, so far, the remedying of the Unsatisfactory conditions of the military forces in the matter of essential munitions, equally for Thef o u r t h reason given in the coast defences as for the field army. Although Australia received from the Imperial authorities the post helium equipment of the -Australian Imperial Force, the guns and ammunition(i) arc insufficient for divisional units; (ii) do not provide anything for nondivisional units [i.e., corps and army troops); (iii) do not provide any reserve of-.ammunition for the field army; (iv) do not provide any ammunition for the existing armament of coast defences. It is hoped, however, that something may be done to at least partly relieve this situation in the near future. ThiB is a terrible state of affairs to men who have the welfare of Australia at heart.

When our soldiers went to the western Front they realized what it meant for us to beosuperior to the Germans in artillery, and they knew that we must be so before we could gain our objective. It is awful to think that the Minister should make such an admission as he does in his report. This Committee should vote such a sum as will provide proper ammunition, but nothing is provided in tlie Estimates for ammunition. Last year only £22 was voted for that purpose. In' regard to field artillery, the Inspector General mentions that the Lewis gun and machine gun was used a little last year in field practice, arid that that increased the interest of the men.

I agree with the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) that the time has arrived when there should be a re-organization of our policy of defence, and it should take place in Australia, and nob at the Imperial Conference. England expects that the people of Australia will shape and maintain their own defence policy, and that is the common sense vi-jw to take of the matter. The fact that the military arm of our Defence Force is to cost, roughly, £38,000 more this year than last year, indicates one direction in which we can economize, and there are many in which we might, economize without endangering the safety of the country. I am one whobelieves bhat we should launch out in the building of submarines and aeroplanes, and certainly we should proceed with the manufacture in this country of arms and ammunition. It would be of very little use for us to attempt to defend this country were an invader to land here if we had not arms and ammunition. It must be clear to every honourable member that if this country is invaded within the next year or two the war will be fought, not on land, but in the air and on the sea.

I am one of those who believe that we shall never quarrel with Japan. was said of Germany right up to the declaration of the last war. between the two cases. There is practically only a subdivision fence between France and Germany, and the last war was the result of a land invasion. We are -separated from Japan by many thousands of .miles of ocean, and I ask the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell) does he think that Japan or any other nation could afford to leave her shores open to attack through the back door and transport all her forces thousands of miles overseas, to invade a continent like Australia? question. The honourable member said that he accepted the statement of Japan that she has no intention to make war on Australia. WhatI said was that, so .far Japan has given no indication that she is going to attack us. Neither is she, nor is any other nation in the world. friendly. tremely friendly to Australia. During the Great War she escorted our transports overseas, and as Japan has remained friendly to us, why should we turn round and say that we must be prepared to meet Japan in war? during the last war he would have been deuorted. . would. I do not believe that Japan, or any other nation, possesses sufficient ships to transport the land forces that would be necessary to take Australia. I question could muster sufficient ships to transport 200,000 men with big guns, ammunition, horses, foodstuffs, and everything else that would be necessary to carry on a land war in this country. I say that such a thing is beyond the bounds of possibility. If there is an invasion of Australia, without a doubt it will be from the air. We have been told by many of the experts during the last twelve months that great scientists have been at work, and that America, France, and also Great Britain are in a position to manufacture some of the -most deadly gases that it is possible for the mind of man to conceive. If that is so, we should be taking action in that direction. If it is a good thing for other nations to set scientists to work to devise the deadly weapon of poison gas, we should do the same. If a nation hostile to Australia has a supply of deadly gases with which to destroy this country, where shall we be? Most honourable members opposite are fair minded men, and I confess that I was astounded at the remarks of the honourable member for Richmond( Mr R. Green). He made the charge against the Labour party that it is anti-Australian. I am an Australian born. I say that Australia is the best country in the world, and I want to live in no other country. I suppose I had as many relatives fighting in the war as the honourable member, who. unfortunately, lost a leg, for which I am very sorry. His remarks were absolutely uncalled for, and they will not assist the Government or the Opposition to frame a policy for the defence of this country. If we are not all Australian-born we are Australians by adoption. I will not abuse any honourable member on the other side because he holds views on defence which are different from mine. I respect every man's. opinion. I am president of the Labour party in Victoria, and it is one of the greatest parties in this young country. The Labour party of England is one of the greatest parties in Great Britain to-day. There are in that party some of the finest intellects in the British Empire.

If he would not be game to attack the British Labour party as being antiBritish he has no right to come here and say that the Australian Labour party is anti-Australian. able member is quite fair. The honourable member for Richmond did not say that the Australian Labour party was anti-Australian; he said that it has pandered' to people who are anti-Australian. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ( Mr Watkins) As the honourable member for Richmond withdrew the remarks to which exception was taken, they cannot now be referred to. the honourable member would withdraw those remarks. aud apologize for them. that when Mr Andrew Fisher was Leader of the Labour party in Australia, the Tories of those days proposed to make a present of a Dreadnought to Great Britain. that was the way in which we should take our share in the defence of Australia. Mr Fisher and his party, in 1910, said, "" No. Australia is going to be defended in a proper way, and Australia will build its own Navy."" We did so. days that they were the true blues, the only pebbles on the beach, were the men who laughed at the proposal of the Labour party for the building of an Australian Navy. I remember that Sir Joseph Cook, the present High Commissioner, referred to the Australian Fleet as a ""Mosquito Fleet."" It is a most remarkable thing that, later, it was one of Australia's vessels that destroyed the Emden, the enemy ship that no other ships could capture. The Labour party is given no credit for that. This party has played a clean and honest game, aud has pursued a clean and honest course so far as the defence of this country and the welfare of Australia is concerned. will do so until its last man is dead. It is, therefore, quite uncalled for that any £1,000,000,000, and we should therefore honourable member should get up here, and say that we are anti-Australian, and that we sheltered the cold-footers. We did nothing of the kind. I know to what the honourable member was referring. He was referring to the fact that the Australian Labour party opposed conscription, the defeat of which enabled the men whom he called "" cold-footers"" to escape military service. If there is one thing of which I am. proud it is that the on two occasions, and while there is breath in my body I shall resist compulsory military service. Australia should be kept free of the military discipline that is imposed unfairly upon the men of older countries. Those who have been at the war know that any soldier in Englr.nd, France, or America who dared to protest against the tyranny of some petty officer was gaoled, whilst pacifists were treated worse than criminals. We do not desire that sort of thing to occur in He should go further, Australia-it does not fit in with the I remember democratic ideas of our people. Give the Australians a fair and honest chance and they are the best people in the world. No finer body of men ever donned a uniform than the Australians who went to the war. They considered that Those who say that men cannot be trained for active service in a few months do not know what they are talking about. The men who lefit Australia spent some weeks on the water, a little time in Egypt, and then were rushed to Gallipoli, where undoubtedly they were badly handled. The men who pretended in those They were thrown into a hell compared with which the charge at Balaclava was insignificant, yet they accomplished their task as only Australians could. months training in Egypt in addition to the training they received in camp in Australia. MrM c NEILL I admit that; but if they had been trained in camp for four years they would not have been any better than they were after four months. I do not think there are any Australians who are not. prepared to defend their country, but we on this side of the It Chamber recognise that the Commonwealth has a debt of almost cut down defence expenditure as far as may be consistent with safety. We cannot continue piling up millions of pounds of debt; we must call a halt at some time.

367,Mr Lister,"Thos e men had had fourthousands of pounds in the Defence and other Departments of the Estimates. We have responsibility on our shoulders for steering the ship of State to a haven of safety, and the suggestion made by the Leader of the Opposition that we should re-organize ourDefence policy is sound. If the Government cannot do that tliis year, they should, at least, take into consideration the advisability of doing it next year, so that we may get the most effective defence at a minimum cost. -In two rather long speeches, which I made earlier in the session, I expressed my views regarding tlie A i r Force and the Navy, and I shall not dwell upon tliose subjects this morning; The Leader of the Oppositionasked what form Australian defence should take. I understand that the Imperial Conference will advise Australia upon that matter, and until we hear from the Conference, through the Prime Minister on his return, we can do nothing but tread water. Treading water is costing us a lot of money; but I do not see how we can avoid that. We have a large -personnel, wages are high, and the cost of food is very great Those three facts largely account for the amount appearing in the Defence Estimates. The '' man in the street"" wants to know what Australia is getting for the expenditure. ""Not much, beyond a highly efficient personnel."" That is the opinion of the Admiral and others who can speak with authority regarding the Royal Australian Navy. Australia is to be congratulated upon having a man like Colonel Brinsmead in charge of civil aviation, and the Government are deserving of thanks for having placed on the Estimates a sum of about $60,000 to subsidize aviation. I am in favour of using commercial air pilots for defence if they can hove an intensive course of defence training before going on to the air routes, and come back periodically for refresher courses. Airmen who had not had intensive training would not be of much use for defence purposes. From time to time. I have placed upon the notice-paper questions regarding naval affairs, and the reply in every instance was far from satisfactory. I have received dozens of answers, and nearly all sidestepped the questions. The Minister i» perfectly innocent of any intention to deceive, but honourable members will recollect the Gunner Yates' incident, in connection with which Sir Granville Ryrie explained that he had been "" sold a pup "" by somebody in his Department. I warn Ministers to be careful or otherwise they, too, will be "" sold a pup."" The replies they have given in the House were not honest, and it is time that some member protested. For instance, I asked the Prime Minister, first without notice, and later upon notice, whether the Commonwealth would follow the lead of the British Government in subscribing towards the great Victory fund for. repairing Nelson's old flagship? The reply I received was that the fund was' being raised by public subscription, and that the British Government was doing nothing to help it. Everybody who takes an interest in the matter knows perfectly well that the Admiralty subscribed £25,000 towardsthe fund; yet the Prime Minister was told by his Naval Adviser that the British Government is not doing anything in that regard. That is one instance of an unsatisfactory reply to a question. Here is another: I asked the TreasurerWhether the Government will consider the The answer is> advisability of collecting Federal taxation from officers and ratings in the Royal Australian Navy, as is done in the Royal Navy, by the necessary deductions being made in the ship's ledgers, and paid to the Taxation Department by the Naval Board, the accountant officers of the ships being responsible for such deductions ? That is a very simple way of collecting this taxation. The reply I received was-*Yes.' There is, however; nothing to indicate that this course would be agreeable to tlie taxpayers concerned, and there certainly has been ho demand from them for the intervention of tbe Naval accountant officers in the manner suggested. Yet, in 1922, the Welfare Committee, composed of officers and men, and appointed to consider all grievances in the Navy, specifically asked that this course should be followed. I could relate a dozen other illustrations, all of which occurred within the last two or three weeks, of equally unsatisfactory answers, and I could name the man who writes the replies for the Minister. I am fed up with this sort of thing. I am giving",81,Riley I S The Honourable Munications Jias Shown That Australia Must
368,Mr Marks (Wentworth) [1.55 A.m.].,"this warning to Ministers because if they are not careful they will fall in. What is the use of an honourable member asking questions if he is not to receive honest answers? asking questions, because the replies I have been getting have not been fair'. I asked some time ago whether it was a fact that recruiting for the Navy was slackening. The reply was, "" Yes. But recruiting shows signs of improvement.** On the Estimates is a sum of £41,000 for the transhipment of bluejackets from England to Australia, whilst the cost of maintaining the training ship Tingira .is £60,000 per annum. recruit men in Australia? Because the Department does not go the right way about it . Why not institute a more vigorous method of recruiting, and emulate the British system of displaying on railway stations and book-stalls handsome illuminated posters, showing the white ensign, where they would attract ths notice of lads who wanted to go to sea and fire their imagination. There is plenty of material in Australia from which to recruit the naval ratings, for love of the sea is inbred in the British race. I receive many letters from time to time from retired Royal Navy ratings who during a long term of service have become skilled as turret officers, submarine experts, fire control officers, and so on. They have had to retire at the age of thirty-nine years and are living in Melbourne, Sydney, and other capital cities, upon small pensions. They are dying to get to sea for a fortnight or longer every year, but, so far as I can ascertain, there is no means by which they can be kept up to the mark in the respective branches in which they have made themselves skilful, so that they may be ready when called up by Order in Council upon the outbreak of hostilities. There should be some means of allowing these men to go off to sea and keep up-tois not a regulation, but an instruction."" date in their special branches. I can understand the reason for protests by honourable members opposite at the limitation of the time available for the discussion of these Estimates. I have a great quantity of material of much' interest to honourable members, but I cannot make use of it because my time is all too short. On 3rd March last I asked the Ministeri f , against the event of ths in mobilization of the Australian Citizen Naval Forces, adequate -stocks of uniforms and accoutrements were held in reserve; and if , against the event of hosI have almost discontinued tilities breaking out, complete sets of all stores were held in readiness for immediate supply to the ships. The official reply wasReasonable stocks are held in reserve and no difficulty is anticipated in obtaining supplies. I should like to know what is meant by the term "" reasonable"" stocks. If events developed as rapidly as in 1914, could all the reserve be fully equipped Why cannot we immediately ? In view of the disposal of the Geelong Woollen Mill, and the closing-down of other Government factories, what about uniforms and accoutrements ? It is well known to everybody that reasonable stocks are not in store and available for our Forces in the event of an outbreak of hostilities. Then, again, I asked the Minister, for Trade and Customs whether the long-established custom in the Royal Navy of selling tobacco duty free to officers and ratings could not be followed in the Royal Australian Navy, and under the same rules and restrictions as apply in the Royal Navy. The Minister's reply to that question was to this effectThere is no power to remit duty payable on goqda consumed in Australian waters. Could not the Government provide the necessary power required, as this provision is more closely related to the general contentment in a sailor's life than is, perhaps, understood by people on shore. This, too, was the subject of a "" welfare "" request in 1922. I asked the Minister whether under regulation No. 12, men compulsorily retired from sea-going duty on account of age and invalidity and not absorbed in auxiliary services, would be given preference in civil employment, and whether the regulation was still in. force. The Minister's reply was: "" This Well, I have here the book"" Royal Australian Navy-Permanent . Naval Forces-, Sea-going,"" and in it is "" regulation"" No. 12, dealing with engagement, promotion and retirement of men. Where is this going to end ? I now direct the attention of the Minister to the position of the Army Instructional Corps. There is general dissatisfaction among the men regard to living allowances. In the Public Service married men 'of cotton, flax, tea, and many other proget a living allowance of £ 1 a week, ducts should be encouraged. with an additional 5s. for each child.

Instructional Corps discharge important tens of thousands of lives of our enemies, duties in the training of our citizen but when it is a question of providing troops; and I assure the Minister that facilities for pioneer settlers, or the setthey are very, dissatisfied. I trust, thereting aside of a sufficient sum of money, fore, that he will look into the question. with a view to arresting disease, and I know it is a matter of finance, but if saving the lives of thousands of our own possible this discontent in the Service people, the Government fail to appreciate should be removed.

I do not wish to deal with the question in a party spirit. I recognise that it is above party politics. not with any view to gain political kudos that I submit my amendment. To place that beyond all doubt, I intend to read to the Committee some of tlie letters I have received from sugar growers' associations in my own electorate, and in other parts of Queensland, asking me to take this step. I am pleased that the Queensland sugar-growers accepted the sugar proposals offered them by the Commonwealth Government, because, nothwithstanding the many defects, they recognise that they were better than the only alternative at the time-that of handing the industry over to the tender mercies of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. In a press statement. I said that it would be better for the growers to accept the Commonwealth Government's proposals at the time, with a view to liberalizing them later on, than to tur n them down, altogether. When they were first made it seemed that they would be turned down, b u t on the advice of the officials of sugar-growers' associations, the Queensland Premier, and others, it was agreed that it would be in the best in terests of the growers to accept the Government's proposals under protest. It was made clear by the growers that, although they accepted the proposals under protest they were not satisfied. honourable members have heard the letters I intend to quote, they will see that the growers,' although accepting the proposals, are not satisfied, and that they would particularly like the embargo on black-grown sugar to be extended to five years. ing for wealthy citizens of Queensland? honourable member's ignorance. typical of the. Country party's attitude. plies now to the land under the plough in many The honourable member has a quite cases. And then a two years' embargo only mistaken idea. in Queensland are poor, men. the farms they have undertaken to purtaking off the three crops will about cover n chase. A great number of workers in Queensland, and in other parts of Ausfair-minded person that a two years' embargo tralia, depend upon the sugar industry. Althoughi t may be said that some of them earn under contracts 23s. per day, the industry is a seasonal one, and the work of these men lasts only for from two to five months in the year. It is himself quoted Queensland as paying higher rates in wages than any other State. not then dealing with the sugar industry only. These observations were made in reply to an interjection that Queensland is being ruined because a Labour Government is in power there. I showed that Queensland's exports have increased while those of other States have decreased, and that theoutput from Queensland factories, per employee, is greater than that of any other State. As Queensland does not export sugar, her prosperous position in regard to exports cannot be attributable only to prosperity in the sugar industry. honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr. Watson) was merely a fairy story. it . These are some letters I have received from sugar-growers and workers in the industry in various parts of Queensland. The. first is from MrW . D . Moore, honorary secretary of the Bucca branch of the United Cane Growers Association, dated 6th August, 1923I am instructed by my association to inform you that they consider the sugar policy of the present Commonwealth Government of little . When use to the industry as far as stabilizing it is concerned, because a two years' embargo only applies to the cane now planted, and, of course, that planted since last crushing would only get one crop taken off. So you see it gives no encouragement to get any land ready to plant. My association is of the opinion that an embargo should be given it for five years, so that it could be applied when sugar could be imported for less than we can produce it with white labour; if an embargo cannot be put on for the following reasons, namely:-Becaus e from starting to fall tbe scrub, burning off, It is will take at least two years, and the same apapplies to one crop after planting it, and, as a Many sugar-growers rule, we count on a first and second l-atton, and struggling very often the second ratton has to stand over, They are trying ..to buy so from starting to get land ready to plant and period of five years.

The members of my association are very pleased that' you are going to move for a five years' embargo, as it will be a very good way of showing where the Queensland members stand-whethe r they stand by the election pledges about tbe sugar industry or just plain party members. Here is another from C. M . Gibson, secretary to the Qunaba Cane Suppliers Association, dated 24th July, 1923.1. beg to notify you that the members of tbe Qunaba Cane Suppliers Association, comprising the whole of the suppliers to the Qunaba mill, are unanimously of the opinion that, in order to maintain and encourage the growth of the sugar cane, a five years' embargo on the importation of black-grown sugar is an absolute necessity. They also consider that the minimum price should be £27 per ton for 94 net titre sugar for the above-mentioned period. The next is from J . .11. Wrench, of the Isis Sugar Growers Association, dated 23rd July, 19231. am instructed to say that this association have accepted under protest the proposals of the Commonwealth Government relative to the future price and conditions governing the sugar industry, and they feel that all representatives of sugar constituents should oppose' the proposals and advocate a longer period of embargo, as it is considered that the proposed conditions are not sufficient to fully protect the industry. Trusting you will support our protest in the House. I received the following from MrW . Hiscock, honorary secretary of the Millaquin Cane Suppliers Association, dated 25th July, 1923:The Millaquin Cane Suppliers Association, representing over 200 growers, are unanimous that it is necessary, to put the sugar industry on a sound footing, that the sugar embargo should be made for five years at £27 per ton net. We hope you will move in Ibis direction. Here is another from MrW . Hiscock, secretary to the Bundaberg District Council of the United Cane Growers Association, dated 24th July, 1923The Bundaberg District Council of ihe United Cane Growers Association, representing over 600 cane-gro-vers in the Bundaberg district, are absolutely opposed to Mr Bruce's proposals in their present form, and we as cane-growers consider that it is vital and necessary to the sugar industry, to put it on a sound footing, to have the embargo extended to five years at £27 per ton net. I received the following telegram from Mr MacKenzie, secretary to the-Proserpine Farmers Association: Proserpine Farmers Association request that you move in direction of having embrfrgo placed on'sugar for five years at £27 per ton net when sugar resolutions come before House for confirmation, so that vote of all parties can be taken regarding stabilization of sugar industry and maintenance of White Australia policy. This is a telegram from MrJ . Clayton, president of the ChildersM ill Cane Growers Association: My association urgently requests you urge Parliament to agree embargo on foreign sugar for four years at least. I have received from Mr George Dawson, honorary secretary of the Oakwood Booloongie branch of the United Cane Growers Association, a letter in which he . says-^I.t is the opinion of my branch that while the embargo for two years is far front satisfactory, the industry was compelled to accept, as sole reliance on an import duty would not :ulequately protect the cane growers. . . . We consider that the granting by the Commonwealth of a five years' embargo on black-grown sugar only a fair deal, and if the industry is to. be encouraged to expand and develop, something more than a year to year arrangement will have to be provided. I could read numerous other letters, but as my time is limited to half-an-hour, I must cut a lot out. I have one here fro m MrA . Anderson, secretary of the South Bingera and Electra branch of the Cane Growers Association, reading as -follows :: At. a well > representative meeting of tbe above association, it was unanimously agreed that this association support you in moving for a five years' embargo. I have another letter from MrJ . C. Batt, honorary secretary of' the Mullett Creek Cane Growers Association, who saysThe Mullett Creek cane growers accept. Commonwealth Government proposals under protest, but strongly urge for five years' embargo and £27 per ton net. I have received also a telegram from Mr. Cutcheon, the secretary to the Proserpine Chamber of Commerce, to the same effect. I think that these letters prove that it would be in the best interests of the industry to give a five years' embargo. In some districts sugar cane is not harvested unti l thi-ee years after planting. Much depends upon the season, and in the Bundaberg and Childers districts the rainfall is not as reliable as it is further north, and it takes longer for the cane to mature in those districts. It is clear, therefore, that a two years' embargo on black-grown sugar would not afford adequate protection to the industry. The right honourable member for North Sydney( MrW . M : Hughes) took a very keen interest in the sugar industry, and I believe that he was well-intentioned towards it , but the National Union prevented him from carrying out his wishes. He said in a recent speech in this HouseIt is impossible to run an industry like the sugar industry from hand to mouth from year to year. Stability is essential. The growers must know where they are before they plant. It is perfectly absurd to have an embargo for two years. The right honourable gentleman in a speech he made said that if the question came before Parliament he would move for the extension of the embargo by at least an additional year; hence honourable members will quite understand my action to-night. The sugar industry is one upon which over 100,000 people are dependent. It is the real bulwark of the White Australia policy. It was worth £9,500,000 last year to the Commonwealth. It gives employment approximately to 25,000 men. the extent of £16,000,000. PoUr thousand men come from the south to Queensland every year to work in the industry. The wives and families of these men live in the southern States, and their wages are expended largely in those States.' Many thousands of pounds' worth of farming machinery and implements, as well as clothing and other products from the Victorian factories, are imported' to Queensland every year from the south. The vessels, that bring raw sugar to the south return to Queensland with goods from the factories of Melbourne and other places in the southern States. Moreover, through the sugar industry we are building up a great White Australia industry, which flourishes in a part of Australia in which no Other industry would flourish to the satne extent. It is interesting to know what a Royal Commission appointed by the Federal Government in 1911 said in this connection. The Commission r e p o r t e d Unsettled areas in the tropical parts Of Australia are not only a source of strategic weakness, . they, constitute a positive temptation to Asiatic invasion. The ultimate, and. in our opinion, the effective jrstificntion of the protection of tlie sugar industry lies beyond the question of industry or wealth or' protection. It must be sought in the very existence of Australia 'as a nnt'on. That statement is significant. mission recognised that the industry does more for the' development Mr Fur de. of Australia, and to safeguard it as a wh'ite man's country, than does any other industry of which we can think. I know that the present Prime Minister recognises the importance of the industry. The first agreement in connection with it was made in 1915, and the price of £ 1 8 per ton was fixed under that agreement; in 1918 the price fixed was £ 2 1 per ton, and in 1920 the price was £ 3 0 6s. 8d. < per ton. The present Prime Minister said in this House, in referring to the agreementsThere has been a tremendous amount Of misunderstanding, particularly with regard to the effect of, those agreements upon the consumers of sugar. There isa generally accepted idea that they were designed 'solely for the benefit of the man who grows sugar, and that-they have placed him in the position to make an enormous fortune at the expense of the unfortunate sugar consumers of Australia. That view is absolutely and totally wrong. These agreements, which have been id existence now since 1916, have been of immense benefit to the There is invested in it capital to consumers of sugar in Australia. . . . During the three years that the last sugar agreement was in operation it conferred a very great benefit upon the people of this country. Tho right honourable gentleman plainly recognised the importance of this industry, but why did he not put his expressions of sympathy into effect by renewing the Sugar Agreement ? I said that I would advocate and fight for the renewal of the agreement, but Unfortunately the powers that be are against us on the Labour side of the House, and the agreement has r o t been renewed. The honourable member for Herbertf Mr Bamford) said in a recent speech in this House:About twelve months ago I was ib Queensland with the ex-Prime Minister, Mr W. M. Hughes. I travelled with him to my electorate, and heard him speak at Cairns, Townsville, Mackay, and. one or two other places. In each of his speeches Mr Hughes said, "" I will give you an extension of tlie agreements for five years at the same price as you receive now, namely. £30 6s. 8d., provided I get a majority in Parliament after the elections."" Mr Hughes did not get a majority of Nationalists in this Parliament, but the Nationalists and Country, party together constitute the majorit y in this House. They are the Government. The ex-Prime Minister said, according to the honourable member for Herbert, that if the Nationalist Government received a majority, fhe Sugar Agreement would The Combe renewed. As the agreementis not being renewed the inference is that the of the north minoiity party-the Country, partyi n the composite vented the Ministry from carrying out agreement, the Prime Minister has proposed that the industry should establish a Pool free from the control of the Commonwealth Government, and buy raw sugar for the 1923-24 season at not more than £27 per ton of 94 net titre f.o.b. m ill , andThe Pool to provide sugar for the purpose of manufactured goods for export at a price equal to the current world's parity. The price for raw sugar for the 1924-25 season to be determined after investigation by a tribunal,, and to be' based upon the cost of efficient production in reasonably good districts and under normal conditions; such price not to exceed £27 10s. per ton. What if the cost of production is more than £ 2 7 per ton ? Let us examine how generous the Government were when they made that offer. I am not blaming the growers for accepting it ; on the contrary, I advised them to accept it as being better than the alternative of handing the whole business over to the Colonial Sugar Refining CompanyOn the 25th of July Java whites were £28 19s. £9 7s. 6d. per ton higher than that paid per tion; Cuba whites, £31 19s.; American' granulated, £31 15s. Add duty and other charges amounting to about £12 per ton. and you will see thut the cost of raw sugar landed in Australia would be £40 19s., £43 19s., and £43 15s. respectively. As the world's parity is based on Java"" whites,"" let us take' the co3t of imported sugar at the prices quoted on the 5th June, 1923, about the time when the Prime Minister went to Queensland. The f.o.b. quote for Java ""brown"" was £ 2 8 10s. per ton. Add to that the cost of refining, shipping, freight, Belling fees, and duty, & c , amounting to £23 10s., and the landed cost was £ 5 2 for refined sugar, representing a retail price of about 5-Jd. community would have had to pay if sugar had been imported from Java at that time. Cuban ""raws"" on the same date were quoted at £29 15s. f.o.b. Refining, shipping freights, Colonial Sugar Refining Company's managing costs, processing, and selling, would have amounted to another £25 15s., making a total of £ 5 5 10s. per ton, or a retail price of 6d. per pound, which shows that the present price offered by the Pool, 4Jd., at which the growers are prepared to supply, and in return ask that they get a five years' embargo on imGovernment preported sugar, is very reasonable. The price of sugar in England until recently that promise. Instead of the was 8£d. per l b . , and it is now 7£d. The price in America was 6d., and is now 5d. per lb. I admit that there has been a slight drop in the price of sugar abroad recently. Java sugar, about the end of July, was about £22 per ton. D u ty and Other charges would bring the price to £37 Is. 8d., or about the same price as Queensland sugar; but by buying Queensland sugar you are supporting a. great Australian industry. If that policy is good for the secondary industries it is good for the sugar industry. I desire to deal briefly with 'the price of sugar during the control period. Up to 1915 it was 3d. per l b . ; from January, 1916, to 26th January, 1920, it. was 3Jid. per l b . ; and . thereafter, u n t i l recently, it was 6d., although it would never have been more than 4£d. but for the purchases made abroad. From 1915 to 1920 Australia spent £16,750,000 in importing sugar, exclusive of duty, and the price for these importations was to the local producer under the present agreement. What would that money have meant if it had been spent in Australia ? It would have brought prosperity to thousands of people. Surely there is something more than sentiment in the White Australia policy. If that money had been .expended in .this country, would it not' have been a great boon, not only to Queensland, but also to the whole of the Commonwealth? Australia has paid, on an average, only 4d. per lb. for sugar during the last ten years, whilst during the war America paid in the vicinity of Is. I d . ; Italy, Is. 6d.; France, Is. 6 d . ; and Java, lOd. Britain paid That is what the prices ranging from 7d. to Is. 2d., and in May of this year refined sugar was £66 per ton in England, or 8 i d . per l b . ; it is now £46 13s. 4d. per ton. The sugar industry in Australia during the period of Government control saved the consumers approximately £17,000,000. The sugar accounts supplied to Parliament by the former Ministerf o r Trade and Customs( Mr Rodgers) showed that the foreign "" r a w s "" imported from 191:5 to 1922 inclusive totalled 475,947 tons, and the average -rate per ton gross was £37 19s. During the same period the Australian "" raws "" purchased totalled 1,412,000 tons, at the average rate per ton gross of £25 17s. l i d . Mark the difference. Had the whole of Australia's requirements of sugar been purchased on the world's markets at world's parity, Australia's sugar bill would have -amounted to £71,000,000, instead of -£54,000,000 for Australian "" raws,"" including £5,000,000 worth of foreign '""raws,"" as was the case. figures show a saving of. £17,000,000 to the Australian consumer as a direct benefit from the local industry. The Federal Royal Commission on the cost of living in Australia reported that a man and his wife aud three children would consume, on the average, 5^ lbs. of sugar per week. With sugar at 4$d. per lb., it would cost such a family 2s. I d . per week for sugar. A reduction of I d . per lb. would mean a reduction of only 5|d. per week in the household account. Rents and other charges were increased much more than the price of sugar, but they provoked less outcry, because the wealthy interests which denounce the sugar industry give no opposition to high rentals and profiteering. We have been told that the depression in the f r u it industry is due to the increase in the price of sugar. It is not. at Benalla at which a motion in favour of the renewal of the Sugar Agreement was carried unanimously. sugar, the less we get for our fruit. must blame the jam manufacturer and not the sugar-grower. Under the agreement which was so bitterly opposed he obtained the sugar he requires at 4^d. per lb. as against 2|d. in 1914. Comparing pre-war prices with those of to-day, the price of plum jam has risen from 4d. to 7d., and canned pears from. 4.8d. to 7.9d. per lb. Jam contains 50 per cent, sugar. The increase in price of sugar is accountable for less than Id. per lb. of the increased price of jam, and £d. per lb. of the increase in the price of canned fruit. That leaves 2d. and 3d. respectively due to other causes. Australian manufacturers of jam for export obtain sugar at £28 per ton, less 5 per cent, for cash within seven days, or £26 12s. per ton, as compared with the wholesale price of £42 and the retail price of £36 13s. 4d. They get a rebate of £14 per ton, and preferential treatment under the British Tariff of £4 5s. 7d. per ton, oh the sugar contents of their jams for using Empire-grown sugar. The British jam manufacturer has to' pay something like £48 10s. per ton, and in May last, paid considerably more. The Australian manufacturer pays £21 10s. Those after all rebates are taken off jams for export to England. Only 32 per cent, of the total production of frui t in Australia is processed. The remainder is eaten in the raw. Therefore, if sugar were given to the jam manufacturer for nothing, there would still be depression in the fruit industry. The honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Watson), for whom I have a great respect, visited Queensland and went into a sugar district as a prospective buyer of land. Of course, every one he met who had land to sell made out a good case. The honourable member said that he found that land-owners were wanting £100 per acre for sugar laud. Some of the Mildura improved land, where fruit is grown, is priced as high us £300 per acre. Bacchus Marsh land for lucerne growing is £120 per acre, and land at Maitland brings the same price. Moreover, the sugar land which was shown to the honourable member for Fremantle must have had a crop on it . Allow 17% tons of cane to the acre, and S tons of cane to produce a ton of sugar. The 17£ tons of cane, at an average price of 50s. per ton, would produce £43 15s., and the sugar from an acre of land is worth £54 at present prices. On that land there must have been also improvements, buildings, and manures. The honourable member said that in the years 1918 to 1922 inclusive the average price of sugar in Java was £27 per ton. That, of course, was bleached sugar. He said also that in 1920 the price of Java sugar was £57 per ton. The absolutely authentic figures, as revealed by various offers, quotations, acceptances, &c, are that Java raw sugar, on 18th October, 1918, was £20 12s. 6d. per ton, and, on 19th November, 1918, £21 per ton. The average price for 1918 was £19 13s. I d . per ton. Add the £6 per ton duty, to the average price of raw sugar, and £6 per ton for freight, landing charges, and",88,Department Or Trade And Customs

401,Mr Forde,"The honourable membercommission, and the lauded price for Java sugar for that year was approximately £31 per ton. The Australian price was £18 from 1915 to 1918, and then £21 per ton. In 1919, the price of raw sugar in Java varied from £25 to £7S 7s. 6d., and Mauritius sugar was £80 per ton. The average price of Javu sugar was £47 3s. lOd. per ton. If to that is added duty, freight, landing charges, and commission, the landed cost price in Australia was £60 10s., as compared to the price of £21 per ton for Queensland sugar during the same period. In 1920, Java sugar varied from £22 to £119 per ton, an average of £67 l is . per. ton. The average landed price in Australia was £S1 l is . Tho price for Queensland sugar was £21 for part of the year, then £30 6s. 8d. per ton. In 1921, Java prices for raw sugar were from £16 5s. to £42 per ton, an average of £29 4s. per ton. Add freight, landing charges, commission, duty, &c, totalling £12, and the landed cost i u Australia was £41 4s., as against £30 6s. 8d. for the Queensland product. In 1922, there was a drop in price. Java sugar varied in price from £15 15s. to £20 10s. per ton, an average of £18 l is . 6d. ""If all charges and duty were added to that, the cost landed in Australia would have been £30 l is . 6d., as compared with £30 6s. 8d. for Queensland sugar. From my intimate knowledge of the sugar industry, I can assure the Committee that the workers are not profiteer-: ing, and that the growers are not obtaining anything more than a reasonable return. The average contract rate for cutting cane is 23s. per day, and the average wage in the mills is 2s. per hour. The mills only work for periods of from two to five months, the industry being seasonal. The statistics I have quoted prove that the falling off in the fruit industry is not attributable to the increase in the price of Queensland sugar; and I sincerely hope that the Government will stabilize the industry by giving a five years' embargo. a.m.] I support the complaint made by the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Marks) regarding the impossibility of getting straight-out answers to questions which honourable members ask of Ministers in the House. That also has been . my experience, and I want to give honourable members some idea of how business is being conducted by this Government. Some time ago a certain firm in Tasmania secured^ through the Commonwealth Government, a contract with the Government of the United States. The amount involved was a substantial sum, and the balance ;lue on the contract, £8,062, has been in; the hands of the Commonwealth Government for the last two years. Repeated demands have been made by the contractor for payment, but, so far, he has been unable to get a settlement. In fairness to the new Comptroller of Customs it must be said that he has intimated to mo his intention to do all he possibly can to expedite the settlement. the contract? tract. The matter .in dispute is now being dealt with by the Crown Law oflicers, though I fail to understand why a straight-out contract at so much per lb. should be referred to the legal branch of the Attorney-General's Department. I should like now to direct attention to the unsatisfactory position in connection with light and harbour dues. The Government have taken' over all. the lighthouses and lights, with the exception of harbour lights. In Tasmania, certain of these lights have been made automatic, with the result that in the case of two lighthouses six families formerly engaged in caring for them have been discharged, and the dwelling-houses attached to the lighthouses removed. I have no objection to this course, which I realize is dictated by economy, but it is extraordinary that, since the Commonwealth Government have taken over control of lights and lighthouses, the light dues on a 1.2,000-ton vessel visiting Hobart amount to £250, compared with £25 when the lights there were under the jurisdiction of the Hobart Marine Board. If the Commonwealth Government have effected economies in expenditure on lighthouses and lights, why this great increase in light dues? This is a matter which, I think, deserves serious, consideration, because of its effect upon shipping. Thousands of tons of shipping have gone out of Australia since' the war. I think it is a well-established fact that increased",92,Department Or Trade And Customs

Hitherto the apple-grower has never had one penny piece from the Government; but assistance has been given to the grower of soft fruits. If the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Austin Chapman) is anxious to help the fruit-growing industry he should treat growers of apples in the same way as those engaged in t i e meat industry in Queensland have been treated, by giving them i d . per lb. bounty, and the export of all, apples should have the same. endeavour to insure cheaper freights. conditions I cannot see how freights can be: lowered.

The only way in which the Government can. help the industry is by the payment of a bounty. for Capricornia ( Mr Forde) had a good deal to say about sugar. put the position of the f r u it industry in its relation to sugar costs in Australia. One-half the soft f r u it produced in Tasmania is made into jam, and I remind the honourable member that in a t in of jam there is over 200 per cent, more sugar cost than f r u it cost. The more we have to pay for sugar the less the fruit-grower can get for his product. in a Ib. of jam is 50 per cent. talking about. A 2-1L. t in of jam contains 50 per cent, of f r u it and 50 per cent, of sugar, but sugar costs the manufacturer 3^d. per lb., and the f r u it I d . per lb. The honourable member cannot get away from this important fact. The jam manufacturer has to pay £.30 18s. per ton for his sugar, and only I d . per lb. for his f r u it . Thus the sugar cost of a tin of jam is 200 per cent, above the cost of the f r u it . It follows, therefore, that the more the manufacturer has to pay for his sugar, the less the f r u it grower can get for his f r u it . TheM in direct attention to the ister for Trade and Customs informed the of the Committee.

One grower who sent twenty-five cases of apples to England received only 7d., and in another instance a returned soldier exported twenty-five cases of apples, which realized £ 5 5s. in London, but after expenses were paid he received only 1.3s. 9d. Out of that amount he had to meet the costs of orchard, materials, cases, and cover the cost of his own labour."" The account sales in connection with/this case have been submitted to the Minister.

454,Mr Mackay,"The honourable memremarks to which I must refer. I assurewill read, answer the points raised by the honourable member for Franklin. They are as follow:1. What is the percentage of Australian grown fruits processed into jams and canned fruits for export?-Australia n fruits processed (a) into jams for export equal 1.53 per cent, of the total fruits produced; (6) nito canned fruits for export, equal .49 per cent, of the total fruits produced. 2. What are (o) the estimated quantity of added sugar contents per lb. of jam and canned fruits; and (6) the cost of such sugar?-(a ) Jam, 9.6 oz.; canned fruits, 1.6 oz.; (6) jam, 2.55d.; canned fruits, .425d. 3. Is it a fact that a rebate of import duty is granted by the British Government on all Australian jams and canned fruits containing sugar produced in the British Dominions?Yes; the rebate is one-sixth of the ordinary sugar duty, or £4 5s. 6d. per ton on the sugar contents. (The information contained in 1 and 2 is based on the average quantity of Australian fruits processed into jams and canned -fruits for export during the nine years 1912-13 to 1920-21.) It is quite apparent, therefore, that so far as the cost of the sugar content of jam is concerned, it is comparatively trifling, and certainly would not interfere in any way with the sale of jam. think the public w ill understand that the remarks of the honourable member for Capricornia to-night were not made with the sole object of assisting the sugar industry. made to embarrass the Government, and could not therefore benefit the sugar industry, otherwise I would gladly support the amendment. think that by this time the Government must realize the harm they are doing to the country by l i m it i ng the debate on the Estimates in the way they have done. I wish especially to deal with the regulation issued by the Ministerf o r Trade and Customs imposing restrictions on the exportation of the fauna of Australia. I am inclined to think that the Department is not f u l l y seized of the harm which this -regulation is doing. If the M in ister w ill go into the matter further he w ill realize this. ment I propose to read some correspondence which passed between myself and the Minister on this matter. the 29 th March there was published in the Commonwealth Gazette, No. 23, a regulation prohibiting the exportation of certain birds. It was noted by b i r d dealers in South Australia, and I was approached by them. They are not very numerous, because as honourable members are aware, their's is not a very flourishing business. The regulation imposes very great hardship upon those engaged in that business. I have not very much knowledge of t h e . birds of Australia, .but I believe that the restrictions placed upon their export are more drastic than they need be. I received a letter from a bird dealer in ' Adelaide on the subject, and I interviewed the inspector of game and fisheries in South Australia. I want to make it clear to the Minister that the exportation of game and birds from South Australia is regulated by the Game and Fisheries Act of that State. I have not only seen the inspectorof game and fisheries, but have had conversations w i th a son of the curator of the Adelaide Zoological Gardens. This gentleman is honorary zoologist to the London Zoological Museum, and has gone I to the Old Country. The Minister w ill realize from the information I am in a position to give that the opposition to the regulation is not merely a factious opposition. ""When the regulation was promulgated, the bird dealer to whom I refer wrote to me, and I forwarded extracts from his letter to the Ministeri n I believe they were the following terms:12th June, 1923. Hon. Austin Chapman, M.H.R., Minister for Customs. Dear Sir, I desire to bring under your notice what is urged to be an injustice entailed upon the dealers in birds, &c., by the Proclamation No. 75, published in the Commonwealth Gazette, No. 23, of 29th March '.ast, having relation to the export of birds. In doing so it would, perhaps, be best for me to quote you a letter I have received on the subject from one of the largest exporters of birds in South Australia:"" This proclamation prohibits the export of a large number of birds on the unprotected list in this State, which we in tbe past have been able to export. "" AH birds and animals exported by me are forwarded under permit issued by the Minister of Industry. The Chief Inspector of Fisheries and Game also personally inspects all birds and In proof of my stateaccommodation provided for them at the time of shipment, and his approval, is necessary before they ore allowed to leave.

"" On all my shipments I accompany the birds to bhe place of destination, and an attendant is also engaged. A limited number only are put iuto each cage, and are well looked after, the mortality amongst them being practically nil. I also import and accompany birds from South Africa and other places under the same conditions. Mr Seth Smith, of the London Zoo, was greatly impressed with the conditions under which my birds travel and the health in which they are, landed. The London press has also favourably commented on all of my shipments. "" I have orders MI hand now for the shipment of birds in the coming season for the London Zoo, and if I cannot export them my loss will be a severe one. I trust that, in view of the above facts, you will place this matter before the Minister on my behalf,pointing out to him how harshly this proclamation will affect genuine dealers desiring to carry on a botiu fide business in this direction, and request that I be allowed to continue my shipments of birds under permit and inspection as in the past. I am dependent on this business for my living, and if the proclamation is adhered to, my living wili be taken away and my trade ruined. "" MightI also point out that thousands upon thousands of ducks and quail are shot and killed annually in Australia, and yet tbe proclamation will not allow live birds to be exported. Many of the birds covered by the proclamation have been proved to be terribly destructive on farms, orchards, &c."" I have also been interviewed by others interested in the export of animals and birds, and the consensus of opinion is that the objected to proclamation will do untold harm. The stationinaster at Ivimba, on the west coast of South Australia, avers:"" There arc thousands of Ring Neck Parrots (Pt. Lincoln); they do great damage to the wheat in stacks and on trucks, boring boles, in the bags, and in consequence a lot of wheat is lost between here -and Pt. Lincoln."" Mr Minchin, who is proceeding to London Jia Honorary Curator to the London Zoological Gardens, states :"" My experience is that the Blue Mountain and Pt. Lincoln Ring Neck Parrot infest the whole of the west coast, and docs great damage to the fruit crops, and is a groat trouble to the new settlers in those areas. The Chief Inspector of Fisheries and Game in Melbourne informed me that when he was here in April last, he was surprised to find how numerous and destructive the Pt. Lincoln parrots w*re on fruit, &c, also the Blue Mountain parrot on fruit. As an example, at the Government Forest all fruit is bagged on the trees to protect it. Many farmers said they were partially protected, and asked me to let the authorities know that they rivalled the -Ttogella in destruotiveness."" He also veferred me to letters sent by Mr L. R. Scainniell to Mr Museum, MrJ . Kershaw; deputy, Mr. Rodgers, late Minister for Customs, on the 17th October, 1922, and Mr A. G. Rymill on tlie 27th September, 1922. I would esteem it a favour if you would have these letters brought before you, and give consideration to the matters contained herein. only birds that are being exported by the dealer to whom the honourable member refers?. of birds, but none the export of which is forbidden by the Game and Fisheries Act of South Australia.

The Minister for Trade and Customs should have known that. He replied to my letter to the effect that he was having inquiries made into the matter. It was an urgent matter, so far as the bird dealer was concerned, because trapping takes place in August, September, and early in October, as that is the best time for shipments to be made to the Old Country. A week or so ago I brought a letter from the bird dealer and a covering letter from the inspector of game and fisheries to the Minister, and I received the following reply from him, dated 2nd August:I am in receipt of your letter of the 13th inst., forwarding extracts from eommiinicfttions received by you. Adverting to your letter of 12th June, l beg to forward herewith for your information list showing names of gentlemen who have been appointed to the Victorian advisory committee to assist this Department in' oonnexion with applications which may be received for permits to export Australian birds and animals. Action is being token for the appointment of similar committees in other States. With regard to future applications which may be received for permits to export birds and animals which are on the prohibited list, fcliia Department will be guided by advice from the State Advisory Committees. It has been decided that the exportation of such birds and' animals for purely commercial purposes will not be permitted. That is to say, the request was turned down, apparently on the advice of the' Advisory Committee for Victoria. The members of that Committee are the following : -Representin g the ""University and learned societies, Sir Baldwin Spencer; deputy, Professor Agar; Zoological and Acclimatization Society, D r .

Ihe Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, which justifies its existence, are really associations, of enthusiasts who quite miss the practical side of. the question. are inspected on the boat, and their cages examined. The bird dealer who has communicated with me does not require to have his birds counted in London. He can sell at sight, because the mortality amongst the birds he exports is practically nil. There have been shipments -of birds from other States which, when they arrived at Adelaide, have shown great neglect in the accommodation provided for the birds. Some persons export birds by giving the butcher or the cook on board a boat a few pounds to look after them on the voyage, and they are sold for' what they 'will fetch on arrival in the Old Country. That kind of thing should be prevented. I have .been informed that the Game aud Fisheries Department in South Australia see that all necessary care is taken in the export of birds. The Advisory Committee in Victoria, can do no more in this matter than the Inspector of Game and Fisheries is doing in Adelaide. I ask the Minister for Trade and Customs to agree to accept the recommendations of the South Australian inspector. cockatoo in South Australia ? It is a very great pest. member refers to the sulphur crested cockatoo. That bird is mentioned in the correspondence, and galahs are also referred to. I .should like the Ministerv to look further into this matter. must realize that his regulation flies in the face of the authorities in South Australia,, and is ruining the business of at least. one man there. -The ' honourable member for Adelaide has raised an important question. It is desired to prevent cruelty in the export of birds and animals, because other animals than birds are. covered by the regulation. The State authorities have no power to control the export of anything, but in tection of birds and other animals against cruelty. It may be, as the honourable member for Adelaide has said, that conditions are all that could be desired in South Australia, but the matter has to be looked at generally. Recent experience has shown that further precautions than those adopted in at least some States are Birds exported from Adelaide required, and there is, therefore, good i ground for Commonwealth interference in the matter. Another aspect of the subject is that Australia is being denuded of certain rare birds and animals. Not long ago four birds were seen in New South Wales not far from Sydney, which had not been seen in the vicinity for about twenty years. Their discovery was reported in one of the bird journals. No more was heard of them until it was known that two birds of the species had appeared in New York. Surely that kind of thing shows the need for rigid control. Some of our animals are very rare,and scientists say that some may hold secrets which may be of the very greatest value to humanity. One name mentioned by the honourable member for Adelaide was that of Dr. Colin Mackenzie, who has conducted extensive researches relating to Australian animals. He is my authority for the statement that a great contribution, may be made to science and human well-being by a proper study of Australian animals. Some of these auimals are being exported, and their export should be rigidly controlled. I agree with the honourable member for Adelaide that birds which are pests may be freely exported. It has been suggested that a disinterested committee should be appointed, which would not look at the subject from only one point, of view. He are being, destroyed, they might as well be exported is proposed to form committees in other States so that f u ll local information will be obtainable. I agree that birds and animals that are a pest in this country may well be exported under humane conditions. I desire to say only a few words about sugar.

It appears to be assumed that the Commonwealth has power to arrange for the purchase of sugar, a.nd'to control the retail prices at which it may be sold. wealth has no power to enter into agreements in time of peace, the purpose of which,is to control the wholesale or retail price of any article. It may impose a Customs duty or an Excise duty, or grant a bounty, but otherwise it can exercise no control. In view of the decision of the H i g h Courti n the recent wool tops case, any persons relying upon the supposition that the Commonwealth has power to make an agreement to control sugar, .and to regulate its sale at certain prices, may tind that they are making a very serious mistake.

There is no other coast in the world so badly lighted as fche north-west coast of this continent I protest against the Government curtailing the time available for the discussion of the Estimates to such an extent that, although I have travelled 8,000 miles to gather information, I am unable to bring important matters before the Committee. When I spoke i u the Budget debate I intended to deal with the matter of lighthouses, but as my notes were rather lengthy, the Treasurer suggested that I should defer my remarks, and promised that I should get an opportunity later. This is the opportunity -seve n minutes to deal with highly important and technical subjects. The Government, deserve the most severe condemnation for forcing the Estimates through the Committee without allowing an opportunity for my constituents to have their views properly represented. Mr O'KEEFE (Denison) [4.25 a.m.]. I join in the protest made by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie ( MrA . Green). There are at least half-a-dozen items ' in this Department concerning which I would have sought information The Commonfrom the Minister had an opportunity been afforded. But what chance have I to deal with these matters when I know that the guillotine w i ll operate in a few minutes? j-'he procedure adopted by the Government is a damnable outrage on the rights of the people. I do not think it will be repeated, because the people are not fools or blind, and they w ill not stand this sort of thing more than once. The Government, and the party behind it who are responsible for taking away the rights of the people's representatives, w ill sooner or later "" get it in, the neck."" spoke for an hour and a half on the iiudget. MrO ' KEEFE I did not; but does I had the honourable member suggest that an hour and a half is too long for a membeif to speak in a session that has extended over ten weeks? If I had occupied the f u l l time which the Standing Orders' allow me, what right would the honourable There is a stretch of member have to complain ? Do the people who send us here expect us to have our right of speech taken fro m us ask the because the Leader of the Government, m pursuance of his intention to represent Australia at the Imperial Conference, fails in his duty to the people of the Cornwealth ? If there is no other man on the Ministerial side strong enough to lead L Parliament during his absence, if the right honourable gentleman does not trust nis Ministerial colleagues, and, therefore, thinks it necessary that Parliament shall be closed before he departs, he should have convened Parliament at least eight or ten weeks earlier. During this short session, I have exercised my right of speech only in regard to subjects which I knew were of special importanceto the people. W h a t chance have I of getting the information that I had intended to seek' in behalf of my constituents? I wanted particularly to question the M in ister regarding a matter that vitally affects the people who sent me here, and who, though small in number, have rights under the Constitution.

This is a very suitable hour of the morning for the protest I am about to make against the parsimony of the Government at present in office. Their treatment of some of the most hard working employees in its service is only what one would sweater. I refer to the office-cleaners in the employ of the Commonwealth. Those, in this city are paid on a basis calculated on the determination of a Victorian Wages Board, which fixes £ 3 2s. 4d. for a week of forty-four hours. That works out at Is. 5d. per hour. Government do not employ these officecleaners for forty-four hours per week. They employ them for only twenty-four hours a week, and pay them the miserable wage of Is. 5d. per hour or 34s. per week. occupation? opportunity to engage in any other occupation. Most of them are widows who have lost their breadwinners. They leave home about 5 o'clock in the morning to do office cleaning, and return to their homes to get the.ir children ready for school. afternoon after office hours. get twenty-four hours' work week, and are paid at the rate of Is. 5d. per hour. Under the determination of the Victorian Wages Board, if they were employed for only twenty-two hours per week, they would have to be paid at the rate of Is. l i d . per hour. In order to avoid the necessity of paying these people casual rates, the Government employs them for two hours over the minimum, and at the rate of Is. 5d. per hour. It should not require any stressing of the matter to convince the Minister that this is not fair treatment for these women. There are not many of those women, and the sum that would be involved in the suggested increase would not be great. The Government should be a little more just to those who are probably the lowest paid workers in its employ. some of the cleaning material they use? complaint on that score has been made to me. No one will deny that these women are badly paid. Representations have been made by their union. of any such representations since I have been in office. expect from. a miserable representation's have been made to the Department, and that the complainants have received no satisfaction. I do not like mentioning these grievances in Parliament, if tliey can be rectified in any other way, but I have been told that the cleaners could get no redress from the DeThe partment. There are plenty of private employers who' would not take such a paltry advantage of their employees as the Government are taking of the women office-cleaners. a.m.] I congratulate the Minister for Works upon the effort he has made in the House and in his Department to have, this Parliament removed to Canberra as soon as possible. Even before a motion had been carried in the House, at the instance of the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Mahony), the Minister had given proof of his bona fide intention to do what lay in his power to have the They return again in the Constitutional provision regarding the They Federal Capital honored. This House per has now definitely resolved that the Goveirnor-General shall be asked to convene the next Parliament at Canberra. I am sorry that there is not on the Estimates-a small amount for the survey, or some other preliminary work, in connection with the proposed railway between Kyogle and Brisbane. This line has been discussed between Commonwealth and State Ministers as part of the scheme for the unification of gauges. Recently the Minister for Works, whom I commend for endeavouring, by travel, to learn first-hand Australia's requirements, made a trip through Southern Queensland and the Kyogle district, covering a portion of the proposed route. He saw some of the magnificent country that a railway would open up, and the terrible isolation of the settlers there, and he expressed surprise that such a fine territory should, be absolutely undeveloped.

I am disappointed, therefore, that there is not a sum on the Estimates to indicate that the construction of the line is to be proceeded with. I know that the Minister for Works is quite in earnest in his advocacy of the railway, but the five State Governments of the mainland are concerned in the question of cost. The Kyogle-Brisbane line is not to be merely a district utility; in character, and to link up great country it is to be portion of a greatscheme affecting the whole Commonwealth in respect of defence and transcontinental communication.

The Minister for Works and Railways was mainly responsible for the main roads development scheme, which was recently approved by the House. I congratulate him upon that proposal, because the expenditure involved will be of inestimable benefit to country districts. Roads, particularly those in the country, play a peculiar part in our national life. one may travel by trains only at such times as are suitable to the general community or the Department, the road is Open to anybody at any time. And all may travel on it as they please-in Rolls-Royce motor car, on horse, on a bicycle, or on foot. more convenient, and transport' easier and more rapid. not only as great highways between cities, but also as the arteries of industry tradesmen, bricklayers, carpenters, and in the country, carrying produce from outlying hamlets to the towns and goods from the town shops to the settlers. A good road means less freighting, a saving of time, and an increase of comfort. Mr It. Green. Anything that will add to the comfort and prosperity of the people should be strongly supported by honourable members, and roads should be recognised as of great assistance to pioneers in the back-blocks, who are fighting so hard to make this country the success it should be. As a general rule, the city gets all the plums in the form of expenditure, but the grant for new roads is an exception. The roads are not to be built in the cities, but are to be developmental districts. I again congratulate tlie Minister for Works and Railways on the service he is rendering the Commonwealth. I direct the attention of the Minister for Works and Railways to the necessity of providing adequate accommodation for workmen engaged at the Federal Capital site. During the last two months the weather has been anything but pleasant, and a number of cases of influenza has been reported. Most of the men are housed in old military huts or .canvas .tents, and therefore their living , conditions are anything but satisfactory. If we are in earnest in connection with the construction of Parliament House, the hostel, and other public buildings, it will be necessary to insure an adequate supply of skilled labour. To do this it is essential that suitable accommodation should, be available, not only for the workmen, but also for their wives and children. . The contractor for the hostel has made the suggestion that suitable' temporary weatherboard dwellThey are free to all. Whereas ings of three or four rooms could be erected quite handy to where building operations were being carried out for about £180 each. These would serve the workmen during the period of a capital construction, and they could afterwards be removed.

I know that scores of expert other artisans would be prepared to go to Canberra and take up work there if they could depend upon having accommodation for their wives and children.

In the Governor General's establish-, ment, on page 271, there appears an iteni £ 4 0 0 for telephones at, I presume, the Melbourne and Houses. There seems to be something wrong.

If the pruning, knife is to be applied to employees in the Public Service, we should also insist upon proper economy being observed in the Governor General's establishments. The sum could very well .be cut in half. The Governor General is paid £10,000 per year, and he should be expected to pay his own telephone bills. Honourable members are expected to have telephone connection from their residences, and to pay the ground rental and for all originating calls. It is not fair that the taxpayer should be saddled with this huge amount in respect of the Governor General's telephone services. There is also an item for china and glass at the Governor General's establishments. This, too, is quite unnecessary. If , through any. carelessness, breakages occur in the Governor General's household, the taxpayer should not be called upon to replace tlie broken articles. item, is £100 for fittings and furniture. Last year the expenditure under this heading was £ 1 9 6 , making the total for the two years just under £ 3 0 0 . We are entitled to some explanation from the i Minister. Does this expenditure represent the removal of fittings or cupboards to suit the likes or dislikes of some of the Governor General's household? One other item, £2,550, is for non-recurring works at Melbourne and Sydney Government Houses. What' does this mean ? explanation should be given.

I trust that the Minister will take steps to have this officer's position re-classified, and see what he can do to pay adequately an officer doing such good work. desire to direct attention to the apportionment of the money which the GovernSydney Government ment has granted for road construction. I may mention, by way of explanation, that when the Minister for Defence( Mr. Bowden) visited Queenscliff a month or two ago he was taken over a road which connects Swan Island and' the fort, to see for himself the damage that has been done by the very heavy traffic of the Defence Department. He was so impressed by what he saw that he felt that something should be done by the Government to help keep the road in a good state of re-pair. The borough is in an unfortunate position. It is very small in area, and the rateable properties are so limited that it is obliged to appeal to the Government for assistance in the maintenance of this road which, as I have said, is used almost exclusively by the Defence Department. The same may be said of another road in another shire of my electorate, namely, the road from the Laverton Railway Station to the Point Cook Flying School. This is also used almost exclusively by Another the Defence Department, and up to the present the Government have contributed nothing towards its upkeep. I understand that in connection with, the Queenscliff road the Government have previously given a grant, but I am informed by a ' councillor of the Werribee Shire that there has been no grant towards the maintenance of the Laverton-Point Cook"" road. To make the position worse, there is, along the latter road, a considerable area of land owned by the Federal and State Some Governments, and, of course, it is not ' revenue-producing.

However, there has been an improvement since Ithe present Minister assumed olice., and although consideration has been shown to the single men 'there is stall room 'for .further improvement. The honourable member'.for Grey :( Mr Lacey) referred to the houses at Raw'Iinua, which are -.a big improvement on those constructed at various other points. We have been informed that the cottages cost fhe ""Department £450 each to construct, and that the rental of JJa. fid. per week is to cover the interest at 6 per cent, on .the capital cost, and water and ' sanitary charges.

The employees are naturally 'dissatisfied with the present conditions, and I trust that, at an early date, a .marked improvement will be made. I am indebted to the Minister for advising me that this would be 'a .good opportunity to deal with the question of lighthouses. During my trip to Kimberley a few weeks ago, I wasistruck with the absence of lighthouses along the north-west tcoast of Western .Australia. JErom. Cape Leveque, .which is the western point on Kings Sound, upon which Derby stands, to Port Darwin, which is a distance of '625 miles, there is not a single vicinity of .the shore is .very small, the distance I .have mentioned is perhaps the longest on which .there .are no lighthouses. The risks are indeed great. I ask ionorable .members to examine the plan before me, .and they will see that this particular portion of the coast of Australia is .heavily indented. In the {pilot book of the Australian coast, which is the .master mariner's guide, it is stated that this portion of the coast is the most indented .of -any of our littoral. Along that coast, with the exception perhaps of the Bay of Pundy, the highest tides in the world prevail, .and .©r.dina-ry spring lides of .2.8 feet /rush -along the coast and create & current,, in places, equal to 10 knots an hour. Some1 of the steamers trading along that portion of the coast 'do imt average 10 knots, and it will 'therefore be seen that if vessels ;are in tbe vicinity of theicoast their danger is very great owing to the presence of numerous islands. The number of 'shipwrecks has not 'been large because the trade on that portion of the coast is comparatively small, and the skilled master mariners in charge of the vessels exercise great caution. I have been in conversation with some of these men, who have made certain recommendations as to where lighthouses should be placed, which I shall now submit to the Minister. The lighthouses on the whole of the Western Australian coast number only nineteen, whilst the number on other parts of the Australian 'coast 'is over 100. As the Western Australian coast is 'etraal to one-third of our whole coast line, -it will be seen that ""the lighting; is altogether inadequate^. It may be said that, because vessels, pass, along, that coast, only occasionally,, lighthouses are not required,, but tha need, ia all the greater, because on the well-lighted' portions of the coast the course is well known. lights apart, from the leading lights, into the. harbors? tfwo», ships a monthtoPortDarwin, but the Government have provided ten lights between Cape Don and PtortDai-win, which is a very short distance, while on the ©Cher stretch of 625-* mileswhich I have mentioned there is not one.

The writer of the pilot book gives some particulars about the natives in these districts. On page 154 of the book, referring to the natives near Cape Londonderry, he saysThe reports of the treacherous character of the natives should be borne in mind. Of Napier Broome Bay, he says-;The natives on the shores of Napier Broome Bay, and also on Eclipse and adjacent islands, I shall only be able to reply briefly to were hostile at the time of survey.

With respect to the Kyogle-Brisbane railway, I can assure honourable members that the Commonwealth Government is anxious to cooperate with the State iu constructing the line. Negotiations are going on at present. by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie in explanation of the need for lights on our north-west coast. I appreciated very much what he said. Lighthouses are under the control of the Department of Trade and Customs. An amount of £140,000 has been .provided this year for two new vessels for tending lighthouses. One of these will work on the Western Australian coast. I was glad to hear the reference to automatic lights. Already £250,000 has been spent in providing these lights, and. a saving of £11,000 a year has been made by removing the old type of light and replacing it with the new automatic light. I suggest that the honourable member state his case to the Department of Trade and Customs, which, I am sure, will give it the fullest consideration. view of the assurance that the Minister for expenditure of £10,000,000, which will Works and Railways has given, I desire to withdraw my amendment.

I shall not take up much time, as I know that honourable members desire to speak about post office' and telephone construction. I am very glad that the criticism levelled against the Department I have the As honour to administer has been very friendly. With regard to telephones, honourable members know that last year we spent something like £2,000,000 on constructional work. I want to pay a tribute, to Mr Poynton, who held the office of Postmaster-General prior to my taking over the administration of the Department. He set out to catch up A very fine speech was made with some of the arrears of construction, and he went so far as to widen ' the concessions to country districts generally. As an ex-sailor The present Government propose to further extend the facilities for communication in the country districts. Honourable members will recognise that this is a work of very great magnitude when they remember that we are spending this year some £4,000,000. If we had before us a proposal for the construction of a railway at a cost of £4,000,000 we would hardly expect to spend the money in one year. It is, however, proposed to spend the £4,000,000 on the Post and Telegraph Department's operations during the coming year. That is almost double the amount expended last year. I hope honourable members . will recognise that this is a very big work, and will give a great deal of employment. The expenditure will cover only works that are absolutely necessary, and that represent only a part of the be completed in a future programme of construction for 1924-25. The public seem to think that . it is quite an easy matter to make connexions with the telephone service, but when it is explained that it costs as much per mile to lay down conduits and cables in the capital cities as to lay down a line of railway, it will be seen that it is not an easy matter to make some of the connexions for which people are clamouring to-day. The arrears are very great. Something 'like 14,000 people are still waiting for con(Postmaster-Generalnexion with the telephone service. Since the present Government came into office we have connected some 3,000 per month, which, I think, is a very great feat.

Some honourable members opposite have said that most of the money is being expended in city areas, and others have said that most of it is being spent in country areas, so the Department would appear to have struck the happy medium. plain what is being done in both city and country areas. The references made by the honourable members for Hume( Mr Parker Moloney), Gabb), ( Mr A. to and not so much to the amount of £2,980,000 which appeared in the Loan Estimates for telephones and telegraph works. What we are proposing to spend is £3,200,000 on telephones and telegraphs; £729,366 on buildings, and £82,400 on sites. In 1922-23 we spent £2,000,000 on telephone and telegraph works, and £182,818 on buildings. of the £3,200,000 proposed to be expended this year is as follows:New South Wales £645,300 in metropolitan areas, and £701,200 in country areas, or a total of £1,346,500. In Victoria, £444,400 in metropolitan areas, and £326,900 in,country areas, or a total of £771,300. In Queensland, £159,500 in metropolitan areas, and 322,600 in country areas, total £482,100. In South Australia, £185,700 in metropolitan areas and £202,500 in country areas, total £338,200. In Western Australia, £56,100 in metropolitan areas and £132,600 in country areas, total £188,700. In Tasmania, £31,000 in metropolitan areas and £42,200 in country areas, total £73,200. These figures give a grand total of £1,472,000 for metropolitan areas, and £1,728,000 for country areas; 46 per cent, of the total expenditure will be in the metropolitan areas, and 54 per cent, in the country districts. I should say that this does not represent the whole of the money being expended in country districts for the reason that it is necessary to dismantle a good deal of work in city areas, and many switch boards, conduits and cables are transferred from city to country areas. The country districts get the benefit of this dismantled material with little cost to them. Taking that into consideration the actual amount Mr Oibsun, which is to be expended in the country districts will be much more than the figures I have just given. the dismantled material still debited to city works?' I propose to exrial is simply removed to country districts. Honourable members will understand that the capacity of conduits and cables in the capital cities is in some cases Angas( Mr soon outgrown by the. increased traffic and and, I think, Kalgoorlie the dismantled' material is quite useful Green) were particularly for the country districts. With regard to the expenditure on buildings, cable material there has been a great deal of difficulty in the past in getting this material. In city areas, very many applications for telephones have been outstanding for a very long time. It is a very difficult matter indeed because of the lack of cables to make the connexions required. I have explained that the cost of laying down conduits and cables of 1,000 The allocation pairs of wires amounts to over £5,000 per mile, and many would be subscribers must remain without connexions until such time as conduits are laid down, and the cable arrives from overseas. When we are in a position to do so, we shall, instead of connecting one subscriber, connect hundreds, or even a thousand, by a single cable. I must confess that the telephone system in the capital cities is very bad indeed, and the position in Sydney is probably worse tban in any of the other capital cities of Australia. There the junction lines between the exchanges are not sufficient for the number of persons who want connexions between them. There"" are only fifty junction lines for 500 people,and if more than fifty wish to be connected at one time, the whole automatic exchange is thrown out of order. As a result we are to-day really spoiling the valuable machinery contained in the exchanges. We are making an effort to have additional junction lines placed in position at the earliest date. We are trying to give the community as soon as possible the service which should be given in the capital cities ' as well as in the country districts.

The number of telephones connected Number of Circuits to on 30th June, 1922, was 258,477, and, on the 30th June, 1923, approximately be erected. 287,000, showing an increase of 28,523. In the five months since the present Government took office, an average of 3,000 Busselton subscribers per month has been connected, and half of those are in country districts. As a matter of fact, applications are being received at the rate of about 4,000 per month, so we have a good deal of leeway to make up before we can satisfy ftverybody. before all the applicants in big cities like Melbourne are connected? them w ill be connected in twelve months. We are laying down many conduits and cables w it h 1,000 pair wires in each, so that thousands of subscribers can be readily connected in a week or a fortnight after the exchanges are ready. In the past we have had a great difficulty in getting a supply of switchboards and cables, but at the present time orders are coming forward very well. The whole of the cable has been coming from England, but the Department has given a contract to an Australian f i r m to manufacture cable in the coming year. The whole of tlie orders for copper wire, totalling 50,000 or 60,000 miles, have been placed w i th an Australian firm. As indicating the progress that is being made and the revenue that is flowing into the telephone service, I may in for m the Committee that the revenue from calls in July, 1922, was £278,794, and in July, 1923, £302,283, representing an increase of £23,489. Similar figures could be quoted for every other month, and I 'feel sure that, if the Department were able to give prompter connection on the telephones, the business would be increased very largely. The new work to be put in hand w ill mean the employment of very many temporary hands. A t the present time, 2,655 returned soldiers are employed on telephone and telegraph works, and we propose to engage another 700 to help in carrying out the 1923-24 programme. Some of the concessions made to the public in regard to telephone services were stated in the Budget speech. In future, we propose to base trunk-line charges on direct mileage instead of route mileage. Very many country districts have lines running parallel, w it h in 10 or 1.5 miles, but the route mileage travelled by the telephone message may be 60 miles. B y adopting the direct mileage instead of the route mileage, we are placing country districts on exactly the same footing as the cities. Every country district subscriber w ill be able, without paying a trunk-line fee, to communicate within a 5-mile radius of the exchange to which he is connected. Country subscribers w ill thus be in the same position as if they were connected w i th a city exchange. H o w long w ill it be rental for the use of Government poles has been reduced from 10s. per mile to 5s. per mile for metallic circuit, or 2s. 6d. per mile per wire, and for lines constructed wholly by the Department from £ 2 to 30s. per mile; Formerly subscribers in country districts were asked to pay two years' rental in advance, while the city subscriber was asked for only one year's rental. I have directed that the city and country subscribers shall be placed on the same basis. If it is safe to accept one year's rental from a city subscriber, it should be equally safe to accept it from a man in the country. In the city, up to £65 per subscriber can be expended in providing a subscriber's line, but only £21 could be expended in the country. Henceforth, up to £65 may be spent on a country subscriber's line. A furthe r disability imposed on the country subscriber was that, even though there, were two or three applicants in a certain district, the Department would not erect .a line for more than 2 miles from the exchange. In future, if four or five people in ' a district make application to become subscribers, the limitation of £65 per subscriber w ill apply instead of the distance limitation. have to give a seven-years' guarantee? I do not think that prevails in the cities. and above the £65 per subscriber. mean that if five subscribers to a country exchange make application, the line may be extended a distance of 10 miles? to spend £ 6 5 per subscriber, and in this respect the country subscriber will be placed oh exactly the same footing as the subscriber in city areas. The honourable member for Bass( Mr Jackson) referred just now to the length of the poles. The Act does not permit wires being less than 12 feet in height being erected along fences, and less than 18 feet over roads. I intend to introduce an amendment of the Act to enable us to place wires on poles 8 feet high, instead of 12 feet along certain routes. It is not proposed to use these shorter poles in cities or towns, or in places where there are a number of wires, but in the more sparsely populated districts in Western Australia, QueensThe land, and the Northern Territory.

Mr O'KEEFE (Denison) [7.2 a . m . ] In the Postmaster-General's Department there is an item £30,000 for the conveyance of mails between the mainland and Tasmania by certain steamship companies, under contracts with the Department. I should like the Minister to give some information as to when these contracts will expire.' If they have only a short term to run, I suggest the advisability of not renewing them for a lengthy period, because this expenditure of £30,000 would .be an important factor in the profitable working of the Common-, wealth Line of steamers between the mainland and Tasmania. I know that I would not be in order if I referred at length to the necessity for the Commonwealth employing Government steamers in owing to the declaration of urgency in respect of the Estimates, I was deprived of my opportunity to refer to this matter when the Department which controls shipping was under discussion. Once again I enter my protest against this method of doing business. The action of the Government is preventing fair and . reasonable debate on the Estimates. Recently we passed a B ill which contains a provision for the appointment of a Board to take over and control the Commonwealth Line. authority to purchase suitable vessels, and if it considered that course desirable, to put Commonwealth vessels on the run between the mainland and Tasmania, in ships. This sum of £30,000 now being paid under contract to the various. shipping companies for' the conveyance of mails to and from Tasmania, wil l be a very important factor in the successful running of any Commonwealth steamers that may be put into commission in that trade. Unfortunately, owing to the tactics of the Government, I have been deprived of the chance to have a vote recorded in connection with a. motion for : the appointment of a commission to in quire into and' report upon the advisability of Commonwealth steamers engaging in the trade between the mainland I had an and Hobart. I hope, however, that we may yet have an opportunity of getting a vote, because I am satisfied that a majority of the members were sympathetically interested in the motion. The Commission could do its work within a week, and submit a report to Parliament. I believe that the Board to be appointed tocontrol Commonwealth shipping will give early attention to this question, and I am satisfied that it will not be long beforeCommonwealth vessels are put on the run between the mainland and Tasmania. In that event, the amount paid under themail contract with privately-owned vessels could be paid as a subsidy to the Commonwealth ships, and be an important factor in their success.

D u r in g the time. I have been a. member of this House, I have always received the greatest courtesy from postal officials, even down to the messenger boys, competition with privately-owned and I think it is only right to pay them some small tribute for the efficient service they render. The position held by the Minister has always been regarded as a political grave, but I am satisfied that if the present Postmaster-General continues his good work it w ill be a long time before it can again be so regarded. A good deal has been.said concerning thenecessity for providing country districts with the facilities enjoyed by the people in the metropolitan areas, and it is gratifying that the Government have submitted a policy which w ill materially",121,Australia Continued Western Australia Continued

513,Mr Lister,"E v e r since I have beentend to increase development in the outback country. The Minister will be justified in making inquiries into the n manner in which city telephone cabinets are working, in an endeavour to ascertain why they constantly get out of order. The honourable member for Bass (| Mr Jackson) mentioned this matter a few days ago, and I have lately had a similar experience. The telephones, at railway stations particularly, are frequently out of order, and consequently a good deal of revenue is lost. There is also an insufficient number of telephone cabinets in the metropolitan areas, and revenue is lost for this cause, because people cannot waste time in waiting an opportunity to call subscribers I was interested to hear the Minister's statement that it is proposed to manufacture cable in Australia. If this work is undertaken, employment will be provided for a large number of our own people. I trust that some of the cable coming forward will be ear-marked for Geelong, where there have been numerous complaints owing to persons being unable to get connected with the exchange. The installation of an additional switchboard at. the Geelong, Post Office is also a pressing need. The existing boards are full, and even if a permanent board is not available, perhaps the Minister will authorize the installation of a temporary board to accommodate 100 subscribers to overcome the present difficulty. Improvement should be made in the accommodation provided for the Geelong telephone attendants. The constant clicking of the apparatus must be very irritating to operators. I also understand that the temperature of the room in which they work has to be regulated, and that moist air, which would interfere with the delicate mechanism, must not be admitted. It is intended, I believe, to provide additional facilities for the telephone attendants in a room adjoining that which they now occupy, and I trust that provision will be made in this direction at an early date. The traffic on the trunk line between Geelong and Ballarat is frequently congested, and at times there is difficulty in establishing communication between the two pl'aces. The difficulty could be overcome by the construction of a line 8 miles in length from Fyansford to Murgheboluc, and I am glad to learn that this work which is now contemplated may soon be authorized. As the revenue of the Department has been buoyant, those,in charge of allowance post-offices might well be granted an additional allowance, as the amounts received in some cases are too small. I am sorry that a ""Werribee mail delivery service on the northern side of the railway line has not been arranged, and that the Department has not complied with the request of the Albion Ratepayers Association to place a letter-box on the Albion railway station. Naturally, all the work requiring attention in my electorate has not been done, but it is pleasing to know that attention has been given to many of the requests I have submitted. a.m.] I wish to refer briefly to the development of the wireless broad-casting system, which is a matter that should be given careful consideration by honourable members on account of its importance to our country districts. An agitation has been going on for some time for the provision of wireless broadcasting facilities. A deputation met the Postmaster-General recently, and in consequence a number of regulations have been framed which are on the. table of the House at present. Unless objection is taken to them by 15th August, they will become law and will have all the force of'an Act of Parliament. I have 'nothing to say i agains.t the action of the Postmaster General in endeavouring to establish this system.' If it is successful it will be a great boon to people who live in the more remote parts of the country. It will increase the pleasure of life to them, and will enable them to obtain information of important matters which occur in the capital cities or in other parts of Australia. BufI have received several letters which seem to indicate that the regulations are not altogether satisfactory. ber tell me from whom he received the letters ? the Wireless DevelopmentAssociation of Victoria, 323 Flinders-street, Melbourne;. another from Mr John Payne, editor of the Australasian Wireless Review, 143 Avoca-street, Randwick, Sydney; and another from Mr C.

They have requested me to take action to prevent the regulations from becoming law. I told them that I could not do that, as the time for which Parliament would be sitting would not permit it. But I promised that I would take the first opportunity to bring the matter under the notice of the Postmaster-General. I understand that the Minister framed these regulations after a conference was held, and I suppose, therefore, that he has some justification for them. We should make these facilities available as far as possible to all the people in the out-back settlements, and not only to the wealthier classes. If we can use this means to bring a little sunshine into the lives of the folk out-back we should do it. Our people should not be in a position any less advantageous than that of the people of Great Britain or other parts of the British Dominions. The letter from the Wireless Development Association of Victoria reads323 Flinders-street, Melbourne. 9th August, 1923. Dear Sir, We received your letter this morning, and have much pleasure in forwarding another copy of the cuttings. We believe that to-day is the last day. on which a protest can be lodged in , the House on the Wireless Bill this session. While the Postmaster-General states that there was no opposition at the time of the conference, we would like to point out that at the conference the public was not represented, and it is the public's interest that we wish to protect. The only interests that have been protected by the present regulations are any broadcasting station which might start, and there is no .limit in the fees that they may demand from the public for their service. event of more tlian one broadcasting station starting and charging for services, the public w ill have ""to pay for both 'broadcasting stations if they desire to listen to both, and so the ordinary working man will be debarred from listening in . This is not so in New Zealand, America, England, South America, and Europe, and' why should Australia be placed in this position ? You w ill also notice that Tjroadcasting stations have the monopoly for five . years, which means that we are held up by them for five years. If the regulations are amended, they uu-doubtedly will claim compensation against the Government '„ We would be pleased to give you any other help in this matter. Yours faithfully, C. W . CHUM , Treasurer. Mr Charlton. According to that letter certain companies are to be given a monopoly for five years. 1 ° Mr GiBSON.^That is not so. hear that. The writer of that letter points out that if such a monopoly were given, and subsequently it was found necessary to alter the agreement in the public interests, the companies which had been granted a monopoly would claim compensation. This association forwarded a copy of a letter from C. W. Norris, of Norris& Skelly, 346 Post Office-place, Melbourne, July 1923. It reads: "" BROADCASTING OR THE SEALED BOX? "" To the Editor, Electrical Times. Sir, Now that the recent Conference called by ihe Minister( Mr Gibson, P.M.G.) is over and the discussion has been published, the majority (which have just discovered that there has been a conference affecting their business as electrical traders) on hearing the result stand aghast! While we all agree that broadcasting must be governed, and, possibly, subsidized-in small c populated areas such as Australia -wha t we cannot understand is that the Australian Government has agreed to demand that, before the public can even purchase a receiving set, they must pay a fee to one broadcasting station-that is, after paying 10s. for a licencethen they are allowed to purchase a sealed box. If they do not like the particular station for which they have already paid their money, then back they go with their sealed box to their dealer and pay a small fee to have same altered to another wave length; then it will be necessary to pay a fee to this broadcasting station, and they are allowed to take home their sealed box again, and so on and so on. Do you honestly think the public will do this ? Mr Gibson stated to myself and others, while on a deputation of protest, that it w ill 'be just like ui book-lending library-if you don't like In the one you just go to another. Yes, but remember that you pay and you can choose at random what book you want, but not so with the sealed box. I would suggest that, as the Government is so good as to sponsor the broadcasting companies which w ill have every possibility of becoming monopolies, as in England, that they do the job properly here, as suggested below:(1) Raise the licence fee to £ 3 3s. per annum. (2) Genuine experimenters be protected as at present,and charged 10s. per annum. (3) Appoint a Board, consisting of representatives of the Radio Department, broadcasting companies, traders, press and others directly interested in broadcasting (these to be paid a small fee, if any at all), to control-broadcasting.

(7) That the licences be issued to companies or firms desirous of broadcasting on payment of a fee, say £20, and placing a bond to maintain small service for one year, advertisements to be strictly limited, no charge whatever to public for the service, but would be on any wave length available, and under strict Radio Department's regulations. (8) That all receiving sets bought complete or made up of parts can be capable of receiving on any. wave lengths. (9) All dealers in wireless apparatus to be licensed and under penalties for supplying apparatus to others than holders of Government licences. (10) Licences to be obtained at post-offices or licensed dealers. Then broadcasting will have a chance to be on the proper lines, the public having six subsidized high-power stations at their service and a number of other stations supplied by firms, &c. (as in USA. at present}, but properly supervised here, all for the sum of £ 3 3s. per annum. Just you calculate the money available by subscribers in each capital city, which would be at least £10,000 per State.

In brightness and happiness. In the Old Country the wharfie has his little set, and listens in at night with his family. It keeps him at home, and the home is the brighter and happier for it . There any one can have a radio receiving set to cover any wave length, and this means that he can listen in to all kinds of concerts from all over the place. In New Zealand splendid regulations have been gazetted, and any one there can have a receiver which will receive any wave length, and concerts are heard in different places from the North Cape to the Bluff, the annual licence fee being only 5s. In England the listener-in to radio concerts, as they are called, pays £1 per year, 10s. of which goes to the Broadcasting Company, a company formed to rendei; radio service tlu'oughout Great Britain. In addition, amateurs send music. So far, a fee of only £ 1 . More as funds An English radio man can listen to' any concert for that inclusive sum. In America there is absolutefreedom, as only an annual licence fee is charged by the Government of a nominal amount, and the big firms broadcast free for the purpose of advertisement mainly. Our regulations have just been gazetted, as you will be aware, and they contain some of the most damnable and restrictive provisions on the radio concert listener it is possible to conceive. 1 have quoted sufficient to show t h a t there is some dissatisfaction. The people which have corresponded with me understand the business. I do not know anything about radio-wireless, and am bringing the matter up because I have been requested to do so, and because the regulation,, I understand, will come into force on the 15th of this month. I hope that the Postmaster-General will see his way to suspend its operation until he has made further inquiries. I have personally no doubt that he has taken every care in the matter, but in the initiation of these things some little mistakes are likely to occur. I agree with the honourable gentleman that it would be unwise to hold up the matter for any great length of time. The system should be introduced as quickly as possible. We should encourage companies to start radio services to give the people the benefit of them. I believe that advantage will be taken of the system by big business companies in the different cities to communicate information concerning their business to their customers. I believe it will he beneficial in many ways.' It is one of the great scientific developments of the last few years, and we should see that it is installed here.

I am sure the Postmaster-General w ill give consideration to the representation I have in that State. The State Government is made. I want -to compliment the Postmaster General upon the very concise way in which he presented his Department's programme. It is gratifying to honourable members who receive so many communications concerning postal .matters to know that every year the Post and Telegraph Department is modernizing as well as liberalizing its ideas. becoming prevalent that the Department is a public utility, and not merely a money-making concern. The expenditure upon it in the different States should not be on a per capita basis. When the Government recently proposed the appropriation of £500,000 for main roads development, they decided that it would be wrong to allocate the vote to -the different States on a per capita basis, because it was obvious that the States in most need of the grant were those with the greater areas. The Government allocated a portion of the £500,000 on the per capita basis, and the balance on an area basis. I was pleased to learn the distribution which the Postmaster-General proposes for this year's expenditure iu metropolitan and country areas. His advisers in Western Australia may not have properly estimated the amount which should be spent in that State. They failed to do so last year under Mr state Poynton's regime, and, if that is the case this year, they will have to apply later on for increased expenditure. The Minister has admitted that he scarcely knows how to get through his programme and spend £4,000,000 in the year effectively. find useful and proper ways of expending the money in Western Australia. I wish to say in the kindliest manner that Western Australia-and I dare say the same thing applies to Tasmania and Queensland-suffer s greatly because of its Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) distance from the centre of things in Melbourne. The honourable member for Corio( Mr Lister) was able to refer* the Minister to post-boxes in this street and that street in Geelong, but we cannot do that kind of thing in Western Australia. I hope that the Postmaster-General w ill , take advantage of the earliest opportunity w ill especially visit Western Australia. He will find that development is going on trying to effect the settlement of immigrants on the land. The Commonwealth Government is paying part of the interest on the expenditure of a lot of money in that Statef o r the purpose, and settlement is spreading rapidly into large new areas. We have been told many times in this chamber that if a block of land is put to the ballot in some of the States there w ill be 500 or 600 applicants for it . That is The fact is not the case in Western Australia. A l though it may cost £5,000 per mile to lay cables in the cities, 100 miles might be laid for that money in Western Australia. I hope that during the recess the Postmaster-General will devote as much time as possible to visiting the various Statesi n order to make himself acquainted with local conditions. The Postmaster-General, no matter who he is, must work largely through Deputies. Some Postmasters-Generali n the past have imposed very restrictive conditions. Officials' of the Department have been brought up under them, and have got into a groove. They want to be on the safe side, bust the Postmaster-General should let them know that regulations must be liberally interpreted.

' The postal services are the most important rendered to the people by any Government Department. not more than ten members in a House of seventy-five will have an opportunity to express their opinions concerning the administration of the Department. That is a scandalous state of affairs, particuwhich will' never be great enough to, larly as during the next fortnight the House will be dealing with comparatively unimportant legislation. The expenditure indicated by the Postmaster-General will give a certain amount of relief during the to ask these officers, who receive not next twelve months, but the last Government and the one preceding it had so neglected to keep pace with current requirements, and so starved some of the services, that even the new works and additions now promised will not be adequate if population increases as has been foreshadowed. services. much the war as the foolish cry for false economy that induced the Government to cut out many services. mail services in country districts were cut down from three to two a week, and in order to get back the old service the people are asked to dip their hands into their pockets to pay a subsidy. One town in a grazing district used to get three mail deliveries a week; the service was cut down to two mails a week, and the residents were informed that if they wished to restore the three-days-a-week service they must pay £70 per annum towards the additional cost. This Parlia; ment should make the Postmaster-General understand that such services should be paid for out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund. The people living in these outback districts are pioneers; ""they are making the country habitable, and helping to support the people living in the cities. Yet, in addition to the taxation they pay, an additional impost is put upon them when they ask for a service to which they are entitled. People who settle in the country should not be penalized by being asked to put their hands into their pockets in order to pay for necessary conveniences. up the country are asked to pay more for postal and telegraphic services than are the men who stay in the big centres of population. Yet In regard to the expenditure upon works and buildings, I draw the attention of the Postmaster-General to the fact that there are many small but well-established villages, the population of justify the establishment of an official post office. These places are served by allowance officers, who are required to provide their own quarters. Is it right more than from £2 to £3 per week, to pay for accommodation for themselves? There is in the town of Cobbadah an old tumble-down stone building, in which the postmistress has accommodation. She cannot be expected to provide better accommodation for herself when she is not secure in her position. She is told by ' the Department that it will not erect a building for her, although a timber room could be built for about £50. The policy of the Department should be to build offices andquarters, and' charge small rents for them.

529,Mr Cunningham,"It was not soThat would be a handsome return on the capital cost of a small wooden building. Many employees of the Postal Department are inadequately remunerated for their services. There are some men who have been in the .Department for twenty-five and thirty years, are in control of as many as ten officers, and are responsible for a twenty-four-hours-a-day service. They have to handle large amounts of money, and to be in attendance at all hours of the day or night, and yet are receiving only £25 0 per annum, plus a living allowance. ment ! men are up in years, and their families are already grown u p ; therefore they do not get the endowment. Unless the Department w ill pay better salaries it cannot expect to attract the best men to its service. Another injustice is in respect of the allowance to junior oflicers transferred to stations away from their homes. A boy of poor parents may be required by the Department to transfer father cannot afford to ' assist him , that boy, after having spent a couple of years in the Department, has to resign his position for no other reason than his father's poverty. The total allowance in this regard this year for New South Wales is £4,010. I know of many boys who have been forced to leave their positions in the Department because they could not afford to be transferred. That is not the sort of treatment that should be given to young men who enter the Commonwealth service. The Postmaster-General has spoken of the large amount of money to be expended in connection with telephone services. Until wireless has been simplified and cheapened, the telephone w ill continue to be the chief means of communication between people in the outback districts, and I appeal to the Postmaster General to liberalize and broaden his policy w it h regard to telephones'. TheM in ister may say that Cabinet w ill not give him more money, but his duty is to come to Parliament and ask for the money. Peoplei n the country districts appreciate the value of the telephone, and as a result are often prepared to pay more than they can really afford to secure the convenience. Unfortunately, many are unable to provide the funds, and in case of sickness are at.a serious disadvantage as compared with their wealthier neighbours, though their people are just as near and dear to them. The 'Government, we have been informed, have placed £2,500,000 to a contingency f u n d for defence. Probably this' money will be poured into the Singapore Naval Base. The Government, with the surplus funds at their disposal, should liberalize the postal and telegraphic and telephonicservices of our people in the back country districts. The Postmaster-General w ill . child endownot be able to carry out his public works policy during the next twelve months, unSome of the less he enlarges his staff. I suggest that steps be taken in this direction at once -to insure that the much-needed facilities in country ""districts shall be provided promptly, and at the same time relieve much of the unemployment iri our midst.

They would have to provide for feed for at least eighteen months out of the three years. No man can possibly foreshadow the weather conditions in Australia over a series of years.

Minister will, see that this ridiculous provision is eliminated from forms of tender, otherwise most mail tenders will have to be based on a much higher cost, because the contractor will have to safeguard himself against a period of possible drought, and thereby increase the cost of mail contracts. On the question of accommodation for the public and for employees in country districts, I think that there should be a thorough inspection, and re-organization of all our postal buildings with a view to bringing them up to date. Many are very inconvenient and badly lighted, and in several places where there is electric light the Department insists on retaining the old gas lighting system. In this matter we should follow the example of the States. As a rule, State public buildings are an ornament to a town or district, whereas a Commonwealth building is usually the most ramshackle structure in the town. of them this year. dreds more throughout Australia need attention. Many of them are dilapidated, unpainted, and, generally speaking, are no credit to the Commonwealth. electoral office, post-office, and branches of the Commonwealth Bank could, in many instances, be housed in one substantial and presentable building. I have in mind most unsuitable quarters at Narrabri, housing the electoral, officer for the division of Gwydir. I propose to test the feeling of the Committee in regard to increasing the mail and telephone facilities in country districts. It has been urged that if these facilities are granted to one country centre, thousands of other districts will want the same treatment, and we may not have the money to provide them. £8,000,000 in"" one year. ferring to works and. buildings, but to mail and postal services in country districts. We should not withhold these facilities from the people. On the contrary, it should be our duty to provide them wherever possible. Parliament is in control of the finances, and honourable members should give the Postmaster-General an intimation to re-draft his policy with a view to liberalizing the provisions in regard to mail contracts, and provide for mail contractors to call in at homesteads. As a case in point, I may state that many men have to ride from l i to 2 miles and even 5 miles every day from the homestead to the ^ mail road on the off-chance that there may be an important letter for him. Where a person is within a reasonable distance of a mail route, or even if he is inconveniently situated, the Postmaster-General, should include terms in mail contracts requiring the contractors to run their services so as to suit the people. We should provide money so that country people shall not be obliged to travel long distances each mail day from week to week and month ,to month to get their mails. would object to the mailman carrying their letters loose.

This subject has given me more thought than any that I have tackled since ' I have been administering the Postal Department. ments have been made in regard to the application of these regulations to broadcasters who propose to erect stations for the purpose of broadcasting. It is quite true that under the regulations a person w ill be required to have a sealed set. It might just as well be urged that any boy in the street should be given the privilege of making a connection with a telephone wire and listening to the messages that pass over the telephone, as that he should be allowed to listen in when messages or entertainments are being broadcasted at very great expense. We have arranged to regulate in the direction of having broadcasting stations licensed. As the honourable member for Kooyong said, a guarantee of good f a it h has to be given to the extent of £1,000. If this were not done there would be a number of "" w i ld cat"" schemes organized. Subscriptions would be charged, instruments would be sold to the people, and thousands of pounds would be collected. Then the whole scheme might 'be closed down, and no broadcasting done. A guarantee is now given to_ the people who subscribe that a service will be given, but there is in no sense a monopoly. We have received several applications for licences to broadcast, and no subscription whatever is to be charged. I ask honourable members not to condemn the regulations until they have been tried. They are not like the laws of the Medes to, they are now asking and the Persians; they can be altered their amendment.

Regulation 68 statesWhere an officer whose ordinary hours of duty are between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. is required to attend for duty before 6.30 a.m., or to remain on duty after 6.30 p.m., and where an officer is required to commence duty at least two hours before the usual time, or to remain on duty at least two hours beyond the usual time, and such attendance necessitates his obtaining a meal away from home, he shall be granted a meal allowance according to salary on the following scale :Salary.

Probably, if justice were done, the lowsalaried man would receive more than those above him. I s it thought that an officer-receiving £750 a year requires more sustenance than an officer beneath him, who probably has to do heavier work, or does the Board consider that the higher the salary received by an officer the more he should receive by way of meal allowance to enable him to have a more expensive meal ?

554,Mr Gibson,"I shall put the matterment will not shelve their responsibility by saying that it is a matter for the Public Service Board. Honourable members should protest against such glaring anomalies as one officer receiving twice the allowance granted to another. The amount on the Estimates for the Postal Institute in New South Wales is £1,064. I understand that an officer has been appointed to attend to the accounts of the Institute, and if my information is correct he receives an allowance for that work. Seeing that there are great numbers of returned soldiers and others out of employment, would it not be better to create a new position rather than allow an officer already in receipt of a good salary to have an extra allowance for additional work i Another matter to which I desire briefly to refer can be quickly indicated by the following extract from a letter I have received from the secretary of the New South Wales Branch of the Australian Postal Electricians UnionThe costly and cumbersome costing system, and the staffing of the professional division in our branch, are making the overhead charges so heavy that equipment that should be manufactured locally is in a number of instances imported. These heavy charges result in increasing the cost of manufacture in Australia. It is most unfair to the workmen employed in the Department that their labour costs should be over-burdened to such an extents-thu s causing much material to be imported which could otherwise be manufactured in Australia. ask the Postmaster-General to consider, in connection with the new Postal Rates Bill, which will be introduced this session, the question of reducing the telegraphic rate. The present charge for Inter-State messages is I d . per word, with a minimum charge of Is. 4d. Much time would be saved to officers of the Department if the minimum charge was reduced to Is. Some consideration might also be given to a proosal to charge varying rates for Intertate messages. it 'costs as much to send a telegram from Wodonga to Albury as from Port Darwin to Townsville, vid Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney, and Rockhampton. I suggest that the charges should be based on a zoning system. adoption of that suggestion involve increases in certain instances? be necessary to make any increases. On the contrary, the suburban rate might be reduced to 6d., at which it previously stood. The facilities for lodging lettergrams should also be extended. These are now accepted only at the head office. Why should they not be accepted at every suburban office, so that residents of the suburbs might enjoy the same facilities in this respect as people in the cities? They are handed in as deferred telegrams, and despatched whenever a clear line is available. In some offices the slack period is in the middle of the day; in others, it is in-' the afternoon. As suburban offices close at 6 p.m., this facility could very easily be granted. 1 also desire to urge the establishment of an exchange at Lakemba. I do not wish to encroach upon the electorate of the man), but the people on the Belmore. railway line are united in their desire for this exchange. In the Canterbury municipality alone there are nearly 50,000 ratepayers, and they are unable to get a telephone exchange, and along the Belmore line there are approximately 1,000 subscribers, and there would be more if the exchange were provided. An extra rate is charged to these people because they live more than a certain distance from the Ashfield, Burwood, and Homebush Exchanges. Such treatment of people in a thickly populated area is not fair, and, moreover, the absence of an exchange is not economical for the Department. If an exchange were provided money could be saved, and subscribers given much more efficient service. I hope, also, that the Minister will give further consideration to the request for the establishment of a post-office at Hurlstone Park. This office is very much needed in the interests of a thickly populated area.* [10.15 a.m.] I wish to bring under the At the present time notice 'of the Postmaster-General the miserable remuneration given to those people who run allowance post-offices in the country.

560,Mr Parker Moloney (Hume),"find themselves -without a job. kind of treatment is unfair to people who are in charge of semi-official offices, and discourages them from putting forward their best efforts in the interests of. the Department and the public. I bring the matter under the notice of the Postmaster-General in the hope that he will do something to see that men who give their time and energy to the building up of these offices will not be thrown out of employment because of their success. I have received several complaints of this character. Then there are the allowance offices. I know the stereotyped answer of the Department to requests for increased allowances to the persons in charge of these offices. It is pointed out that allowance post-offices are given only to persons who have another business. There are many places, particularly small places out-back, where it is not possible to run any other' business in conjunction with an allowance office. They have to be at the beck and call of the public, not only during ordinary office hours, but at all times. A huge institution like the Post Office, which is showing a large profit, should do something to improve the conditions of these people. While I am thankful for small mercies, and admit that the Postmaster-General is doing something to meet the position, there is still a grievance in country districts that the greater proportion of the money voted for new works is spent in city areas. Last year £58,462 was spent in the country in New South Wales as against £244,429 in the-city areas. A sum of £1,400 was to have been expended on a new building at Wagga. The existing post-office building is a disgrace to such a place, which is one of the best towns between Sydney and Melbourne. In the Estimates this year a sum of only £500 is provided. The postmaster is compelled to live in. a hotel, where he cannot afford to keep his wife and family, and because of the want of quarters they have to live in Sydney. I give that instance to show that fair treatment is not being given to the country districts. As I desire to test the Committee on this question, I give notice of my intention to move That the proposed vote be reduced by 10s. . I shall move that amendment to indicate my electorate. I cannot say I am pleased to the Government that provision should at the small amount set down on account be made for more liberal payments to of the post-office in Bay-street, North That officers in charge of semi-official and allowance offices. On behalf of the honourable member for Brisbane( Mr D. Cameron), who is absent by leave of the House, I wish to bring under the notice of the Postmaster General the urgent necessity for remodelling the post-office at Brisbane. There are also important suburbs of the city in which allowance offices inadequately cater for the needs of the people. In my own electorate, Lilley, application for official offices to take the place of allowance offices have been made from places like Nundah and Hamilton. The suburb of Windsor, which contains something like 15,000 inhabitants, has special claims for immediate consideration.' I hope these matters will be attended to in the near future. I ""congratulate the Minister on having effected some reforms that have been urged for long years past, particularly on the decision to allow State engineers to expend larger sums than hitherto on their own responsibility. This will result in a greSjt saving of time and increased convenience to the public. I direct attention to the urgency of providing the full amount required for the construction of a post-office and telephone exchange in Lakemba, New South Wales. This is a matter of mutual interest to the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Marr) and myself. We are inundated with complaints of the inconvenience caused by the congestion of the lines in that district. The paltry sum of £500 is placed on tbe Estimates towards the cost of con-' struction of the exchange, the total estimated cost of which is £3,660. It is also' important that the'full amount necessary to complete the construction of the Belmore and Guildford post-offices should .be provided.

I have no time to deal w i th these matters in detail, but I strongly protest against the action of the Department in compelling people who live on the outskirts of towns 'to subscribe something like £ 2 0 towards the expense of a daily mail delivery. I know several instances of the kind, and I am certain honourable members agree that the public should not be penalized in this way while postal 'rates are being reduced to benefit the big commercial houses in the cities. I urge the importance of cheaply-constructed telephone lines in country centres. General himself favours them. Eor, country districts we do not require extensions costing £60 per mile, but merely cheap lines sufficient for the needs of isolated districts. complaint from Brisbane, regarding mails for No r t h Queensland. class mail matter, which is carried by sea from Brisbane, is often detained in the metropolis awaiting a The site is a most valuable contract boat north because the Department objects to paying the charges of a non-contract boat. This is very unfair to North Queensland. Perhaps the Minister will be good enough to peruse the speeches which have been made, and look"" into the matter. Another complaint is of the great congestion at the Brisbane Post Office. I understand that the honourable member for Lilley( Mr. Mackay) and the honourable member for Oxley( Mr Bayley) are looking after the interests of the honourable member for Brisbane( MrD . Cameron), and I shall have a conversation with these gentlemen with a view to removing this source of inconvenience. I am informed that the mails for Rockhampton have missed the train at times because of. the congestion. I am in accord It is said that the office is understaffed, and that the employees labour under all kinds of disabilities, rendering the serI give the Postvice by no means efficient. Mails are sometimes delayed for a fortnight or to help honourable members three weeks, according to definite inside information, which I shall hand over to the Postmaster-General. There is another Much little matter I should like to mention. Under the old Public Service Act,, females employed in the Postmaster General's Department were given a special allowance on their retirement in case of marriage. When the B ill to amend and postmistresses the Act was before this HouseI think provision for a continuance of this practice was inadvertently omitted. As 'a result, the Department has sent out a circular to the female employees, stating that no such payment will be made on and after the date of the proclamation of the Act. I ask the Minister to look into this matter and have it rectified. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ( Mr Bayley) -The time has arrived for the question to be put.

War Service Homes Amending Bill. fact that an amending Act is promised; but it may or may not be discussed. The question might very advantageously, and very properly, have been opened up on the discussion of the Estimates. I say no more than that for the present, but I wish to lose no opportunity to deal with the subject. In the electorate which I have the honour to represent there is a very large number of occupants of War Service Homes, and they have many just complaints. I have been asked to introduce a deputation next week in connection with the matter, which, as every one knows, is a ,most complicated one. There is scarcely a member of Parliament who does not desire to bring individual cases under notice. A very informative address on the question of national health was given in this Committee by the honourable member for Darling( Mr Blakeley), and I venture to express regret that no representative of the Ministry has made any statement upon a subject of such importance. Although we labour under many disadvantages in having this Government,"" we have an advantage in the fact that it includes as Treasurer an eminent medical man. pared to concede that much. He is a ' man who, in the pursuit of his profession, has rendered very distinguished services to the community. I make that declaration apart from political considerawealth Government, the State Governtions. I suggest that it would have been appropriate if Parliament had had the advantage of his advice and assistance in connection with the question of health. One phase of health is the much-debated Spahlinger treatment for tuberculosis. I am very much interested in that, and in the meagre newspaper reports regarding the extent to which it is being tested. At times I have felt deep disappointment by reason of the fact that the Government was apparently regarding this alleged cure lukewarmly, if not indifferently. Such an attitude, is not fair to the people of the Commonwealth. Tuberculosis is a dread disease, and if, by the expenditure of a few thousand pounds-nay , I would say millions of pounds-w e could introduce a reliable corrective to the dread bacillus, we would be spending money wisely, and in a direction that would have the support of every member of Parliament. I can merely ""mention those twoor three matters, and there are a host of others which might Avell have been discussed under the same heading had timepermitted. I want to allow other honourable members a few minutes for discussion before the time limit is reached. I conclude, as I began, with a public protest against the way in which the Estimates .have been handled and Parliament has been treated by the Government. surer) [11.31] I wish to state very plainly. the Government's attitude on the question of health. I listened very attentively to the able speech delivered the other day by the honourable member for Darling( Mr Blakeley). The subject on which he spoke should be ventilated much more than it is. His speech was a distinct contribution to the discussion of national health, and that discussion might easily be added to from many other sources. The Government is anxious, and has shown itself very desirous, of proceeding with a national health policy, but its activities are very much hampered by the fact that it cannot bring the States into line. A t the Premiers' Conference the Government put I am quite preforward proposals, and pressed the States very hard, to assist us with expert advice in forming a Royal Commission to investigate the whole question, and define definitely the spheres of the Commonments, and the municipal authorities. The most we could do was to obtain'the consent of the States to their public health officers discussing the matter with the ' Commonwealth health officer, after which the States would consider the representations made by those oflicers. The Government has endeavoured to arrange that conference. I have repeatedly urged that it should be held, but we have not been able to arrange it up to the present. As soon as that conference takes place I am hopeful that we shall",141,Chairman Have Fallen That Will Hot Mean A Very

This should lead not only to a discussion of the health of the community, but also to the adoption of measures to prevent the spread of disease, which, as was shown by the late war, can be done on a big scale. The difficulty we have had with the States explains why the proposed vote is almost the same as that for last year. Regarding tuberculosis and the possibility of discovering a cure, the Governmerit's position is quite plain. could see with any certainty a definite cure for that disease, or any process that would markedly alleviate and lessen the effects of it in the community, it would pay almost any price, and think that price cheap, to secure such a benefit.

During a previous -debate, honourable members mentioned some undoubtedly hard cases amongst -soldiers Avho are suffering from ill-health. Of course, the medical histories of these men are confidential, and it would be unf a i r to the patients to have the facts recorded in Hansard simply on the ground that they are in receipt of pensions. However, I have gone personally into -each of the cases, and I have made the 'suggestion that a sub-committee consisting of soldier members of the House, one from each of the three parties, be appointed to make the necessary inquiries. If the suggestion is adopted we shall feel assured that the men .will receive just .and sympathetic treatment. given to the recommendations of such a be housed in the building of the Repatria-committee? ter which could' be discussed w it h the the administrative charges. committee; as I have said I do not think we are justified in discussing such cases on the floor of the House, and thus placing on record facts which might be read by the descendants of these men. No attempt whatever has been made to diminish the war pensions, nor has there been any falling-away in the sympathy which 0 is extended to the recipients. Many of these men areextremely ill , and some of them, unfortunately, die. That is one"" way, of course, in which the total expen"" diture tends to diminish. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) referred If it to the necessity for medical treatment for embarrassed widows and children. The Government is going into that matter very carefully, and I hope to be able during the next week to suggest to the House any amendment of the Act that may be considered necessary. However, we may be able to accomplish what we desire by means of regulation. We have sent representatives The cases of incapacity may be divided into two classes. There is, It in the first instance, the disability which is set down by the Medical Board as 65 per cent, or 70 per cent. It is found that men w i th 70 per cent, disability who have been a'ccustomed to clerical or other light occupations have The Governnot much difficulty in supplementing their pensions. On the other hand, there are those who have been accustomed to msnual labour requiring f u l l health and strength, and they suffer considerable hardship. I hope during next week to present to honourable members some definite proposal to meet these latter cases. The control of the Repatriation Department, mentioned by the Leader of the Opposition, is receiving the careful attention of the Government. It will have been noticed that the appointment of the Repatriation Commission has been renewed -for only jme year, during which, it is hoped, the Government w ill be able to co-ordinate the Old-age and Invalid Pensions Department and the Pensions Branch of the Repatriation Department.

I enter my emphatic protest against the Government's neglect to accept f u l l responsibility for the aftermath of war. I protest against the action of the Government in the vote for health purposes. A miserable sum of £15,000 has been provided for the treatment and control of venereal diseases throughout the Commonwealth'. This disease is agrave and serious menace, as it vitally'concerns the national health of Australia. £121,000 set aside for health, £70,000 is devoted to the clerical staff, miscellaneous services, and so on. pounds is < ear-marked for medical services, laboratory Avork, research, and investigation. That is quite insufficient for this vast continent. In the Estimates for this year the Health Department's, figures for Queensland Territory are coupled together, but they are of sufficient importance to be kept separate. I cannot understand the reason for this, although it is perhaps necessary that, from an administrative stand-point,' Queensland be in close touch w i th the Northern Territory. I have here . an Ordinance concerning the Northern Territory which was issued in March of last year. It deals w i th the question of venereal disease, and I commend it to honourable members for consideration. contains far-reaching provisions, such as the compulsory notification of venereal disease, and a penalty of £500 or imprisonment for five years for any person Avho marries knowing that he is suffering from venereal disease, yet to some extent Ave are l e f t in the dark. We have not yet had .a statement from the Minister concerning the successful operation of that Ordi nance.

It does not concern the Government, evidently, if through its failure to attend to national health, a high percentage of our This woman manhood, in time of war, is certified to be medically unfit.

Discussion on the Estimates had to close at 12 o'clock to-day. A t one minute to twelve three honourable members rose to speak. Had each of those honourable members been called upon in turn each would have had 20 seconds to develop his theme. naturally hoped that the Standing Orders would be complied with, and that this meagre measure of. time would bo allowed them. 1 regret to say that, while these three honourable members were endeavouring to catch the eye of tbe Tern-, porary Chairman of Committees ( Mr Bayley), that gentleman rose in anticipa1 tion, before the expiration of the time fixed, and stated the question. I desire merely to add, as the King's hangman said when he pulled the lever, "" we willlet the subject drop."" -Fo r the information of the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan), if he seriously desires me to give him the information, ""I may say that the House takes no official cognisance of what occurs in Committee, unless it is officially .reported. and Minister for External Affairs) t l 2.14] -In view of the statements made iy the honourable member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr A.
