In Committee of Ways and Means: Consideration resumed from the 5th with the tariff? May (vide page 1609), on motion by Mr That the schedule to the Customs Tariff 1921-1930 be amended as hereunder set out (vide page 682). That the schedule to the Excise Tariff 1921-1930 be amended as hereunder set out (vide page 740). Item1 (Ale and other beer, cider and perry, spirituous). -The subject of the tariff calls for a great deal of consideration, and I do not intend to allow the general debate to pass without making my contribution to it. When I first took an interest in politics I promptly came to the conclusion that the adoption of a protectionist tariff policy would be in. the interests of Australia. At that time not 20 per cent, of the people in the electorate in which I live approved of such a policy. Nevertheless I did not fight on the side (through Mr of the big battalions.

The honourable member overlooked the fact that when the Bruce-Page. Government took office it found in the cupboard a surplus of £7,000,000, and that when it went out it left behind it a deficit of £5,000,000.

40,Mr Fbancis,"What has that to dowas rather surprised that the honorahle member for Parkes was allowed to speak as he did. However, since he was given the opportunity of misleading the public as he did in his speech, I wish to remind honourable members that he did not present the whole case. He did not say that the Bruce-Page Government found a credit in the London banks when it took office, yet finished with a debit of £36,000,000 in the same banks. The honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory) and the honorahle memher for Forrest( Mr Prowse) may, I believe, be classed as free traders, and they miss no opportunity of advocating the nostrums which appeal to them. Galvanized iron seems to be a bug-bear with them. To listen, to their speeches one would imagine that the farmers lived on galvanized iron. As a matter of fact, most farmers have their properties improved now, and do not require much galvanized iron. In any case, the extra cost resulting from higher duties would be a very small part of the farmers' expenses. The great need of the farmers at the present time is to sell their produce. They can do without galvanized iron. iron for covering their wheat stacks? farmers were fortunate enough to have a Labour government in office in New South Wales, a government which sent the honourable member for Yass( Mr depreciated 50 per cent, in value the day Nielson) to America to arrange for the visit of an expert in the construction of silos. Upon his recommendation Mr after it has been in use for two or three Burrell came to New South Wales and, under his direction, wheat silos were buiit that it was Abraham Lincoln who pointed throughout the State. The farmers do not now need galvanized iron to cover their wheat. They are not worrying now about the price of machinery and galvanized iron, because they have no money with which to buy anything. Their great need is to sell their products. I speak as one who knows something of the farmers and their needs. My father was a farmer, and I began my career as a farm worker. When I was nine years of age I was able to reap more with a reaping hook than, I venture to say, could any honourable member of this House reap now. Afterwards, when I entered business, I was for many years an agent for farm machinery, and obtained much inside information which convinced me of the fallacy of free trade. I saw the farmers being compelled to pay £76 for a machine which was sold to the American farmers for £23. The farmers here did not reap the benefit of the cheap prices at which the machinery was constructed in America. a reaper and binder before the war? The honourable member knows that the price was about £24, whereas to-day it i from c £86 to £90. and binder before the war was about £72, but in any case, reapers and binders are practically obsolete now; farmers are concerned mostly with harvesters. The honourable member for Swan professes to be greatly concerned because the price of galvanized iron has gone up a little, but he supported a government whose policy allowed the farmers to be charged £300 for a motor car such as was sold in America for £60. The same government allowed the farmers to be charged 3s. a gallon for petrol, although petrol was sold in America for a few pence a gallon. I cannot understand how it is that the farmers have been deceived by the honourable members for Swan for so long. When a farmer bought a motor car for £300 it he bought it ; but an Australian-made harvester is worth practically as much years as it was when it was new. I think out to his fellow countrymen that when they bought an English axe handle for 2s. 6d., America had the axe handle and England had the half-crown; but when they bought for 3s. an axe handle made in America, that country would have the axe handle' and the 3s. as well. The same thing applies to a battleship. If at a cost of £2,000,000, we built at Cockatoo Island a battleship which could have been constructed in Great Britain at a cost of £1,800,000, some",14,Fobde

That example will give honorahle members some idea of the benefit that accrues to the community when it patronizes its own industries. It has heen said in this House that the discovery of a new mining field which provides employment for 5,000 miners at a wage of £5 a week each, will lead to the springing up of a township of 25,000 souls. That is rendered possible by the continual circulation of the wages of the miners among the hotels, the stores, and other appurtenances to civilization. tablishment of an industry invariably leads to an increase of population in its vicinity. It is in that way that a nation is built up. When an Australian farmer pays £300 for a motor car which costs £60 at Ford's factory, the money is sent away to help American industries. We get no trade in return, because America refuses to buy Australian such as butter, wheat, wool and clothes. [Quorum formed.] We derive considerable benefit by keeping our money in our own country. An increase in the tariff does not necessarily mean an increase in prices, because I am well aware that when higher duties were imposed on certain imports, those who handled them were compelled to reduce their prices in order to compete with the Australian product. It is unnecessary for me to elaborate the advantages of protection, because so few people in Australia now advocate free trade. generally is in the direction of protection. so that effect may be given to the finanA farmer who has the option of buying his vegetables from a Chinaman at a price cheaper than that charged by an Australian greengrocer should patronize his countryman, who may be a married man with perhaps nine children all attending school. He may be the owner of a motor car, and a man who is generally supporting other Australian industries, whereas the Chinaman would hoard his savings until he had sufficient to enable him to return to his native land; once he had acquired a competency he would be of no further advantage to 3fr. Cusack. Australia. It is therefore, far better for us to patronize our own people. Eveni f it costs us a little more at the time, it is cheaper in the long run, because the money spent is kept in Australia. By supporting the policy of protection we support our own people and our own industries. The few persons in the community who are free traders have the idea that the only thing which enables us to live is the money that we receive from overseas in payment for our exports; but I claim that we can do without exports altogether. We can live among ourselves. We require only food, clothes and shelter, which are The esthe essentials of life. Some token or some medium of exchange could be used to euable transactions to take place between the consumer and the produoer. If some such system were adopted this country would soon prosper. Unfortunately it cannot prosper to-day hecause of the refusal of the banking institutions to make credits available. Persons who have good commodities securities are to-day unable to obtain advances. Something should be done to alter that position. The failure of the banks to release credits is responsible for the serious depression that now exists in this country. This Government has introduced legislation with the object of enabling the Commonwealth Bank to function. That institution is receiving some prominence to-day, and I hope that some influence will be brought to hear on the gentleman who is appearing in another chamber-on e of those antiquated political bluebeards who have been blockPublic thought ing the proposals of this Governmentcial and hanking reforms embodied in the legislation recently passed by this Parliament. Certain honorahle members opposite claim to be friends of the farmers. They voted for bills introduced by the Government with the object of helping the farmers. But the representatives of the same parties in the other chamber voted against them. Consequently, I am forced to the conclusion that the only way to meet the existing situation is for additional credit to be made available. To-day even persons with sound security cannot obtain advances from the hanks. ago a gentleman with property valued at from £40,000 to £50,000, on which he does not owe a penny, desired to buy sheep to the value of £800 from another man who was in dire straits. The owner of the sheep had no suitable grazing land on which to run them, while the man who desired to buy them had an abundance of good feed available, which was a danger to him because of the possibility of a fire breaking out in it. But he was unable to obtain an advance of a penny, and so could not buy the sheep. Had the policy of the Labour party been put into operation when the Government first desired to give effect to it, such a situation could dissolution of both Houses of the not have arisen. If that man had been able to obtain an advance of, say, £1,000 from his bank, everybody would have been better off. The bank, by holding the money, would probably have had to pay £40 in interest to the depositors of it, whereas if it had supporters? lent it out again it could have obtained from £70 to £75 in interest, and so would have shown a profit of £35 on the transaction. could have made the money available at 5 per cent, under a system of extended credits-in other words, by merely issuing a piece of paper-it could have made a profit of £50 per annum. Had that been done, the Commonwealth Govermnent would have immediately received sales taxation amounting to £20 on the purchase of the sheep for £800. The difference betwen a private bank and a government bank issuing credit is thus shown. In addition to £50 interest an amount of £20 is earned in revenue by the latter. Had the sheep been purchased two drovers would have been required for some time, and their wages would have amounted, say, to £6 . each. unemployment fund of New South Wales would have been relieved of paying out the dole to those two men, and they, in turn, would have paid 6s. in taxation to Mr Lang. Had the deal been made, a certain amount of money would also have been' spent in railway fares and in other ways. All this would have been beneficial to the country"". If one transaction of this kind is so profitable, what profit must be derived A few days from transactions involving the expenditure of from £300,000 to £500,000 in that way! If money were made available under a system of extended credits for business of this description, the depression would be lifted from Australia almost immediately. Security valued at millions of pounds is available in return for advances. If the policy of the Government were given effect, it would be possible to provide the credit to make such advances, and prosperity would rapidly be restored. Is there no way to give effect to the policy of the Government except by the Parliament? Can we not challenge the political bluebeards of another place to resign their seats and contest seats with honourable members of this chamber, on the understanding that if they are defeated the seats which they hold in the other place shall be filled by Government The adoption of that method would give results more rapidly than they can be obtained by means of a double dissolution. I am prepared to If the Commonwealth Bank resign my seat and contest it with a member of another place under these conditions; and I am sure that other honorahle members would be willing to do the same thing. It is distressing to me to see so many people practically starving. The other day a returned soldier was evicted from his home. He sold his furniture, and with the proceeds bought a horse and conveyance and went on the roads, with his wife and three children, looking for work. Unfortunately, his horse died at Yass, and he had no money to buy another. He is now hoping some one will be generous enough to give him a horse. It is extraThe ordinary that although horses are being shot in many parts of Australia because there is no use for them, this man is held up because he cannot get one. It is tragic that misery like this should occur in a country in which there is an abundance of food. Cannot we, like the Greeks of old, build a wooden horse, fill it with men, and drag it into the other place as though it were a modern Troy with the object of defeating our political enemies? The present situation cannot be allowed to continue. policy of the Government has been approved by the people, and it should be put into effect, notwithstanding the fact that members of another party are so strongly entrenched in the other place. I wish to refer briefly to the effects likely to follow the imposition of the duty Labour newspaper on newsprint. The people have been led to believe that the present Government has had a wonderful chance to pass legislation in the interests of the people, and has taken no advantage of its opportunities; but not a word has been said by the newspapers about the obstacles that lie in its path, and the difficulties confronting it in another place. No newspaper in this country really fights in the interests of the people. The newspapers of Australia are gradually becoming more traitorous and parasitical. Their chief object is to make profits, and, Australia shortly in the manufacture of because of the influence which they wield, the difficulty of the Government's task has Commonwealth Bank could be induced been increased. Even that journalistic abortion known as the Labor Daily has been largely responsible for preventing the passage of Labour legislation. There is a conspiracy of silence on the part of the press to refrain from giving publicity to the remarks of any honourable member who supports this Government; but the "" big four "" in this House merely have to sneeze and the occurrence is recorded. [Quorum formed.] This Government has not received the support that it deserves. Even the Labor Daily 13 out to disparage the Treasurer. At a recent meeting in Melbourne, the Minister was well received, but that journal tried to make the public believe that he was counted out. A Labour Government should at least receive some support from a newspaper supposed to advocate the interests of Labour. This journal has done more damage to the Government than all the other newspapers combined, because so many people believe what they read in its columns. It publishes inane and purile platitudes in condemnation of the Government, but it is not game to 3ay anything detrimental concerning Lang. The honourable member is not now dealing with an item in the tariff. Mr Ousaek. newsprint, and there ceuld be no newspapers in this country unless that duty were paid. The eyes of the people should be opened to the extent to which they are being deluded by the press. I believe' that there is a prospect of a genuine being published shortly, and if it does appear on the journalistic firmament there may be a chance of the Government receiving some practical assistance from it in putting its legislative programme into effect. In my opinion, the tariff has noc resulted in much employment up to the present time, but it is responsible for keeping at work quite a number of men who would otherwise be unemployed to-day. I understand that a German firm is to begin operations in dyes. This is due to the tariff. If the to extend credits to the business community, a revival of trade would take place immediately, and very soon the unemployed would be given work. I have had a number of years' experience in business circles, and I know that many persons, including members of my own family, have been seriously affected by the prohibition of imports. So far, no revival of trade that would compensate for the damage done has occurred. Yet the banks have been calling on their customers to curtail their overdrafts. If adequate advances were made by the Commonwealth Bank to-morrow, from 600,000 to 700,000 business people would begin to re-stock their establishments. Thax would result in greatly increased employment, and prosperity would soon return. The employment of one man quickly leads to the engagement of another, and very soon our difficulties would disappear. The solution, therefore, is to pass the financial proposals of the Government. Even though the Commonwealth Bank may not be willing to extend credit on a considerable scale, I believe that a revival of trade and a good deal of employment would be brought about if the fiduciary were accepted in another place. I loyally support the Ministry, but I would",15,Fobde

I would very readily do what the honourable member for Angas( Mr Gabb) has done, but I would do it in a different way; I would resign my seat, and allow the electors to express their views. I would not support a government which, in my opinion, was doing injury to the people, and causing misery such as exists to-day. I appreciate the honour of being a member of Parliament, though, if there is money in public life, I have notofound it. I have never found politics a profitable investment. There is at least £700 owing on my business books; the debtors concerned have adopted the so-called Lang plan, and it has been wonderfully successful, but only because they have nothing. If they were worth anything, the Lang plan would not be of much good to them. Mr extend credits all would be well. The Lang claims that the plan is his, but I suspect that it was concocted by Jock Garden. It has misled the unfortunate workers, and I am very sorry that it has received so much prominence. It can never operate successfully. If one State adopts a policy of repudiation, the whole nation will do so; if one nation repudiates, other nations will do so, and I do uot know what the end of that would be. Dishonest intent and fraud methods do not appeal to me. Repudiation is not a plan; it is a plot. We are told that Mr and the creation of fictitious wealth has Lang's policy is not repudiation; if it is not, it is at any rate so good an imitation that I , for one, cannot tell the difference. member must address himself to the tariff schedule. to say when the items are reached. Having had experience as an importer and exporter, I have personal knowledge of many phases of manufacture. I can approach tariff problems with the knowledge gained hy a successful business man. I say this not boastingly, but because our opponents so often try to disparage Labour Governments by saying that they know nothing of business. As a man with practical commercial experience, I believe that the tariff will be most beneficial to the Australian people. member's time has expired. [3.35] -The most urgent need at the present time is a solution of the financial and economic difficulties that face Australia. Its fiscal policy has an important bearing on the prosperity of a country, and therefore the most calm and deliberate consideration should be given to the tariff schedules now before the committee. Since the last general election, tariff schedules have been introduced at the rate of one in every two months. We are now considering the eighth for which the present Ministry has been responsible. The honourable member for Eden Monaro( Mr Cusack) stated repeatedly that if the Commonwealth Bank would truth is that if the governments of Australia would withdraw their demands on the funds of the Commonwealth Bank, adequate credits would be available for industry, and legitimate business enterprises would have a-chance of extending. But the governments have first claim on the resources of the Commonwealth Bank, and unfortunately their demands have been so great that the financial resources of the country are exhausted, been proposed. If the Commonwealth Government could be induced to set its house in order so that credits would bo released to industry, very great benefit would accrue to our country. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro said that all the banks had been guilty of contracting credits, thereby depriving industry of its life-blood. Chief Justice Dethridge, of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, replying to continued statements by Labour representatives that the trading banks have carried out a policy of deflation, said on the 22nd January lastI t was submitted (by the unions) that the banks, notwithstanding the prosperous run they have had since the war, were unnecessarily contracting credit and were dictating the financial policy of enterprise all in tlie direction of forcing reductions of wages. In order to test this argument the court secured from the Commonwealth Statistician an analysis of banking statistics between the years 1914 honourable and 1930, with a view of determining whether there had been any undue contraction of",18,Fobde

It will thus be seen that during recent years, particularly the last, two years, there has been no undue contraction of credits by the banks. On the contrary, from 1920 to 1930 percentages largely increased. [Quorum formed.'] I am not championing the cause of the private banks, but I have dealt with the allegations against them because in seeking a solution for our present difficulties we must deal with facts; if we are led astray by misstatements we shall reach no conclusion that is worthwhile. Another statement by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro was that the Commonwealth Government's short term indebtedness in London when the present Government took office was £36,000,000. That statement is incorrect, and is likely to mislead, the public., I refer honourable members to the reply made by the Prime Minister( Mr Scullin) to a question asked by the right honourable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page).

It is apparent that the honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Cusack) became confused when dealing with the subject. Actually only £3,545,000 was owing by the Commonwealth in London as at the 1st October, 1929. The Prime Minister's reply reveals what is a very pleasant feature to me, that Queensland has no short-term indebtedness either in Great Britain or in Australia. As a matter of fact that State has credits both in Great Britain and in Australia. The Prime Minister's reply continuedL i the period of one and a half years from 1st October, 1929, to 1st A p r i l, 1931, no loan from those countries goods to the value of was raised overseas, and the loans raised in Australia were insufficient to meet the restricted loan programmes approved by the Loan Council. The increase in short-term debt was necessary to meet tbe loan programmes, and to cover the deficits. Since September, 1930, when the exchange pool commenced to operate, the short-term debt in London has remained stationary. Figures for the States prior to 1st A p r i l, 1931, are approximate only. Honourable members have a right to express their own views with regard to tariff matters. I do not know that mine are in accordance with those of all who sit on this side of the chamber. It is my conviction that, wherever possible, we should encourage the establishment of secondary industries in Australia, provided that that can be done, on an economic basis. It is essential that this output should be marketed to Australian consumers at reasonable prices. Such a policy would bave the inevitable result of providing additional avenues of employment. The most important factor which governs our future prosperity is the satisfactory exporting of our products. To compete successfully in the markets of the world our output must be produced at the lowest possible cost. The second important factor is that we should locate and stimulate markets for our primary products on the otlier side of the world. We should purchase, from friendly trading countries, those commodities which we cannot produce or manufacture on an economic basis. In the past, Australia has not been careful enough in the disposition of its import trade. Our empire trade has been satisfactory. During the financial year 1928-29 we imported 53 per cent, of our total requirements from Great Britain and our sister dominions. while 52 per cent, of our total exports were sold to the same source. Great Britain purchasing its wheat ? British Labour Government made an agreement with Russia and unfortunatelyhas purchased Russian wheat. At the moment that is merely a side issue. The figures before me, the latest available, were compiled by the Commonwealth Statistician, and they show that iu 1928-2.9 Great Britain and the dominions purchased goods from Australia to the value of £76,060,357, while we purchased £76,491,242. The transactions were practically on a fifty-fifty basis. On the other hand, Australia purchased from the United States of America 24.58 per cent, of its total imports, while that country bought from us goods representing only 5 per cent, of our total exports. to be cut out from our business. with the honourable member. I would strongly support any tariff regulations that would effect an embargo against any country that treated us in that fashion. Rather than allow one pound of our butter, one tin of our canned fruits, or any of the products of our orehardists to be landed there even as ships' provisions, the Government of the United States of America causes commodities to be jettisoned outside its harbours. During the past ten years the United States of America has taken from Australia no less than £212,000,000 worth of our gold and credit, which was a considerable factor in bringing about our existing adverse trade balance. We could do very well with that £212,000,000 in gold today. Last year I strongly opposed the sending overseas of £7,000,000 of our gold, which was going to Great Britaiu to meet demands from the United States of America, occasioned by our unfortunate adverse trade balance. Until the United States of America is prepared to treat with us on* a more favorable basis, Australia should refrain from dealing with that country. Australia had satisfactory trade balances with other foreign countries, and the present Government should",19,Fobde

Those countries were buying the produce of Australian farms, and we should have encouraged them to go on doing so. The wisdom of such a course is evident when we remember the small amount of goods which we imported from them, as compared with the large amount they bought from us. From France, for instance, we took only 2.58 per cent, of our total imports, whereas she took from us 10.45 per cent, of our total exports. The balance of trade was very heavily in our favour, so that when compiling our tariff schedule we might well have considered the goods to come into Australia on reasonable terms. Belgium has also protested against the heavy duties imposed upon her products. From that country we obtained only .63 per cent, of our imports, whereas she bought from us 6.24 per cent, of our exports. From Germany we obtained 3.16 per cent, of our imports, while she bought from us 6.72 per cent, of our total exports. The German Government made representations to us on the subject of the increased duties, and afterwards imposed retaliatory duties cn our wheat, butter and grain, making the conditions of their entry into Germany much less favorable than those applying to similar products from New Zealand. Honourable members will see that there are other things to be taken into consideration in framing a tariff schedule. The class of commodity imported from France will never be manufactured here and no employment will be gained to Australians. nation's past desire to welcome the products of our primary producers into a feeling of hostility. ducer had no home market for his products he would be in an even worse position. nize the value of the home market, but I also recognize that much of our primary production is dependent upon our export trade. with which our trade balance was favorable.

I hold the view that the home market is the most valuable of all. We must establish industries here to endeavour to build it up. The British market is also a valuable one to the primary producers. Until now we have been selling to Great Britain just about as much as she has been selling to us. In my opinion, trade relations between Britain and the other parts of the Empire should be much closer than they are. In the United States of America advisibility of allowing her trade exists between the various States, which seems natural enough, because all the States form one compact territory; but there is quite as much justification, in my opinion, for trade agreements between the component parts of the British Empire. [Quorum formed.] I am in favour of many of the duties imposed in this schedule. I am particularly pleased with the duty on imported tobacco. We have in the past been paying £2,000,000 a year for imported tobacco leaf, and another £.1,000,000 a year for manufactured"" tobacco, most of that money going to the United States of America. It has been proved that Australia can produce tobacco as good as that grown in any other part of the world. The last Government put a tax on tobacco, but it was accused of taxing the workers' smoke. We have turned that not impose a protective duty such as we put on. It imposed a revenue duty. present Government adopted the last Government's proposal and added to it chiefly for revenue purposes. The last Government had established experimental plots for growing tobacco in various parts of Australia, one of the most successful being at Mareeba, in the electorate of the honourable member for Herbert( Mr Martens).

When this had been demonstrated, the last Government introduced its tax on imported tobacco with the idea of raising more revenue, and also of assisting the local tobacco industry. Its reward was to be accused of taxing the workers' smoke. The duties imposed by the present Government, which are also for revenue, are heavier than those imposed by the last Government, but I intend to support them, because I wish to assist the local tobacco-growing industry. In many ways the Government's tariff policy may be described as a panic tariff. It was introduced in the hope of making up the revenue lost in other directions. It has failed in its purBank. The honourable member is destined f ose, and we are to-day £13,000,000 short, t has been proved that high tariffs do not always result in increased revenue; there is such a thing as killing trade. Some items on this schedule should be revised, particularly that relating to galvanized iron. The Government first imposed an embargo on the importation of galvanized iron, and later replaced the embargo by an exorbitant duty, the proceeds of which are distributed to those engaged in the industry in Australia, contrary to the recommendations of the Tariff Board. According to evidence given before that body, £6 5s. a week is the ( Mr Corser) seemed to be much conaverage wage received by those in the iron industry. Dairy farmers would be greatly pleased if they could average such a return. It is estimated that 80,000 tons of galvanized iron are required each year in Australia. The duty on British iron is £5 10s. a ton. The effect of the Government's provisions is that the iron industry in Australia is being assisted by the Government to an extent which is greater than the total wages paid to those engaged in the industry. From the Australian consumers the industry is receiving £440,000 a year. I trust that the Government, in its desire to assist secondof party considerations. My. idea of tariff ary industries, will not unduly hamper our export trade. I believe that it is the duty of Australian citizens to buy Aus[50] tralian-made goods wherever possible. I also believe that the local market is the best market for our primary products. The more we can develop our secondary industries, and increase our population, consistently with the proper development of our primary industries, the better it will be for Australia.. [4.16] -It appears that I have about eight minutes during which to speak before I am interrupted by the honourable member for Angas( Mr Gabb) calling for a quorum. It might be just as well at this stage to place on record in Hansard the fact that Sir Robert Gibson is at present in another place delivering an address on the financial position of Australia. The honourable member for Angas has no wish that other honourable members should attend another chamber to hear the views of the Chairman of the Commonwealth to serve but a short term in this House, and he is, therefore, not concerned with the opinions of Sir Robert Gibson, and, knowing that his own confreres are absent from this chamber, he takes the opportunity to call for a quorum so as to prevent honourable members on this side from attending another place. The honourable member has become so accustomed to a poorly-attended chamber when he is speaking that he hates to give any other honourable member a decent deal. The honourable member for Wide Bay cerned about the interests of certain persons overseas and the cost of the requirements of our primary producers; yet he religiously refrained from dealing with the vexed question of sugar. He said not one word about the £9 a ton which it is costing the consumers of Australia for all the sugar sent out of this country. The sugar industry is of such great political significance that the honourable member and his colleagues are afraid to mention it ; but, to be consistent, he should tackle all items of produce affected by the. tariff, irrespective protection is the protection of Australian industries from the competition of cheap foreign products and the protection of",22,Fobde

It is futile to attempt to make the tariff a panacea without giving adequate consideration to other essentials such as primary production. If the Government desires to make Australia a self-supporting nation, as well as an exporting nation, it cannot ignore the application of science to industry. By the courtesy of the Minister, I relating to the peanut-growers of North Australia. It must be gratifying to the Minister to have learnt from the report of the Direotor of Agriculture that of some GO odd unemployed men who were given an opportunity to go on the land producing peanuts, only two have failed. Those meii went on the land without any capital. It is true that the Government did assist thefri by letting a contract for the ploughing of the land; but, apart from that, these settlers were left to their is valueless until such time as improveown devices; Many of them were forced to improvize tools out of forks of trees and other things for scarifying purposes. When the Government, irt its wisdom, launches out oil a scheme of settlement, it shbiild at least see that the men who are placed on the land are supplied with the tools necessary for the cultivation of the soil. These settlers should have the benefit of scientific and expert advice in respect of best means of production; I noticed from the file that some of the growers, who have a little capital, have tried to improve their holdings by using fertilizers. Some of them have used as much as 5 cwt. of fertilizer to the acre, and others 1 cwt. to the acre. They have no knowledge of the quantity of fertilizer that should be used for the proper cultivation of tl^e soil. likely to be assisted, because once they become successful thp squatters will lose their lauds. this Government has withheld assistance for that reason, but I know that the large landholders in the north are not 'anxious that agriculturists should get a footing there. The report of the Director of Agriculture shows conclusively that these If high tariffs are settlers are excellent workers. It is far better for them to be producing wealth than receiving the dole. I have made a suggestion to the Minister, and he has agreed to it to the extent that he is pre: pared to establish experimental plots in connection with tobacco-growing. These areas are Crown lands, and are capable of absorbing hundreds of thousands of settlers. tobacco as well as it does peanuts, there is a great future for it . , be grown in the Northern Territory. [Quorum formed.'] There is in the Northern Territory soil that is capable of growing anything that can be produced elsewhere in Australia. The climate is so varied that almost any plant can be grown there. The areas are Crown lands, and there is nothing to prevent the Government from granting portions of from 10 to 2,000 acres to any settlers, because the land ments are effected upon it, and it is made productive. The Territory cannot be compared with any other part of Australia, because the capital cost or the interest ou the capital cost of land elsewhere makes its cultivation almost prohibitive, and nine out of every ten settlers upon it are doomed to failure. The position is the reverse in the Northern Territory. Peanuts are being produced successfully by some hundreds of farmers, and there are enormous possibilities for the production of tobacco. How much better it. would be to absorb some thousands of men on the land in these industries, at thefeainetime adding to the wealth of this country, than to do what we are doing at present-pa y them the dole. If a fraction of the money that is paid in doles were used to place men on the land, it would enable them to become self-reliant, self-supporting, and decent citizens; but it is essential that expert advice should be given to the settlers before any cultivation of the land is attempted, particularly in respect of tobacco-gr&wing, whioh entails the involved process of tobaGCO-curing.

The soil was hard! bla,ck claywhich was incapable of absorbing even the torrential rains which, fell in the wet season... The farm was foredoomed to failure; but because it failed the Government has refused to do, anything further to exploit the agricultural possibilities of the Territory. : It is true that at present about a hundredfarmers, are making a living by growing peanuts;. but. they are all settled' on farms of double the ajrea which would be required to enable them, to make a living fromtobaccq culture.. Beautiful river flats and am abundant supplyof fres-hj water from ruiani-ng streams, combined with a climate thoroughly suitable for tobacco cultttre, are conditions which exist in the Northern Territory, and I urge the Government to adopt the suggestion that I hav.e. made for the granting -of assistance to. this industry. Thepastoral industry also offers great possibilities ofdevelopment in the Northern Territory. Sheep and' cattle can be raised, there profitably. For many years-1 have endeavoured' to get the Go? vernmentto establish a stud' farm in this remote"" area. Cattlemen in North Australia, as well as those in the southern areas, realize the advantage of breeding up to a standard; but scrub bulls hay.e wrought havoc in the quality of the stock in ithe Northern Territory. Even small cattlemen in the far north,, who run from 300 to 3,0,00 head of stock,, are willing to pay a reasonable price for good stud stock.. They realize that a badbeast costs just as, much to feed as a good one. But,, unfortunately, stud stock is available animals, that have been, procured' have failed to become acclimatized. If the Government, would? establish a stud f arcm in the more temperate zones on the edge, of the Barkly Tablelands, it would find, a ready market for the progeny in the Northern Territory. It cannot be expected' that our people will' go on year after year paying hundreds of guineas fan stud stock which dies very shortly after it is delivered'. A good, deal has. been, said in this chamber at different times in, relation to the possibilities of sheep raising in the Northern Territory.. In 1887 the flocks in the. Territory totalled 80,531,, whereas now they a«e do.w-u to a few thousands. This is due, not to. the unsuitability of the country for sheep, bu,t to the isolation of the holdings. The long distances which have to be traversed in. order to get the sheep to market have forced many settlers to abandon sheep -raisi'ng. Cattle cam be driven on the hoof to the rail head. The only period in which any real, effort was made to develop, the sheep industry in the Northern. Territory was while Dr. Gilruth was Administrator. !But, unfortunately,, the evils associated with previous administrations were perpetuated at that time.. The endeavour was made to raise the sheep on the sour coastal areas where the spear grass, grows from 10i feet to 1>2 feet high. Although suofe country is absolutely unsuitable for sheepraising, a few sheep have lingered on, though the spear grass has penetrated their entrails. Last year, I saw the remnants of some of the flocks on the Barkly Tablelands, and was surprised to find them in such excellent condition. If the Government would do something to assist this industry, it would be wonderfully well repaid. I wish to refer again to the possibilities of the mining industry in the Northern Territory. In 1895, the value of the gold produced in the Northern Territory was £111,94:5. From 1881 to 1892, the territory produced minerals valued at over £1,000,000. I have been asked why the mining industry has not prospered if the mineral deposits are as valuable as I have indicated. PerhapsI can answer that question best by quoting from the report of Mr Dashwood, who was the Administrator in 1900. He saidBefore the ruin of tlie mines by the English Defence( Mr Chifley) is seated in the companies, they had been profitably worked; and the returns had helped considerably to swell the output of gold. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN (Hon. R. A. Crouch) I ask the honourable member to connect his remarks with the tariff. that the Government could do a great deal to encourage the mining industry, as well as other industries, in the Northern Territory, apart altogether from the tariff. The people there require a little assistance from the Government, and if it :it> given to them they will make a success fell Price, the author of a number "" f works on the Northern Territory said, on one occasionWhen in my next lecture I deal with the have referred. behaviour of labour extremists, it will be well to remember that the Northern Territory has door of Australia. An axiom which is also suffered from capitalistic greed.

The efforts that have been made We talk of our great White Australia to develop profitable industries in the policy, and of the need for imposing high constituency which. I have the honour to duties; but let me remind honourable represent, have, frequently, been nullified members that the fact that Australia has because of the financial'juggling of those been kept white is not due to foresight on who were more concerned about making the part of governments. Overtures were money than about developing the counformerly made to Italy, Japan, China, try. According to Mr Dashwood's report, Mr Horatio Bottomry spent £80,000 in one venture in residences, billiard tables, telephones, tennis courts, and so on, but left the mine untouched. It is unfortunate that from the days when the territory was under the control of the South Australian Government until to-day all efforts at development have been concentrated on the sour coastal areas, and the really valuable localities have been given no consideration whatever. I am certain that, given a little assistance from the Commonwealth Government, our settlers would be able to stand on their own feet. Given reasonable assistance, those areas are capable of absorbing large numbers of unemployed, and of contributing to the production of Australian commodities, which do not need nursing as do the products of many other industries. [Quorum formed.] I desire to focus the attention of honourable members upon the Northern Territory, and, as the Minister for ministerial chair, it is opportune to point out that, in the north of Australia, some 40,000 tons of crude oil is stored in tanks, and there is not even a pop-gun in that territorv for its protection.

But there comes a time when luck gives out, and the best insurance against trouble in the future is to populate that territory. Suitable settlers are already in the country, and, if given reasonable encouragement, they would convert it from a financial sink into ono of the most prosperous parts of the Commonwealth. At first I was inclined to think that the delay that has occurred in dealing with the tariff alterations was a disadvantage; but, the further this debate has proceeded, the more satisfied I am that the delay has been advantageous in certain respects. The operation of t h e tariff has demonstrated its complete failure to carry out the main objectives of the party that introduced it. It was intended to keep wages up, and unemployment down; but, during the period in which the tariff has been in operation, wages have steadily dropped, and unemployment has rapidly increased. Moreover, the delay in dealing with this problem has brought about a steady increase in the number of the converts in this chamber to a belief in the need for a revised tariff. I was glad last night to hear the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Keane) speak in reasonable terms about what should be done in tariff matters. I was pleased, also, to notice that the honourable member for Calare( Mr Gibbons) practically deserted the accepted tariff platform of the Labour party, and pleaded that the present high duties should not be allowed to operate to the detriment of the great primary industries. He practically delivered a free trade speech, and I trust that, when the individual items are under the consideration of the committee, you, Mr brought about, other brauches of industry are Temporary Chairman, if you then, happen to be in the chair again, will ask him to vote in accordance with the views that he has expressed during this debate. I was gratified, similarly, to note that durof manufactured goods, must tend to dislocate ing the speech made by the Minister for Defence (M.r. Chifley) at Lithgow, 'he pointed out that the Western Australian Labour Party could not control the fiscal policy of the Australian Labour Party. South Australia He said that that party in Western Auspolicy of the Australian Labour Party was one of high protection. Evidently there is a continually increasing amount of dissension among honourable members on the Government side in relation to the tariff. The inexorable logic of economic facts is gradually convincing everybody in the country that the present super tariff cannot be maintained. I believe that one result of the delay in dealing with it will be the removal of a large number of the heavy duties that have been imposed. It is worthwhile recording what the Tariff Board stated in its report dated the 30th June, 1930The examples given herein clearly show that many of the products of local industries are being sold at prices which equal the landed costs of similar imported goods, including the duty that operated up t ill the 22nd November, 1929. The changes which have since been made in the customs tariff, and the unfavorable exchange rates, together with the embargoes imposed upon imports, have resulted, in many cases, iu the local market being secured to the Australian manufacturer. In other cases manufacturers have lodged applications for further increases in duty. In practically every case the manufacturer is prepared to give an assurance that the prices of his commodities will not be raised if the increased duty is granted. It w ill be seen f r om the figures already given, however, that not only is it essential that the prices be not raised, but that the prices be very materially reduced . . . If , however, a duty aimed at equalizing the cost of production in Australia as against overseas is raised to a rate which represents prohibition, there is a grave risk of loss of customs revenue without securing the advantage of reduced prices of the local commodity. When this happens tlie consumer w ill pay in the price of the local article the amount previously collected as customs duty on the imported goods, and will, subsequently, be called upon to make up the loss of customs revenue in the form of direct taxation. This means that where reduction in prices is not in the position of having to subsidize through direct taxation, to the extent of the revenue previously collected, the new industry that hat resulted from the prohibitive tariff. It lollows that the burden of further direct taxation, without a compensating fal l in the cost industry and cause unemployment. That is the view of an impartial observer, and it emphasizes the value and importance, and, in fact, the inevitable necessity.",26,Fobde
74,Dr. Earle Page (Cowper) [4.50],"of bringing into being a tariff along the line3 that the Country party advocates. We need a tariff that will, first of all, lower the price of machinery required for the equipment of the factories of Australia., so that cheap goods may be turned out. Such a policy would encourage industries. It would enable them to supply the substantial part of Australia's requirements of manufactured goods, and also make it possible for us to begin to exgiven to them by way of tariff duties or port manufactures. That would make us less dependent than now on seasonal conditions and world prices for our raw products as the basis of our prosperity, and it would provide increased employment in Australia and more stable conditions. If we could bring about a condition of affairs under which we could export not only raw products, but also a continually increasing number and quantity of manufactured goods, we could bring about a marked increase in the value of our export production. That this could be done is shown by what has happened in Canada, the x value of whose exports rose from £89,000,000 in 1916 to £290,000,000 in 1928-29, increasing threefold. The introduction of the present tariff alterations shows that the policy of protecting all the industries of Australia indiscriminately has lamentably failed. During the last 30 years there have been eight major revisions of the tariff, even if this continually changing tariff of the last year be regarded as one. Having launched the policy of protection with duties averaging 10 per cent, or 15 per cent, in 1901, there are now about 418 items in our schedule on which an average duty of over 40 per cent, is imposed; and on 70 items the duty is over 75 per cent. I do not think that anybody will suggest that an industry needs 75 per cent, protection if it is naturally suited to this country. most serious eharge that can be brought against the present tariff policy is that during the 30 years it has been in operation it has not brought about, to any appreciable extent, those conditions which lead to economic and efficient production. In 1901 there were, roughly, twenty workers per unit throughout Australia, and to-day there are the same number. The number of inDr. Earl-e Page. dustries has increased, and yet we have only 707 factories in Australia which employ more than 100 men. No less than 97 per cent, of our factories are at present utilizing the services of fewer than 100 men. The Tariff Board, in its annual reports for 1928 and 1930, laid emphasis on the fact that many of these industries employed so few men that the protection bounties was worth twice as much as the cost of the labour employed in the whole industry. That ""is a heavy burden on Australia. In the past, tariffs have been hopelessly unscientific. They have been built up piecemeal, and most of the duties are out of perspective. The result is an irrational scheme of protection by means of unco-ordinated and often anomalous duties. During this crisis when we should be looking to the manufacturing industries to help Australia, by reason of the protection they have enjoyed in the past, they are unable to aid to any material extent. Although the purchasing power of our people has declined because the value of the prices of our exports has decreased in some instances 50 per cent., the national income has dropped by over £125,000,000, and the standard basic wage has been reduced 10 per cent., the prices of many manufactured goods remain at the same level as in 1926. A few days ago I quoted some statistics prepared by Professor Copland, showing that, whereas in 1926 the price index figure for raw products was 185, and for manufactured goods 18S, . in. 1930 the figures were 317 and 186 respectively; the prices of finished articles had not fallen in sympathy with the fall in the prices of raw materials, and that is one of the influences which is helping to keep Australia in the doldrums at the present time. The purchasing power of The the farmer and the workers with reduced incomes is diminished, and because of that while prices of finished goods remain high, fewer people are employed in industry. In contrast to Australian conditions, the prices of textiles and other English manufactures have fallen in the last three years about 40 per cent, or in about the of manufacture same ratio as the fall in the prices of cereals. In Australia, on the contrary, the prices of cereals have fallen, but there has been no decline in tbe prices of finished goods. Something must be done to alter this state of affairs, and a revision of this schedule offers scope for remedial action. . In 1908 only eight items in the tariff bore duties of over 40 per cent., whereas in the present schedule 418 items carry duties of over 40 per cent., and 70 duties of over 75 per ceut. At the same time these industries have a 30 per cent, additional protection in respect of exchange, and 4 per cent, in respect of primage, whilst 132 items are the subject of prohibitious or super duties. This huge burden carried by industry is capable of substantial reduction without injuring any manufacturing enterprise. By recasting the tariff on sane lines', further employment would lie provided, the cost of living would be reduced, and our export industries would be given an opportunity to recover from their present unfavourable | Quorum formed.] The Tariff Board investigated the reaso7is why the prices of Australian manufactures remain high in Australia although they are falling in every other country. Tilie board mentioned three main causes-(1), . inefficient machinery and over capitalization; (2) excessive overhead, because of the limitations of the market; and (3), insufficient co-operation between employer and employee to insure increased output per individual employed. The Country party's policy aims to remove those three) disabilities. We desire to terminate this era of inefficient machinery and overcapitalization by reducing the cost of machinery essential to production. We have heard a great deal about the adverse trade balance during the last ten years, but the value of machinery introduced for the establishment of new industries during that time exceeded our adverse trade balance. tion of machinery for the establishment of new industries or the improvement of existing ones is of advantage to Australia because it assures progress. The cost of production can be reduced by making it possible to install sufficient machinery at lower cost hy admitting the machines duty free from England, and this will tend to correct the evil of over-capitalization. In regard to the second complaint, that the overhead costs are too high because of the limitation of the Australian market, there are some moderately protected industries which have been able to thrive, and yet reduce the prices charged to the consumers, because they have set out to capture the whole Australian market. They are not always supplicating this House for increased duties. Many of them are conteut with duties of 35 or 45 per cent. If we were impartially to study the tariff in its whole perspective, to select 40 or 50 major industries that have a real chance of becoming established on an. economic basis, and ultimately of becoming exporters, and to withdraw the duties from other insignificant industries or retain some of them for revenue purposes only, the costs of those major industries would be so reduced that they would position. be able with lower tariff protection than at the present time, to supply the local market and sell overseas in competition with other countries. If only half'our export production came from the factories, that fact would tend to bring employers and employees closer together, because awards would have a definite relation to the world economic position. At present primary producers have to sell their goods competitively in the markets of the world. They have to bear what is strangely called in some quarters the burden of export. What a way to speak of our export production! If we were able to export our secondary products, arbitration laws and awards would he based on economic considerations, and there would be no insistence upon the protection of hot-house industries that can get Australia nowhere, aud that only build up the cost of living, decrease the purchasing power of v/ages, and burden other industries. The policy of the The importaCountry party aims to encourage the manufacture of natural secondary products for which there is a ready market, and the raw material of which is produced in Australia. The boot industry, which is protected by duties of 35 to 40 per cent., supplies 90 per cent, of the Australian market. Its machinery, is introduced duty free, and that concession, together with other helpful factors, enables it practically to dominate the Australian trade. At one time, when otlier conditions were more favorable, it exported annually about £800,000 worth of boots to New Zealand, and I am told that Rhodesia each year would buy about £200,000 worth of Australian boots if they could be sold at competitive prices. There is a big overseas market to be developed for our boot trade. Many thousands of pounds worth of Canadian sandshoes, and other rubber goods are imported into Australia annually. If that dominion, which is further away from the sources of rubber supplies, can build up a big export trade in rubber manufactures, why cannot Australia do so? Of the rugs and blankets used in Australia each year 87 per cent, are of local origin. The manufacturers have not asked for huge extra duties. The Berlei Corset Company has acquired 80 per cent, of the total Australian trade, and is exporting to New Zealand; it has never applied for increased duties. Soap manufacture may be said to be a natural industry, and 95 per cent, of the market for that commodity is supplied by local factories. Surely if Australian soap is good enough to satisfy 95 per cent, of our people, it is good enough for the people of other countries. If we give the major secondary industries a chance, we shall lx j able to develop an export trade, and so bring additional money into the country. member mean that we should remove the protective duties on soap? enabled the manufacturer to get his machinery at lower costs, and removed the protection from subsidiary industries that will never be of great value, the cost of production in industries that have real potentialities would be reduced. I shall illustrate what has already happened in Australia. RecentlyI visited two adjoining factories at Botany. Davis Gelatine (Australia) Limited makes 16 per cent, of the total gelatine production of the world, and exports over 40 per cent, of its output. It has been able to progress because the arbitration award prescribes the same rate of wages for each shift. As a result, the factory at Botany is one of the great gelatine producers of the world, and Australia is not able to supply it with sufficient waste products for its raw materials; it has to import some of the material from which gelatine and other goods are produced. Alongside that concern is the factory of Kellogg (Aust.) Proprietary Limited. I asked that firm why they were not exporting their products all over the Pacific, and was given two reasons. First, they had to pay 70 per cent, duty on the machinery imported for their factory; and, secondly, the Arbitration Court would not permit the firm to work that machinery for 24 hours a day. They desired to work three shifts, and had no objection to paying the stipulated wages for all shifts at the same rate if permitted. If they could work that expensive machinery for 24 hours a day, six days a week, they could give employment to three times as many hands as they have at present, and would be enabled to cut costs of production to such an extent that they could export their products to all parts of the Pacific. At present they have to start their great machines at eight o'clock iu the morning, and cease operations at two o'clock-onl y one shift-so that the packers can fill their packages by knock-off time at 5 p.m. The breakfast foods that they manufacture are hygroscopic in nature, that is they take up water from the air. They must be cartoned immediately or they would speedily become worthless in the humid the honourable atmosphere of Sydneyi f left overnight. I leave honourable members to reckon how greatly that firm's overhead expenses are increased because of its inability to work the expensive machinery an additional two shifts a day. Take the case of our iron and steel industries. We have available in Australia, the richest iron ore deposits to be found ih the world. They are right on the water's edge, readily accessible to navigable waters, and alongside are great deposits of coal, the Maitland area having seams 60 feet to 70 feet in thickness. Why, then, are we unable to market our iron and steel products overseas? orable gentleman knows that Maitland coal is not used for smelting purposes ? that some of the Newcastle seams are used; they are even closer to the water.",27,Fobde

I merely wish to point out that it is a different class of coal from that used in the iron and steel works. located in that spot because of the accessibility of the coal deposits and the availability of transport facilities. The year before last Canada exported £16,500,000 worth of its iron and steel products, on which it enjoys a protective duty of 15 per cent, to 20 per cent. Australia, with a protection twice as great, cannot even hold its own market, In the same year, Canada manufactured and exported £24,500,000 worth of nonferrous products. That has been achieved by concentrating on industries that were worth-while, and for which the resources of the country were adapted. We should follow a similar course in Australia and then both establish industries and get revenue duties from right Instead, the tariff imposed by this Government has practically sounded the death knell of our customs revenues without really helping major industries. Let mo give a comparison of the prices of a few iron and steel items in the United Kingdom and in Australia. In England pig iron is sold at £3 5s. a ton, while in Australia it costs £6 10s. Bar steel sells in the old country at £7 15s. while here the price is £12 12s. 6d. Spring steel is £14 5s. a ton in Great Britain, and £24 a ton in Australia. Bolts and nuts are £19 a ton in the Motherland, and £31 a ton here. That should not be so. Our prices must be considerably reduced if our industries are to succeed. What excuse is there for our galvanized iron costing £5 to £7 a ton more than it does in New Zealand? That means the imposition of additional burdens on our primary producers. The effect of our policy is apparent especially on such huge concerns as the BrokenH ill Company Limited. concern had erected a big by-product factory at a contract price of a little over £1,000,000. The manager of the contracting company showed me over the works, and, incidentally, informed me that his company had purchased Australian-made goods where ever that was possible. At the time his company was seeking a rebate of £300,000, representing duty charged by the Commonwealth Government on material that was imported as it could not be produced in Australia. I do not know whether the Government has met the company in the matter; if it -has I give it my blessing. The company is a big concern, and should be able to put its case quickly and well. Eveni f it succeeds, other smaller concerns will be unsuccessful with similar applications. The Government must surely realize what a ^tremendous load its tariff policy places upon industry. Something should be done to have these matters adjusted by Parliament. I remember a claim for rebate that was lodged during the term of the Hughes Government, and was adjusted only just before the Bruce-Page Government went out of office. I sug1 gest to the present Minister for Trade sources. and Customs( Mr Forde) that he would .make his term of office a notable one if he took steps to have the whole schedule reclassified, so that protection may be given only to those industries that can materially benefit Australia, and items not made to cover goods that have no chance of being made here commercially for many years. The matter of what items are to be admitted free of duty and what not should not be left to ministerial or departmental control; it should he specifically decided by Parliament. We have had eighteen months in which to judge how the new tariff has worked. Obviously, it has failed. Instead of increasing, it has lessened, employment. Further, it has added to the prices of our manufactured commodities. I remind the committee that years before federation, the firm of G. and C. Hoskins Limited secured the contract to supply 400 miles of water pipes for the Kalgoorlie water supply, in competition with the world. Why cannot that sort of thing be done now ? It would be possible if the GovernProprietary ment formulated a tariff on the line that Recently that I have indicated. Preference should be given to Great Britain and our sister dominions where possible, and reciprocal trade arrangements entered into with other countries. We should establish a",30,Fobde

80,Dr. Earle Page,"The works werefriendly trading feeling towards Australia, instead of engendering the antagonism of foreign countries. If we told Great Britain that we were willing to take, on a free trade basis, £20,000,000 to £30,000,000 worth of goods that cannot be produced here, in return for preferential trading treatment in connection with our wheat, wine, meat, and so forth, we would have no difficulty in making the deal. The additional employment provided in Groat Britain by such a scheme*, would make that country only too ready to grant us the preferences we sought. gentleman knows that Great Britain would not do that. 1923-24, when Mr Bruce was Prime Minister, he returned from an Imperial Conference at which he negotiated substantial trading preferences for Australia. There would still be left a very great field of possible bargaining with other countries for commodities which we shall not be able to produce for at least 50 to 100 years. Negotiations could be entered into and reciprocal trade treaties established. Only recently, Australia lost a meat contract with Italy because of the action taken by the Government of that country as retaliar tion against our tariff. That policy will not bring us trade. It merely antagonizes other countries and embarrasses our own industries. I urge that, in the light of the experience that it has gained, the Government will adopt the policy that I have advocated. [Quorum formed.] I desire to say a few words as to how our balance of trade would be affected if the Government adopted the policy of the Country party, and gave discriminating protection to selected industries. Such a scheme would substantially reduce prices, tend to increase exports, and improve our balance of trade. That can be best shown by recalling what happened during the period from 1893 to 1914. During that time there was a favorable trade balance each year, despite the fact that, for the first five years, New wisely spent. Similarly, the line from South Wales was operating on an absolutely free trade basis. Australia was not able to take a great many imports during those years, because she did not have the money to pay for them, and it was difficult to borrow. Exactly the same thing is happening now. Our favorable trade balance ' is due not to high tariffs or embargoes, but to the fact that we have not the money to pay for imports. This is borne out by the figures which the Government itself has made available. The importation of petrol has declined by 40 per cent, during the last eight months, although we do not produce any petrol in Australia. It is our poverty that has caused a diminution of the demand. Metals and manufactures have declined by 70 per cent., and motor vehicles and parts by 84 per cent., although we do not make those articles in Australia. The decline in the importation of carpets has been higher than in anything else, although the duty on carpets has not been increased. The importation of coal has fallen by 85 per cent., although there is no protective duty on imported coal. It was imported in the first place because of industrial trouble in this country. country where this sort of thing has been happening? happening all over the world. That is the point I am making. Take Hungary, for example: The Government of that country reduced import duties by 15 per cent., yet the volume of her imports has declined. Last year there was a decline of 30 per cent, in the volume of imports into the United States of America, not as a. result of higher tariffs, or embargoes, or super duties, but because of economic conditions which will obtain in Australia whether this tariff is passed or not. We shall find that, for the next ten or fifteen years, our exports will exceed our imports, because we are hard up. That will be a good thing for Australia. We shall be able to use profitably much of the machinery that has already been bought, and our railways, which are now running at a loss, will become payable. Take, for instance, the line connecting Sydney with Brisbane. The money spent on that undertaking was Adelaide to the Northern Territory will eventually become a valuable asset.

In the treatise known as The Australian Tariff, by Professors Copland and Giblin, and Messrs Dyason and ""Wickens, there are three very significant and pertinent observations which no one can deny. The first is as follows:The evidence available does not support the contention that Australia could have maintained its present population at a higher stanarticles, companies which had never dard of living under free trade. That is an. answer to those who put the primary industries in a class by themselves, and have no time for the secondary industries. The statement goes onTlie adoption of a considerable, but not unlimited, amount of protection is justifiable ou economic grounds in the circumstances of Australian industry. But the extreme applications of the tariff have undoubtedly been a cause of net loss. Further extensions may involve a more than proportionately increased loss. There has been'a further extension by the present Government, which, far from creating more employment, has so shaken commercial enterprise by violent tariff changes, that the volume of unemployment has actually been increased. The authors continueI t is important, therefore, that no further increase in, or extensions of, the tariff should merchants for their Australian mowers, be made without the most rigorous scrutiny of the costs involved. How that advice has been ignored! I could deal with many other anomalies in the tariff, but I prefer to leave them until we are discussing the items in detail. I mention one, however, to show how certain firms have been unfairly discriminated against. For instance, an Australian timber company, registered in Victoria, all of whose shareholders are Australians, is being discriminated against by the tariff as compared with firms importing timber from Borneo. This firm imports kauri timber from the Solomon Islands. This timber does not compete with any Australian timber; it competes only with kauri timber from New Zealand, which is admitted into Australia under a preferential tariff, and arrives sawn into planks. Although the Solomon Islands kauri comes here in logs, and is sawn in AustraMr White. lian mills by Australian workmen, it is treated under the tariff as a foreign product. This case calls loudly for investigation by the Tariff Board. Another case has to do with lawn mowers. While the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton), who was then Minister for Trade and Customs, was in England, he had conversations with the representatives of an English company, and induced it to establish a factory in Australia for the manufacture of lawn mowers. There were already in Australia two firms making those applied for increased duties. The existing duty was 20 per cent. British, and 30 per cent, foreign. On the basis of 20 per cent. British, the Qualeast lawn mower was costing, landed into merchants' store in Melbourne, 31s: 6d. for 12-in. mowers, and 33s. for 14-in. mowers. The mowers were being sold retail at 4.2s. 6d. and 45s. respectively. will have to see that the honourable member for Maribyrnong is put out of his party. party he may belong to; I shall not fail to criticize anything which I think is wrong. As soon as the Qualeast Company commenced operations in Victoria, it advanced its prices to the wholesale in parcels of fifty, to 35s. l i d . for 12-in. mowers, and 37s. 4d. for 14-in. mowers, and insisted that the retailers should charge 50s. and 52s., respectively. In this case, protection of industry brought about price-fixing by the manufacturers, so that the public were not allowed to buy at the lowest price. That has happened over and over again. AlthoughI cannot say that this applies to the company I have mentioned, it has certainly happened many times in the past, that as soon as an overseas company North knows that it is assured of a certain amount of protection, it dumps into Australia large quantities of overseas-made products, and, having established a corner in the Australian market, rapidly recoups the cost of its Australian factory out of the increased price which it so obtains. When the time comes, I shall be able to quote half a dozen examples of this sort of thing. The Government has",33,Fobde

He was in office during the most prolific years that Australia has experienced. Our revenues were buoyant, and he had every opportunity to adjust the tariff in sueh a way as to bring the' greatest measure of prosperity to our industries. But what was the result of the tariff policy of the Bruce-Page Government ? The honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr White) and other -honourable members of the Opposition who have contributed to this debate, commented caustically on the fact that this Government presented eight -tariff schedules and put them into operation without permitting any discussion to take place upon them. Not one of .those honourable members, in criticizing the Government, took into consideration the fact .that it is faced with a serious financial crisis. Its position is unprecedented, and .some drastic and extraordinary action is required if Australia is to be placed on the road to prosperity. Every suggestion that the right honourable .member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page) made this afternoon could have heen put into practice during the regime of the Bruce-Page Government, for the times were then propitious for experimentation; but this is not the time for trying out such theories. If we did soj, we should find ourselves in .a more hopeless position than ever.

The right honourable member for Cowper has said that it is only because of our poverty that we have not continued to buy motor cars and other luxuries. In -ray -opinion, many better reasons could be given for the expenditure of considerably less money than formerly upon imported goods, one of them being the tariff imposed by this Government with the object of encouraging secondary industries in Australia. We shall, as time goes on, reap the full advantages of this policy. In endeavouring to make a point against the tariff, the right honourable member said that the Kellogg Eood Products Company had spent £100,000 on machinery for its Australian factory, upon which it had to pay 7>0 per .cent. duty. He argued that this had crippled the industry ; but he disproved his own statement, for he went on to complain that the company had not been able to produce at .the f u l l capacity of its machinery because the Arbitration Court would not allow it to keep the machinery in motion for 24 hours a .day on a three-shift system. For my part, I hope that the Court wail 'never allow .any industry to carry on its operations for three shifts unless it is absolutely imperative that the plant shall be kept in operation. However, the plain fact is that neither the tariff policy of the Government nor the Arbitration Court can be blamed for the failure of this company, because it has not failed; it has succeeded.

The Government of which the right honourable member for Cowper was a member sent a delegation to America, the most highly mechanized country in the world, to methods with, I suppose, the idea of adopting them in Australia. [Quorum formed. | What benefit did we derive from the investigations of that committee? It has been proved that not even the American efficiency methods are sufficient to maintain the prosperity of that country. The United States of America has not only the most efficient manufacturing plants of any country in the world, but she also has plenty of money, and real money at that. She has melted her gold into lumps and placed it in the vaults of her banks. But even America is in difficulties to-day. So are Germany and Great Britain. It is true that France is enjoying some degree of prosperity at the moment, but eventually she, like all other nations which are relying on the present monetary system, will encounter insurmountable obstacles. I repeat that the present system is breaking down, not because of inefficiency or tariffs or currency, but simply because the methods of production and distribution are based on wrong principles. This Government is endeavouring to improve our business and industrial methods. An honourable member interjected earlier in the debate this afternoon that this Government could not borrow any money. In my opinion we should, so far as possible, avoid increasing our troubles by the adoption of those methods. A proper monetary system would provide the Government with ample means without placing a crushing interest burden upon the people. If I had my way, I would change our monetary system without a moment's delay. MrM . CAMEEON -What system tariff' policy, should recall that if this would the honourable memher adopt in Government had . the opportunities place of it? for use' and not for profit. I would get has.

Sitting suspended from 6.15 to 8 p.m. member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page) in criticizing the policy of the present Government told us what should be done, but he should remember that he held the position of Treasurer for a longer term than any other occupant of that office, and during that period the Government of which he was a member should have legislated in such a way as to bring about the results which he now so much desires. Notwithstanding the prosperous conditions which prevailed, the Government of which the right honourable member was the Treasurer failed so dismally that it was annihilated and the right honourable member, together with ' his colleagues was ignominously "" fired "".

The honorahle member for Riverina( Mr Killen), who represents a. rural constituency, should' realize that our present economic position is due not to any action on the part of this Government, but largely to the marked decrease in the price of our wool and wheat. This Government has tried as far as is humanly possible to meet the situation by introducing legislation, which it was thought would assist in alleviating the situation; but owing to the action of another place, which has resolutely stood in the way of everything which this Government has attempted, our legislative programme cannot become effective. A majority of the members of another place, who do not possess the confidence of the electors, will not allow this Government to attempt a scheme of rehabilitation. venting this Government from doing even more harm. anything that has not even been tried is likely to be harmful? Could anything which this Government might do be more disastrous achieved by the Government of which the honourable member for Riverina was a supporter? act of this Government prevented the development of this country? It is useless for the honourable member to make mere statements that do not mean anything. Why do not honourable members opposite get down to fundamentals and definitely state what this Government has done to retard development? Their only solution of the difficulty is a reduction in wages and in government expenditure generally. government expenditure naturally means a reduction in the purchasing power of the people which would bring about an even more dismal state of affairs than exists to-day. If additional revenue were made available by reducing the salaries or wages of public servants, by'reducing old age and invalid pensions or repudiating our obligations to former soldiers who fought for this country, would that additional revenue be invested in industry? As mentioned. a day or two ago the workers of Australia have within the last two years made a sacrifice equivalent to 22 per cent, of their earnings, which, during a period of two years, represents £44,000,000. In spite of such a tremendous sacrifice industry has not been developed and employment has not been made available to the workless. How can a policy such as honorahle members opposite support relieve the present depression? This tariff, which was framed with the intention of stimulating industry cannot possibly do so unless the purchasing power of the people is increased by placing the thousands of men who are now unemployed again in remunerative work. Some eighteen months ago I submitted a scheme whereby that could bo done. I did not propose anything that had not been previously tested. I did not advocate inflation; that is a policy which I do not favour. I merely suggested that our overdraft should be increased and the credit of the country extended by £20,000,000. If that policy had been adopted all our people would now be at _ work and. there would be some opportunity to correct our economic position. But that proposal was not accepted. Honourable members oppothan the record site who allege that this Government has been responsible for accentuating the depression know that it has done Has any single all that is humanly possible, and that an institution comprising certain inhuman persons is standing in its way.

I favour the prohibition of the importation of all goods that can he manufactured in this country even if it means temporarily paying a somewhat higher price. After visiting Bryant and A reduction in May's match factory at Richmond, Victoria, I came to the conclusfoii that it was useless to attempt to find fault with the organization or the conditions under which the employees were working.

The best speech on the tariff was delivered by the honourable member for Bendigo, ( Mr Keane) who, in the course of his remarks, directed attention to the fact that although the wages paid in some highly protected industries have been reduced hy 22 per cent, there has been no corresponding reduction in the price of the commodities which those industries are manufacturing. If the Tariff Board wishes to retain its right to function it should see that the tariff is properly applied to such industries and that the consumers and not the manufacturers get the benefit of any reduction in wages. If it can be proved that there are anomolies, adjustments can be made when the items are under consideration. were one or two instances in which some amendment was necessary, but after further investigation I found that the manufacturers only require sufficient time to honour the promise they made to the Minister for Trade and Customs. those instances I am satisfied that consumers are not being penalized by paying the prices now ruling.

He said in effect that although this Government promised to do so much for them they had not given them even a penny.

Have not the farmers, in common with others, to pay in accordance with their capacity? On a previous occasion I pointed out that 202,000,000 bushels of wheat were reaped last season, and that in previous years hundreds of millions of bushels have been sold at prices ranging from 4s. 9d. to 5s. l i d . a bushel.

Let me quote a case that came under my notice recently in South'Australia. I thought there of the conditions that apply throughout Australia.

It is true that during the regime of the Bruce-Page Government the national debt of Australia was increased, on account of borrowing by about £220,000,000; but I point out that, of that sum the State Governments £207,250,000, while the Commonwealth's share was only £12,750,000. Against, the latter sum, the Commonwealth had obtained assets at least three times as great, which are earning ful l interest, and also providing for a sinking fund. The honourable member for Adelaide endeavoured to show that the former Government's borrowing policy had made it necessary for the present Government to impose high duties; but I have pointed out that the former Ministry was responsible, not for the borrowing policy of the whole of Australia, but only for the money borrowed on behalf of the Commonwealth. The present Government, however, is entirely responsible for the tariff alterations which it now submits. A general debate on the tariff affords an opportunity to members to examine the Government's fiscal policy generally, and one cannot do that without noticing that the tariff wall is steadily growing in length, and enveloping an increasing number of industries. Under this policy more articles are being removed from the free list, and, incidentally, goods made in Australia are being relieved of competition. This wall has now enveloped so many classes of industries that only about one-third of the goods that we import are now on the free list, whereas about two-thirds of the imports of the United States of America, which is often quoted as a high tariff country, are free of duty. Another striking feature of the tariff wall is that, while it is steadily growing in length, it is even more rapidly growing in height, and the mortar in the top row of bricks hardly has time to set before another row is superimposed upon it. In The honourable gentleman 30th June, 1928, attention was drawn to the fact that while in 1908 only eight items on the Australian tariff schedules carried ( duties of 4'0 per cent, or more, those items had increased to 580, many of them carrying duties of from 60 to 80 per cent. The record is reached with one item which is 8,000 per cent., the duty being eighty times the invoice value of the product. Of the 580 items which have been increased to 40 per cent, and over, the present Government during its short reign has been responsible for more were responsible for than half. In the case of fifteen of them the ad valorem rate of 40 per cent., 50 per cent, or 60 per cent., whichever it may happen to be, is only part of the duty, because in addition, there is a fixed rate of duty. In respect to 172 itemsI believe there are more, but I can vouch for 172-ther e is not only an ad valorem rate but also a fixed rate to be taken alternatively to it. Whichever rate is the higher is .applied. One finds in almost monotonous repetition throughout the tariff schedules the words ""whichever rate returns .the higher duty"". When alternative methods of taxation are provided the higher rate is always imposed. In addition to these high rates I have mentioned, in the case of 132 items, there is imposed a super tariff of 50 per cent, of the existing duty. The tariff wall is so high now that one needs a telescope to see the top of it. When wages are falling, when manufacturing costs in respect to wages are coming down, the manufacturers should really need less and not more tariff protection. Before any duty is imposed on imports the Australian manufacturer has the benefit of a certain amount of natural protection in the shape of ocean freight, marine insurance and so forth. It varies. In some cases it is comparatively insignificant, in others it is as high as 100 per cent. The natural protection alone doubles the price of some articles, but it is quite safe to say that it",41,Fobde
123,Mr Paterson (Gippsland) [8.26],"averages approximately 30 per cent., quite apart from the exchange position. When goods are landed in this country a statutory addition of 10 per oent. is made to the f.o.b. price in order to cover the assumed cost of transportation, and arrive at a rough estimate of the c.i.f. value for customs purposes, and the customs and primage duties are based on the higher figure. I propose now toshow what happens to goods worth £100 on which is imposed a duty of 60 per cent, plus a super tax of 50 per. cent., and a primage duty of 4 per cent., and when 30 per cent, is added for the natural protection of ocean freight, &c, and 30.5 per cent, for exchange. The landed price of goods costing £100 f.o.b. becomes £263 18s., in this way£ s. fl.

Exchange. . 203 18 0 *To this has to be added the statutory 10 per cent, to bring up to assumed c.i.f. value for ceeding in a competitive struggle are customs taxation purposes. But this £267 18s. is merely the wholesale landed duty-paid cost of goods worth £100. When to this we add 12£ per cent, for merchants' profits and 25 per cent, for retailers' profits, the price is considerably increased. If £1,000 worth of goods were landed here duty free, and without primage duty, the merchants' profits and retailers' profits on this basis of 12-J per cent. and. 25 per cent. respectively would bring the price of those goods up to £1,406 before they reached the consumer. moderate duty of 15 per cent., such as New Zealand imposes on many imported articles, were imposed, the profits of the wholesalers and retailers would increase the value of the goods to £1,616. But where, as in Australia, a statutory increase of 10 per ceut. is added, and the duty is, say, 55 per cent., the cost of these articles before they reach the consumer becomes £2,343. With a tariff wall as high as that, is it any wonder that a large proportion of the goods we need in Australia are very much dearer than they ought to be? Is it any wonder that manufacturers take advantage of the charter to profiteer which has been handed to them by a misguided government? Is it any wonder that the workers' wages have a lower purchasing power in Australia in respect to manufactured goods than in almost any other country in the world? I admit that all manufacturers do not take full advantage of this tariff wall. It is perfectly true that certain secondary industries in Australia which are highly protected are selling their goods at prices which compare favourably with those in other countries. Boots, rugs, and blankets are a very good example of what can be done in Australia. They are being sold at prices which bear quite favorable comparison with prices in other countries; but what of machinery, .. .. 100 0 0 whether it is to be used on the farm or in .. Of. 0 0 the factory? It ought to be as cheap as 33 0 0 possible if a country desires to produce 4 8 0 cheaply. It is, above all others, the very .. 30 0 0 thing in regard to which we should say, .. 30 10 0 "" Hands-off"" in respect of customs duties, yet it carries some of the highest imposts of all, and our manufacturers' and primary producers' chances of sucwrecked before they even get a start. Broadly speaking, there are two theories in regard to protection. One is that a duty should be imposed in order to secure the whole market in a country, and thus permit of mass production with the object of securing a cheaper output and enabling sales to be made at competitive rates without taking f u l l advantage of the duties. There are some industries proceeding on those lines. Unfortunately, there are a great many more w hieh are not, and those who T If a are engaged in them think that the purpose of the duty is to raise the level of external competition to rates which will enable big profits to be earned by the local manufacturer, operating perhaps on a small scale and with efficiency in many cases far below that of his overseas competitors. Too much of that sort of thing is going on in Australia to-day. It is, unfortunately, a most popular view-point with many manufacturers? Australia is hampered by its high duties. Its secondary and its primary industries are suffering from a certain amount of arrested development because of the tremendous loads placed upon them by high tariffs. The load on machinery and equipment in particular has just about reached the breaking point. We shall never do any good in this country until we reduce it. An Australian-made road roller costs £1,450. For a similar road roller made in Great Britain the price is £550 f.o.b. There may be some little items of expense in the price of the Australian roller which are not included in the f.o.b. price of the British roller, but still there is an impossible difference between the two. We are able to make locomotives in Australia. The engines of the "" S"" type, which haul trains between Melbourne and Albury, are magnificent examples of workmanship. But what is the position in regard to the factor of price? Honourable members opposite seem to think that we have done everything we need do when we can produce a good article which will do the job regardless of what it costs. That reasoning is unsound. in Western Australia produce locomotives which are cheaper than the imported engines. general experience. An Australian manufacturer of locomotives stated in evidence that the cost of building his engines was 20 per cent, above the price for which similar engines could be landed from the United Kingdom after paying the cost of transportation and a duty of 40 per cent. A young country like Australia cannot afford to load itself with such an immense difference in costs. Bolts and nuts made in Australia cost £31 a ton; in the United Kingdom, £19; a halfyard excavator, such as is used for making water storages, cutting railway tracks and roads, &c, costs in Australia £2,300. The British excavator £1,450 c.i.f. Manufacturers have stated in evidence before the Tariff Board that these high costs are due to the high price of steel, Why is the price of Australian steel so high? At Iron Knob, which is not far from the seaboard, there is the finest deposit of iron ore in the world; it averages about 67 per cent, of iron. Three tons of that ore will produce two tons of iron. Ore from the Longwey mines in France contains 34 per cent, of iron, and three tons is required to make one ton of metal. Some of the ore at Iron Knob is extraordinarily rich, containing up to'95 per cent, of iron, and it has been taken into asmithy at Port Augusta and forged into horseshoes without undergoing the process of smelting. Our rich mineral deposits give to us a tremendous natural advantage, and we are able to export iron ore to the United States of America and Europe; that is proof positive that it can compete in the markets overseas without assistance, despite the handicap of freight. Why then is there such a tremendous difference between' the price of iron and steel smelted in this country and the metal produced abroad? I ask honourable members to consider the discrepancy revealed in the following figures:Australia. £ s. d. £ s d. Pig iron . . 6 10 0 .. 3 5 0 Steel joists .. 12 12 6 .. 7 7 6 i Bar steel . . 12 12 6 .. 7 15 0 Spring steel 24 0 0 . . 14 5 0 All these extra costs are passed on and on, increasing the price of everything that is produced from these commodities, until they reach the one section of the community which cannot pass them on. That is the section which produces 96 per cent, of our exportable commodities, and thus creates credits against Australia's obligations overseas. These men, who should be encouraged in every possible way, are forced to carry an almost impossible load in the form of tremendously high prices for commodities that are essential to them. A few years ago when wool was 2s. a lb., butter 2s. a lb. wholesale, and wheat 6s. a bushel, it was possible for the primary industries to carry a certain tariff load, but it is impossible for them to carry the burden any longer. It is an extraordinary anomaly that at a time when special consideration should be given to the primary producers, heavier indirect taxation is being heaped upon them. Take for example the change over by the present Government from the policy of the former Government in respect of the assistance given to the manufacturers of galvanized iron, fencing-wire, and wire-netting. The Bruce-Page Government assisted those",42,Fobde
124,Mr Cubtin,The Midland workshops,44,Fobde
125,Mr Patersok,"That is not theindustries by means of a bounty. The present Government has removed the bounty and substituted duties. former Government adopted the bounty system not because it was simpler, for it was not; not because it suited the Treasury, because the Treasury would sooner collect duties than pay bounties; not because it suited the manufacturers, who always prefer a protective duty to a bounty; but simply because it enabled the producers of wheat, wool and other exportable commodities, who must meet world competition, to obtain their essential requirements at competitive rates. By adopting the bounty policy the Bruce Page Government said in effect that, if it was to the advantage of Australia to establish in the Commonwealth factories for the production of galvanized iron, wire-netting and fencing-wire, the additional cost to the users should be borne by the people as a whole. When, however, the stage was reached at which, in the opinion of the Government, the community as a whole could no longer afford to pay the bounty to bolster up those industries, it transferred the whole burden to that section which can still less afford to pay the huge subsidy to the manufacturers. Evidence was given that the average wage in the iron and steel industry was £6 5s. a week. I am not opposed to high wages, but that rate would represent absolute opulence to the vast majority of men who are saddled with the additional cost of fencing-wire, wire-netting and galvanized iron. A very small proportion of the men on small farming blocks in the Mallee or in Gippsland obtain a reward for their labour of £6 5s. a week. We cannot have in this country two widely different standards, one for men in the secondary industries and another for men in the primary industries. Sir Otto Niemeyer said in regard to the Australian tariff(a) Primary producers competing in the world's markets with Australia have a competitive advantage over the Australian primary producer, so long as the Australian costs of production are not reduced. (b) Australian secondary industries must face a fierce international competition, growing in intensity as the price level falls, unless able trade balanco is the direct result they in their turn are able to reduce their costs. Tho secondary producer can attempt to meet this price situation by increased tariff protection, but this simply means that his proThe tection is achieved at tlie cost of primary production. That contention is indisputable. Tbe chief purpose of the tariff to-day is not to restrict imports, but to enable manufacturers to maintain, high prices. The high tariff wall has been a comparatively small factor in bringing about the huge drop in importations. We do not import extensively to-day because of our poverty; we cannot provide the money with which to buy goods overseas. Mr Gordon Woods' publication, Business and Borrowing, includes a table relating to the trade balances of New South Wales prior to and immediately after 1893, when the big financial smash occurred following the land boom. Before 1893 New South Wales had a long succession of adverse trade balances, and after that year, a long succession of favorable trade balances, simply because owing to the depression its people could not afford to import. At that time New South Wales maintained an almost free trade policy, the only customs duties being on tea and kerosene. Yet when the State was deep in the trough of depression the tradebalance turned in its favour. Australia will again have that experience, regardless of tariffs. If half the tariff wall were removed the effect on importations would be almost negligible. Men would want to import certain goods at the lower rates of duty; there would be a demand for exchange, which would not be available, and the exchange rate would rise more and more. We should have an exchange rate not of £30.10 per cent, but £50 per cent., which would be the natural means of preventing such imports, instead of the unnatural method adopted by this Government, which has given offence to so many of our overseas customers. An increase in the exchange rate would largely take the place of the tariff, if the tariff wall were reduced to one half its present height. I was amazed at the honourable member for South Sydney( Mr E. Riley) yesterday, contending, as also has the Prime Minister, that our present favorof the high tariff duties imposed by this Government. It would be just as reasonable to argue that the barnyard cockerel which greets the morning sunrise, is responsible for the rising of the sun. As a fact, the high duties imposed by this Government have had little to do with the present favorable trade balance. The true reason is not far to seek. Importations of all except the most essential commodities have ceased largely because our people cannot afford to buy them. I may add that we shall never be able to afford such commodities again unless we reduce our costs. An examination of the tariff in detail will fully support my contention, because it will be found that the importation of commodities, the duties upon which have not been increased, has declined to almost the same extent as the imports of those goods upon which heavier duties are now being levied. I do not wish it to be inferred that I believe tbe higher duties have had no effect upon importations. I merely assert that they are not nearly so effective as the Government wishes us to believe they are. Our first care, in a discussion on the tariff should be to see that the machinery of production used in all our factories is made available as cheaply as possible. I believe that, if we could concentrate our attention upon the big natural industries, primary and secondary, instead of giving indiscriminate tariff assistance to so many small parasitical industries, we should be in a much better economic position to-day. whole of the tariff policy of this Government is in urgent need of review. We need to think of first things first. We should concentrate upon the protection of those industries which are capable of building up an export trade. Since Australia is a debtor' country, it follows that the fullest encouragement should be given to our export industries. To this end every unnecessary burden that has been laid upon them by this Government should now be taken of f . Even the Tariff Board is becoming horrified by the structure which it has helped to rear. Experience has shown that when the Tariff Board concentrates upon the v immediate welfare of individual industries without having regard to the probable effect upon other industries of a protective policy in regard to that Mr Paterson. industry, it frequently recommends substantial duties. Sometimes, also, the Government imposes duties even higher than those recommended by the board. But when the board sits back at the end of the year or a period of years and reviews the cumulative results of its high tariff policy, it appears to be afraid of its own handiwork and thereupon states some wholesome truths in itsannual reports. The honourable member for South Sydney yesterday said that, in the discussion of the Government's tariff policy,, honourable members should take the broad view. Evidently, the honourable gentleman thought that members of the Country party, to whom, apparently, he was directing his remarks, would be taking the broad view if they were willing to concede some special tariff concessions to particular industries which, no doubt, he had in mind. I agree with the honourable, member that we should take the broad view; that we should pay no regard to the narrow view which sees only, one industry at a time-onl y the manufacturer in Sydney or Melbourne-and ignores the interests of the country beyond. I agree that the opportunity having been given to us to discuss the tariff policy of this Government, our vision should range over the whole gamut of industry and see it as a whole. We should not fail to note the evil repercussions of our present high tariff policy The upon essential, competitive and exporting industries, resulting from an indiscriminate handing out of excessively generous fiscal favours to small parasitical industries which will never be anything but parasitical in character. If this Government had taken a broad view, in which, apparently, the honourable member for South Sydney believes, such a schedule as the one now under discussion would have been absolutely impossible. I have given up hoping for anything sound and sane from this Government with regard to tariff matters as well as other matters. It declines to look ahead. The immediate horizon is sufficient for it. It is useless also to expect moderation in tariffism from the present Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Eorde). I freely admit that he is most industrious and diligent about his ministerial duties, but be is utterly incapable of conversion to tbe path of economic sanity. I believe that the Minister and those who support him will, when the appeal is made to the -country, go down clinging to their fiscal faith, whioh they will find as buoyant as those bricks which they have heaped in such numbers upon the tariff wall. Paterson butter curse at all events. under the scheme to which the honourable member for Corio( Mr Lewis) refers, our butter producers obtain in the Australian market a little more than export parity for their produce. But does the -honourable member for Corio know that the price at which our butter is being sold in Australia is just about equal to the price at which fresh Danish butter is being sold in Great Britain to-day, if we take into consideration the difference iu exchange? I make the comparison with Danish butter in England because Danish butter when landed on the English market is as fresh as Australian butter is when it goes into consumption in this country. How many products of our secondary industries can be sold in this country at prices even remotely comparable to prices obtaining in Great Britain for similar articles? If all our secondary industries in Australia could be placed on the same competitive level as is the butter industry, money would go much further than it does to-day. What Australia most needs to-day is a downward revision of the tariff, such as will lower production costs, increase the purchasing power of wages, stimulate exports not only of our primary products, but make possible the advent into the field of overseas trade of our great natural secondary industries which up to the present have been kept within sheltered walls by the tremendous number of high burdens that have been imposed upon them through the tariff. Mr A. previous administration do something in that direction? governments may have been guilty of certain tariff excesses, I remind the honourable member that when the Bruce-Page Government left office the number of items in respect of which the duties were over 40 per cent, was 259. After eighteen months of rule by this Government, the number has been increased to 580. I congratulate the Deputy Leader son) upon the fact that the advent of this Government has at least emancipated the him from the fiscal serfdom imposed upon him by the protectionist policy of the Ministry with which he was allied. It must be apparent to all houorable members that but for the change of government some little time ago, we would not have been treated to the exposition of fiscal independence which not only the Deputy Leader of the Country party, but also his leader (Dr. Earle Page), has given to this House to-day. able gentleman like to be equally free as representative of Western Australia? freer in my consideration of this tariff than the honourable member was when dealing with tariff items brought in by the Government of which he was a member. I say this because I feel that if we are to have a right appreciation of the significance of a tariff, we must realize that we cannot haves an entirely satisfactory examination of its economic incidence if we insist upon the retention of existing political demarcations. I feel also that, in the consideration of this subject, no possible unity among honourable members opposite is possible either under their de jure leader or their de facto leader, and I doubt that the latter will be seen here. Obviously, the arguments which the honourable member for Gippsland has addressed to us in general principle are at complete variance with the views that have been put forward by members of the Nationalist party as such, and certainly by representative nationalist spokesmen outside this Parliament. We must realize that Australia is not an the fact that large portions of it are comparatively undeveloped, make it almost certain that any attempt to discuss the tariff in its Australian-wide aspect from the standpoint of how best it suits particular areas which, I shall say, are effectively occupied, is bound to produce violent political reactions.

A sound case may be made out for increased or lower duties, but alterations sbould not be made in tbe tariff simply because tbe argument for sucb a course is, in itself, sound. There would have to be taken into consideration the effect that that alteration would have, cither up or down, upon the existing industrial structure; and to what extent it so far as possible, restrict its imports to would make it difficult for this country to beGome possessed of the means overseas to pay its way. I answer part of the contention of the Deputy Leader of the Country party ( Mr Paterson) when be said that the borrowings of the Bruce-Page Government were unassociated with the fiscal policy of this country. If desired, I can, giving chapter and verse, state from 1923-24 to 1928-29, the overseas and Australian borrowings by the Commonwealth G'overnment as distinct from those of the State Governments. figure approximates the extent of our adverse trade balancefor the period. I quite understand the honourable member's contention that his Government converted into a live debt that which was previously comparatively a dead debt. As a matter of mere argument, that is true. But the fact remains that that conversion did give to this country, for the purpose of paying for exports, the command of external resources which it would not otherwise have had. It was out of the pool of that artificial prosperity created overseas that the Bruce-Page Government was able to permit Australia to pay for its excess of imports. The very illustration which the honourable member used in the concluding stages of his speech about the effect in New South ""Wales of the depression following the collapse of 1S93 is a perfect economic analogy of what is now occurring. The principal reason why we cannot import at present is that we have not command of funds overseas. The argument of the honourable member that we are a debtor country, and, therefore, must encourage our exporting industries, is a sound one. But there is another aspect. Every £1 worth of such goods imported into Australia, as we could ourselves manufacture under right industrial conditions, represents £1 which is really added to our overseas liabilities, and for which Australia has to pay. Not only have we to find money overseas to pay for our annual interest obligations; we also must be possessed of the requisite funds to pay for our imports. It seems to me to be a sound principle of national economics that a debtor country should, those goods that will come in as a reinforcement to its own productive capacity. Any other kind of imports represents a wastage of the value of such exports as the country may have, as they do not help it to balance its external trade obligations. I feel that I can look at the whole of these schedules with a perfectly open mind, just as I regarded those submitted by the Bruce-Page Government prior to the general election of 1929, when it passed its validating bill. I do not believe that it is possible to combat the problem of unemployment by a mere adjustment of the tariff. I do not feel that the differences between a policy of protection and free trade as applied in the life of any country produce any fundamental alteration in. the trade activities of that country. If it be a fact that Australia's primary producers are suffering grievously because of our tariff, then somebody has to explain to this chamber why it is that all over the world, irrespective of whether the tariff of the country be high or low, the primary producers occupy an adverse position, having relation to the rest of the community. The tariff of the United States of America is nothing like so high as ours, yet it remains a fact that if we were to reduce our tariff schedule to theiT level, and as a result give to our producers a status equivalent' to thatpossessed by the primary producers of the middle west of the United States of America, they would not be much better off than they are now. Of those who argue that the remedy for the difficulties of our primary producers is a lower tariff and lower cost of production, I ask how comes it that the agricultural population and the primary producing section of the United Kingdom are themselves in anything but a satisfactory position? ""We are face to face with a problem which goes very much deeper than, the mere incidence of a tariff schedule. I",47,Green Wh Y Did Not The Economic Unity Its Immense Area And
133,Mr Patebson,"They total £58,000,000.",48,Green Wh Y Did Not The Economic Unity Its Immense Area And
134,Mr Curtin,"That is so, and thecan quite understand that, having regard to post-war history, and more particularly the prognosis that statesmen made of the probable course of post-war events, and their anticipation of an intensive international competition for markets, it was but natural that each country should do all that was practicable to protect its home industries, so that it might weather the economical storm. The history of the last decade reveals everywhere a disposition to tinker with tariffs in the hope that, although that might not permanently resolve any problem, it would at least avert the worse consequences of the' devastating competition that is due, not so much to the superior productive powers of certain countries, as to the derangement of the banking and monetary system of civilization. Let me come to a consideration of the problem which this tariff submits to this Parliament. It is a fact that the schedule now before the committee increases substantially the duties imposed upon a long series of goods which in past years were imported into Australia comparatively free. There is a good deal in the contention that it was not necessary to fix duties at the present levels in order to effect a considerable reduction in the volume of imports. It is quite a sound economic contention that the exchange rate in itself would have afforded some protection. But the existing exchange rate cannot be regarded as a permanent one, and, therefore, cannot be put forward as a definite contribution to the protection of Australian industry. These tariff schedules were first formulated before the worse effects of the world depression had manifested themselves, but were yet put forward at a time when the economic consequences to Australia of a long series of adverse trade balances were was, therefore, justified in coming down quite early in its life with a series of proposals which would compulsorily restrict,the excessive importation into Australia of goods, which, in many respects, we could well manufacture ourselves. Further, so long as we were importing those goods, it was essential that more of our exports should be hypothecated in order to pay for their import, instead of going towards the redemption of our obligations. believe that the remedy for the trouble is to be found in absolutely wiping out existing forms of protection. I believe that we have to restrict our imports. As a debtor country we cannot afford, either immediately or in prospect, to look forward to having this immense piling up of national obligations annually, and concurrently of haying to employ the greater part of our exports to pay for our imports. Any fiscal policy authorized by this Parliament that merely permits exports to balance imports, will make it compulsory for the country to pay its interest bills by making arrangements for fresh loans overseas. Therefore, the avoidance of default ultimately involves a contraction of imports, so that added to interest payments they will total less than exports. sion of exports? about an extension of exports in a world suffering from restricted market facilities, and of a diminished purchasing power is simply to voice a pious aspiration which cannot become a practical solution of the trouble for some time yet. ber's leader has appealed for more exports. lower, even of the blind. It was, however, sound national policy to believe that those exports for which we regularly found a market in the past would in the ordinary run of things be the most valuable in a time of national crisis; that whatever be the present price of wheat, it was better for us to produce 100,000,000 than 50,000,000 bushels of it annually. There is much to be said for the contention that the real time to encourage an increase in the production of wheat or wool is not palpable. The Government when the prices of those commodities are high, but when they are low. The time to restrict acreage is when prices are rising towards the peak, because the peak can occur in the cycle only very infrequently, whereas the average occurs often. An examination of history justifies expectations of recovery. It shows us that when, the price of wheat is low there is a contraction in the acreage cultivated in most of the great producing countries. Therefore, the country that has the courSome age to increase its acreage at such a time",48,Green Wh Y Did Not The Economic Unity Its Immense Area And

If there is not going to be an improvement in the prices for wheat, wool, or base metals, this country cannot possibly meet its overseas liabilities for the next five years, or probably ten years, because no conceivable variation of local costs would enable Australia to produce profitably for export. It is upon that hypothesis that this country Las at least to formulate a choice of policy. It has either to adopt the view that there will be a recovery of prices, and revolve upon that pivot, or say that the opposite is the case; in which event it would be absolute folly to encourage the primary producers of Australia to continue on the extended developmental plan of the past decade. members of the Country party, that there comes a time in the history of every country when it is necessary to change the nature of its exports. That condition arises out of the growth of entirely new circumstances in the countries which heretofore have consumed your products. Who knows what changes will take place in Asia? If Asia should become a manufacturing competitor with other nations, then Great Britain, Germany, and France will have to dilute honourable more and more their economic life. Great Britain, instead of being paramountly a manufacturing country, will have to revert, to some extent at least, to agricultural industries, to provide itself with the necessaries of life; because, if it cannot sell machinery and textiles in China, it cannot possess itself of the means to purchase foodstuffs produced in other countries. Australia has to realize these facts. It appears to me that the problems must be tackled from the stand-point of finding means whereby the honourable Australia as a community may provide avocations for the existing population. In answering that question I find myself incapable of accepting even the logical conclusions of the statements made on behalf of the Country party in this chamber this afternoon. No country that goes in predominantly for primary production can maintain the standards, either of subsistence or of employment that are necessary in a modern community. The trend is more and more towards industrialization, standardization, raticularly in relation to manufactures, and increasingly in regard to agricultural activities. It is because of that fact that the competition for markets has become so acute. Each country, therefore, has been responding industrially to what it believes is necessary to make it self-contained. I do not agree that it is possible for any country to be completely self-contained. I would even enunciate the prinicple that it is undesirable in the best interests of civilization as a whole, for nations to track deliberately towards that objective. But we can at least acknowledge the fact that this struggle for markets involves employment opportunities. Any country that cannot furnish those opportunities for the mass of its citizens, will not have a stable life. In ' I would say, particularly to Australia, primary production provides 94 per cent, or 95 per cent, of our exports. But it is also a fact that nearly 65 per cent, of our population obtain a livelihood without being either directly or indirectly employed upon the soil. I agree that all those who are employed in transport occupations are connected more or less with ' agricultural pursuits. I",49,Green Wh Y Did Not The Economic Unity Its Immense Area And

142,Mr Curtin,"Obviously Russia ispoint out, however, that the percentage of our population engaged in primary production fifteen or twenty years ago was much greater than it is to-day. That is the case all over the world. The reason is that, with the growth of agricultural chemistry and the adoption of new methods of production, fewer and fewer units of the population are needed in the production, of the world's food' supplies. I have been toldI have not been able to verify it-that in connection with manufacturing operations the proportion of the population engaged to-day is less than it was twenty years ago. If that be so, it becomes necessary for governments to resort to those alleged parasitical avocations to which the honourable son) referred-occupation s that are a part of the social services of a country-if a livelihood is to be provided for the superfluous elements in production. Therefore this tariff can not be regarded from the stand-point of its scientific accuracy. inevitably by many anomalies in it. That is the case with every tariff schedule, because the finished product of one industry is frequently the raw material of' another. Country party ( Mr Paterson) illustrated the pyramiding that takes place as a result of the imposition of a duty on imported goods. That, of course, is certain to be one of the consequences of a protectionist tariff. I believe that industrial and commercial monopoly is strengthened in its momentum as a result of a protectionist policy. The trusts of the United States of America, the rings and cartels in Australia-consistin g of merchants who are associated for the purposes of exploitation-receiv e assistance from a tariff by reason of the fact that to some extent it restricts competition. happens to be the case. I do not say that there is absolutely free competition in countries that are free trade. Given the requisite organizational capacity, monopolies can operate in those countries just as they do in protectionist countries. Capitalized monopoly does not depend upon a tariff for its origin. It can be helped by and gain strength from a tariff; but it can become established no matter what fiscal policy a government may pursue. monopolies in Australia is organized labour. for Pawkner( Mr Maxwell), in making that statement, has allowed the language of exaggeration to distort his sense of proportion. I want this Parliament, in discussing the tariff schedules, not only to take into consideration the relationship of a particular duty to other industries, but to treat each industry fairly and to remember that all are related; to bear in mind that we cannot afford to ignore any of the existing avenues of employment for our citizens, and that, while helping certain industries, we must see to it that we do not prejudice others. I also desire that the economic structure of certain States shall be taken into consideration. There There must are secondary industries in some of the States which, by reason of their comparative newness, and the absence 'of an extensive local market that they may exploit, are prejudiced in competition The Deputy Leader of the with the more highly organized manufacturing industries of other States. A good deal of unfair trading goes on under the Commonwealth Constitution. Any tariff that is promulgated in Australia must prove more advantageous to a highly organized industry which has a large local market to exploit, than to an industry which is established in a State where the population is small and the opportunities for expansion are restricted. There are certain political considerations attendant upon this fact. Some of the States feel that the federation has not been altogether a success. They contend that a great deal of injustice is done to their industries and their people by the policy that has the sanction of this Parliament. I remind honourable members opposite that this objection to federal policy is not a new one, that it did not originate with the coming into power of the present Government. As a matter of fact, that dissatisfaction with the working out of the Commonwealth policy originated during the years in which honourable members opposite were in command of the Government.",50,Green Wh Y Did Not The Economic Unity Its Immense Area And

The readiness of the people of a particular State to seek freedom outside the Constitution is diminished or increased according' to the just or the unjust manner in which the tariff' operates in relation to its principal industries .. We have to 7 remember that the federation has not worked, economically,, souandly or fairly. There has never been, complete sa'disfaetion with. it..

T propose to quote the remarks of Mr Norbert Keenam, who presented for Western Australia the case that was submitted to the royal commission; which inquired into the relationship of that State to the Commonwealth, and wMchi recommended the making of a special grant. After' pointing' out that early' in the life of the Commonwealth the State of Western Australia had been given the right to control its own customs and excise tariffs; Mr Keenan went on to S *FI f the Commonwealth, authority decided not to recognize the claims of the State, or of those in a industry carried on in the State. . . such a decision would not merely affront all sense of justice; but alsoengender a deep feeling of distrust on tlie part of the people of the State. Nevertheless it would uo doubt be borne, as many wrongs have in the world's long history been borne, in a silence of subdued resentment. I feel that it is quite practicable for this Parliament, in the consideration of the tariff, to deal with each item as it stands and at the same time not to overlook the fact that it is definitely related to existing industrial conditions as well as to all other items in the schedule. No honourable member should have his mind paramountry centered upon what a particular duty happens to look like in the eyes of his constituents; each should be regarded from the stand-point of the effect that it is likely to have upon Australia. I shall justify the votes that I give for increased duties. I shall show that those votes are motived by the desire to reduce the volume of imports into Australia where jl/V.

This Parliament must, bear in mind that we can developan effective export trade only if we consent to thosecountries which purchase OUTexports receiving at least some-shareof the Australianmarket. We cannot expeeti other countries to purchase completely out' of our own market.

148,Mr Nairn (Perth) [9.50],"I objectAt present the duty is 45s. a gallon British and intermediate, and 46s. general. This provision about bottling in bond was inserted about twelve months ago, partly for the purpose of ensuring that spirits should be bottled under proper supervision, but more particularly to provide employment for those engaged in the bottling trade. As a matter of fact, very little extra employment has been provided. From the point of view of employment, it does not matter whether the liquor is bottled in tie bond stores or outside them. The effect of the provision, however, has been to impose an extra tax of 5s. a gallon on liquor imported by those firms or persons who have not bond stores of their own. Before this provision was made, a large quantity of spirits was imported by hotel keepers and others from the smaller manufacturers, chiefly in Scotland, who were able to supply the spirit more cheaply than the big whisky manufacturing combinations. The effect of this provision is simply to play into the hands of the large corporations which market the well-known brands. ordinary hotel keeper who was able to import wholesale whisky at lower prices, and transferred the benefit of those low prices to the public, is not allowed to do so any more, because he is obliged to pay an extra 5s. a gallon duty. The excise officials can supervise the quality of the liquor even though it is not bottled in bond. to the public a better quality of liquor? thing in that, but I do not think that it is worth the extra cost. No such provision exists in respect of home grown wine, nor do I think that any other country has done anything of the kind. We have a staff of excise officers, whose duty it is to make frequent inspection of the hotels, and who are capable of supervising the bottling of spirits. I am looking forward to the discussion of this item, and shall be interested to note how honourable members opposite vote on it. We have been told that these increased duties were imposed to correct our adverse trade balance. Every other consideration was to give way to this. Now, I understand, there is a general desire amongst Government supporters to reduce the duties on whisky and other spirits because they have been ineffective from a revenue point of view, and have only served to prevent various well-known brands from coming into the country. From the manner in which honourable members vote on this item we may be able to judge whether they were honest in their claim that the duties were imposed for the purpose of correcting our trade balance. In the meantime, I intend to keep an open mind on the matter. Progress reported. BILL (No. 2). Bill returned from the Senate without amendment. (ADMINISTRATION) BILL.

I read a few days ago in one of the Sydney newspapers what purported to be an official announcement that as a result of a review of old-age and invalid pensions the department was effecting an annual saving of about £50,000.

153,Mr Ward (East Sydney) [10.0],"I should .he a review of these pensions. They openly state that they are out to attack them. One can understand that; hut it is rather surprising to read what purports to be an official statement to the effect that the Federal Labour Government is scientifically attacking the old-age and invalid pensions, and that a saving of £50,000 is being made at the expense of our aged and infirm people. If it is true that the Government is effecting this economy in order to balance the budget, I say emphatically that I am not a party to its action, because I believe that the last persons in the community who should be called upon to make a sacrifice in this time of financial stress are those who are unable to assist themselves. Within a few days many of our so-called patriots will be delivering addresses on Empire Day. They will then deplore the fact that the disloyalists are trying at all costs to disrupt the peace of. the community, yet those very persons who, on that occasion, will be parading their patriotism, are effecting economies at the expense of the meti who fought for them in the Great War. This economy is being effected at the expense, not only of old-age and invalid pensioners, but also of returned soldiers. We know that the Government has dismissed nearly 4,000 employees from the postal services in an attempt to balance the budget, and among those dismissed men were 2,000 returned soldiers. All honourable members receive from day to day applications from persons seeking invalid pensions, and from returned soldiers protesting against reductions in their pensions. pension of a man who was disabled at the war, and is compelled to wear special surgical boots, has been reduced from £4 to 16s. 5d. a week. In another instance the pension was reduced from £4 to 14s. a week. We do not hear the patriots in this House protesting against that form of economy, but on every occasion that the members of this party attempt to make those who made their fortunes out of the war bear some sacrifice in this time of stress, we are heckled by honourable members, not only of the Opposition, but also of the Government side. If any economy is to be effected, we declare definitely that it must not be at the 'expense of the old and infirm people, because the paltry pension or allowance Mr Ward, which is given to them at the present time is not by any means sufficient to meet their immediate demands. It is incomprehensible to me that a Labour Government and Labour representatives should he prepared to acquiesce in an economy which presses heavily upon the aged and the infirm. I hope that even at this late hour the Government will rescind any instructions that may have been issued to the department to effect economies by refusing applications for invalid pensions. In many instances the applications of persons who are entitled to invalid pensions have been turned down, and the reason given is that that has been done on the advice of the medical referee. All sorts of excuses are made for refusing applications, so as to keep the expenditure on pensions as low as possible. The department is systematically and scientifically reducing its expenditure. I can give instance after instance of reductions in war pensions. The pension of one returned soldier has been reduced from £4 to 14s. a week. His vision is impaired and he has not been able to read since 1920. His disability is due to war service, yet the department has decreed that his pension shall be 14s. a week, notwithstanding the fact that his defective vision precludes him from obtaining any kind of employment. Let me give one illustration of the tactics resorted to by the department to bring about reductions in pensions. An' aged couple recently had their pension reduced by the paltry sum of 2s. a week. Away back in 1919 this In one instance the old couple were induced to pay a deposit on a block of land at Port Stephens and, in 1928, they still owed £52 on the property. Since then the husband has not been able to do a day's work, and despite the fact that he will never work again, and will probably never become the owner of the property, the department has decreed that this aged couple own a block of land at Port Stephens, and their pension has in consequence been reduced by 2s. a week. It is the duty of the Government to state definitely whether it is opposed to reductions in old-age and invalid pensions, or whether it is acquiescing in the scientific and systematic activities of the department. A l though j my colleagues and myself have within the past few months received maay applications for invalid pensions, not one these should be discovered and stopped. of them has heen granted.

There is no mention in the article of the gallant part the mother of the family must have played, assuming that she was livin g at the time. Neither is there any mention of the backing of wrong horses being apparently a hereditary f a i l in g in this respect, the brilliant also backing a losing horse in a political Melbourne Gup or All for Australia Cup. The article goes on to say thatThis is tlie man to whom Australians are looking now to help them fight their way back to honour and prosperity. After some more fulsome praise, the article contains this extraordinary passageWheneverI think of Mr and Mrs. Lyons a beautiful old-fashioned verse of poetry comes Hoating through my head. T invite the special attention of honourable members to the extraordinary line that is then quoted, as follows:He for God only, she for. God in him. The article concludes with these wordsNo wonder we look towards them in this our very present hour of need. In the Bulletin of the 29th A p r i l , the following paragraph appeared:The transparent honesty of the dispossessed sovereign, his deep faith in his ability to restore the lost prosperity of his people"", his noble rage as he describes the perfidity of the usurpers of his power, were brought out by Mr Lyons by methods which could hardly be called acting at all. As he stood there, his kindly face framed in silver-grey hair, his hands clasped across a stomach of modest proportions, and his good-humoured eyes gently lighted by the warmth of an inner integrity, it was impossible not to believe in his belief in the justice of his cause; even if one were unable to accept all* his proposals as practicable. In all his experience present critic has never seen such an unsophisticated performance have such a deep effect upon a house. Strong men wept, women looked broken-heartedly at their neighbours, and even the press reporters were seen to be unusually busy with their handkerchiefs. It was my intention this afternoon to ask the Attorney-GeneralWill he say if it is within his powers to direct that his department shall, if necessary, in consultation and co-operation with the State authorities, take appropriate steps in the interests of public health and morality, to prevent any further harrowing, stage-managed exhibitions of this kind being inflicted on a long-suffering public by a political Nick Bottom. -There is a second chapter to the story told by the honourable member for M a r t in ( Mr Eldridge), concerning which I desired to ask a question of the Prime Minister this afternoon. I wish to read to the family, nor of how, in honourable members an extract which is son is also taken from the Bulletin of the 29th A p r i l . It is as follows:But, great as was the emotion stirred by Mr Lyons, it was nothing compared to the sustained enthusiasm aroused by Mrs. Lyons. As the exiled queen, Mrs. Lyons was poignant in her majesty. In honiely words, which yet rang with intense conviction, she showed that the solution of the tragedy lay, not iu the squalid intrigues of courts, ov the fortunes of political battlefields, but iu tlie hearts of the people; in the steadfastness of housewives, to whom an unbalanced domestic budget was unthinkable; and in children, who never failed to admit that mother knew best. At the final curtain there was not a dry eye in the house. I intended to ask the Prime Minister this afternoon whether he would ascertain from the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr. Latham) how much longer his party intended to be led by exiled queens and screeching Sarah Gamps. I am sure that all honourable members w ill have a certain measure of sympathy with the Leader of the Opposition in the circumstances in which he finds himself. If the Prime Minister can assist the honourable gentleman in any way to overcome these circumstances, he w ill certainly do something which w ill tend to settle a question which is causing a good deal of public controversy at present. In the public life of Australia, the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham) has been regarded as a man of strong convictions, who has had a long legal training in connection with matters which affect our public life. It is, therefore, regrettable, in a measure, that he should be subjected to the indignity of having his campaign carried on for him in all the capital cities of the Commonwealth in the manner in which I have described. tralia's credit. noticed an article in the press which pointed out that the Leader of the Opposition had rendered great service to this country during the period in which he has led the Opposition in this House.",56,Adjournment Pensions Re Appointment Of Sra Robebt Gibson Al L Fob Australia

169,Mr Beasley,"-Last SundayIThe Sun referred to him in glowing terms. Not only did it publish a f u l l face picture of the honourable gentleman, but there was also another illustration, showing only the eyes, which were piercing in the extreme, and looking apparently, far into the future, considering the needs of his country. It is regrettable that a man of his capacity, according to the article which appeared in the Sunday Sun, should be left in the undignified position which he occupies to-day. I think that every honourable member will agree that this farce which has been played on tlie public with respect to a united front and united parties has been going on long enough. the well-being of the country it should immediately cease. As the credit of the country, as the honourable member for Martin( Mr Eldridge) has said is involved, I think it would be better and more fitting if some courage and determination were displayed by honourable members opposite, who should at least stand up to their responsibilities, instead of leaving the women folk to fight their battles for them. It is the first time in the history of this country that we have had such exhibitions. The lady to whom I referI do not speak in any disparaging sense-ha s entered into the political field voluntarily, and is, therefore, entitled to criticism in regard to the matter. ""While we have every respect and regard for the great service which her supporters have claimed publicly she has done to the community in the sphere in which she has operated, still we feel, in regard to political matters that when members of this House are being paraded as it were before the gatherings which she addresses, as incapable of discharging their duties properly, we are entitled to offer comment by way of reply. The Prime Minister and the members of his Government, including the Attorney-General, should endeavour in some way to prevent a repetition of this extraordinary behaviour. ringah) [10.33] I cannot help expressing my unspeakable disgust at the sorry spectacle which this Parliament has presented during the last half-hour. More amazing behaviour on the part 'of grown men, it would be hard to imagine. The vulgar abuse that has been heaped upon the wife of a reputable member of this House, is something of which honourable members and those whom they represent should be ashamed. order. The honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Parkhill) is absolutely misrepresenting the position when he refers to "" vulgar abuse "". -That is not a point of order. words "" vulgar abuse "" by the honourable member for Warringah as offensive, and For the good and for ask that they be withdrawn. ber for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) complains that the references of the honourable member for Warringah were offensive. I thefore ask that the words be withdrawn. withdraw them. The thing was not at all well done, and I am sure that every honourable member on this side must have felt utterly disgusted with those who participated in it. It is not unusual for the women of this country to take an active part in politics, nor for the wife of a member of Parliament to assist her husband, or to express her views on political questions of the day. Yet chivalry has always been displayed by members of Parliament, and by the public, with respect to the wives of members of Parliament and other women who appear in public. Never before have I heard any such woman attacked by a member of any deliberative assembly of this country as a woman was attacked to-night to the accompaniment of vulgar sneers and laughter, even from Ministers who ought to have known better. I hope for the credit' of this country that we shall never have a similar disgraceful exhibition from honourable members opposite, including Ministers. PerhapsI am entitled in this connection to make a reference, not to the wife of J. T. Lang, but to Mr Lang himself. I intend to quote from the same issue of .the Bulletin as was quoted from by the honourable member, a paragraph regarding the Premier of the most important State of this Commonwealth, a man who receives the approbation and craven adulation of",57,Adjournment Pensions Re Appointment Of Sra Robebt Gibson Al L Fob Australia
