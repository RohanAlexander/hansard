Groom) -The Public Service Act places the parliamentary officials under the control of the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives, who. in respect of them occupy the same position as that of the Board of Commissioners to the other branches of the Service coming under that measure. The ofncials of the Senate are under the jurisdiction of the President, those of this House under that of the Speaker, and those of the joint departments-Hansard, the Library, and the House Committeeunder that of the President and Speaker jointly. the officials of all the parliamentary departments have received f u l l consideration, but any member of the staff who is dissatisfied, with his treatment, or desires to make any representations concerning his position, can do so through the regular prescribed channels. pared a complete list or the salaries paid 16 July, 1996. to the messengers and others . associated with the staff of this House, and obtain from the Public Service Board informa(Hon.

W it h respect to the I s it proposed to give suggestion that information should be obtained from the Public Service Board about the salaries paid to similar officials under the board's control, I may inform the honourable member that in fixing the salaries and wages paid to the officials of the Parliament, particular attention is given to the nature of the duties performed, and regard is had to the wages ing positions in other branches of the Public Service, so that f u l l justice may be done to all on the parliamentary staff., able member that the practice I have messengers, and outlined has been followed.

Some seven years ago I drow attention to this matter and secured some amelioration of the position. I wish, sir, to ask you whether the attendance book, whioh must be signed by certain officials only, can be placed on the table of the Library for the inspection of honourable members. I may mention that MrK in g O'Malley at one time insisted that every officer of the department over which he then presided should sign the attendance book, and to set an example he signed his own name at half-past 8 a.m. each morning-he visited his office That caused a little revolution at the time.

TAX ON CROWN LEASEHOLDS. notice1. Whether the whole tax due on Crown leaseholds has yet been collected? 2. If not, how much is still outstanding? tbe honourable member's questions are as follow:l . No. 2. In view of a recent judgment of the High Court it is impossible to state a definite tions were established between the two figure. Assessments of land tax on Crown countries by the British Government leaseholds were made by the Department of appointing a Charge d' A ffaires in MosTaxation for all years in which the ta.x cow, and by the Soviet Government apoperated. The assessments were based on valuations ascertained by the departmental pointing a representative of similar status methods of valuations then employed. Some in London. of these assessments had, at the 30th June, 1026, been reviewed by the adoption in thom of lower valuations ascertained by tlie application of the rules of valuation recommended by the royal commission which considered the subject in 1924. This revision resulted in very great decreases in the tax originally assessed; in some cases, the tax was entirely wiped out. At the 30th June, 1926, the amount unpaid of the land tax assessed as stated above, was £984,832 for all years. The department had, since April, 1925, when the Government decided to adopt the rules of valuation recommended by the royal commission, taken ac&ive -steps to require Crown lessees to pay part of their taxes pending final revision of their assessments. The amount of £984,832 would probably be reduced to not more than £300,000 at -the conclusion of the work to apply the -royal 'commission's rules of valuation. On the 5th July last, Mr Justice Rich, of the High Court, delivered judgment in Brisbane on an appeal by Mr Edmund Jowett against the valuations applied by the department in accordance with the royal commission's rules of valuation to three of his Crown leaseholds. The court rejected the valuations thus found, and, by implication, rejected the royal commission's rules of valuation. The court adopted tions, and rejected practically the whole of th? had collected. The court found freehold valuaI s the Prime Ministions for the land which were very much lower than those found by the department by the application of the royal commission's rules of valuation. On tlie court's valuations there was no statutory value of the leasehold estates in tlie land the subject of the appeal, and Mr Jowett's assessments are being amended in accordance with the judgment. It is impossible at present to gauge the effect of the I shall look into the judgment upon valuations in otlier cases, but if the principles of valuation adopted by MrI do not think there is any Justice Rich in the Jowett appeal are applicable to other cases, it is possible that very little, if any, land tax is still outstanding, on Crown leaseholds.

19,Mr A. Green Asked The Prime,"the facts are as stated in question No. 1, are the retailers keeping to thespirit of the arrangement that 4^d. per Ib. should be' charged to the consumer? 3. If Perth has not been determined as a .capital centre for distribution purposes, why has discrimination been made, as compared with the arrangement for other capitals?' honourable member's questions are as follow:1. Yes. 2. Retailers in Perth have been charging, the public 5d. per Lb. for sugar as against tbe stipulated price of 4£d. per lb. whicli obtains in the capital cities of a l l States except Western Australia. Perth retailers are not, therefore, keeping to the spirit of the arrangement by which the Sugar Board pays a l l freights from the refinery to Western Australia (amounting to approximately £30,000 per annum), so as to enable grocers in Perth and Fremantle to retail sugar at 4£d per Ib. and still receive the same gross profit as grocers in the eastern States. 3. Perth, and also Fremantle, were determined as capital centres some time ago for the purpose of distributing sugar-a t the particular request of retail grocers in those cities -so that grocers in Perth and Fremantle, by receiving sugar at exactly tbe same price charged to grocers in the capital cities of eastern States, should be enabled to sell such sugar to the public at the lower rates charged in the eastern States. Despite the payment by the Sugar Board, necessary to reduce the wholesale price in Western Australia to the wholesale price in eastern States,, of freights amounting to approximately £30,000 per annum, grocers in Perth and Fremantle have retained their substantial concession, and' the public have not derived the benefits for' whicn the concession was solely granted.. several months' negotiations with the Grocers' Association of Western Australia, the association refused to sell sugar to the public at the stipulated price of 4 i d . per Ib. for cash, and the Commonwealth accordingly could no longer withhold objection to the proposal of the Queensland Sugar Board to withdraw tbe freight concessions. These concessions were withdrawn as f r om the 1st July, 1026, and from that date Perth and Fremantle ceased to be regarded as capital cities for the purpose of distributing sugar. The Western Australian Grocers' Association has been informed that the concessions w ill be immediately reinstated if grocers in Perth and Fremantle agree to sell sugar at 4 i d . per lb. for cash, as is done in other capital cities. Minister, upon notice1. What procedure is followed in the ratification by tlile Government of various treaties and conventions? 2. I s Australia committed by the treaties negotiated by Great Britain, which have not been approved and/or signed by Australia? orable member's questions are as follow :1. The practice followed iu the Commonwealth in respect to the ratification of treaties is that adopted by the 1923 Imperial Conference, as follows:(a) The ratificationof treaties imposing obligations on one part of the Empire is effected at the instance of the government of that part; (6) The ratiiication of treaties imposing obligations on more than one part of the Empire i» effeeted after consultation between the governments of those parts of the Empire concerned. It is for each government to decide whether parliamentary approval, or legislation, is required before desire for, or concurrence in, ratification is intimated by that Government. The procedure in respect to treaties is for the Governor General, on the advice of the Executive Council, to move His Majesty the K in g to effect ratification in respect of the Commonwealth. Certain international conventions of an administrative or technical character are not subject to this procedure of ratification, but are confirmed and approved by the Governor General, on the advice of the Federal Executive Council. 2. This question, deals with the constitutional "" relationships between Great Britain and the self-governing parts of the' Empire, and cannot 'be appropriately dealt w it h in reply to a question.

The estimate of Customs receipts for 1926-27 is £29,208,000. the proposed tax on petrol, chassis, and tires amounting t'o £1,500,000. It w ill be seen that each year since June, 1923, the Customs receipts have greatly exceeded the estimates, and that, notwithstanding the tariff, they are becoming greater each year. In 1922, when the present Prime Minister was Treasurer, there was no stronger critic of his administration than the present Treasurer. In a speech delivered in this House on the 12th October, 1922, he saidThe increase in Customs revenue is not a matter of which the Treasurer should he proud. It should rather cause him to go into sackcloth, and place ashes upon his head. If the then Treasurer should have gone into sackcloth and placed ashes on his head for receiving a Customs revenue sent scathing indictment, having received for The revenue raised the last year. £27,000,000 in Customs revenue, should put not ashes but coals of fire on his head.

It would be unfair to the Treasurer to quote the gross debt, and I , therefore, shall deal only with the net debt. In 1922-23, it was £335,371,000; in 1923-24, £335,123,000; in 1924-25, £336,196,000, and in 192526, £338,841,000. debt has, therefore, increased for those years by £3,470,000. In addition, the Commonwealth proposes to raise loans of £34,000,000 for migration spread over ten years, and of £20,000,000 for housing, which was one of the placards displayed in the Government's Bhop window at the last election. Whilst money is placed into a sinking fund, of which there is much boasting on the part of the Treasurer, the bulk of it being taken from the profits of the Commonwealth Bamk and the note issue, which institutions were established by a Labour government against strong opposition, the national debt is still increasing. In those ciurcumstajices, I cannot see how the Treasurer can rightly boast about the sinking fund. Turning toiconversion loans, which were mentioned .by the right honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Watt), I would point out to the House that there is a 'serious position .facing us respecting 'them. There will be £46,600,000 maturing .on the 15th December, 1927; for which we are paying 4£ per cent., and £21,200,000 at S per cent., the balance being at 6 per cent. Assuming that that money can be obtained for 5£ per cent, in 1927, we shall have to pay an extra 1 per cent, to convert the £46,600,000 and an extra $ per cent, to convert the £21,200,000, making an additional burden of over half a million per annum. surer will accept the estimate of 5^ per ing contrast. In the year ended the 30th cent, for 1927. 5$ per cent. now. will be found to be fairly correct. This for which complete' figures are .available, continual overseas borrowing has meant our imports were valued at £157,097,000,, tliat the Australian market has been so that they increased by approxiflooded with overseas products. I am adoptmately £57,000,000 in tbe three years. ing this line of argument, let me say, not Those figures spell, not prosperity, for the mere purpose of criticizing the budget, nor to decry Australia, for I have absolute and unbounded faith in the future of this country. I do nof care what Government may be in office, I think the country has such vast possibilities that its credit will remain sound. But as responsible men we should study the position into which we are drifting. The following table, showing the value of our imports and exports for the last four years, is enlightening:Tbe net national Year. Imports. Exports. 1922-23 .. £131,757,835 .. £117,870,147 1023-24 .. 140,618,293 .. 119,478,164 192425 .. 157,097,465... 161,106,111 192526 (11 months only) .. 140,639,257 .. 138,014,302 It will be seen, therefore, that while the excess of imports over exports in 1922-23 and 1923-24 was £13,887,688 and £21,131,129, respectively, we recovered our ground in 1924-25, when we had an excess of exports to the value of £4,008,646. But, unfortunately, we lost ground again last year to the 'extent of £2,554,000. I wish now to compare the total' increased -value of our imports with the total aaamint of loan money that we 'have raised abroad, to isiww how closely .the mm approximates to -the other.

While we are paying toll to the foreigners by importing their goods, we are paying doles to our own will undoubtedly relieve the situation, to a large extent, but it will not remove all the pressure. It is regrettable that its introduction was delayed for so long. We talked about it for years' before it was actually introduced, and while we were talking our production steadily decreased, and the number of unemployed steadily increased, until conditions generally became such as should not obtain in a country like this. While we were importing goods we were also bringing migrants here. opinion that is an insane procedure. We discussed the broad question of immigration when the Development and Migration Bill was before us, and I do not propose to say much on it just now, but I invite the attention of honourable members to a few figures to illustrate the nnancial .effect that the new migration agreement will have. According to a cable message published in the press on the 2nd July last, the Under Treasurer of Statef or the Colonies pointed out that Under the old scheme it cost Britain for migration (as far as Australia was concerned) £5.80,836 in connection with 25,696 migrants for the year .ended the 31st March last. In other words, it cost Britain £22 13B.. per migrant. Under the new agreement Australia is to receive 450,000 migrants in ten years, and the maximum cost to Britain is to be £7,083,000. In other words, each migrant is to cost Britain £15 14s., or about £7 less than under tbe old arrangement, in addition to which Britain will be relieved of unemployment payments to the extent of about £50 per annum for every migrant. The statement furnished to us on the 1st July of this year by the Minister for Markets and Migration gave some interesting figures, from which I have abstracted the foUowing table:Total number Year. 1923 1924 1925 Tbe state It will be seen, therefore, that the average expenditure for the three years was Many of £323,333, the average number of migrants introduced 25,502, the average cost to Australia being £12 10s. per migrant. Under the new agreement a total amount of £34,000,000 is. to be spent in unemployed. The new tariff ten years, to introduce 450,000 persons. The expenditure per annum will thus average £3,400,000 for 45,000 persons. Under paragraph 5 of the agreement Great Britain will contribute £130,000 for every £750,000 spent, so that on an expenditure of £3,400,000 a year she will contribute £589,333, leaving Australia to find the remaining £2,810,667. In addition, Australia will have to pay 4 per cent, on the £3,400,000 each year, so that the cost for tbe first year under that heading will be £136,000, and it will increase every year afterwards. In my At the end of ten years Australia will have to pay the ful l rate of interest on the money borrowed. It is clear that, under the new agreement, Great Britain will be much better off, and that Australia will have to meet a considerably increased expenditure. ber has not explained that Australia wiU retain the assets created by the expenditure of the money. ing this money for the settlement of each migrant at three times the rate provided under the terms of the agreement. borrowed abroad we shall have £34,000,000 worth of .goods .added to our flood of imports, and that will be detrimental, rather than beneficial, to the industries of Australia penditure per bead explained by the fact that under the new agreement migrants will be settled on the land, whereas they were not so settled under the old system? -only a small percentage of tbe migrants can be settled on the land, because, if you divide. £34,000,000 by 450,000, there is less than £80 per bead available for that purpose.

Can this be fairly described as expenditure on new works ? I submit that the country is being misled. It may look well for the Government to say that it is spending so much on new works, which will be additions to the permanent assets of the country; but it is unsound finance, in my judgment, to spend borrowed money for paying the passages of assisted migrants. Let us take a brief survey of the finanthe Treasurer surplus after surplus, there cial position. The total expenditure from revenue and from loans from 1922-23 to 1925-26 was as follows :192223 .. .. £62,275,327 192324 192425 192526 The estimated expenditure from revenue and loan funds for 1926-27 is £73.980,830. The. expenditure has increased from 1922-23 to 1925-26 by £10,045,083; and it is now estimated that £1,660,420 more will be spent this year than last year. A survey of the finances of the nation shows that the position is not very encouraging. Our interest bill abroad for Pederal debts aloneI am leaving out of consideration the State debts-is approximately 8,000,000 per annum. The total value of imports in excess of exports for the four years from 1922-23 to'1925-26 was £33,500,000, and the excess of exports required to balance the interest woiild be, say, £32,000,000. nation must export more than it imports in order to balance its finances, and Australia is in the position of having imported more than it has exported. found all tbe worse if the. honourable tion. member also takes into consideration the figures relating to the States. fining my attention to the Federal that the Government will stop the per figures.

From 1922 the States, the land tax, the estate duties, to 1926 we borrowed approximately believe. £60,000,000.

If we take the State loans and interest, it will probably be found that a similar position obtains regarding them. I have given, as briefly as I could, a general review of this phase of the budget. I turn now to the subject of the financial relations between the Commonwealth and the States. This has been raised as one of the burning issues of the .present time. As the Customs revenue has mounted higher and higher, giving has naturally been a demand for reduced direct taxation, notably of income taxation. The Government proposes a rearrangement between the Commonwealth .. .. £71,063,634 and the States, enabling it to say, .. .. £66.409,593 ""We are going to reduce direct taxation .. £7^320,410 by over £7,000,000, practically without any loss of revenue to the Commonwealth."" The Government hopes to bo in the happy 'position, when presenting the next budget, of being able to show that it has reduced direct taxation by so many millions. This will have been done, of course, only by cutting off the per capita grants to the States. Action in that matter has been postponed as the result of widespread criticism. When the Treasurer introduced the Surplus Revenue BillI asked him, by way of interjection, whether he thought that it was fair to rush the proposal, good or bad, through the House, expecting the States to rearrange their finances within a few A debtor weeks. At that time he said he thought that it was fair; but he has changed his opinion since then.

70,Mr Scullin,"The Government willamount in cash as it paid to them previously. scribed as per dcCpita payments from Customs and excise revenue, or are called land tax, estate duty, and entertainments tax, the fact remains that there is a lot of make-believe about the matter. The Treasurer could have reached exactly the same position by telling the State Governments that he would pay them so much during the ensuing twelve months, and would give them notice that at the end of the year the per capita payments would cease. But that would have been a backdown, and the honourable gentleman is camouflaging his backdown, at least for this financial year. sirability of preventing the duplication of taxation is a thing about which all honourable members agree. The delimitation of the spheres of taxation is also a desirable end; but it is not everything in it self. A f t e r all, the only real evil associated with duplicate taxation is the extra cost involved and the. extra inconvenience to the taxpayers. If we could eliminate or reduce the inconvenience to the taxpayers and minimize the wastefulness due to the operation of a duplicate system we should achieve the same result whether we delimited the spheres of taxation or not. There is no big principle involved, and certainly none which would justify the rendering of the condition of the finances of tbe States chaotic. The Treasurer saidThe authority which expends money should have the responsibility for raising it. roads grant? that. Speaking generally, the Treasurer's statement. I have quoted is sound, but I point out that under the new arrangement proposed, the duplication to which he takes exception continues. The honourable gentleman also saidThe States should be financially independent of the Commonwealth. I submit that the States cannot become financially independent of the Commonwealth. It is impossible that they should do so. The Treasurer himself admits that, in what he proposes. I have before me the figures showing the amount the honourable gentleman is going to raise from land tax, income tax, entertainments tax, and estate tax, which be is proposing to hand to the'States, and'to .make up the difference between that amount and 'the amount of the per capita grant he pro""Whether the moneys are deposes a special grant of £600,000.

Then tbere are special grants to be paid to Western Australia and Tasmania, because of special circumstances, and amounting to £828,000. There is no independence of the States there. I submit that any loss made by a partner in the Federation must be repaired, and we cannot bave State financial independence. The worse feature of the honourable gentleman's scheme is the .proposal that the Commonwealth shall engage in The deroad-making, which is essentially a State function. For this purpose he proposes a grant of £20,000,000 extended over ten years' and so links the Commonwealth up with a State activity and function for the next ten years at least. It is most anomalous that at the time when the Government is. saying that it wishes to delimi t the spheres of taxation of State and Commonwealth, and to separate the Commonwealth finances from the States', it should come down with a new scheme to link them together in the carrying out of work which for the last 25 years has been regarded as essentially a State responsibility. given no guarantee. grant £20,000,000 to make roads in the different States was no doubt soothing to the ears of the people, especially in the back country, at the last election. It was one of the proposals of the Government I am coming to that was placarded throughout Australia. It was one of the finest and most brightly labelled goods in the Government's political shop window-£20,000,00 0 for main roads! Yet the Prime Minister said in bis policy speech that, unlike other Prime Ministers, he made no lavish promises of millions. The right honourable gentleman promised more millions than were promised by any other Prime Minister.

As such it would have been discussed as a legitimate Or illegitimate proposal for the encouragement of Australian industries.

I want to tell the Government that there is going to be no camouflage in this matter by calling a special revenueraising duty a protectionist duty. Government's proposal must be discussed on its merits. The Prime Minister tells me that the proposal was set out in his policy speech. When the shop window was being dressed for the election, the Government £20,000,000 for main roads. Every one was to be running a motor car over the boulevards constructed through the bush, but no statement was made that, in order to find the money, special duties of Customs would be levied as a purely revenue producing expedient. I submit that the duty on petrol should only be imposed on fchose'who use the article for transport. It should hot be imposed on men using tractors on the lands in the back country, or stationary engines, aeroplanes, or motor boats. Boats which run on our rivers, and aeroplanes which sail through the. air, do not damage our roads. agree that the people who are smashing up our roads should contribute something to their construction and maintenance. I suggest that in the imposition of the proposed duties, it will be practically impossible for the Federal Government to discriminate, and I am not certain that it bas tbe constitutional power to do so. If honourable members read the opinions of at least some of the justices of the High Courti n the Barger case, with regard to limitations of taxation so far as it discriminates between parts of States, and their view that such discrimination must be regarded as unconstitutional, they will find that there is some doubt as to tbe constitutionality of the Government's proposal to levy an increased duty of some 400 per cent, on all petrol, whether used to smash up roads or to plough the. lands of this country. The tax is not scientific, and it is for an invasion of a sphere of action that does not belong to tbe federation. It cannot be scientifically or justly applied. I leave the matter at that stage now, because tbe Prime Minister to-day promised that the House w ill be given a f u l l opportunity to discuss the proposed petrol duties. Turning to the Treasurer's figures concerning tbe adjustment of State and Pederal finances, honourable members have before them the way in which he proposes the adjustment by the new arrangement. There are two aspects oi these figures which I submit are misleading. I regard that as serious when considering the finances of tbe Federation The and the States. There ought to be'no suspicion that the figures supplied are in any way. misleading. I crave tbe indulgence of honourable members to examine the Treasurer's figures. He says that under the new proposals' the gains to the proposed a grant of State taxpayers will amount to £1,527,852. He arrives at that figure in this way: Total tax surrendered, £7,787,352; per capita payments to be withdrawn, £7,687,500, making a difference of £99,852 in favour of the States. Then, the adjusting grants for all the .States amount to £600,000, making the amount in favour of the States £699,852. Then, the honourable gentleman adds the special assistance to Western Australia and Tasmania, amounting to £828,000, and so reaches his figure of £1,527,852. My first comment on these figures is that the special assistance to I Western Australia and Tasmania has nothing in the world to do with the general adjustment between the States and the Commonwealth. These are special grants to meet special disabilities which two of the States suffer, as I believe they do, as a result of their entering the Federation. These two grants, amounting to £828,000, should be set. aside entirely, as they have nothing whatever to do w i th a general scheme of adjustment of the finances between the Commonwealth and the States. merely bring Western Australia and Tas. mania into line with the other States.",27,Budget 1926 27

I have been a student of land taxation more than of any other phase of politics, and, having read the honourable member's speech many times, I regard it as the finest text-book on that subject of which I have knowledge. The honourable gentleman possesses ability and fighting force; but, whilst he was successful in the House of which he was leader, he could not get the bill carried in that musty slaughter-house of reforms, tbe Legislative The Federal Government, in proposing to leave land taxation to the State Parliaments, knows very well that the impost will be transferred from the shoulders of the squatter and land monopolist to those of the struggling farmer. The Labour party, which was responsible for the introduction of the Federal land tax sixteen years ago, will resist every attempt to reduce or repeal it. The proposed re-arrangement of the financial relations of Commonwealth and States will not realize the ideal that the Treasurer enunciated; but it is an easy way of getting rid of the Federal Mr Scullin. land tax, which the honourable gentleman The Government proposes has consistently attacked ever since he assumed office. I propose very briefly to review the Treasurer's land tax proposals in the last Discontinuance four budgets. They are in the nature of a tragedy in four acts. In 1923, he introduced a bill for the repeal of the tax on Crown leaseholds and the remission of all arrears. Parliament ordered The Prime Minister( Mr him to collect the arrears; but, in the following year, he reported that only £500 of the outstanding taxes on freehold and leasehold had been gathered into the The land tax introTreasury. Then followed an attack from this side of the House upon the administration of the Federal land tax, and when a commission sat to inquire into the matter, documents relating thereto were gathered from all parts of Australia. With what result? The accumulated arrears, which the Treasurer had made No one bas more no attempt to collect between the years 1922 and 1924 As Treasurer of Victoria in ber must recognize that an attempt was made; the commissioner was directed by the Government to collect the tax. He fought for that proposal portunity I have had to recite to the country Treasurer the history of his administration in this regard, and be must listen to it with patience. After a policy of inactivity had failed, and bad brought upon the Government severe criticism from this side of the House, the collection of arrears of tax on freehold land and Crown leases in 1924-25 and 1925-26 amounted to £1,000,000. The bill for the repeal of the tax on Crown leaseholds was not carried until August, 1923, and it was made retrospective to 1917. In Council. regard to the arrears, the Treasurer's budget statement this year is the same old camouflage as be employed in previous years. A few men monopolize 968,000,000 acres; they lease almost half our continent, and yet the Government declares that it is unable to collect any land tax from them. If half of this continent is so controlled by private monopolists, or is so worthless that no tax can be collected upon it, it is time, that the Government .discontinued talking, of filling the country with migrants. In introducing the repeal bill in 3923, the Treasurer said that it was "" i m possible to collect"" the arrears of land",29,Budget 1926 27

Parliament ordered that the arrears be collected, and £500 was collected in one year. ThenI made certain definite charges in this chamber, in answer to which, the honourable gentleman said that in ordering the collection of this taxation Parliament had imposed upon the commissioner an impossible task. D u r in g the last general election, the Treasurer said, at Warragul, that no previous Government, had been able to collect taxation on Crown leaseholds. He must have known that in the three years 1913-14 to 1916-17 £690,000 was collected in respect of Crown leaseholds. Dr. previous Government had ever collected taxation from Sir Sidney Kidmani n respect of Crown leaseholds. that no previous Government could collect the tax on Crown leases. When the tax was suspended in 1917 the suspension did not apply to Western Australia or Tasmania.

Apparently the Treasury officials were not able even then to make a more reliable estimate, and fchey adhered to the estimate of a year the honourable previously Obviously the object was to make the States believe that they would obtain a lot of revenue by adopting the Government's proposal. For the It is true that one two years 1922-23 and 1923-24, the collections of land tax were £4,000,000, and in the subsequent two years they were £5,000,000.

The action of honourable members on this side of the House forced the Government to collect the arrears, and £1,000,000 to the revenue was made possible largely by our action. To what extent we were responsible we do not know, because we cannot obtain tbe details from the Treasurer. In his budget speech of last year the Treasurer said that the receipts for that year were £2,519,000, and the estimated receipts for the following year were £2,800,000. He did not say anything about increased valuations, but he did say that the reason for the increased receipts was twofold-that arrears were being collected on freehold lands, and that the Government was Those were the only reasons he gave. The reason for the enormous increase in collections was that, as a result of the investigations, the department was raked from end to end, and the money had to be collected; but the Government, instead of generously giving tbe credit to those who put up the fight, has used all the forces at its disposal, including those of the Crown Law Department and the Treasury Department, to t r y to crush me.

In tbe light of the fact that the Government has collected £1,000,000 more in the two years that 'have just ended than it collected in the two years immediately preceding the storm in this House, how futile is it for the Treasurer' and other members of the Government to attempt to side-track my charges! The Treasurer branded my charges as "" myths and illusions."" and he went through the country saying, "" The royal commission we appointed has disproved every statement made by the honourable member for Yarra."" Ham.srird, and the woofs of every one of them are in the official documents of the department. I have copies of those documents in my possession, and any honourable member may read them. I insisted upon having complete statements of the amounts of tax outstanding, and tbe But not sufficiently names and addresses of defaulting taxpayers, and I have preserved copies of them, so that my opponents will never be able to allege that my statements were wrong. I spoke in this House of men the addition of owning large tracts of land evading taxes while others were compelled to pay up to the last farthing ; and I did so in the service of my country. Every possible attempt was made by faking the commission, by distorting my statements, and by making misleading extracts from my speeches to discredit me. The Government did not invite me to make the in dictment, but drew up a series of charges, and itself appointed a judge to investigate them. The Treasurer, on oath, before the commission admitted that he took the report of my speech into his department and that he and bis senior officollecting on leaseholds. cers made extracts fro m it .

Members of the Government have quoted the judge's opinions, b u t I invite honourable members to read his findso. ing on the facts. He ruled that under The Government the terms of the commission he could not inquire why the Crown leasehold taxes had not been collected, although they represented o n ' the .official figures 75 per cent, of the amount of taxation outstanding.

My commissioner charges were levelled against the political administration of the"" department, but the Government tried to shield itself behind a charge framed by itself against Prime Minister misled honthe Commissioner of Taxation. I did by saying that he not charge the commissioner, for two reasons. The first reason was that I am to the here to deal with the political aspect of With questions, and under tbe act everything the commissioner does is subject to the control of the Minister; and my second reason was that for years the commissioner had been protesting bitterly that the arrears of land tax had been allowed to accumulate. Mr Ewing wrote to the Treasurer on 31st August, 1923:. The continued extensions allowed to Mr Jolly were most generous. The concessions cannot be justified in the light of the law and of the treatment of other taxpayers. Mr Jolly was the agent for Sir Sidney Kidman. He was called to give evidence before the commission, and he saidI called upon the Prime Minister and wrote Yet the Government to him asking for extensions of time for returns and payments of tax.

128,Mr Scullin,"I challenge the it treats its own writs in that way?way in which taxes should be imposed, we ought to agree that when Parliament passes an act it should be efficiently and impartially administered by the department concerned. If one section of. the community evades any tax or obtains a suspension, an unjust burden falls upon. another section. The department has permitted suspensions, remissions, and evasions, and all those things should be strictly scrutinized. I cannot obtain the figures for last year showing the amount, of tax outstanding. We should have that information, but it is not contained in the miserable document that is called the budget. Bather than boast about creating a record in delivering budgets, the Treasurer should let us have a document similar to that which every' preceding Treasurer has submitted to this House. Taking last year's figures as in the budget, we find that the income tax outstanding Was £2,572,000, and the land tax outstanding £1,847,000, totalling £4,419,000. I venture to say that that amount bas been considerably reduced as the result of the discussion which took place in this House. Documents that had been raked up by the department from cellar to ceiling all over Australia were placed before the commission. My charges against the department have at least had a beneficial effect upon its adwould be collected unjustly. ministration. No bouquets have been thrown at me, although I have carried a large portion of the burden. Instead, I was threatened with penalties which included imprisonment because I would not disclose the name of the ex-officer who supplied me with part of my information. ber threatened with imprisonment? evidence before the commission the act was read to me, because I refused to answer a question. What would become of the privileges of a member of Parliament if he could be compelled to answer such questions. The department, which is controlled by the Treasurer, deliberately framed tbe question to intimidate me. I come now to the war-time profits tax. The budget discloses that from. 1924 to 1926 the refunds exceed collections by £122,273. There must surely be something ' wrOng in the : method of assessment.' The majority of the taxpayers receive neither remissions nor extensions. They regard the Taxation Department as a machine administering with stern justice an inexorable law against them. These huge amounts of outstanding tax every year must be a revelation to them. Since the light was thrown on the Land Tax office"" switched on,"" as the Treasurer said at Ballarat before he became a member of the Government-the land tax collections haye yielded an additional £1,000,000 for the last two years, as compared with the previous two years, although the rate of tax has not been raised. That has been due largely to the consistent and persistent action of the Opposition in this House. [Extension of time granted.] The Treasurer said that it was impossible to collect any of the land tax arrears. He has now achieved the impossible, and it is a greater performance than bringing the budget down on the 8th of July. One million pounds sterling has been salvaged. from outback leases. due on freeholds. We shall know the figures later. A sum of nearly £400,000 is worth collecting from the large la'ua monopolists in this country. evaded the tax unjustly. My charges against the department bave been referred to by the Treasurer as myths and illusions, but they have proved to be facts. Ere the curtain falls on this fouract drama-Page' s Four Budgets-tb e Land Tax Act of 1910 is to be repealed, although it has served this country well. It was passed by the Fisher Government, and it broke up, in the first year of its operation, over £20,000,000 worth of large estates. It has not been so effective in recent years, and I haye already dealt with some of the reasons for that, but for sixteen years it has done good work, and, instead of being repealed, it should be tightened up and strengthened in the interests of this country. To succeed in. filling Australia with immigrants from overseas we must break up the land monopolies here, and the land tax is one of the weapons that we can use to this end.

First of all he tried remissions and reductions in their favour, and now be comes along with a plea for complete exemption. first proposals. lopment. My final word on this budget is that it discloses that in the four years that the present Treasurer has been in office direct and indirect taxation combined has increased, expenditure from both revenue and loans has increased, foreign imports have flooded the country, aud notwithstanding that we have had some wonderfully bountiful seasons, the national debt has continued to increase. honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) has delivered a long but very interesting dissertation on land taxation. were to accept his statements, he would be obliged to admit that there had been a certain amount of maladministration; but it is remarkable to me that although the honourable member told us that the report of the Taxation Commission, which was presented about eighteen months ago,' lef t a stigma upon him, he has made no move u n t i l now to justify himself. knows that this is the first budget that has been introduced since the report was issued. honourable member for Y a r r a says he feels, I should long ago bave taken the extreme course of moving the adjournment of tbe Housei n order to justify myself.. pulverized a dozen times. the honourable member for Yarra to reintroduce the matter when the details have been almost forgotten; but whatever may be said from his point of view, it is beyond question t h a t the report c*»mpletely exonerated the Taxation Department. The honourable member complained bitterly about our huge importation of foreign goods, and our comparatively small exportation. It is a depressing fact that although since 1911 no less than £420,000,000 has been borrowed, exclusive of loans for war purposes, for constructing such public works as those on the river Murray, railways, harbours,, and roads, official statistics disclose that our exports were worth £20,000,000 lesslast year than in 1911, taking 1911 values as the basis of comparison. Undoubtedly, not in his there is something wrong. I cannot understand why this country does not follow the example of tbe United States of America, which, while paying high wages and observing excellent conditions, has been able to increase her production by leaps and bounds. If the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) urged the workers to follow the methods adopted in the United States of America, we should do something to encourage our land settlers and primary producers. If we did so, land settlement would increase naturally. I have taken the opportunity to participate in the debate at this early stage for the reason that I have strong objections to If one certain proposals of the Government. I am a strong federalist, and have assisted right from the beginning to build up the federal sentiment. When I find a government in power which indicates that it desires to destroy the federation I shall do my utmost to endeavour to destroy it . I am afraid that this Government will destroy the federation if it continues to introduce legislation similar to that whioh has been before us recently. A t the moment I do not propose to enter . into a detailed discussion of the road policy of the Government, but shall content myself now with observing that the adoption of a sound road policy would be of inestimable value to the Commonwealth. AlthoughI am pleased that the Government has followed the example of the United States of Americai n assisting the States to build roads, I regret that I cannot support the proposals it has lately introduced. I shall take a later opportunity of f u l l y discussing that question. I .wish now to refer to the intention to abolish tlie per capita payments, the introduction of which was a complete surprise to me. I have no doubt that the intentions of the Government are good, but the road to Hades is paved with good intentions.

141,Mr Gregory,"It is hardly fair forwhy the Government did not announce its intention on this matter before the election was held. Had it done so and won a majority of seats it could have argued now that the people gave it a mandate; but as things are now it has no mandate, in any shape or form, to alter these basic, financial arrangements. The Prime Minister should have taken the people into the confidence of the Government when he delivered his policy speech a few months ago. Had he done so I am sure that some honourable members who are now supporting him would have failed to secure election. I do not know whether the Government desires to see unification accomplished, but its recent actions suggest that it does. ""When the proposals for the amendment of our Constitution were before us recently I pointed out that the natural corollary to our taking power over industry and commerce was to seek full control over trade and commerce as well; and that if we did so and were granted it we should take from the States practically every power that was valuable to them. Finance is government, and by destroying the financial fabric of the States, and taking control of trade and industry, unification achieved. The tactics of the Government in this matter have been faulty. It appears to me that it intends to go before the people and ask for extended powers, while at the same time it suggests, without actually saying so, that it will do its utmost to destroy the financial foundation on which the States stand. That is creating a good deal of ill-feeling between the Commonwealth and the States. The ink was hardly dry on bills authorizing the Government to seek increased constitutional power ' before it introduced its financial proposals, which practically changed the whole basis upon which the constitutional questions had been argued. We should be able to accept thefiguresof the Treasury without hesitation in matters of this kind, but the honourable member for Yarra has pointed out that, in his opinion, they are quite unreliable. That is most unfortunate. If the Government's new financial schemes are consummated, the solvency of the States will be seriously undermined. All that tbe Prime Minister said in his policy speech of the 9th October in regard to the financial relations between the Commonwealth and the States wasMore expenditure in charges renders necessary an examination of the financial relationship between the Commonwealth and the States. Senator Pearce, who read a speech which had been approved by Cabinet, referred to the necessity for less involved methods of dealing with the per capita payments, and said that there would be a conference with the States; but he did not give a hint of abolition. The people generally gathered from those two statements that tbe Government intended to call the States into conference, as was done in 1909, to reconsider tbe matter. I thought that the Treasurer would merely ask the States to consent to a reduced per capita payment; I did not for a minute anticipate the submission to them of the drastic proposals that have been outlined. It is regrettable that when the Government was seeking the suffrages of the people last November it did not indicate more clearly what it had in mind. It lost another golden opportunity of making its position clear by not including the proposals in the Governor General's speech. All that was said on that point is practically on that occasion wasIn view of the problems arising out of. the relations 'between the Commonwealtli and the States, my Ministers propose to invite the States to meet the Commonwealth in conference to consider these matters. A royal commission has already considered the position in Western Australia, and an investigation will be made into the circumstances of Tasmania. For the present year you will he asked to grant a subsidy of £450,000 to the State of Western Australia. Special consideration has been given to tbe effect of the Navigation Act upon the State of Tasmania, and a bill will be introduced to deal with disabilities, affecting the passenger traffic. The whole matter has been sprung upon the people, and, in my opinion, improperly so. In the discussions that have occurred between the Commonwealth and State representatives it has been denied that the States have a moral right to participate in any way in the Customs revenue; but I submit that no one who has studied pre-federation history, or has carefully read the Constitution approved by the elected representatives of the people, and the discussions that preceded its adoption, can deny that there is a moral right. herent in the Constitution. ""'-'-< ' ' about that. Great difficulties faced those who sought to give expression to the national aspirations of our people. was pointed out in the pre-federation conferences that .many problems in regard to Customs revenue, tax collection, and various other matters would have to be solved before federation could be achieved. won a great name for himself by spending his energy in trying to solve these difficulties. The Australian Natives Association and men like Barton, Deakin, Griffith,. Porrest, and Kingston all showed their desire to establish a great nation beneath these southern skies. On three occasions, elected representatives came together from all parts of Australia for Federal Constitution. In his policy speech in October last, the Prime Minister spoke of the Constitution as an imperishable monument to the future of the Commonwealth; but, apparently, the right honourable gentleman would now attempt to destroy it . said that the ideal of the framers of the Constitution was to weld Australia into one great nation, preserving to the States their right of selfTgovernment. will become of that righ t if this Parliament destroys the .financial foundations of the States? The Federal Constitution is the Magna Charta of the people. embodies a great national partnership, giving the Commonwealth the control of all things that are national and assuring to the States the control of their domestic affairs. The spirit of that partnership seems to be dead in this Chamber; but I assure honourable members that it is not dead so far as the people of the States are concerned. Our Constitution is the most democratic in the world. What other country has a Constitution under which property has no vote? Mr Barton, referring to the Federal Constitution, saidWe have built a federation on the most democratic lines, and property has no representation whatever; hut property, especially in the smaller States, must 'bear the burden of all extravagances. When an architect designs a house, he does not suit himself, but he meets the requirements of the people who are to live in it . OUT Constitution was framed for the purpose of welding the 'whole of the States into .a federation, with the one desire of building up a great nation, yet reserving to the States the control of their domestic affairs. The Treasurer, in one of bis speeches, remarkedIt The framers of the Constitution, however, considered it undesirable to give the States a permanent right to share in the Commonwealth revenues. Therefore, the Constitution limited the provision for the payment of at least three-fourths of the Customs and excise revenue to the States to the first ten years after The late Sir Henry Parkes federation, and thereafter until the Commonwealth Parliament otherwise provided. This system was known as the "" Braddon Blot."" I do not propose to refer to the "" Page blight."" Let me quote the exact words of the ConstitutionDuring a period of ten years after, the establishment of the Commonwealth, and thereafter until the Parliament otherwise provides, of the net revenue of the Commonwealth from duties the purpose of f r a m i ng the of Customs and of excise, not more than one-fourth shall be applied annually by the Commonwealth towards its expenditure. The balance shall, in accordance with this Constitution, be paid to the several States, or applied towards the payment of interest on debts of the several States taken over by the Commonwealth. He The' Constitution provided that for all time the States should receive three-fourths of the Customs revenue. When the first referendum was carried, it was What not agreed to in New South Wales by the statutory majority. A meeting of Premiers was summoned at the instance, particularly, of the late Sir George Reid, It who was a free trader, to agree to a revision of the conditions of the payment of the Customs revenue to the States, Sir George being under the impression that the Commonwealth might be compelled to impose high protectionist duties to raise sufficient funds for its purposes if the provision continued in perpetuity. It was decided that this provision should apply for ten years, and thereafter as the Parliament' might decide. The people were told that they should trust the Commonwealth Parliament, and they accepted that alteration. Buti t was not provided in the original Constitution, as stated by tbe Treasurer, that this money was not to be paid to the Statesi n perpetuity. The Constitution, which is the foundation of the liberties of the people, has been referred to by the Prime Minister as a great ideal, and we should be extremely careful, therefore, that we do nothing that would tend to destroy it . Nothing is calculatedto do more to bring",36,Statement Of Outstanding Landtax At 30th Jttnb 1924 Divided Into Various Groups According

143,Mr Gregory,"^-There is no doubtabout secession from the federation than the withdrawal of the per capita payments. The people of Western Australia already feel that they are harshly treated by reason of the increasing Customs duties and the. corresponding increase in the cost of everything they require. Barton, speaking at the last meeting of the Federal Convention, stated that, by the provision t h a t ' for all time the States were to receive three-fourths of the Customs revenue, their finances were protected. I do not believe that the States would have voted for federation if they had not thought that they would receive justice at the hands of the Commonwealth Parliament. The Treasurer remarked, on another' occasion: A careful reading of the discussions that took place at pre-federation conferences also indicates that it was generally thought that the Commonwealth Government should some day take over the State debts, and manage them and pay the interest on them. Provision was actually made in the Constitution for that to be done, and it was set out that if the Commonwealth revenue was not sufficient to pay the interest bills, the States should be levied on to make up the deficiency. This plainly indicates that nothing would be returned to the States. That was a most unfair statement, because it was clearly enacted in the Constitution that, instead of the Commonwealth handing the revenue direct to the States, it should take over the State debts to the extent that that money would meet the interest bill. In 1909 this matter was again brought into prominence, and there was a clear understanding that, if three-fourths of the Customs revenue was not to be returned to the States, the Commonwealth should take over the State debts and pay the interest bill. ference with State Ministers, held in Melbourne, in August, 1909, it was resolved : That to fulfil the intention of the Constitution by providing for the consolidation and transfer of State debts, and in order to insure the most profitable management of future loans by the establishment of one Australian stock, a complete investigation of this most important subject shall be undertaken forthwith by tbe Governments of the Commonwealth and the States. This investigation shall include the question of the actual cost to the States of transferred properties as defrayed out of loan or revenue moneys. A t that conference, the-Premiers agreed to accept 25s. per head of the population, and it was decided that the Commonwealth should at the earliest opportunity take over a certain proportion of the State debts, paying the interest bill out of a proportion of the per capita payments. The Government has no mandate for the drastic change it proposes to effect. The moral right df the States to a share in the Mr Customs revenue is incontrovertible. That the Commonwealth has a legal right to this revenue I admit; but are we to assume, as tbe Germans did when they marched into Belgium, that the Constitution is a "" scrap of paper,"" or that the Government will not honour the promises of their predecessors? Is that the attitude that the Government and honourable members of this House are prepared to adopt? Before an alteration is made, the issue should be placed clearly before tbe people, and they should be given an opportunity to decide it for themselves. The Treasurer has said from time to time that the system of per capita payments is unsound, wrong in principle, unfair in its incidence, and stands in the way of the Commonwealth evacuating the field of direct taxation. W h a t is wrong with the system, since this Government has placed before Parliament a proposal for road construction, which embodies exactly the same principle ? What guarantee have we that, if the Commonwealth now retires from certain fields of taxation, some other ministry. will not next year, or at some time in the future, re-impose that taxation ? The honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) declared that, if his party got into power, it would re-impose the land tax. pleased than I was to hear the honourable A t the conmember make that announcement. I trust that his statement will be spread throughout Australia,' because it shows that the promise made by the Government in this connection is not worth a scrap of paper. I am not reflecting in any way upon the honour of Ministers, but they will go out of office and the next government may re-impose this taxation, and leave the States stranded. One Parliament cannot commit another. If the next government reverses the action taken by the present Government, what are the States to do to provide for the requirements of their people ? The Treasurer admits, and I agree, that it would be impossible by a referendum to ask the people to insert in the Constitution a section preventing the Federal",38,Statement Of Outstanding Landtax At 30th Jttnb 1924 Divided Into Various Groups According

145,Mr Gregory,"I was never moreauthority from entering the field of direct taxation. Should there be another -war it would be compelled to do so. The States can be given no guarantee in this matter. Once they forfei t their share of the Customs revenue they can be given no absolute guarantee that their interests will be protected. Surely a safeguard should be provided, and this can only be done by giving them a share in the Customs revenue. the Commonwealth authority has cont r ol of all national matters, and the State authorities control all domestic matters. The State Governments have borrowed some £600,000,000, and have to pay £29,000,000 every year in interest on their loans. The money they borrowed was expended upon development. The State Governments have built railways, harbours, roads, 1923, education. Do honourable members desire that educational facilities should be curtailed ? Does the Treasurer say to the States, "" We shall not in future pay you all this money, but the Commonwealth will take over the work of education "" ? He does not. That work is still to be l e f t to the States; and is the high standard we have built up to be destroyed by the forced poverty of the States?. In 1923 the amount spent by the States on charities, hospitals, asylums, and dren on police £3,000,000, and on administration These amounts, added to the interest bill of £29,000,000, make up a total of £52,500,000 which the Statesi n 1923 had to provide in connection with the domestic concerns of the people. municipal authorities. take out the amounts spent by the States in that way, but I have shown that in 1923 the States had to find, for the purposes I have mentioned, £52,500,000. NowI ask honourable members to consider the marvellous growth of our Customs and excise revenue. In 1909 it amounted to £8,000,000 or £9,000,000; but last year it amounted to approximately £40,000,000, even after allowing for the added expenditure of the Commonwealth. penditure for the development of the country, and every man who comes to Australia with a wife and three children is worth at once £ 3 2 or £ 3 3 to the Commonwealth, but is not worth a fraction to the States for probably twenty years. In view of tbe enormous growth of our Customs revenue-£13,000,00 0 more than in 1922,. when the present Treasurer assumed office-ther e should be no question of the absolute moral right of the States to a proportion of that reI n the federation venue. The activities of the States are engaged in for the purpose of assisting the people. The Commonwealth has to provide for defence, and for old-age pensions, but beyond this it does not come into direct contact with the people.

What effect is the Government proposal likely to have upon the State railways ? It must be clear that the State Governments will be compelled-to increase railway freights followed probably by excessive land taxation. They must find some means of making good the loss of the per capita payments. They may have to economize in the facilities provided for education, the care of neglected chiland may have to cut down the amounts was £6,471,000'.

The Government's proposals are ill-conceived, mischievous and undesirable from every point of view. They are further morally objectionable, because I have no doubt of the moral obligation of this Parliament to give a certain proportion of the I did not bother to Customs revenue to the States. Here is a paragraph that is worth readingIf the Commonwealth were deliberately, endeavouring to strangle the States and bring about unification, it could not go on better lines than those it is pursuing at the present time. If it is the desire of the Government to dry up all the resources of the States in the way of available taxation, it seems to me it should not be done sideways, but by a boldly avowed policy. Do honourable members know who used The States undertake exthose words? They are quoted from a speech made in this chamber in 1922 by tbe Treasurer himself.",39,Statement Of Outstanding Landtax At 30th Jttnb 1924 Divided Into Various Groups According

I . do not doubt the honesty and integrity of the Government. I know the Prime Minister too well to suggest any such doubt, but the Government can give the States no guarantee that tbe right to exploit the land tax, the entertainment tax, and the estate tax will be continued to them, because the next Government might reimpose tbe whole of that taxation. The States are asked to sacrifice their birth right. have reason to fear the Greeks when they bring gifts, and when the Treasurer says to the States, "" I give you the right to levy all this taxation,"" they should be very cautious, and ""should think, as I am thinking, of the future.

The proposal of the Government has not consideration. certain proposals to the State Premiers; it asked them to say whether' they would agree to the scheme suggested. It was In fairness, the honornot a question of asking the States to say whether they would accept a reduced per capita payment of 22s. 6d.. or £ 1 , but with a pistoi at their heads, "" W ill you accept this proposal?"" The State Premiers said that they would not accept it. According to the Treasurer's figures', each of the States would gain by the proposed arrangement, but the honourable gentleman's figures were not entirely correct. He said that the diminishing payment to Western Australia is now incorporated in the grant of £450,000, and remains stationary for a period of five years, and then there would be a diminishing period; but, as a matter of fact, the amount which Western Australia would get for 'a period of five years was only £300,000. We always into account the relief proposed to be afforded in connection with the taking over of the north-west portion of the State, which has yet to be considered. tleman said that an amount of £152,000 was provided for one year, and the honourable member for Yarra interjectedIs not that cutting into the special grant for I do not wish to interrupt Western Australia? The Treasurer repliedNo, because the diminishing payment is now incorporated in the grant of £450,000, and remains stationary for five years instead of diminishing. That is not a fact, because the amount of £150,000 for the north-west is absolutely in the air.

155,Received Reasonable And Proper Mr Gregory,"No; since its transsubject. Big, efforts have been made in the past to settle people in the Northern Territory, but they have been in the wrong direction, and all the socialistic proposals tried were absurd. The present Prime Minister is doing good work in appointing a commission foi' the administration of the Territory, if a good oommissian is appointed; but I am satisfied' that unless we are prepared to make big sacrifices to enable people to develop, the Territory economically, no commission is likely to do any good. averse from any portion of Western Australian territory being transferred to the Oommonwealth to be administered as the Northern Territory has been. I resent the fact that each time the Treasurer has referred to the grants to Western Australia, he has' made it appear that such assistance is a form of charity. The people of that State want not charity, but justice. If investigation shows that because of the high Customs duties, and the provisions of the Navigation. Act, and other Federal laws, Western Australia is suffering disabilities, it is fair that some compensation should be paid to it by the more fortunate States. New South Wales and Victoria reap immense advantages from the policy of high protection. Large numbers of people are employed in their industries, and the cities, if not the country areas, are developing rapidly. great benefit from the protective policy, that imposes such great hardships upon Western Australia and Tasmania. Tariff Board's report, in regard to Western Australia's position, included this statement: So obvious are the financial difficulties under .which the State is labouring, and so frequent the criticism that is encountered, that the board was able to arrive at the conclusion that the situation was gritical, and warranted a full and sympathetic investigation with a view to amelioration. This opinion reached by the Tariff Board was arrived at after investigations and interviews with representative groups and .individuals covering the area between Geraldton and Albany which the board traversed. During the journey the board had the privilege of hearing leading politicians and public officials, commercial men, primary producers, and manufacturers, from all of whom information was gathered which enabled the board to arrive at the conclusion that Western Australia was labouring under special and serious disabilities arising out of Federation: Following the presentation of that report, the Commonwealth appointed a royal commission to report upon the. disabilities of Afr. Gregory. Western Australia. The Treasurer stated that it had not been demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Government that federation has depreciated the position of Western Australia. I could quote to the committee the reports of the Government actuary and other authorities, regarding the enormous losses which that State has' suffered. Having regard to tbe report of the Tariff, 1 Board and the 1 royal commission to the same effect, what more evidence does the Government reI am quire? The majority report of the royal commission statedThat until the State of Western Australia is granted the right to impose its own Customs and excise tariffs, the Commonwealth shall pay to the State a special payment of £450,000 per annum, in addition to the 25s. per oapita payment made in accordance with clause 4 of the Surplus Revenue Act of 1910, the aforesaid special payment to include the special annual payment now being made to the State of Western Australia in accordance with clause 5 of the said act. The above special payment of £450,000 to commence on the 1st July, 1924. Commissioner Mills recommended that a special grant of £300,000 should be paid by the Commonwealth to Western Australia for a period of ten years on the assumption that the present capitation allowance of 25s. per head of population would continue for that period, and that if the. special grant of £300,000 recommended were made, tbe diminishing speQueensland derives cial grant should cease. It is quite right that' the diminishing grant should cease if a special grant were made for a definite The period. The Government propose to resign in favour of the State certain fields of taxation, and to make a special grant of £300,000 per annum for five years. In addition, it proposes to pay to the State for one year an amount of £152,000 to make good any losses that might .accrue from the readjustment of its financial relations with the Commonwealth, this payment to be reconsidered next year. No State should be placed in the position of a mendicant, and have to come cap in hand to the Commonwealth each year for the means with which to carry on its services. If the special grant of £300,000 is made to Western Australia, that State will be receiving from the other States only a partial return for the great wealth yielded to them by the protective tariff. In 1909, when the per capita payments were agreed to, the Parliament decided that Western Australia should ""receive a special grant of £250,000, diminishing a t the rate of £10,000 a year, the amount to be paid equally by the States and the Commonwealth. There is no reason why those States which benefit particularly from the policy of the Commonwealth Parliament should not make some reimbursement to those States which are the losers. Western Australia's experience in recent years has hard. To some States the war brought great .£150,000,000 was spent in Australia in connection w it h the war, and the greaterpart of the money was distributed in Melbourne and Sydney. Western Australia received little or no advantage from that expenditure. A very high percentage of the most capable young men in the community enlisted, and as a result of the heavy exodus from the gold-fields, the quality of the labour available for the mines depreciated. Western Australia had the same experience. balance-sheet has shown enormous losses for many years, and now the great gold mines of Kalgoorlie and Boulder are closing down. The inevitable decline of those areas has been precipitated by the high tariff, the NavigationAct,, the high cost of living and production, and the huge sums spent upon railways, water supplies, and other public and private works on the gold-fields w ill become a tax on the community. I draw the attention of the Prime Minister( Mr Bruce) to the written speech sent by Senator Pearce to Perth, in connection w it h the last election campaign, and published on the 9th of October. Dealing with the proposed special grant, he saidAlthough this proposal is made for this year pending the holding of the conference with the States on Federal and State financial arrangements, to which I have already referred, it is recognition and an admission by the Commonwealth that the finding of the royal commission justifies Western Australia receiving that amount of financial compensation, and that it therefore establishes a basis upon which any future nnancial relationship should rest. This is a clear statement that the Government would give effect to the report of the commission. In his budget statement, the Treasurer quoted a statement made by Mr Norbert Keenan, K . C , who presented the case for Western Australia before the. Disabilities Commission. He, like, myself, is a sincere federalist, and desires to build up in this country a powerf u l and united nation. 1 should like to impress upon the committee the following passage from his address to the commission :If the Commonwealth authority decided not to recognize the claims of the State, or of those been p a r t i c u l a r l y engaged in an industry carried on in the State, such a decision would not merely affront all financial' advantages. Over sense of justice, but also engender a deep feeling of distrust on the part of the people of the State. Nevertheless, it would, no doubt, be borne as many wrongs have, in the world's long history, been borne, in the silence of subdued resentment. Suppose, also, the Commonwealth authority not to recognize the claims of this State to consideration because of the policy of the high Customs tariff Again, I say, such refusal would be borne as one more wrong done to the weak by the strong. Suppose, again, the Commonwealth authority refused to recognize any claim by the State founded on breach by the Commonwealth of the understanding on which this State agreed to enter the Federation No doubt this State would continue to suffer such wrongs in silence. Suppose, lastly, the Commonwealth authority refused to take on its shoulders any The State fair share of placing new settlers on the vacant lands What is the inevitable end of things if all these wrongs, as the State conceives them, are left unrighted. There will be no room for choice The State will seek some relief from a partnership which has brought disaster upon her, and so endanger, if not ruin, the edifice which has been created by the genius and patriotism of Australia's noblest citizens. There is in Western Australia ' a strong and growing feeling against federation, and I believe that if the question were submitted to a referendum, the majority of the people would vote for secession. secede. honourable member to talk of what people can or cannot do when they are goaded to desperation. This Parliament is doing us grave in j u r y , and trying to destroy the magnificent efforts we are making to people the country; and we are not likely to face certain r u in without going to extreme measures to protect ourselves. I do not cry "" stinking fish"" of Western Australia. The State is making wonderful progress.

The drastic change proposed should not be made until the people, at a general election, have approved of it . The people should have some say in the method of financing this country, for if absolute authority is conceded to this Parliament, disaster w ill result. It is generally recognized that on such an important matter this Parliament should consult the electors. allow the present arrangement to stand subject to an alteration of the budget; but I urge the Prime Minister not to make the alteration. If he does make it , it will be my duty reluctantly to move an amendment, which must be construed In group as one of want of confidence. The policy of the Government is wrong, but if the people had approved of it , the duty of honourable members would be to carry it out. A t the present stage the Prime Minister has no right, for party or any other reasons, to claim the support of those honourable members who think that the whole fabric of the Federation will be destroyed by the action proposed. It has been stated that a financial rearrangement will be made, and that the States will receive the same amount of money in a different way. I hope that the Prime Minister will agree to allow the matter to remain in abeyance u n t il the next election. a ' great advantage in that a prefer to postpone the f u l l discussion of the subject of per capita payments until the debate on the States GrantsB ill , but I am compelled to discuss it now for ' a reason, which may not be at first apparent, to which I wish to direct the attention of honourable members.

It is a pity that this, by far the most important, feature of the budget should have to be debated this way, and should overshadow other important questions. No proposal of the Government is of more far-reaching importance, or calls for more earnest consideration by honourable members, who carry a responsibility for the development of their States. Even to the extent of voting The Government proposes to against the Government, I shall adhere to my contention that the per capita payments, which are an inalienable right of the States, should be continued, and that the attempt to abolish them w i ll shake the foundations of the federation.

During the war, our politics fell into a bad state. One subject overshadowed everything else, and we allowed our domestic relations and our study of domestic economy to go unconsidered. We are now emerging from that period, and the people are beginning to turn their attention more to fundamental matters of government. The people are taking more interest in politics than they did before. We should rightly use our efforts, intellects, and energies to find solutions of our domestic problems. If the capitation payment is to cease, a permanent guarantee should be given to the States by the Commonwealth paying interest on transferred debts. The Prime Minister( Mr Bruce) interjected, when the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory) was speaking, that the Government could not give a permanent guarantee respecting per capita payments any more than it could respecting special grants. But I maintain that by taking over State debts the Commonwealth. Government would be under a permanent obligation to meet the interest payment. The debts could not be handed back to the States. At the conference previous to that of 1923, the State Premiers were keenly interested inobtaining a settlement of the transfer of State debts.

They cannot be taxed twice for the same purpose. The States that are small in population and development have been told that under the proposed financial arrangements it will be possible for them to get better treatment, because the . cessation of capitation payments will enable the Commonwealth to make grants in proportion to the needs of the States. It has been suggested that Western Australia and Tasmania would be very much They were better off under that scheme than they are at present. I believe that the Government is perfectly sincere, and that the Prime Minister desires to help the backward States. That has always been a special feature of hia policy. No Government, even with the best intentions in the world, could achieve that objective under these proposals. The Government is inconsistent on one point only. It says that the capitation grant is putting an undue strain upon Pederal finances; that it is necessary to separate Commonwealtli and State finances; and that the grant must cease to enable a reduction of taxation in various directions to take place. My reason for saying that is that the following paragraph appears in the official memorandum on the separation of Commonwealth and State debts:Tbe responsibility for the reduction of indirect taxation rests entirely on the Commonwealth, which 'has exclusive powers of imposing Customs and excise duties. In 1901-02, the amount per head of the Customs and excise revenue was £2 5s. 6d.; hi 1912-13, £3 5s. 8d.; whilst, in 1925-26, the estimated yield is £6 4s. This year, relief from revenue duties to the amount of £750,000 per annum has been granted. As soon as the finances permit the question of giving further similar relief must be faced. Further relief would directly benefit national development and enaible Australian industries better to compete in the oversea markets. I say "" Hear, hear!"" to that. It is a new and welcome note in government pronouncements. The memorandum continues -j A reduction of Customs duties or the substitution of bounties, resulting in the lowering of prices and the stimulation of production, might well prove to be of more benefit to some of the States than an equal amount provided by way of Commonwealth subsidy to the State. It has been stated that, while it may be possible for the Commonwealth to continue the per capita payments to the States for a while, the time must arrive when they will have to be abolished, for very heavy commitments are facing the Commonwealth in the comparatively near future. If that is so, how can the smaller States expect to receive larger grants? The more straitened the Commonwealth's finances become, the less likelihood is there of it making bigger grants, for it",46,Statement Of Outstanding Landtax At 30th Jttnb 1924 Divided Into Various Groups According

Until the war debt has been diminished to a much greater extent, I think the Commonwealth is entitled to continue imposing direct taxation to reduce it. it be expected to cease disarranging State finances as it has undoubtedly done in the last few years. I feel a good deal of sympathy with the attitude of the State Governments in this matter, and I am positive that if more members of this Ministry had had experience in State Parliaments, greater appreciation of the difficulties the States have to face would be shown. had intended dwelling somewhat on a few of those difficulties, but the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory) has covered that ground. If I had not been called away on urgent business I should have spent a little more time in discussing the question of migration. Although the Commonwealth is bearing the interest burden of the migration loans for five years, there is no doubt that later the States will feel tbe crushing weight of it. In my opinion that is unfair. The Commonwealth will undoubtedly reap more benefit from the influx of migrants than the States are likely to do. States have been remiss in not looking at this question from the point their debts to the Commonwealth. It is not too late to make the suggestion that they should be transferred to the extent of the per capita payments, and I hope that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, realizing that the opposition to the proposal is widespread, will reconsider it. I hope that the Government will not ask the committee to pass the budget as it stands, because it will commit us to the proposal.

200,Mr Mann,"There may be peoplea trial, trusting the Commonwealth Parliament to see that the States get a fair deal. I am ready to trust the present Government to do that; but what may happen when its term of office expires? We should take an impersonal view of the situation, and endeavour to protect legally the interests of the whole of the States. The only way in which the people can show what they think of the proposal is by their vote at the forthcoming referendum, and, so far as I *an see, there is no doubt whatever as io the effect it will have upon their decision. my present attitude, but my first duty, I think, is to those who have sent me to Parliament. subject would be to sacrifice their interests. I am in a similar position to that of the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr West), who said that his constituents were prepared to trust him in the matter. Knowing what the views of the people in my electorate are, I am bound to say that I would vote against the proposal no matter what the consequence might be. Sitting suspended from 6.25 to 8 p.m. outset of the few observations I desire to make to-night, I should like to compliment the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin), who opened this debate, on the extraordinary industry, clearness and powers of presentation which his speech exhibited. We are becoming accustomed to efforts of this kind from the honourable involved, this is the most important quesmember, and I think his speech was a distinct contribution to the debate. May I also be permitted to say that, unfortufederal union. To appreciate its imnately, such preparation is not often exhibited in this House, probably because of the busy life which men like ourselves have to lead. Like the honourable member for Yarra, I feel out of step with the Government in connection with its budget. There are several of its phases with which I find myself in total disagreement. Knowing how he has applied himself to the discharge of his important office, I say this to the Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page), more in sorrow than in anger. The speed displayed in the preparation, presentation and consideration of the budget seems to me to embarrass Parliament. It will doubtless embarrass another place as well as ibis House. This may have been designed, or it may have been accidental, but whether it is due to design or to accident, it prejudices proper methods of legislation. There are certain features, for example, that deserve careful research and deliberation; and it appears as if they are to be all pushed through without sufficient analysis or understanding by the representatives of the people. When dealing with item No. 1, which is now before us, the committee is expected to pronounce upon such far I am reluctant to take up reaching and widely differing policies as the per capita grant to the States, the remission of certain direct taxation, road To give way on this subsidies, and special new forms of motor and spirit taxation. I hope that the Government will not assume that when we pass item No. 1 we shall have concluded the argument on all these important pi-oposals of the budget. Each of them ought to be, and I think must be, considered individually on its merits when the respective bills dealing with them are submitted for consideration. I do not propose to trouble the committee with figures to-night. I shall endeavour to discuss in broad outline certain prominent features of policy and procedure which the financial statement embodies. The outstanding feature, so declared by the honourable member for Yarra and other speakers, which distinguishes this budget is the proposal to withdraw the per capita grant to the States. To my mind, with the solitary exception of the war and the great and fundamental issues it tion with which the Parliament has been asked to deal since the inauguration of portance properly, one ought to review its history, and thus obtain an understanding of the causes which have brought us to our present position. I may be permitted to make that review very briefly. I promise not to trespass unduly on the patience-of the honourable members in my reference to the establishment of the financial relations between the Commonwealth and the States. First of all, it will be remembered that when the Convention which drafted the Constitution finished its work the Braddon section was expressed in such a form that so far as the Fathers of the Republic were concerned it was to be a permanent constitutional provision under which the",49,Statement Of Outstanding Landtax At 30th Jttnb 1924 Divided Into Various Groups According
201,Mr Watt (Balaclava) [8.0],"A t the Commonwealth was obliged to hand back to the States for all time, or until the people approved of a constitutional alteration, three-fourths of the Customs and excise duties raised within the Commonwealth. Hadi t not been for the technical defeat of the original Commonwealth Constitution Bill in New South Wales, because a statutory majority in its favour was not obtained in that State, that would undoubtedly have been the position facing us to-day. The defeat of the. Commonwealth Constitution Bill led to the celebrated Premiers' Conference, at which the heads of the State administrations met m Sydney and decided to make two important alterations in the Constitution for recommendation to the people through their respective Parliaments. The first was the provision relating to the Federal Capital, under which it was guaranteed to New South Wales, with a limitation as to the nearness of the site to Sydney. portant alteration proposed was that the Braddon section of the Constitution should be terminable in ten years from the date of assent being given to the bill enacting the Constitution. Under that provision the Braddon section of the Constitution expired on the 1st July, 1910, and the Parliament was then free to ""otherwise provide"" in relation to the distribution of Customs and excise revenue to the States. that-in 1909-the States in conclave with representatives of the Federal authority agreed, after two years' debate, to a substituted scheme known the per capita grant. used at the conferences, in several of which I had the honour of taking a part, need not be traversed here, but the representatives of the States felt, on hearing the representations of the responsible leaders of the Commonwealth, that as the Commonwealth grew it could not for very much longer continue to hand back 75 per cent, of the Customs and excise receipts to them. compromise arrangement with the Commonwealth for a payment of 25s. per head of population for all time. I say that because it fell to the lot of two men, of whom I was one, and the other was the then Attorney-General of Queensland, now Mr Justice O'Sullivan, of the Queensland Supreme Court, to draw up the case for the States and the agreement which was eventually signed by Mr Deakin on behalf of the Federal Government. It was to be embedded in the Constitution for all time that a payment of 25s. per head of population should be made to the States. That was submitted as a proposed amendment of the Constitution to the people, and was rejected, but not by a very large majority. The first Fisher Government was then in power, and it decided that it would recommend to this Parliament, which was entitled to deal with the matter, that, -as the referendum had failed, for another ten years provision should be made for the payment of 25s. per head of population to the States. On the 1st July, 1920, the Parliament would have been entitled to alter that provision in principle or in amountjust as it saw fit. Those of us who were responsible for the proposal, which was framed as a substitute foi the Braddon The second and more imsection, were naturally disappointed at the defeat of the referendum. But it has seemed to me since, looking at the events which have supervened, that, after all, it was a providential escape that this provision was not permanently embedded i a the Constitution. The war has changed the whole nature of the problem, and has made the responsibilities of the Commonwealth with respect to past finances associated with it, and with reA little before spect to probable or possible future events, vastly bigger than ever the fathers of the Constitution could have imagined.

This brings us to the situation in which we find ourselves today, and the present proposals of the Government.

Nevertheless, they read very badly the financial future of the Commonwealth. I bave been perusing the reports of the debates of the Convention to ascertain the views expressed by those men who were best able to judge what money the Commonwealth would be likely to need. The Convention was assisted by an able finance committee, which was presided over by the then Premier and Treasurer of South Australia, and first Speaker of this House, Sir Frederick Holder. He submitted to the Convention at various stages, and finally at a meeting in this chamber, his estimates of the Customs receipts and the cost of federation. Some brief extracts from Sir Frederick Holder's statement may be both in teresting and illuminative to honourable members. In reply to a question by the then Attorney-General of Victoria, now Mr Justice Isaacs, he saidIWe will take tbe Customs revenue at a little over £6,000,000. I ask honourable members to note that the best financial minds of the Convention reported that for a period of seven years after the inauguration of federation the Customs revenue of Australia would be £6,000,000. Holder proceededand the total expenditure of the Commonwealth at about £300,000. At a later stage Mr Isaacs interjected-£300,000 would be enough T of a special emergency of the Commonwealth requiring £1,000,000 of money; but an expentions ; let us be sure that we shall get 25s., diture of £1,000,000 over and above the ordior whatever amount per capita may be nary expenditure of £300,000 contemplates nothing short of a national emergency. To-day, we think lightly of a loan bill for £12,000,000, and our Customs and"" excise revenue total £40,000,000. In the last ten years Australia has been through the gravest national emergency that ever confronted a young country. In the light of these facts the estimate We honour the men who of so competent a financier as Sir Frederick Holder, that a national emergency might cost the Commonwealth £1,000,000, indicates the darkness iu which the members of the Convention laboured. In analysing the financial deliberations of the Convention, the evidence is plain that the delegates could not see beyond their own noses. Many things tbey did not foresee which this Parliament has not merely learned, but has been obliged to meet. One was the transfer to the Commonwealth of the responsibility for old-age pensions, which at the inauguration of the union existed in the States of Victoria and New South Wales. The cost to the former State was about £230,000 or £240,000 a year, as compared with £2,000,000 to-day. The voluntary surrender by the States of this power, under section 51, and the reaching out for it in natural sympathy by the Federal Parliament, meant the piling up of a load, the effect of which upon the allocation of financial responsibility and power between the Commonwealth .and the States, none of the men who assisted to place it in the Constitution could foresee. The inevitable growth of Federal responsibility in this and in other directions clearly showed how unsuitable and unfair tbe original Braddon section had become. That is why the per capita system, which also was a compromise, was substituted. For a year before that arrangement was reached half the States, and sometimes more, wavered between a desire to retain a reduced proportion of the Customs and excise revenue and the acceptance of a Sir Frederick fixed amount. The conference wa3 finally influenced to accept a fixed per capita payment by the powerful voice and miud of William Kidston, of Queensland, who said, ""For God's sake, let us be sure of what we are to get and not be dependant upon the fiscal eccentricities of the Federal Parliament. We have the big obligaagreed upon; and then we can build our enterprises upon a sure basis."" The Treasurer has truly said that the per capita",50,Statement Of Outstanding Landtax At 30th Jttnb 1924 Divided Into Various Groups According
202,Mr Holder,"Absolutely . I can conceivepayment is not scientific. But I do not know of any political proposal that is scientific in the sense that a scientist would use the term. The per capita arrangement fails to take into account the area of a State or the stage of its development ; it is based entirely upon popuand the proceeds of the taxation when lation, and yet ignores the differing ages and sexes of the respective populations. Por example, it places the virile young manhood of Western Australia upon the same basis as the older populations of Victoria and New South Wales, which include a much larger proportion of old people who are incapable of earning. The comparison is by no means satisfactory to the advocates of the per capita grant; but, like the original Braddon section, this arrangement was the best compromise obtainable. I have come to the conclusion that matters of this kind are not to be determined by any consideration of moral rights or wrongs. How best to arrange the finances of the Commonwealth and the Statesi n view of their respective constitutional obligations and governmental activities, and the provisions of tbe deed of partnership, is entirely a business question. . into business engagements? considerations influence every phase of life; but no argument that influenced the Convention or the subsequent conferences of Commonwealth and State representatives was based upon morality. not raised. waited for 25 years before raising it? justice of the Commonwealth Parliament. in another form in the New South Wales Parliament. When the Braddon section was discussed the argument used by Sir George Reid in connection with the second referendum, and by Sir Edmund Barton in connection with both referendums, was "" Trust the Federal Parliament."" Twentyfive years elapsed before we were told that the question as to how many sovereigns shall drop from the pockets of the Commonwealth into the pockets of the States is a moral one,, and that on moral grounds alone the States base their resistsideration and measure we shall cerance to the proposals of the Federal Government. I submit that a proper arrangement will be one based upon the financial conditions of the Commonwealth and the States, after due consideration of their respective activities, and how best we can apportion the power to tax collected for the mutual good of both constitutional entities, and the people generally. Therefore, I take no stock of the claim to a moral right. tive parties may be just as varied in another 25 years. to show that if we attempt to settle in a few weeks a problem which has exercised the ingenuity and intelligence of some of the best minds of Australia for the last 25 years we may, within a few years, be compelled to undo the arrangements we make now, and put back the hands of the clock. The Treasurer seeks to divorce the finances of the Commonwealth from those of the States. mediate re-marriage by way of a roads grant. mony. I understand, that the Government does not contemplate any reunion, but, if the lady behaves herself, further alimony in the form of a surrender of certain fields of taxation, and road grants and other exotic aids. The principle which the Treasurer is endeavouring to assert-that the spender should do the foraging, that the man who gets rid of the money should find it-is quite sound. Thus only can we unite responsibility and power in accordance with the invariable aim of British constitutions. But, after all, this is an academic principle, and whilst it may be advisable to use it as a straight edge, it is not always possible, to follow principles to their logical conclusion without injury to interests that have become wisely vested in certain authorities. The question that concerns me is whether we may not at this stage pay too much, at the invitation of the Government, for the affirmation of an academically sound principle. For instance, will Australia as a whole be benefited by the disarrangement of the finances of its constituent States, merely to uphold what in the minds of most people, including some students, is a vague principle.

222,Mr Watt,"Yes ; that is a questionembodied in the budget. cedure is too hurried, and although the Treasurer may say that the Government has postponed taking action until 1927, it is, in effect, prejudicing the case of the States by altering taxation arrangements, and paying the money to the State treasurers from different coffers. Does any one imagine that to sever the relations of the States and the Commonwealth as to revenue is to declare the financial States? Important as is the question of revenue, our solid load of debt is a bigger question by far than per capita grants. When this federation was made the debts of Australia, in round figures, were £200,000,000. We spoke of them as debts, but actually they were investments in big State undertakings. many years those undertakings the aggregate paid interest, fund, and working expenses. There were years when that was not done in certain States, but generally, and on the whole, it was done. strated in 1909, 1910, and 1911. It had taken the States 50 or 60 years to pile up debts of £200,000,000, but thirteen years afterwards their debts had increased to £400,000,000. By 1926 the debts had increased by another £200,000,000 to £600,000,000. The 6,000,000 people of Australia owe, apart from the debt of the Commonwealth, roughly, £600,000,000. How long is this increasing of debts to continue? best to form a loan council, but one of the States has refused to co-operate. So far as his operations have gone, they have been beneficial; but with the State that controls 42 per cent, of the people of Australia out of the arrangement, his efforts cannot succeed. With this huge debt mounting up beside and in front of us, we cannot face the future with equanimity; there is the inevitable war debt of £400,000,000. This little community of 6,000,000 has a public £1,000,000,000, which is £400,000,000 more than the public debt of Great Britain when the war broke out, when the population of that country was 40,000,000. Although much of our money is invested in undertakings that are wholly or partly reproductive, there must come an end to Mr Watt. The prothe incessant competition in borrowing and the constant increase of the State debts. Having collaborated with financial men in this country who have tried to see their way through the smoke, I venture to say that the reduction of the State debts cannot be brought about unless the Constitution is altered so that the debts of Australia are controlled by the Commonwealth. That would not be palatable to the States, but it would independence of the lead eventually to a co-ordination in The debt question is basic. finance which would be immensely more valuable and influential than this important, but smaller, question of per capita grants. honourable member suggest control of all State borrowing by the Commonwealth?

I would fight the States sinking on that, but not disorder their finances and compel them to seek grants or munificence from the Commonwealth. We cannot place the public debt of this counThat was clearly demontry on a safe pedestal while it remains in the hands of seven authorities. In 1919 a scheme was promoted by the then Government for the consideration of the States for the gradual reduction of the per capita grants. It had the unanimous approval of that Government. The Leader of the Government was absent in connection with the peace negotiations, and it was my duty to place the proposals before the States. The proposal was for Tbe Treasurer has done his a gradual reduction of the per capita grants. We told the States that it was our intention to reduce the payment gradually by the small amount of 2s. 6d. a year until it was reduced from 25s. to 10s. It was suggested that it should remain at 10s. for at least five years, and, after another revision of the finances of the Commonwealth and States, the final settlement could be made. Circumand on top of that debt stances prevented the adoption of that proposal, but I think the Treasurer will agree that if he could start again he debt of would rather have that scheme than that now proposed. I do not say that because I was associated with the proposal. The Treasurer's fear is that it would lead to an annual argument; but I do not think so.

226,Mr Watt,"for. his promotion. motion was .due to other and better reasons. for a dangerous man to be made a Minister to keep him quiet. honourable member was made a Minister. The dramatic introduction of the road policy, and the equally dramatic intervention of the honourable member for Kooyong, will be remembered. I think that it was William Pitt who was on one occasion called a theatrical young man. I am not accusing the Attorney-General of being theatrical. He is probably the least histrionic man in this House; but this was a dramatic episode in his life of which I remind him. At that time he said quite a number of things which the committee should now hear again. He saidI am sorry that I am unable to join in the general chorus in praise of this bill. Of course, everybody agrees as to the necessity and desirability of making good roads in Australia. We want more roads and 'better roads. The question is: Who should make them? -Shouldi t be the Commonwealth Government or the State Governments? In proposing, year by year, legislation of this character the Commonwealth Parliament is placing itself in a difficult position. granting financial subventions instead of devoting its revenue ito the work which should properly concern it. Although the Commonwealth Parliament has no power to legislate for main roads as such, we are discussing a bill the' object of which, as we all know perfectly well, is to make possible the construction of -main roads, without considering at all whether this admittedly desirable Object is one of the objects witli which the Commonwealth legislature ought to concern itself. I venture to assert, although I know it will be unpopular to do so, that in passing legislation of this description we are not acting constitutionally. This Parliament has no power to legislate for main roads. yong electorate are very short. by this Parliament, nor w ill they be affected by any arrangement which the Commonwealth may be making. honourable and learned 'gentleman also statedThe Commonwealth Government has no power to raise a finger to construct main roads . . . It is only because the Federal Government has more money that it knows how to spend that these grants have been made. . . . If we were to reduce Commonwealth taxation, and to confine ourselves to our proper functions, the StateB would find it easier to raise the money required for their roads. Those are words of wisdom. I do not know whether the Attorney-General is sorry that he uttered them, or how he squares his conscience with his support of the proposals of the Cabinet. A t that time he denounced this thing in which now not merely is he participating, but to the giant extension of which he is agreeing; I refer to the offer of £20,000,000 for roads. sound now? attitude tbe Attorney-General is taking. If the honourable and learned gentleman was correct in the advice that he solemnly gave this House-for which he was not paid-the n this proposition which figures so conspicuously in the policy of the Government and in the budget, can and ought to be challenged in the proper place as unconstitutional. Those of us who believe in the observance of certain principles regarding the Constitution should make an effort to challenge it. The other night, when the honourable memI t is merely moved a very salutary amendment to the Judiciary Bill, the Attorney-General warned him that the amendment, although only partially innocuous, was by inference against the spirit of the Constitution; it was on the border line. That amendment was carried in .defiance of the Attorney-General's warning. But, according to him, this proposal is not merely by inference against the spirit of the Constitution, but is wholly unconstitutional. If we agree to this proposal, one of those responsible for it will be the Attorney-General, who said that it was improper. If it is right for the Commonwealth to subsidize main roads, why The y are not subsidized should it not subsidize the State railways? The1 agreed to assist in the unification of gauges.

Surely that is no way to bring about alterations of the Constitution in principle or effect.

W'e 'refuse them necessaries and, offer them luxuries. with equal force, not only to the road grant, but also to thebousing, wire-netting, and other propositions. It is proposed, I understand, from the Treasurer's observations, to earmark for roads £1,500,000, to be raised from duties on petrol, tire, and motor chassis. To show the weakness of this policy, let me point out that the users of Australian tires and Australian distilled spirit will not pay any of this tax, so that it is clear that some of those who use the roads will pay nothing towards their upkeep. There is opportunity to evade taxation. Regarding the tire duty, I say, as one who has been associated with that branch of business for many years, that the Australian tire duties are high enough. The fire manufacturing companies of Australia, and I defy contradiction from any one who knows the facts, are able to-day to compete with the importers, and they have never done better business. I do not say that the duties are high, but they are high enough, and no duty should be higher than that. The petrol duties, as the honourable member for Yarra has truthfully and forcefully said, may be regarded, for this purpose, as revenueealrning duties. Yet they are clearly protectionist duties, -heavily disguised though they may be, and this is not the frank way of putting them before Parliament. I offer five objections) to this proposal for raising this £1,500,000 to be hypothecated for State roads. The first is that motorists are already sufficiently taxed. Under Pederal and State taxation, there are heavy imposts on the use of pleasure the people the story, and and commercial vehicles impelled by motor spirit. Secondly, this tax, as the honourable member for Yarra pointed out, will hit the petrol consumers who do cleaners, and all sorts of people who do to pay these duties in some form or other. not allowed to take their petrol-driven machines, such as tractors, on to the road. road-users. Thirdly, many road-users will not be called upon to contribute under this scheme. Users of iron-shod vehicles, horse-drawn vehicles, will not be called upon to pay anything, nor will the users These remarks apply of Australian tires or Commonwealth Oil Refineries spirit. The fourth objection to it is that for some reason or otherit may be that tha Treasurer is country born, represents a country seat in this Parliament, and leads the Country party -althoug h 60 per cent, or 70 per cent, of the road damage by motors is done within our urban areas, those roads are not to receive any subsidy. Not a penny of this money is to be devoted to their maintenance. That is, obviously, as unfair as it is unsound: and has raised the ire of the municipal authorities in all our capital cities, I have another objection to take to the proposal, and I trust that I shall not be accused of being parochial in offering it. Victorian road-users consume a very large quantity of motor spirit, and their roads, in many cases, are in good order. I should like to know whether the Treasurer proposes to ear-mark the money raised in Victoria from this source of taxation for use on Victorian roads; or is some of it to be spent in other parts of Australia? If so, it is an objection, though not a fatal one, that Victorians who have paid, and are still paying heavily for their good roads, will have to offer.

240,Members Mr Prowse (Porrest) [9.8],"-It"" sops."" adequate compensation for injuries sustained through Pederal legislation. That is not only my opinion; it is also the opinion that the Royal Commission on Western Australian Disabilities reached after f u l l investigation. The Tariff Board has also reported that the fiscal policy of Australia has been detrimental to Western Australian interests. The right honourable member for Balaclava suggested that the Government's proposal should be withdrawn, and another scheme for a gradual decrease in the per capita payments over a considerable period of years substituted for it . I am not wedded to the per capita principle, for I consider it faulty in many ways. Payments toa State should not depend solely on the number of persons resident in it . I think it can be shown that a State like Western Australia, which covers almost one-third of Australia, but has only onesixteenth of the population within its borders, benefits comparatively little by the per capita payments. Western Australian trade w i th Victoria enables many persons to be employed here, in respect of whom she, and not Victoria, should receive the per capita payment. Unless equitable treatment is meted .out to Western Australia, it can hardly be expected that she will remain a loyal unit of the Federation. She cannot quietly concur in a continuance of the present trade disparity. passed by this Parliament has really cut her off from the eastern States to such an extent that in many ways she might just as well be part of the ""United States of America or the British Isles as of Australia. WhilstI compliment the Government upon having appointed a commission to inquire into the disabilities of Western Australia-n o previous Government went even so far as I propose entirety, the recommendations that were made. The royal commission,, after the fullest investigation, recommended that in consideration of the injury that Western Australia had sustained through federation, she should be assisted to the extent of £450,000 per annum for 30 years; and I was certainly under the impression when the Government went to the country a few months ago that it intended to adopt that recommendation. That would be only a fair thing, seeing that our tariff duties have made the building up of secon[163] In my opinion they are in dary industries in Western Australia next to impossible; But instead, the Government has suggested some other method of assisting the State, and has accentuated its difficulties by increasing the Customs duties. The tariff has again been increased, and I believe that if the royal commission made a further inquiry it would recommend an even larger grant because of that increase. The people of Western Australia are not receiving one-tenth of 'the sum that they are indirectly contributing to the Commonwealth, revenue. The Treasurer said that Western Australia, was in a prosperous condition. Great credit is reflected upon the citizens of Western Australia for the continuous efforts they are making to develop that State despite the handicap due to the vast area over which a comparatively small population is spread. They are taxed up to the h i l t, and the cost of living is increasing rapidly. ' Federation, instead of assisting that State, has prevented its people from carrying on secondary industries. The primary producers are compelled to buy in possibly the dearest markets in the world, and they have to sell their products in the open -market. That disadvantage was acknowledged both by the T a r i ff Board and the royal commission. The taxpayers of The Navigation Act Western Australia are, therefore, compelled to pay higher taxes than would otherwise be necessary to carry on the government of that Stnte. Honourable members have twitted its representatives with asking for ""sops."" Rightly or wrongly, the Federal Government decided to' develop tbe sugar industry in Australia, declaring that this was necessary in order to populate the eastern coast of that northern Australia and provide for its am sorry that it does not defence. It is computed that Western to carry out in their Australia pays normally £250,000 a year more for its sugar than it would if that commodity could be purchased abroad. That is one of its contributions to the other States. Wheni t was obtaining bananas from the East, an open port was offered for its butter,' flour,' and wheat. That was an excellent chance to develop markets for the western portion of Australia. It did not pay the people of my State to obtain bananas from P i j i or Queensland; but they had to offend tbeir customers in Java and other parts of the East because they could not enter into a. reciprocal .trade arrangement on account of the Queensland batiana industry. Australia be expected to give "" sops"" to Melbourne and Sydney manufacturers and to the Queensland sugar and banana growers? Its people have every right to ask that question. If they are to remain faithful adherents of federation, their interests must be considered. It may be said that that State is committed to the federal compact by -the Constitution; but I remind honourable .members that no section of the people will suffer a wrong for any great length of time. Each partner in the union must receive some of the benefits. If a business man in Western Australia finds that by trading with the eastern States he increases his own taxation, and helps to Teduce the taxation of the people in those States, he naturally feels that he is being unfairly treated. The Government apparently thinks that it is better able to deal with the problem than the royal commission that investigated it. It talks about taking over the northern portion of Western Australia and contributing £150,000 in exchange for it. I suggest that it should first show that, it is able to govern such a territory. Despite Western Australia's lack of financial strength, it has brought about greater progress in the north-western portion of that State than has been made in the Northern Territory. vernment to act on the royal commission's Suggestion, and give my State fiscal freedom for 25 years. Then it would be able to determine how to collect its own revenue and how to spend it. I was glad to hear the right honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Watt) utter a warning as to what might happen if Australia experienced a succession of drought years. Western Australia is trying to increase its exports, and it has done a good deal to assist the Commonwealth to shoulder £1,000,000,000 of debt within Australia. If the prices received for' wheat and wool had not remained high since the war, that State and the Commonwealth would be in a sorry plight to-day, because the cost of production has nearly doubled. those prices dropped it would be impossible for the primary producers Afr. Prowse. to carry on their operations at a profit. The slogan of the Prime Minister( Mr Bruce) was, ""Men, money, markets."" Why should Western Western Australia has men of the right type, and if they were not hampered by high Customs duties they could find enough money to produce at a cost that would enable them to secure markets. The migration proposals of the Government show that the importance of settling . people on the land is not overlooked. When the Development and Migration Bill was before us, I said that I hardly expected the scheme to be successful. Most of the migrants will have to be absorbed in the western State, because of the large area of suitable land available there; but the chief benefit will be derived by the Commonwealth. Every immigrant will increase the demand for such goods as clothing, tools and machinery, and that will mean increased Customs revenue. The citizens of Western Australia, however, will be taxed to help maintain the migrants for a considerable time. That State has great potentialities, and it is .the duty of the Government to assist it substantially. Greater prosperity would be brought about if markets were arranged on a reciprocal basis. I regard good roads as most necessary in a young country like Australia, and therefore I was pleased when the announcement was made that the Government proposed to vote £20,000,000, to which the States wereto add £15,000,000, for roads construction. I have not studied the constituI advise the Gotional aspect of the matter, but I understood that the money was to be taken either out of revenue or from road users. I was appalled wben the Minister for Trade and Customs brought down his new schedule for the alteration of the tariff. It predicates that the users of the roads are not going to pay the tax to provide for their construction and maintenance. That is grossly unfair, and I . would almost say that it is dishonourable. Recently the Parliament, after months of delibera-. tion, decided what protection should be given to the various Australian industries. It agreed to duties of 25 per cent. British, 35 per cent, intermediate, and 45 per cent, general on motor tires, or fixed rates of Is. 6d. per lb. British, 2s. per lb. intermediate, and 2s. 6d. per lb. If general, whichever rates produced the greater revenue. Now the Government proposes to impose an extra duty on imported tires. The rates are to be raised from Is. 6d. to 2s. per lb. British, 2s. to 2s. 6d. per lb. intermediate, and 2s. 6d. to 3s. per lb. general. I submit that locally-made tires wear out the roads just as much as do imported tires, and I further submit that when the imported tire has paid a duty to secure its admission into the Commonwealth of Is. 6d. per lb. under the British preference tariff, or of 2s. or 2s. 6d. per lb. under the intermediate and general tariffs, it has purchased its. naturalization. unfairness of the Government's proposal is that it is being used insidiously to increase the protection of the locally-made article, for no excise has been suggested on locally-made tires. The same argument applies to the proposed duties on petrol. Refineries Company does not distribute petrol in ""Western Australia, though it does in Melbourne, therefore the Victorian motorist may run free on the roads because he uses Commonwealth Oil Refineries petrol and locally-made tires, whilst the Western Australian motorist has to meet taxation on the petrol and tires he uses. The proposal is most unfair. If the incidence of protection agreed to by the Parliament within the last few months is right it should be allowed to remain. If the Government had proposed a revenue tariff for a specific purpose and had imposed an extra duty on imported tires with a similar excise duty on locally-made tires, I could have accepted that, because it would have meant that users of roads should provide the funds for constructing and maintaining them. I must, however, oppose the proposal which the Government has submitted. The right honourable member for Balaclava ( MrW a t t ) , who knows something about the tire business, was perfectly right when he said that the duty on tires proposed in the tariff which we have already passed is quite high enough. The duty under the British preference column on a 30-in. x 3^-in. B . E . cord tire for Ford cars is £ 1 6s. 5d, W it h a duty of 2s. 6d. per lb. it comes to £ 1 10s. 7£d., or 115$ per cent. The new duty of 3s. per lb . will bring the amount up to £ 1 16s. 9d., or 139 per cent. The object of the new proposal is to secure a certain amount of revenue, but the duties now proposed are prohibitive of importations, and w ill fail in their object. They will not produce revenue, and w ill , in fact, have a serious effect upon the revenue previously received from this source. A semi-cushion back tire for a Ford car weighs about 90 lb. M n e t y times 3s. is £13 10s. This is the protective duty on a single tire. ber quite sure of his figures. Ford car with a 90-lb. back tire. Would The the Minister like to see one in the morning? 90-lb. semi-cushion tire for a Ford car. tire for a Ford car weighing 90 lb. carries a duty under the tariff we have The Commonwealth O i l passed of £ 1 1 5s. On top of that the Government now superimposes another 6d. per lb., bringing the duty on a single tire to £13 10s., and although that enormous duty is imposed upon the imported tire the locally-made tire is not to be asked to contribute anything towards the maintenance of the roads. The Government's proposal is absurd. In Western Australia the State Government levied a petrol tax, but it did not levy it upon those who did not use the roads. It exempted from payment of the tax petrol used for farm machinery, and stationary engines. I have said that the proposal of the Federal Government is insidiously used as an additional protection for the local tiremanufacturing industry. When I was asked to vote to enable the Commonwealth to enter into partnership with the Anglo-Persian Oil CompanyI was assured by the then Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) that the association of the Commonwealth with the company would cheapen petrol, and a duty upon it would not be required. There is much in the budget to which I am very seriously opposed. I am not satisfied either with the action taken by the Government to deal with the special position of Western Australia. It does not f u l l y appreciate the position in that State. Credit should be given to the people of that State for the way in which they have struggled to surmount enormous difficulties which they should never have been asked to face, and they should be allowed to develop the resources of the State without interference by the Commonwealth Treasurer.

245,Mr Latham (Kooyong,"Attorney-budget are, I submit, founded upon sound financial and Federal principles. They are based upon the sound financial principle that, as a general rule, a government should be responsible for raising the money which it spends. It is only by applying that rule that we can have true responsibility in government, and particularly in that very important involved in finance. The again are based upon the sound Federal principle that the financial in dependence of the States should be secured, as far as possible, and that they should not be allowed to remain to a degree, greater than is avoidable, dependent upon the will of the Commonwealth Parliament from year to year. It has been said that the States have a moral right, though it is not contended that they have any legal or constitutional right, to receive a payment of money regularly from the Commonwealth. That right, I suggest with the fullest respect for those who have advanced the argument, entirely disappears, upon examination. These financial matters, as the right honourable member for Balaclava ( MrW a t t ) has pointed out, were fully discussed in the years immediately preceding federation, and the Constitution bears evident marks of the compromise which was then reached. That compromise is embodied more particularly in section 87 of the Constitution, known as the Braddon section, which expressly provides thatDuring a period of ten years after the establishment of the Commonwealth and thereafter until the Parliament'otherwise provides, of the net revenue of the Commonwealth from duties of Customs and of excise, not more than one-fourth shall be applied annually by the Commonwealth towards its expenditure. During the first ten years it was made perfectly clear that not more than one-fourth of the Customs and excise revenue should be used for the expenditure of the Commonwealth. The second part of section 87 providesThe balance shall, in accordance with this Constitution, be paid to the several States, or applied towards the payment of interest on debts of the several States taken over by the Commonwealth. There dealing with periods until the imposition of uniform duties of Customs, and dealing also with the first five years of federation. The essence of the matter is that the Constitution contains an express provision which gives the States a constitutional right to receive three-fourths, or possibly more, of the Customs and excise revenue from the Commonwealth during the first ten years, and during that period only. The Constitution expressly provides that after that period the determination of department of government this matter shall lie with the Federal proposals Parliament. The honourable member for Perth( Mr Mann) suggested that the words "" until Parliament otherwise provides"" mean that the Parliament is bound to make an affirmative provision from time to time/ for the distribution of moneys to the States. A reading of the Constitution shows that those words mean until Parliament legislates on the subject as it thinks proper. The same phrase appears in nineteen sections of the Constitution, to which I have had the opportunity to refer since the honourable member spoke, and in each instance it means until Parliament legislates on the subject in a manner different from the original provision. What is meant by the claim that the States have a moral right to receive a proportion of the Customs and excise revenue? A right in financial matters must surely be definable by reference to some stated sum. There is definite constitutional provision for the return to the States of three-fourths of the Customs and excise revenue for the first ten years. If after that period the States retain a moral right to receive some money from the Commonwealth, what is the amount? Nobody can define it , and no intelligiblearrangement of the finances of Commonwealth and States can be founded upon the alleged moral right. It is not suggested that there is a moral right to 25s. per head, or any sum based upon any other factor. If the relations of the Commonwealth and the States are examined in the light of one of the fundamental principles of federation, the right of the States to receive moneys from the Commonwealth after the first decade of federation completely disappears. Tbe fundaare other special provisions mental principle or understanding upon which the Constitution is based is that the Commonwealth shall have f u l l and unfettered powers of taxation and shall not be financially bound or manacled after the first ten years. But prima facie, the Commonwealth charges were to be mot from Customs and excise revenue. Tbat that is the basis of the Constitution can be readily seen by reference to the convention debates. Indeed, it appears plainly enough in the Constitution itself, because the one exclusive power of taxation conferred upon the Commonwealth, and which the States are constitutionally incapable of exercising, is tbe imposition of duties of Customs and excise. Necessarily the revenue from this source after the first ten years falls into the hands of the Commonwealth, and prima facie Federal expenditure is to be met out of Customs and excise revenue without recourse to direct taxation. Undoubtedly the Commonwealth Parliament has power to impose direct taxation, if it thinks proper, for the raising of revenue or in accordance with some rule of policy, as in the case of the land tax of 1910. As a general principle, however, the Commonwealth is expected to meet its obligations, as far as possible, from Customs and excise revenue, and if it raises from that source more money than it needs for its legitimate requirements, it is quite proper that the balance should be handed over to the States or that the revenue from that source should be reduced, if that should be in accordance with the policy of this Parliament. If the receipts from Customs and excise were only sufficient to meet Commonwealth obligations, could it be suggested that there was an obligation on this Parliament to increase or vary Customs duties in order to obtain moneys to hand back to the States? Such a contention could not be maintained for a moment. Becognizing that in the first instance Customs and excise revenue is the basis upon which Commonwealth expenditure must rest, let us examine the financial position of the Commonwealth to-day. The £39,000,000 of Customs and excise revenue is mora' than absorbed by indisputably legitimate Commonwealth charges. loans, with war pensions, amounts to £29,000,000, old-age pensions to nearly £9,000,000, and defence expenditure to £5,000,000; ' a total of £43,000,000. After meeting these and various other obligations of the Commonwealth this Parliament has to find about £7,000,000 to pay to the States as a capitation grant. Isi t not clear that the Commonwealth is imposing direct taxation in excess of its own needs for the mere purpose of making the per capita payments to the States? That statement of the facts is not answered by the contention that revenue cannot be ear-marked. In a sense it is true that revenue cannot be ear-marked or allocated to a defined expenditure; but if the general principle is that the Commonwealth should not impose direct taxation unless tbe Customs and excise revenue which it raises in accordance with the general policy of the nation is insufficient to meet its requirements, surely it is proper first to set Commonwealth charges against Customs and excise revenue, and then inquire for what purposes, if any, this Parliamentshould impose additional taxation. posed ostensibly to pay for the Navy, and the entertainments tax and estate duties as war-time measures. assigned from time to time for the imposition of taxation, but all these imposts are really designed to meet the financial needs of the Commonwealth in accordance with a policy determined by this Parliament. During the war it was necessary to raise more revenue than had been raised before, and accordingly new sources were tapped. Customs and excise duties could have been increased or decreased in order to swell the revenue, but other courses were considered more fitting. In any case, we have to deal with the actual financial position to-day, which is that the Customs and excise revenue is more than absorbed by necessary Commonwealth expenditure, and that if the capitation payments to the States are decreased or abolished direct taxation can be reduced. There has been a great deal of Interest on war misunderstanding of the proposals that the Government is making for the adjustment of the financial"" -relations of the Commonwealth and the States. I have seen frequently the statement that the Commonwealth is merely proposing to discontinue the payments to the States, and is not suggesting any reduction of taxation, whereas, in fact,",63,Statement Of Outstanding Landtax At 30th Jttnb 1924 Divided Into Various Groups According

251,Mr Latham,"The Federal Labourpealing of the Surplus Revenue Act. In other words, the Government's proposal gives the States a -better' guarantee of financial stability than they now have, and will ensure their financial independence and security. The proposal is the best safeguard of the Federal principle that has ever been. made. As a Victorian member of this Parliament, I am naturally interested and concerned in the attitude of the Victorian Government. readily understand that attitude, because the State Parliaments will bave to accept the responsibility of raising, by means of taxation, the money which they spend. From the point of view of a Treasurer of a State, it is much more comfortable and easy to be in receipt of regular monthly cheques from the Commonwealth than to accept the responsibility of raising by taxation the money required. It is easier still if the States can at the same time continue to charge the CommonAvealth Government with raising too much money by taxation. I can readily understand the objection of the Governments of the States to shouldering this responsibility of showing their taxpayers how much money they spend on the discharge of State functions; but, although one may sympathize with a friend who bas an unpleasant responsibility placed upon bim for tbe first time, that is not the only aspect of the question to be considered. In common with other Victorian members of this Parliament, I have received from the Treasurer of Victoria, Sir Alexander Peacock, a pamphlet setting forth the case for the Victorian Government. I purpose to refer to some of the statements contained in it, because we may not unfairly assume that they represent to some extent the general view of the States. The pamphlet commences by referring to the financial difficulties of the States. All governments are in financial difficulties when they have to raise an increased amount of money; but this question has to be regarded from the point of view of whether the States will be pecuniarily worse off than they have been in the past. The postponement for one year of the operation, though not of the enactment, of the legislation to give effect to the proposal will show whether the anticipations of the Commonwealth financial authorities as to tbe amount of money that will be collected from the surrendered fields of taxation is accurate. I expect that at the end of the year the estimate of the returns will prove to have been very moderate. They were based on returns from reduced rates of income tax and entertainments tax; much larger sums have been raised from those sources in the past. In the past year about £9,000,000 I can was raised by income tax, but a few years ago £16,000,000 was raised from that source. There is no doubt that the sum of £7,000,000 can be raised in Australia from the surrendered taxation areas. The Treasurer of Victoria proceeds to sayIn pursuance of some tlieor}', the Comiinonwealtli Government now demands the separation of Commonwealth and State finances. Sir Alexander Peacock knows perfectly well what the theory is-that one of the principles of responsible government is that a government shall, so far as possible, raise the money it spends. The pamphlet also states'At the inception of federation it was thought that tlie best interests of government could be served by Commonwealth and Stale finance being interwoven. That is a statement. I take the liberty of challenging. I am well aware that I am much younger in political experience than Sir Alexander Peacock, who was a member of the convention which drafted the Constitution. But surely honourable members who have given any attention to this problem know that one of the difficulties in bringing about federation was that of making the finances of tbe Commonwealth and the States independent. It was far from being the view at that time that the best interests of government would be served by the Commonwealth and State finances being interwoven; the contrary opinion was held. That is why the clause which has been so often referred to was known, not as the Braddon clause, but as the ""Braddon blot""; it shackled the Commonwealth, and made the States financially dependent on the Commonwealth. That arrangement was the only one possible at the time on account of the needs of the States, the manner in which they raised their revenue, and the relatively small needs of the Commonwealth. The pamphlet then saysThe Constitution originally framed provided for three-quarters of the Customs and excise revenue being paid to tbie States for all time. But that is the provision that was not adopted. placed upon it . One of the elements of the Federal system is that there is a Central Government and State Governments,, that each is independent and sovereign in its own sphere, that the different spheres are set for t h in the Constitution, and that no government operating within its own sphere is subject to the control of any other government. That is the principle which the Government for the first time now seeks to apply, as f a r as possible, in finance. I say "" as f a r as possible,"" because it is recognized in the Constitution, and in the proposal of the Government, that financial assistance must be given to certain States. Accordingly, tbere are practical limitations to the adoption of the principle. The pamphlet contends thatAny action to disturb existing relations should only be taken under tlie autliority of tlie people, direct or indirect. But the Commonwealth will not trust the people. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer, at the last general election, said quite plainly that it was their policy to separate Comonwealth and State finances. What is this statement about referring the matter to the people? Section 87 of the Constitution expressly provides that this matter shall be determined by the Parliament of the Commonwealth. No amendment of the Constitution is required to give effect to these proposals, because the Constitution expressly places the power of dealing with this matter in the hands of the Commonwealth Parliament. It must not be forgotten that in 1911' the people rejected a proposal to embody the capitation payment of 25s. in the Constitution. The Commonwealth Parliament, in carrying out its financial proposals, is not only exercising a right, it is also performing a duty. It would be easy for the Government to side-step this difficult problem, but it recognizes that if the present condition of things were allowed to remain unaltered indefinitely, the position of the .States would be so insecure and so on. Afr. Latham. tirely at the mercy of this Parliament, that any party in power in this Parliament opposed to the federal system could, by the simple and easy method of repealing a single Federal statute, force unification upon Australia. That is one of the principal reasons underlying these A ten-years' limitation was proposals. The pamphlet saysThe Government knows that the overwhelming weight of public opinion is against the proposals. I differ from that statement. I am well aware that the press, as a whole, is not favorable to tbe proposals; but I have had the experience of addressing a considerable number of meetings on this subject. I have found that, generally, the proposals are, at the outset, disapproved, but when I have explained the situation, the feeling is changed immediately. Many people whom I have addressed had no idea that the Commonwealth intended to repeal or reduce any of its taxation. They thought that the Commonwealth taxation was to continue, and that the capitation grant was simply to be withheld from the States. The true explanation was a revelation to many of them. I showed them that tbese proposals, if given effect, would place the Statesi n a position of greater financial independence and security than they enjoy at present. The pamphlet, after accusing the Federal Ministers of a lack of federal spirit, saysTheyare heading for the tyrannical government of Australia from Canberra. Exactly the contrary is the case. So long as the capitation system continues, the States are in effect subject to the control of this Parliament. The abolition of that system, and the repeal of the taxation as proposed, would place the States in a more independent position. The pamphlet statesAmong the revenue to be relinquished is the entertainments tax. This brought the Commonwealth nearly £700,000; now it only realizes £320,000. The pamphlet suggests that this tax has become less productive with the years. The facts are that reductions have ""been made in the original tax. The tax was at one time placed on tickets of ' 6d. and upwards. It later applied ' only to tickets of -Is. and upwards, ""and now applies only to tickets of 2s. 6d. and upwards. That is the reason for the reduction in the amount received from aware of any principle with which aggre the entertainments tax.

There would be a regular annual struggle when the State Treasurers endeavoured to make up the amount lost by the reduction of the per capita payment. serious controversy upon every conceivable point. Another suggestion is that it would be better for the Government to take over the State debts and also to control State borrowing than to introduce a scheme of this kind. objections to the proposals of the Government; but they are nothing like the objections that would be offered to a proposal that this Parliament should be equipped with power to control the borrowing and spending power of all the States and, therefore, the whole of their developmental enterprises. The right honourable member for Balaclava was pleased to approve of a speech that I made in this House on the 9th September last, on the motion for the second reading of the M^ain BoadsB ill . I am glad that the sentiments I expressed meet with his approval, for I still hold them. I support the roads policy of the present Government, because there is a marked distinction between it and the proposals contained in the Main Boads Acts that the last Parliament passed in 1923, 1924 and 1925. Those measures provided that certain sums should be payable to the States out of the Consolidated Revenue, according to the schedule contained in the Act ; and that the Governor General should prescribe the class of roads to which the money should be applied. I regarded that as legislation upon the subject of main roads. But had the right honourable gentleman read the whole of my speech he would have seen that just after the passage which he quoted, I observed that the proposals in the bill, then under notice, might-have been justified, had they been advanced as "" f in a n cial assistance to the State,"" but they were not so placed before the Parliament. The road policy which the Government will be presenting to honourable members shortly is based upon the provisions of section 96 of the Constitution, which readsDuring a period of ten years after the establishment of the Commonwealth and thereafter until the Parliament otherwise provides, the Parliament may grant financial assistance to any State on such terms and conditions as the Parliament thinks fit. Legislation of that character for the purpose of granting financial assistance to the States is in every sense constitutional. I point out further, as an important feature, that the Government's proposals It would involve a are dependent upon agreements being made with the States. tional to collect money by means of a Federal tax in a State that does not make an agreement w it h the GovernThere may be ment ? has the fullest powers of taxation, and there is no doubt whatever that it may collect whatever Customs and excise duties it thinks proper, and apply the money as it pleases. As the honourable member for Yarra knows, there must be no discrimination in taxation between the States. As at present advised, I have no doubt that the proposed petrol tax would 'be quit© constitutional. Some of the criticism of it has been based on the assumption that the whole burden of road-making in Australia is being placed on the shoulders of petrol users and motorists. The facts are that under the Government's proposals the Commonwealth will find £2,000,000 per annum for roads, and the States £1,500,000 per annum. Of the. Commonwealth's share £500,000 is to be provided out of general revenue, and £1,500,000 out of the proposed new Customs duties; and the States are to find their £1,500,000, as they think fit from loan or revenue. Accordingly, whatever objections may be offered to the petrol tax it cannot be said truthfully, that the whole burden of road construction is being placed on the shoulders of petrol users. A p a r t altogether from this £3,500,000, probably £11,000,000 or £12,000,000 is being spent annually by various bodies on roads in Australia, so that the £1,500,000 it is proposed to raise from the motor-owners is a very small proportion of the total expense. It can hardly be maintained t h a t ' t h a t is an excessive proportion to be borne by a section of the community so directly in terested in roads as motorists are.",70,Statement Of Outstanding Landtax At 30th Jttnb 1924 Divided Into Various Groups According

The honourable member did not want to hear that. ber knows perfectly well that the reason for the non-collection of that tax has been apparent to the community for years. The last evidence of that is tbe judgment recently delivered by His Honor Mr Justice Rich, showing that it was practically impossible to collect the tax imposed upon those leaseholders by Labour under a section to which nobody has yet been able to attach an intelligible meaning.
