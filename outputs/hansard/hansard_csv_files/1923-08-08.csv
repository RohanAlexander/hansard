2,Mr Marks,"I desire, by way ofCommonwealth. Government Steamers known as the "" Austral"" steamers. I would not again have spoken of the matter but for the fact that the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Mahony), iu referring to my aotion, used expressions concerning which tbere might be some uncertainty. The honourable member and I have known eaoh other quite long enough to be satisfied that neither of us would take action the propriety of which could in any way be called in question. agree with the honourable member. orable member used the expression, "" It is rather scandalous that the honourable member should take such action."" I do not know of any action I could have taken which wonld have been more publio than that which I did take, namely, on the floor of this Chamber to hand to the head of the Government an offer for the purchase of certain ships which the Prime Minister, in speaking on the Commonwealth Shipping Bill, said would have to be disposed of, as they were not of a type that the Commonwealth Shipping Line could use for the overseas trade upon which it would be entering. I want it to be clearly understood that I have no finanoial interest whatever in this matter. People outside, and the press also, at times seem inclined to throw political mild at politicians, and it has occurred to me that, because of the action I took, it might be suggested that I was in some way interested, perhaps in a commission that would be paid in the evont of the ships being sold. I had no interest whatsoever in the matter beyond serving the Commonwealth. The honourable member for Dalley said that it would be better to have tenders called for the purchase of these vessels; but I took it from the speech made by the Prime Minister that certain ships wonld have to be sold, and, on behalf of a constituent, I submitted an offer for the consideration of the Government. tinctly that I am of the opinion that the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr for these men ? Marks) would not dream of doing anything which would justify the insinuation that he was not perfectly honourable Line of or might be associated with transactions that could be described as' shady. WhatI said was that I was astounded at the unu8ualness of his proceeding. To roe, it is even now astounding that such an unusual course should have been taken. If the Government desire to dispose of these vessels, there is a correct procedure to follow. It should advertise their sale openly in the public press, and call for tenders. I took exception to the action taken by the honourable member for Wentworth last night, because I gathered from his remarks that he had been in consultation with the Prime Minister, and that, as a result of that consultation, he came to this House and presented an offer for tbe purchase of these ships. I considered that that would establish a very dangerous precedent, and it is on that ground I took objection to what oocurred. I . am pleased to hear what the honourable member has had to say, and I was pleased also to learn from the Prime Minister that the Government is not prepared to dispose of these vessels in a secret way, and that, if they are to be disposed of, they will be sold openly, and every one will be given a fair opportunity to tender for their purchase'.

9,Mr Bruce,"I think the honorablement to take any action to direct another as to the course which' it should follow in regard to a matter which is its own responsibility. fact that, as I understand, Mr Percy Deane has been relieved of his duties, I should like to know from the Prime Miuister whether any other omcers have been relieved of their duties, or it is contemshould be given. I .think, however, that plated to suspend them pending the inquiry by a Royal Commission into certain sugar purchases? gard to Mr Deane is that in the ordinary course it came to his knowledge that the Government had decided that a Royal Commission should be appointed to inquire into certain purchases of sugar, aud, as his name was mentioned when the matter was discussed in this House and was before the Public Accounts Committee, he immediately came to me and took what I think the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) will agree was a very proper course. He asked that, pending the inquiry by the Royal Commission, he should be relieved of his duties There is no suggestion that Mr Sir Adrian Knox, the Chief Justice, 'and Deane has been suspended. No officer of the Public Service can be suspended unless a charge is made against him. No charge has been made against Mr held in public. Deane. He has merely been relieved of his duties at his own request, and I think that in making such a request he took a very proper course. It is not contemplated to suspend any other officer, nor do I know of any other officer who might be expected to ask that he should be relieved of his duties in connection with this matter. of explanation of a question I am going to address to the Prime Minister, that I quite appreciate his view, that once this matter had been referred to a Royal Commission it would be improper to discuss it on the floor of this Chamber? But I desire to ask him on what principle or precedent he declines to disclose to this House the communications or revelations, whatever they are, which have formed the basis for the proposed appointment of the Royal Commission? As something, apparently, has occurred in regard to which the-right honourable gentleman proposes to ask the Governor General ,,to appoint a Royal Commission, I ask him whether it is not proper that he should take the House into his entire confidence as to the facts he proposes to have investigated ? Royal Commission is, of course, an executive Act. I entirely agree with the honourable member that any information I can properly give to the House when the honourable member sees the terms of the reference he will appreciate the view that there is no further information I can give at this time without prejudicing the case which is to be submitted and determined by the Royal Commission when appointed. orable gentleman inform the House of the name of the Justice of the High Court who is to be constituted a Royal Commissioner? Furthermore, will the proceedings, as I assume they will, be open to the general public? . honourable member of the name of the Justice of the High Court to be appointed. I am in communication with as soon as I am in a position to do so, I shall make the information available. So far as 1 know, the proceedings will be KU-KLUX' KLAN . the attention of the Prime Minister to the formation ih New South Wales of a branch of an organization known as the Ku-Klux-Klan. In his reply, the Prime Minister stated that the Government had no legislative power to deal with organizations of this character. Is it not a fact that the Unlawful Associations Act of 1916-17 gives the Government the necessary power? In view of the outrages committed by the Ku-Klux Klan in the United States of America, will the right honourable gentleman take the neces.sary steps, under that Act, to prevent its formation here?",14,Unemployed

We are 'not sure what the actual saving in expenditure, will <b.e. I consider ithat it will be about £300,000. The taxpayer will also be saved a consider.able amount of worry and vexation, and heavy expenditure in fees. Many people pay lawyers more to compile their taxation returns than they pay in taxation. that. The Taxation Department will do it for nothing. MT. OOOK -That may be the honorah'le member's .opinion. The -migration problem is one of the most important that wo have to consider. It is not a party question. We should face it fairly and squarely, with a determination to do the best thing possible. I invite constructive criticism of our migration policy. Australia has room for a large number .of people. I believe that more co-ordina; tion is necessary. I question whether we are getting the -hest class of immigrants. We need people who are accustomed to the land and who are -prepared to go into .our .out-back ' country to develop it. According to Dr. Maloney, we have more labourers in our capital cities than w.e .can find employment for. A recent -migrant to Australia .discussed with me the policy which Australia was following. He was gratified with his surroundings,, hut ho .assured me ,that the mode of selection in England could not be commended. The agent to whom, he went .received £5 for passing him and his wife and .two children. I . was glad to hear him say that the medical examination -was strict, but he said that the examination as to his capabilities .was very lax. The agent .told him that all he had to do in filling in his papers was -to state that he was accustomed to farm work and had had experience on the land. The Minister should inquire into that statement. While we are anxious to .obtain migrants, At .sliould he made clear that we will only accept the best -class of people. The few million pounds that we propose to .spend on our migration policy is infinitesimalWe «hould do well if we spent £50,000,000 or even -£100.000',000 on a proper scheme of land .settlement.

We -may have .to spend both, but at present j consider at f a r -wiser to spend all the money we .can on jland settlement. Our best means .of .defence is undoubtedly to settle people s>n the land.

Five such battleships. would cost £50,000,000, and the vessels would Ibegin to depreciate the day they were completed. If we spent £50,000^00 an land settlement, we should be accomplishing something which would be of immense and increasing value to the country. Have we at present any ithoroughly practical scheme of land .settlement ? I 'have 1 travelled extensively in Queensland, New South Wales, Western Australia, and South Australia. In only two States 'are any jseally honest attempts being made to solve the .'great problem of land settlement--Victori a and Western Australia. The work going on in Western Australia is' a .distinct cre.dit to the Government, ; .anid Sir .James Mitchell is going full ssteam ahead; -and Mr Mclver, chairman of the Closer .Settlement Board in Victoria, is doing his very -best.

45,Mr Mathews,"or two months we should be overcome. We had some excellent speeches on defence from the members of the Opposition. I am glad that they are willin g to give the Government reasonable assistance in providing for the defence of Australia. They look at the matter in a slightly ..different way from that in which we look at it . They realize the necessity as part of our defence for settling people on the land. I believe that we could do with more skilled artisans in Australia. A t present bricklayers at Canberra are paid 22s. 6d. a day f u l l time. W it h the scarcity of such workers in the cities, I doubt whether we shall be able to secure the number we need at Canberra. We could do w it h extra men. Ten thousand houses were built in Sydney last year, and that number, was 10,000 below the actual number of orders given. In consequence of the shortage of bricklayers, many people were compelled to build concrete houses. We have heard a good deal from the publication in the last twenty years.

Mr Cook. valuable an institution to be placed under the management of one person, who might, on account of his excessive power, become a dictator. The late Sir Denison Miller held the respect of every person who knew him, and the work he accomplished for the community will stand to his credit for 'generations. The war was largely responsible for his success. There are many competitive banks, and I feel that the Commonwealth Bank could do very much better service by establishing rural credit branches. A t present its operations largely favour the city, and I understand there are funds amounting to £40,000,000 invested abroad. The Board should consist of sound practical, men who would see that no section, of the community received an advantage over another. The country interests require no advantage to which ' they are not entitled. The Farmers' Advocate has done more for the primary producers of Victoriai n the past two or three years than has any other establishment of a new Bank: In establishing the Primary Producers' no attempt was made' at originality. It is simply a copy of the. country banking sysas carried out in various European and He conarises-wli y countries. The question naturally open another bank when there aro like institutions in Australia? for another dividends-as possible for ' their shareholders. spirit outside shareholders'^ interests.

It is out to give every assistance to customers when they require to purchase implements, etc., for it has already made arrangements whereby spot cash will be paid to machinery merchants and others. It will attend to insurance of every description-life , fire, burglary, hail, etc., and will help its customers in all matters where money is involved. If the Commonwealth Bank were run on those lines there would be no need for the Rural Bank. Board of Control of the Commonwealth Bank will consider the advisability of giving the primary producers a certain amount of aid. The Government are in stituting a huge settlement .policy. Last night I referred to soldier settlement and similar ventures, and if these are to be successful the Commonwealth Bank must render reasonable assistance. means the opening up and developing of new areas would be greatly facilitated. The matter of national insurance, which is mentioned in the Treasurer's Budget speech, is of great importance. Old-age and invalid pensions are to be increased, for which we are deeply indebted to the Government. The proposed increase is small, being only 2s. 6d. per week, but still it is a substantial amount. A married couple will be allowed tp have 120s. per fortnight in earnings arid pension,' which is a fair and reasonable allowance. Still the Government have not gone as far as they might. appoint a Royal Commission on National Insurance to investigate the various phases of old-age, invalidity, sickness and unemployment. near futur e a B ill will be introduced at, the result of its findings to give some relief. I am not a financier, but I believe that a comprehensive scheme of national insurance would, in the course of fifty years, not only pay for itself, but make available a large surplus for other purposes. Commonwealth and the States have the benefit of superannuation schemes, and if such schemes are good for public servants, they are good for every one else. Wc are indebted to the Agef o r the series of nrticles on this subject which it is at present publishing. I propose to read two extracts fro m the article appearing in to-day's issue. The first refers to the scheme in Germany, and is as follows:The so-called national insurance in Germany had birth in the system of miners' provident . funds, established in .the early half of last century. As long ago as 1845 the Prussian Industrial Code enacted the creation of benefit funds providing against sickness, need and death; but it was not until 1881 that a general scheme embracing the bulk of the industrial workers was instituted iby the State. . not the honourable member read what the Age said about the Budget. I understand that the .do with the Budget?' The Budget makes reference to a national insurance scheme and to old-age and invalid pensions, and if the honourable member for Hume( Mr. Parker Moloney) has no respect for the aged, then I have. The article continuesFrom time to time during bhe intervening period the taw on the subject was amended, By this until it reached its final form in 1011, when 15,500,000 workers came within its scope. Broadly, the system, provides for the compulsory insurance of lojwcr-paid workers against invalidity, accident, old age and death, with a voluntary scheme 'for other better-paid classes. Employer and employee contribute 0 small sums weekly to the general fund, which is subsidized by the State: The benefits comprise:1. Old-age pensions, claimable at seventy years of age. 2. Invalidity pensions. 3. Survivor pensions, Le., pensions to dependants of insured persons. 4. G-ratuitics to widows and orphans. 5. Payments during incapacity through accident or illness. It is intended to 6. Sanatorium nnd other curative treatment. ThenI make the following short extract concerning the provisions of the British We trust that in the Act The scope of the British National Insurance Acts, whicli were originated by Mr Lloyd George, is not so comprehensive as under the German plan. The ifirst Act, which provided for national health insurance, came into operation in 1911, and its scope has 'been extended from time to time. Buring the war period unemployment insurance iwas added, so that to-day the scheme is dividedinto two clearly The Public Services of the defined sections:-'(a ) Health; (h) unemployment. Both are administered by State Departments, with the aid of what are termed "" approved societies,"" such, for instance, as friendly societies, industrial insurance companies, and provident societies formed by them and the trades unions. In regard to health, insurance is compulsory for all persons between the ages of {sixteen and seventy years employed at industrial labour, and all other employees whose annual income is less than cE250 per annum. To this rule tliere are certain exceptions.. The contributions in the case of male workers is fixed at 5d. per week, and in the case of females at 4d:, tlie employer in each case contributing 5d. per week for oach employee, and the State granting a subsidy in proportion.

55,Mr Cook,"Throughou t the East,honourable member for No r t h Sydney( MrW . M . Hughes). is the second address of any i m portance that he has given this session, and it appears that he is what the M i nister for Trade and Customs( Mr Austin Chapman) described as a follower of the Government-wit h a tomahawk ! ex-Prime Minister is a man of wide knowledge, and I appreciate to the fullest extent the work he did during 'the war.. The tactics he has adopted, however, since he relinquished oflice are to be condemned, and they are condemned by practically all the Government supporters The tirade of abuse which the right honourable gentleman delivered yesterday was ill-becoming a man who has held such exalted positions, in this country. He told us tales that were not altogether correct. I remember that, during the elections, he spoke in five towns in my constituency. Before his visit quite a number of the electors -were in doubt as to whether they should support me or not, but after hearing the then Prime Minister they were quite satisfied to do so. The right honourable gentleman on those occasions did not touch on policy, but simply switched on to abuse of the other sidea method of which he gave us an example yesterday. I can only say I was pleased that the Committee did not take the honourable member at all seriously -TH e honourable member for In d i ( Mr Cook) has a large interest in a butter factory, and we can well understand the "" butter "" he has spread over -the M in istry; indeed, it is a wonder he did not also distribute some bacon. In any case, he ought to feel sure of almost as many post-offices and telephones he could hope for in his electorate. I suppose the honourable member has been treated kindly by the Government, and speaks what he feels when he describes it as an ideal Ministry which ought to have an opportunity of showing what it can do. Personally, I have nothing to say against the Government; I am quite content to let time tell its tale. It is true that the Government has started badly in proposing to reduce the revenue of the. Post Office by over £900,000, about which not a word of protest was uttered by the honourable member for In d i . It is certainly not the farmers, and primary producers generally, who w ill benefit by this proThat posed reduction of the postage rates, but the big warehousemen, bankers, shipping companies, and so for t h which send out thousands of letters a year. We must also remember that the amount of mail matter which may be sent for l i d . has'been inThe creased, so that business men will reap a double advantage. If I were a country representative I should strongly protest against money being distributed in this way, while all over Australia people are crying out for extended postal, telegraphic, and telephonic facilities. In the past the Post Office has earned, large surpluses, and these, instead of being devoted to postal works, have gone into the gener a l revenue. The honourable member for In d i represents country interests, and represents them well; but he is quite content to pass over the remissness of the Government in this respect. The Postal Department is the most important we have, affecting, as it does, every man and woman in the country. I receive dozens of letters each week, asking why telephones are not supplied although applications have been approved and the necessary fees paid. Considering the feeling of the country people in regard to the manner in which they are neglected, from a postal point of view, I think the Government is making a great mistake in proposing to reduce the postal rates, and thus lose revenue which could well be devoted to making up arrears in postal works. This is a question that should be above a l l party considerations, and I trust that there will be strong opposition on both sides to the Government proposals. It is disgraceful that at this juncture in our history there should be wealthy men as in the community who endeavour to evade taxation they are perfectly well able to bear. Those men advocated fighting the war to a finish, but now that the war is over and we have an enormous.load of debt seek to shirk their responsibilities. It is true that we .are no longer put to the expense of sending large forces to the Eront, but we have an enormous interest bill to meet; and, in view of all the circumstances, this is not a time at which taxation should be reduced. The best way to reduce taxation is to reduce our national debt, and thus reduce the interest b ill . But a reduction in postal rates ia. a step",25,Budget 1923 24

I am prepared to continue paying heavy income taxation to the Commonwealth and Statesi n order to bring about a diminution of the debt. right to pass our burden on to future generations. The Australian people decided to stand up to their responsibilities in the war, aud to do everything possible to assist the cause of the Allies. We should be prepared now to meet the debt that we have accumulated, and u n t i l that is done there should be no clamour for the reduction of taxation. I expected that a Budget introduced by a Treasurer who is eminent in the medical profession, would include important proposals for improving the health of the community. diabetes are the three outstanding menaces of, humanity to-day, and one would have thought that a medical Treasurer would have placed on the Estimates large sums of money for the promotion of research in regard to those evils.

So too, in regard to cancer and diabetes, it is the duty of the Government to adopt a forward policy, especially when they have the guidance of a Treasurer who, as a medical man, has a f u l l knowledge of the diseases of the human body and the suffering they cause. Although surgery has made important advances, the medical profession has been practically at a standstill in recent years in regard to the treatment of ordinary ailments. Scientists who have made i m portant discoveries of new methods of treatment should be given encouragement Cancer, consumption, and by the Government.

In addition, it built clothing; and', harness factories asi part of thedefence scheme. Yetwe are spending, more money on defence to-day than we spent during' those years. On what are we spending it? I believe it is going in salaries to highlyI t was the dread of his life that his. Navy paid officials. No really progressive defence work is being accomplished. When Mr Massy Greene was Minister for Defence he effected a saving in the. expenditure on defence. We were led to be. lieve that in consequence of the Washington. Conference, and the work of the League of Nations, we. would nob need ro spend so much on naval and military armaments. A f t e r his' return from the Washington Conference, Senator Pearce reported that there was no danger of war in the. Pacific for thenext, ten years at least. Therefore; theexpenditure on our Army and Navy should be cut down to a minimum, and themoney that otherwise! would have been spent on defence measuresshould be made available for. the. reduction of our national, debt and for the development of our resources.

I propose to quote Lord Bryce. No one will suggest that Lord Bryce was anything but a very broad minded, humane, and public-spirited man. In his book, Modem Democracies, volume 2, page 319, w r it in g of old-age pensions in New Zealand-h e refers only casually to .Australia, but the conditions here are substantially the same as in New Zealand -h e saysThe tendency of most branches of administration in New Zealand, as in most democratic countries, has been to a steadily increasing expenditure. Old-age pensions, for instance, when introduced in 1878, ten years ibefore they were granted in Britain, were surrounded by a_ number of restrictions and qualifying conditions, which were, in subsequent years, struck off one after another so that the number of recipients has increased much faster than it ought to have done in proportion to' increase in population. In 1919, it was 19,872; the' original amount of each pension was £18 a year. The average was in 1919 a' little over £37. The total amount expended per annum, which, in 1900, was £157,000, had risen in 1917 to £480,000, and, in 1919, it was £743,000. I have looked up the most recent figures, and I find that in 1922 it was £750,000. Lord Bryce says, furtherTlie large expenditure had not, in 1910, reduced the amount spent by the State on charitable aid to the poor, but it had diminished pribe a permanent increase, and not one that vate contributions to charitable purposes. He refers to a book published by two. gentlemen, Messrs. Le Rossignol and Downie Stewart, State Socialism in New Zealand, in which he says many interesting details are given. I regret to say that we do not appear to have this work in the Commonwealth Library, though I think it should be there. Lord Bryce says, referring to this bookTho poor law arrangements of New Zealand are alleged to encourage extravagance by allowing local authorities to spend sums received from the central revenue; and thc growth of pauperism in a community so new and so prosperous has been frequently commented on, and was deplored even toy the optimistic Seddon. I think I have said enough to enforce the first point I hope to make with regard to old-age pensions, and that is, that our present pensions are the highest in the Afr. Duncan-Hughes. world to-day. That is something which should be taken into consideration. Bryce was rather deploring the conditions which made such provision necessary. orable member has no doubt read the book to.whioh I have referred. honourable member will read the two volumes of Lord Bryce's book, I think he w ill find that his attitude is a very liberal one-no t using the word in a political sense-bu t that he here rather deplores the fact that old-age pensions in New Zealand, instead of having the result hoped for fro m their establishment, led to a certain extent to extravagance and pauperism. I come now to my second point, which is to the effect"" that our financial position does not justify an increase in these pensions at the present time. It is an easy matter to increase the old-agepension or any other pension, b.ut it is a very much more dimcult business to take off the increase granted. I do not think any one will deny that once we make an increase in the old-age pension it will be about the last thing that will be taken off. It would be taken off only in a case of extreme financial stringency. I therefore wish honourable members would take into very careful consideration any proposal to increase the existing pension, realizing that it must can be taken off at any time. Honourable members should realize, also, that if an increase is given we are likely to go f u r ther in the future. Honourable members opposite arealready in favour of an increase of 2s. 6d. in advance of the increase proposed by the Government. hanging to it . say anything on that point. I am giving my view of the position as it appears to me. This increase is likely to lead to further increases; indeed', it is a regrettable encouragement to them. For the year ending 3.0th June, 1917, there were, in round figures, 93,000 old-age pensioners, while in 1921 there were 102,000. In . the same period the number of invalid pensioners increased from 26,000 to 37,000, showing an increase from 120,000 to 140,000,",33,Budget 1923 24

The increase in population during the same period, tahing the years ending on the 31st December, was from 4,982,793 to 5,510,229, or less than oneninth, so that the pensioners are increasing much more rapidly proportionally than the general population. In my opinion the increase both in number and expenditure wilt be much larger in the future. So far only those have become eligible who, when pensions were instituted, were of .middle age. When those who are brought up with the idea that at a certain age they will be provided for by the State take f u l l advantage of the privilege, the fate of increase must be vastly greater. We are already paying nearly £5,400,000 in old-age and invalid pensions, as shown on the 30th June last year. The maternity allowance means an expenditure of £690,700, and we are paying in war pensions of all kinds £7,028,379. I am not criticising these pensions, but merely showing the burden that rests on the shoulders of the people of this country. member so gloomy? some of us have not the natural humour of the honourable gentleman; and I may say that I regard this expenditure as a, serious matter. I am quite aware that my views are not in accord with those of the majority of honourable members, but I think I am entitled to express them. MrO ' KEEFE more serious for poor people who may starve ? orable member can scarcely use the word "" starve "" when he realizes that the pensions paid here are the highest in any part of the world. orable member get along on an old-age pension ? regard that as a fair question. I am entitled to express my opinions regardless of what my personal financial position may be. Perhaps the best answer I can make is that for oyer three years, in a fighting unit, I saw conditions, and suffered conditions, which may be similar to those which honourable members opposite have in mind. It is not fair to suggest that an honourable, member is in fluenced in his opinions by his own position. Further, the fact thab I am not in need of a pension should nob prevent me from taking as long a .view as other members . of this question as it affects Australia as a whole. I arri taunted with being dismal, but the other day the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr. Charlton), when speaking of the heavy financial liabilities of the Commonwealth, was fairly dismal himself. That honourable member told us that he did not advocate repudiation, and hoped no one ever would, but he suggested that the position was one to give grave cause for thought. I quite agree with the honourable member; and if we""refer to the Budget speech of the Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page) we see that in the next five years no less than £263,000,000 of Commonwealth loans will f a l l due, and must be renewed or converted. This is, therefore, not the most suitable moment at which to. grant an increase in old-age and invalid pensions, which, at the beginning, w ill mean an additional expenditure of £1,000,000, and later may mean a great deal more. An y money that is available is required for national reproductive works. During the last twenty or t h i r ty years we have heard much about national works which have to be completed. Some of these, such as. the Murray Waters scheme, are in hand, and there are the transcontinental line and other undertakings, which should be proceeded with as soon as possible.

I understand that national insurance is a plank in the platprinciple upon which the pension is form of the Socialist party, but although I am not a Socialist I shall support it if I consider it right. The Royal Commission will collect data and place Parliament in the possession of the most complete information before it is called upon to embark upon this very important venture. I have endeavoured to speak with moderation ou a very difficult subject, I had no desire to wound anybody's feelings. There are, I know, many deserving old-age pensioners. I have tried to state my case reasonably, and I hope that nothing I have said has been unduly provocative. When the honourable member for Indi( Mr Cook) was speaking, the thought occurred to me that if he had been a racehorse he would have been disqualified for a reversal of form. It was astounding to hear him attacking almost venomously the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr W. M . Hughes), who, when he was Prime Minister, was kept in office by the support of the honourable member aud his associates in the Country party. I was astonished by thc speech of the honourable member for Boothby( Mr Bryce says on tlie subject.

The honourable member is the only person in this House who holds such views. man game to express them. Such provision the 111 representatives of the people in this Parliament, the honourable member for Boothby has been the only one to declare that the old-age pension is a charity dole. He has missed the fundamental founded. Does the honourable member mean to say that the old pioneers, who have reared families and helped to develop this country for the last fifty or sixty years, are accepting charity when the Commonwealth recognises its duty by paying to them a monetary allowance in the evening of their lives ? the expression "" charity dole."" member said that the payment was something other than a right. Nobody can deny that it is the right of the old people to five. If the honourable member could forget for a moment his desire for the reduction of taxation in the interests of the wealthy people; if he would dissociate his mind from his pocket and consider for a moment the welfare of the nation, and the duty it owes to its citizens, he could not deny that the old-age pension is an undoubted right. The honourable member quoted the argument advanced by some writers. My judgment is not influenced by even Meredith Atkinson. I have read his writings, and I know that he is always gibing at politicians and assisting those who seek to bring parliamentary institutions and constitutional government into disrepute.

99,Mr Duncan,"HUGHES -Does not theanything about him, and if his writings suggest that the old-age pension is merely a charity dole, or anything less than a right, I do not want to know anything more of him or his writings. The pension may, as the honourable member for Boothby suggests, reduce private charitable contributions. I know there are good .people who give to charity, but the only unselfish help given to the poor is by the poor. Very little of the contributions to charitable and benevolent institutions by wealthy individuals and corporations is prompted by other than a desire for self-advertisement. During the war it was noticeable in country towns, as well as iu cities, that every contribution to patriotic funds by wealthy people was given due publicity. sure of their generosity being advertised, and then they sought to get their money back by overworking their employees or by some other means. I resent the argument advanced by the honourable member . for Boothby as being alien to Australian sentiment. His views are so hoary and bewhiskered with age that they are a mere relic of the days when these reforms were first proposed. The Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page) has taken early presentation That, certainly, is the only thing about the Budget upon which he can congratulate himself, and he has childishly utilized it to gain kudos for himself for an otherwise unsatisfactory The Budget is ill-digested. The figures have been thrown together in a haphazard way, and are, apparently, compiled to confuse rather than explain. has the Budget been presented earlier this year than in previous years? Is it because the Treasurer wanted to give honourable members the facts' it contains earlier than Treasurers usually give them? Even if honourable members did get those facts earlier than usual, and in time for us to properly consider them, it would be nothing to boast about. The real reason wby the Treasurer brought down this ill-digested and badly-arranged document so early is that he could not help himself. Government is one of hurry and hustle. We remember well that quite recently we had a certain hastily-prepared and illdigested Bill before us. In consequence Mr Laszarini. of objections made to it by the Opposition, the Government withdrew it to enable the draftsmen to do their work properly. That measure is now at the bottom of the business paper. The Treasurer boasts that he has a surplus. He has it in consequence of a policy of retrenchment. It is easy to show a surplus at the price of efficiency. The Government cannot be commended for adopting a cheeseparing policy at a time when, this country needs a strong developmental programme. It is crying out for development, but the Government has brought forward a policy which will retard development, and has claimed credit because it has a surplus. This composite Government may be compared to a miser who The donors made goes about in old clothes and feeds himself improperly, and then boasts because he has hoarded up money. At this,period in Australia's history, we should have no time for a fetish worship of surpluses. We should see that our finances are placed on a sound and scientific basis, and that money is available for the proper management and development of our great resources. I view with some alarm the suggestions in the Budget for the future control of the credit to himself for the Commonwealth Bank. The Government of the Budget. has dynamited so many useful institutions that I am afraid of something sinister in its Commonwealth Bank proposals. I shall refer later on to a few almost transparent subtleties in the Budget, but until the document. Bill to amend the constitution of the Commonwealth Bank is before us we are unable to say how far or how subtle are the Government proposals in respect to the Why Bank. The fact that the honourable member for Martin( Mr Pratten) so strongly commended this proposal of the Government, and so roundly condemned other matters in the Budget, is sufficient to justify my suspicions. That honourable member represents vested interests and financial institutions. His clamoring for the best business brains in other banking and financial concerns to be obtained for the future management of the Commonwealth Bank indicates to me that something is in view which the Labour party The whole programme of the cannot countenance. The persistent requests from outside that the constitution of this Bank should be altered comes from a quarter which bodes no good to the future of that institution-. Had the Government given the Commonwealth (Bank more sympathetic attention and administration it would have heen three times as powerful as it is. Newspapers, such as the Bulletin, which claims to be one of the greatest financial authorities in this country, have also urged a reorganization of the Bank. members should remember that the Bulletin made a strong attack upon Sir Denison Miller's management of the Commonwealth Bank. personal. ridicule on the institution When such nn authority, and other representatives of thc trusts and financial institutions of Australia, strive so earnestly to secure an alteration in the management of the Commonwealth Bank-whic h so f a r has been under national control-it seems to me that we may look for something sinister behind it all. For that reason I shall strongly oppose any meddling w i th the Bank. The only thing that the Government is entitled to do is to widen the scope of thc Bank so that it may become our greatest and eventually our only, tion. be comparatively easy to place our national finances upon a scientific and an efficient basis. We,are entitled to assume, from the speeches made from the other side of the Committee, that the Treasurer proposes to. place on the Board of Control of the Commonwealth -Bank two representatives of the great financial institutions outside the Bank. What sympathy have these institutions ever shown with those engaged in rural pursuits in this country? which they are so proud, and the' wealth of which they boast, have been gained through the sweat and tears of the pioneers and producers of Australia. Those institutions have many times ruthlessly foreclosed on mortgages which they held, and have given only two-thirds, aud sometimes only half, the value of the properties they have taken. That kind of thing has been dpne in every State and ra every district in Australia. Shalli t be said that we are willing to hand over the Commonwealth Bank to the tender mercies of these people ? When the Treasurer stumped the country in the interests of the now extinct Country party, he advocated that the Commonwealth Bank constitution should be broadened to enable the Bank to give rural credits, and. also to enable it to establish ruralt branches. If I mistake not, the proposal of the Treasurer now is that the Commonwealth Bank constitution should be so altered that the Bank will become Honourable an institution something like the Bank of England. A similar proposal has been advocated by a supporter of this Government in the Senate. If we agree to anyThe attack was almost thing of that kind it is "" good night "" The Bulletin tried to heap to the Commonwealth Bank. I am amazed to find that one who travelled all over this country in opposition to the present Government, and who was the Leader of the late Country party, should advocate such a proposal. Previously he desired that the Commonwealth Bank should be re-organized on a basis which would enable it to render greater assistance to our primary producers. His present proposal was conceived by somebody else long before he entered this House. I did not expect that he would be the one who'would bring it forward. It is a great surprise to many honourable members that he should deliberately set out financial instituto cripple and dynamite this great instiWhen that happens it w ill tution. Vested interests and private financial concerns have always endeavoured to get a vice-like grip on, and absolute control of, our financial arrangements and credit system, because they have realized that such control would enable them to do as they like with the country. We find no mention of this fact in the Budget. No attempt has been made by those honourable members who so recently opposed the .Nationalist Government to give effect to their proThe city buildings of mises to assist the primary producers. All their ideals in that, respect have been sacrificed. Their plans for the arrangement of a rural credit scheme through the Commonwealth Bank, which were forcefully advocated by the Treasurer, have been shelved in the interests of a rabid Imperialism. This Parliament is shortly to be closed to enable the Prime Minister( Mr Bruce) to go on a war-mongering excursion to Great Britain. Honourable members on this side of the Chamber have had to' resist attempts to rush through this House a DefenceB ill which incorporated provisions of the British Army Act, an A i r ForceB ill , and also a NavalB ill , which incorporated halfdigested proposals that were entirely against the declared will of the Australian people. who formed the now dead Country party making au endeavour to relieve the people in the rural areas of the burdens resting -upon them, they are standing solidly behind the Nationalists, until recently strongly opposed.

The Government still intend to prepare engines of war for the future of mankind. of the Budget is that the Leader of the Country party has been so absorbed in furthering the interests of the Nationalists that he has included greatly to the advantage of the capitalistic institutions. way, and under the cloak of a popular reduction such as is proposed in the postal rate, they attain their objective. are using this proposal as a smoke, screen to hoodwink the people. duction is an iniquitous proposal. We are told that it is a reduction of the war tax. The general taxpayer of the country writes no more than a letter a week. given a 25 per cent, reduction in letter postage, not amounting in the aggregate to more than £50,000 or £100,000 per annum. The people are thrown a sop of a few thousand pounds so that vested interests may rake in a profit of £800,000 or £1,000,000. letters of over \ oz. in weight. proposed postage reduction will be of considerable of York-street insurance companies, the legal profession, and the estate agents in the cities. documents, under the present system, firms have to pay 4d., will in future be carried for lid. This means a reduction of 150 per cent, as against 25 per cent. The Postmaster General, as a prominent member of the ilr. Lazzarini. Country party, told his constituents that Instead of the members he believed in decentralization. Yet, because of the parcel post arrangements, he is centralizing commerce in the large retail houses of Melbourne and Sydney,, and retarding the expansion of business to whom they were in the small country towns. Does any If the one imagine that the retail firms of the cities will reduce their prices to customers credits as a result of this arrangement Not for I asone moment. The Labour party is not opposed to cheap means of communication It has not between Australia and other, nations. We a constructive policy believe that the more the people are brought together by correspondence, telegraphy, wireless, and telephone facilities the quicker will peaceful civilization deveWe should lop. But we object strongly to this fine sentiment being prostituted under the but cloak of a postage reduction, to prolit vested interests. I wish to be fair, and I shall not condemn the Postmaster General for the present state of my elecdestruction torate; I shall judge h i m by results. Of Another remarkable feature course, I do not expect him to work miracles. I shall put on record, for his benefit, a few of the existing unsatisfactory conditions.

One communication stated that my request would probably be granted on the 1st of this month; yet nothing has been done. The post-office at Boorowa is a disgrace to the Commonwealth. Mr Webster, in 1917 or 1918, during his term of office, paid a visit to this town, and roundly condemned the building. The Postmaster-General's Department has informed me that an inspector condemned the building, but funds were not available to make the necessary alterations. inspected the building, and found that the doors would not close. The telegraphic instruments are placed in a small compartment, which is liable to catch fire. at _ any time. The whole atmosphere of the place is quite unhealthy, and it is unfit for occupation. I have pointed this out on several occasions to Ministers in charge of the Department. A few pounds are being spent at the present time in patching the place up, but tbere ought to be a new post-office built there. Mr of such an office to handle some £3,000 Webster recognised that when he was in charge of the Department, and made arrangements for the choosing of a site for a new office. I brought the matter under the notice of Mr Wise early in his term as Postmaster-General. what his reply was, but I suppose it was the usual excuse that funds were not available. I brought it under the notice of Mr Poynton when he was Postmaster General, and nothing was done. This is a substantial town in one of thp soundest wheat, districts in New Smith WSIIPS. It is a growing place, and its post-office is a disgrace to the Department. It-is by no means suitable to the requirements of the town, and is very inconveniently situated at one end of it. I hope that the present Postmaster-General, when making funds available for works in his Department, will give this case consideration.

It would be far better to pay proper wages, and* increase the facilities afforded in the country districts than to bring forward proposals for a reduction of the postage rates in the interests of the wealthy institutions and great commercial concerns of this country.

I had a great deal, of correspondence to attend to and did not hear what -was said by the right honourable member for North Sydney, but I understand"" from tlie press that he was far from laudatory of the Treasurer. In that the right honourable gentleman was only returning a compliment, because the Treasurer was not very complimentary to honorablo members with whom he is now allied when he spoke on the Budget of last year, and the year before last. I have a vivid recollection of a passage-at-arms between members of the Government at that time and the present Treasurer, who was then Leader of the Country party. gentleman talked . of "" manufactured balance's,"" and the phrase was taken exception to by fhe then honourable member for Richmond( Mr Massy Greene). I remember, also, that the right honourable member for North Sydney, who was then Prime Minister, was very severe upon the honourable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page), who is now Treasurer. With honourable members on the other side, criticism of the Government appears ro depend on whether the critic is a member of it or desires to be a member of it. The honourable member for criticises the financial proposals of the Government, but invariably he lines up and votes solidly for them when the division bells ring. Probably the right honourable member for North Sydney will do the same. If either of these honorablo gentlemen were Treasurer, he would, in all probability, deliver just the same dry old Budget to camouflage the real financial position of the Commonwealth. it would appear, is what a Budget statement is for. No attempt is made to take the people into the confidence of the Government, but every effort is made to camouflage the position in such a way that no one can understand how the finanilr. tiOSiBurini. cial affairs of thc Commonwealth are really being carried on.

I agree with many of the arguments used by the honourable member for Robertson ( Mr Gardner). They were arguments which honourable members on this side put forward in the last Parliament.

That is.the kind of argument the honHughes) might use, but not the Treasurer of a democratic country like Australia. We must remember that when wages are Martin being fixed by the Arbitration Court, tobacco is regarded as a necessity of the worker.

Mr Laezarini. circumstances I am entitled to recall some According to in remarks made by the honourable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page) in the course of his criticisms of the Government last year. The burden of many a song that he sang in this House, and throughout the country prior to the last elections, was that we should get back to constitutional methods of government, and that we should restore to Parliament the power to control the purse. I trust the Treasurer has not forgotten those remarks, and that he will do as he expected his predecessor to do. I hope that when the Estimates are being considered in detail by the Committee, he will not bring out the party machine and force through the various items. The Treasurer should do as he wished to be done by wben he was a freelance, or, I should say, when The circular letter sent to bonorhe was leading the late lamented Country party. His party contested the last elections with the cry, "" Restore to Parliament the power and control of the purse."" Therefore, if honourable members on this side of the Chamber or on the crossbenches opposite move any amendments In the circular letter to which during our discussion of the details of the Estimates, the Treasurer should not seek to unduly curtail the debate. If Parliament expresses a desire to have a certain amount added to any particular I item, wil l the Government allow Parliament to have the final voice in the matter? Is the Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page) going to live up to the promises he made to the people, and stand firmly for the principle he so long advocated-that constitutional government should be reverted to, and that Parliament should have restored to it the power of the purse? If he does not, he w ill demonstrate that the attitude which he adopted in the last Parliament was so much humbug, and that he was merely attempting to tickle the ears of the people in order.

That action, I consider, was quite wrong, and morally it was an improper treatment of the funds at the disposal of the Government, because it entirely dislocated the finances of the States, and brought about many difficulties in the local government of those parts of the Commonwealth in which the central Government should have shown a paternal, interest. practice has been continued year by year; consequently every year a bigger surplus is carried forward. It is a bad practice, because it induces extravagance and carelessness in finance. The Treasurer is not faced with the necessity to cut his coat 1 according to his cloth, because he always has a reserve on which to draw should he get into financial difficulties. From the point of view of the Treasurer, it is a very agreeable position. But I hope that the practice will not be continued after the end of this financial year. I admit that the Treasurer is faced with considerable difficulty at the present moment. He has in herited the surplus, and cannot so adjust his finances as to dispose of it . Moreover, the Government finds it necessary to do a lot of cleaning up, and it is impossible to accurately estimate its liabilities. believe that the Government has made an excellent start to place the affairs of the country on a-proper basis. The existence of the surplus has been responsible for a good deal of the criticism that has been levelled at the form in which the Budget has been presented. Technically, 'the objections that have been voiced may be quite sound, but, from the point of view of the public interests, they do not carry much weight. As long as the money has been devoted to the legitimate requirements of the country, it does not matter very much if technical bookkeeping faults have occurred. I see no reason to severely criticise the Government when the surplus has been devoted to desirable and necessary public works. It has been said in some quarters that the surplus should be utilized to give a greater reduction in taxation. I think the Government has gone as far as it is wise to go at the present stage. A considerable amount of relief has been given. In the Postal Department alone relief is to be given to the extent of about £930,000 as the result of the reduction in the rates of postage. benefit mainly commercial enterprises. fallacious argument. I cannot conceive how a 25 per cent, reduction in postage can be converted into 150 per cent. Eveni f it were so, to argue that the correspondence of business houses is entirely in their interests That is exceedingly short-sighted and foolish. The correspondence conducted by business houses benefits their clients as greatly us it does them. The reduction amounts to nearly £1,000,000, and to that extent is a lessening of tlie burden of the taxpayers. Two aud a half million pounds are to be devoted towards the redemption of war gratuity bonds, resulting in a very substantial reduction of the ^public debt. Tho establishment of a sinking f u n d on a systematic basis will for the first time give us a regular and constant means of lessening the burden that rests upon the people. It is true that a reserve of £2,400,000 is to be carried forward to provide for losses thab may be disclosed when the adjustment is made between the States and the Commonwealth Taxation Departments. I doubt whether such a I loss will be entailed, but if the money is required to be used it will render unnecessary the placing of further burdens upon the people. B y carrying forward £2,500,000 for defence purposes the Governmenb will be establishing a sane and sensible insurance for the future. If , as we all sincerely hope, the expenditure of that.money will be rendered unnecessary as the result of the Imperial Conferences, and the £2,400,000 can still be carried forward, I do not think that those amounts should be devoted-as some people urgei-to a further immediate reduction in direct taxation. An y reduction which is made should affect the indirect taxation that is resting heavily upon the people. Some persons consider that reductions should apply only to direct taxation. That naturally appeals to the man in the street, who experiences a certain amount of inconvenience when he is called upon to pay his income tax. The ordinary taxpayer welcomes the prospect of any lowering of the amount of direct taxation which he is called upon to pay. Becausei t is not brought prominently before his notice, he is not aware of the. amount which he pays in the way of indirect taxation. ,",46,Budget 1923 24

128,Mr Mann,"T h a t is an absolutelyber will -be discussing the Tariff in a minute! discussing the Tariff when I find it desirable to do so. There is not a single financial or economic question with which this Committee is called upon to deal that 'is not connected more or less with the Tariff. It is absolutely absurd for an honourable member to think that by making a jeering remark of that kind he is enlightening the people or assisting in the debate. It has been stated in this Chamber over and over again that the collection of a Customs revenue of £30,000,000 imposes upon the ordinary taxpayer, by reason of the higher cost of local manufactures, the burden of finding £120,000,000. In other words, the burden laid upon the taxpayers by indirect taxation is four times the amount actually received by the Government. Therefore, it stands to reason that if the Government surrenders £1,000,000 of the revenue that is derived from indirect taxation, it opens the way to the indirect saving by the people of no less than £4,000,000. If £1,000,000 is taken off direct taxation, that represents the whole of the saving to the people. This is why I say that it ' is desirable to reduce indirect rather than direct taxation. that the Government intends this year to devote a part of the surplus to lightening the burden of taxation may mean that they have it in mind to make some reduction in indirect taxation in the future. some evidence of reformation, even in the Minister for Trade and Customs. There is one matter connected with direct taxation to which I wish to call the particular attention of the Government, and that is the way in which this taxation is collected. I am very pleased that arrangements have been made between the Commonwealth and State Governments for its collection by one authority, but that will mean an unusually heavy payment by the taxpayer at the same time. He will, under the arrangement, receive his assessment for both authorities at the. same time. sarily. able gentleman that that will be the position in which taxpayers will find themselves. I received my assessment two or three weeks ago, and it was a very heavy I make no apology for assessment. Previously in Western Australia the State Government permitted a taxpayer to pay his tax in moieties. MrM . CAMERON --Why cannot that be done.under the new arrangement! cannot be done. Immediately on receiving my assessment, I telegraphed to the Deputy Taxation Commissioner in Perth to ask if an arrangement could be made for the payment of my tax in moieties, and I received the answer that that was not permissible: I am giving the facts from personal, knowledge, and yet honourable members tell me that the position is not as I stated it. adjusted by the Government., to ask the Government to do. It is often a very heavy drain upon a man to have to find a big sum of money at once. I might say that my returns were sent in eight or nine months ago, and I received an assessment with a notice to pay in ten days or a fortnight. It has to be remembered that, in my case, the fortnight must cover communication to and from Western Australia! Thepayment I hope that the fact of the tax for both Commonwealth and State at the same time will be'found to be a considerable hardship by a great many people, and the Government should issue definite instructions that this taxation may be paid in moieties, and that it should not be necessary for the taxpayer to apply for the concession. It puts a man in a somewhat invidious position if he has to go to a Taxation Commissioner, and apply in formd pauperis for this relief The payment of the tax in moieties-should be in accordance with a general instruction which any taxpayer may take advantage of. Of course, I am aware that it will be said that this would lead to increased cost in collection; but I do not think that the increased cost would amount to very much. It was not found in Western Australia that the practice of making this concession led to any material increase in the cost of collection of the State tax.

I entered into that work with very high hopes and a great faith in its possibilities, but it was not loug before I was severely disillusioned. First of all there was a difficulty that difficulties industrialists, o and work for the benefit There is a very fundamental the way. If a firm has a difficulty, and gets a solution of it from the Institute, it wishes to keep that solution for itself; it objects to the information being giveu to competitors.

Those who have difficulIt may be said that the Goties to solve w ill not submit them to the Institute, just because they fear that I have beard -the information they get w ill become public property. That is quite I have right; if competition is the essence of trade and -industry, it is no use have been a manufacturer giving his knowledge and should have to those competing with h i m . ThereI want to are other difficulties in regard to the organization of the Institute, but I prehad been fer not to go into these at this stage. I can tell honourable members a great deal of the work of tlie Institute, and can. j u s t i fy every remark or comment I make. I have followed every step of its work, and was closely and personally connected with it . The Institute has failed to Some honourable members realize anticipations, and is not giving an adequate return for the expenditure, and it would be better to re-organize the method of conducting its work. BeforeI do not think the Institute came into being, there were in all the States technical offices conupon it. I nected w it h the local Governments. The men in those offices were facing practical and varied problems in the industrial I was a member of the first world, and they had to solve them always with practical ends in view. They were not, perhaps, in some ways so highly qualified as the purely academic scientists, who largely control the Institute of Science and Industry. I take off my hat to those academic scientists, for some The reason was twofold. of them are great meu, who have done fundamental noble work for Australia in this particuin the way. The idea was lar sphere as teachers and guides of tlie Institute should take up thought. But when it comes to the facing manufacturers and practical application, of science to the conduct research difficulties of the day they, in many of industries. cases, lack that judgment that can only difficulty in be gathered by long experience. . When manufacturing the Institute was established the State agencies, though not abolished, were largely superseded. Men who had been fighting and battling for years, and who The would, with a littlemore encouragement, have made great progress, found themsays that the work it does selves overshadowed and pushed aside. property. The two In many cases problems, in regard to which they had done much, were handed I foreover to the Institute, and they found themselves l e f t just when they wanted a certain amount of help. The opporI tunity was then taken advantage of by the State Governments, who, instead of spending money through their State agencies, found it convenient to push the work on to the Commonwealth. Institute: I B the early days of the Institute many of the problems which had been handed over had already been dealt with by the technical men 'in the State offices, and, being found impracticable, put aside. the over, and again made efforts to find solutions only to come to the same conclusion as their State brethren, and to find that time and money had been wasted. It would be f a r better if this technical research work was sent back to the State men, who work, on problems with which they are in close personal contact. If this work were subsidized, assisted, and encouraged, they are more likely to give the best results. experience of between twenty-seveir and twenty-eight years, and I ing my deliberate ""whole scheme for the founding of the Institute sounded well and looked well, but it was really fundamentally weak, and, in many respects, was ill-advised. I now wish to say a word or two about trade and its conditions. We have heard a greab deal about the want of markets, and of the necessity for finding new ones. This was particularly stressed by the honning). I listened with interest and attention to the speech of that honourable member, and'it was a most valuable contribution to the discussion. He spoke as one who knows whab he is talking about;-and a man who does that is generally listened to with respect in this House. The only point on which I differed from h i m was that of new markets. New markets are undoubtedly very desirable if they can be found, but it appeared as though the honourable member' thought that new markets should be made by some artificial means and supported by some artificial stimulant. very different from the making of markets. Markets cannot be made artificially, nor can trade be bolstered up artificially if it is to be strong and enduring. I was, therefore, very pleased to see, from the Argus of yesterday, that it is the intention of the Meat Council, of which the honourable member for Macquarie is a member, to take a step which I think is worthy of imitation by other branches cf industry. That Council has decided t.o make a levy on stock-owners of, I think, l d . per head of stock, in order to-provide a f u n d to be used in exploiting new markets, and opening up fresh branches of trade. That is self-help of the best kind. It will be necessary for the Meat Council' to approach the Commonwealth and State Yet Governments for proper power before Institute took these ' problems they can take the movei they contemplate, and I sincerely trust that they will receivn every assistance in their admirable enterprise. If this example were generally followed there would be no need for further subsidies or artificial props for industry"".

I know that the operation of the Navigation Act has been referred for investigation to a Select Committee, and I do not think it advisable to say much in this connection. But a very real difficulty has cropped up in connection v it h the working of the Act as it affects the i mportant timber trade of Western Australia. Honourable members probably know that the hardwood timbers of Western Australia are unexcelled, if not unequalled, in the world. Western Australia has one of the finest reserves of hardwood on the face of the earth. DurThe finding of markets is ing the war the Western Australian timber merchants were able to open up markets in the eastern States owing to the temporary difficulty in obtaining many imported timbers. I know, of course, that, as compared with some imported timbers, our hardwood is very heavy, and more difficult to handle. Against that, however, our timber presents advantages in structural strength and endurance, advantages which probably outweigh any disadvantages.

The State saw-mills, along w it h other timber businesses, have agencies and markets throughout the eastern States.

Wei n Western Australia are quite prepared to compete w it h those imported timbers on a Free Trade policy, but we are not allowed to follow a Free Trade policy. Our saw-millers have their own markets, and they have no fear of competition in the eastern States. The important point is that the Western Australian timber merchants cannot get their timber to the eastern States. To-day one firm alone has 12,000 loads, representing about 16,000 tons of timber, on order in the eastern States, and cannot get it shipped.

Timber can only be carried at rates which are charged by steamers of the tramp type. bulk and weight, and the difficulty of handling, the timber cannot be carried in any other way cheap enough to pay. Western Australian timber trade has to be bolstered up with coolie labour. honourable member talking about? steamers are low-wage steamers. sumption. Up. to some time ago a certain amount of ship space was obtainable from Western Australia; and here I may turn to the coal question that has been raised. Tramp steamers from the eastern States to Western Australia carried bunker coal, and came back with timber. The. shipment of coal has fallen off partly, but only partly, on account of the strike. The fact is that the Collie coal of Western Australia has been developed to such an extent, and is used so much for bunkering, that the demand for Newcastle coal is diminishing, and consequently there is less shipping to take timber as back loading. The consequence is that if a man wants his timber brought to the east There seemed so much timber he has to pay freight both ways. The other day some of the timber men, in stead of 37s., were asked to pay 53s. a ton freight, a price which makes the business quite unpayable. Those are some of The honourable member the disadvantages which the people of Western Australia have to face. There is a market for the timber, and they have the organization for selling, but they cannot get ships in which to carry their timber to the eastern States. I think there is legitimate ground for asking the Government to put into operation those provisions of the 'Navigation Act which would allow other ships to call at Western Australian ports to l if t this cargo. I am entirely opposed to the principle of subsidizing shipping in order to find markets in the Orient, and I sincerely trust that the caution which ha9 been expressed by the Ministerf o r Trade and Customs( Mr Chapman) will be. exercised in the fullest measure before he agrees to such a policy. Last night that honorI t is on account of the coal able gentleman, speaking at a meeting at ' which the Commonwealth Government was It is nothing of the asked to give the f r u it industry further monetary support, made a remark which, emanating from h i m , should be illuminated in gold, framed, and hung on the On account of its wall.

It has been merely competing with other banks upon the same lines and in the same sphere. not the true purpose of a State Bank, nor can it thus render the greatest service to the community. The Commonwealth Bank should be a discount bank or bank of banks-wha t is known in South Africa as a Bank of Reserves. If the Government bring about a reform of the Bank's operations in that direction, the institution whether or not they had any objections will be able to do a great deal to stabilize the financial structure of the community, and will no longer be merely competing for business with the ordinary associated banks, even, so I am told, taking up securities which other banks would not touch. I welcome the proposal toappoint a Royal Commission to inquire intothe questions of national insurance and old age pensions. important investigations required at the present time, and I hope it will be commenced without delay. During the election campaign I urged throughout my electorate thab.the fullest inquiry should be instituted with a. view to ishe establishment of a national insurance scheme, and everywhere the proposal was received with the heartiest support and approbation. inquire not only into old-age pensions, sickness, and unemployment, out also into the maternity allowance, so that it may be able to evolve and recommend to this Parliament a comprehensive scheme. 'Of course, this is a very dimcult and intricate question. However, much may be learned from the experience of other countries, and only by a Royal Commission carefully studying the question with concentration, and collecting information from all parts of the world, can the foundations of a scheme that may be relied upon as sound and trustworthy be laid down. As a result of a conference held in Melbourne, the Postmaster-General recently issued regulations with regard to the control of wireless and broadcasting. I fully believe that the Minister is doing his very best with a dimcult problem. Some of the regulations have been criticised by thc public and in the press, and I personally have discussed them with the Postmaster-General. regulations to which grave objection may be taken, but I can appreciate the difficulty of the Minister in view of the fact that the regulations were framed by the very people who are interested in the business, and who declared that the set That is of rules they drafted meets all requirements. members of the Conference were unanimous. General pressed the delegates to declare, to the regulations, they persisted in saying that they unanimously approved of them. That makes it difficult for the Minister to introduce any alterations which he personally may think are desirable. I fully understand his position, and I am not speaking critically of his actions, but an awkward position has been created, and I think another Conference should be convened as soon as This is one of the most possible to reconsider the regulations with a view to the removal of the objectionable features. young people a chance. wish at this stage to enter into a detailed discussion of the technical objections. T mention the matter to-night only because I believe that if , by public criticism, I I hope that the Commission will can strengthen the hands of the Minister in seeking another Conference to reconsider regulations that were so ' recently framed, 1 shall be doing some service to the community, and giving the Minister some assistance in a difficult situation. No responsibility for the regulations rests upon him, but mistakes have been made, and it is desirable that the representatives of the wireless associationsi n the different States should be called together to frankly and fully discuss the whole matter. Wireless telegraphy and telephony are one of the great developments of the day, and will be greater in the future, and we cannot afford to start our system of control upon a false basis. I know that the honourable member for Kalgoorlie intends to deal at length with the subject of lighthouses at a later stage, and as I have no desire to steal his thunder, my reference to the subject will be brief.

157,Mr Mann,"I agree, but I do notparamount importance. When I first came to Melbourne to take my seat in this House, being much impressed with £b«j need for further lighting on the West Australian coast, .1 inquired why more lighthouses were not being provided. I discovered that a systematic programme of construction had been carried out on the Queensland coast, and that a large number of new lights had been installed. 1 do not object to that, because 1 recognise tliat the Queensland section of the coast is probably that which most demanded lighting, but that protection having been afforded to shipping, tliere is no reason why some effort should not be made to improve the lighting on that other great stretch of coast line along months' Supply. I suppose all honourable the west of the continent. formed that one 'of the obstacles to the carrying out of such work was that if more lighthouses were built, the Department would not have the necessary steamers to visit the lights. I am very glad, therefore, to see on the Estimates an amount which I understand is to be applied to the construction of two additional lighthouse steamers, which will enable a further programme of . lighthouse construction to be put in hand. From what I can gather, however, even this shipbuilding programme is insufficient to permit of proper control of the whole lighthouse system on the Australian coast, and at least one more steamer should be built. On a previous occasion I spoke to the Minister for Trade and Customs in regard to this matter, and I impressed upon him most strongly my view that there should not be undue parsimony in regard to lighthouses. If his advisors say that another ship should be built that advice should be followed, becauso nothing is more important to life, shipping, and trade than the proper lighting of our coast. I apologize to the Committee for the length of my remarks. I hope that this discussion will not be regarded as critical, but rather as an endeavour on the part of honourable members, by viewing matters from different points of view, to assist the Government to handle some of the tasks which confront them. 0 Mr O'KEEFE (Denison) [9.15] I propose to strike a note which has not been sounded very much in this debate. Before doing so, I congratulate the Treasurer on having brought down the Budget much earlier than has been customary during our twenty-three years of Federal parliamentary life. I have been a close student of Federal politics, and I cannot remember an occasion on which the Budget was brought down so soon after thf close of the financial 3 ear, nor can I T remember an attempt to pass tooth the Budget and the Estimates through the Parliament within a few days of their presentation to honourable members. I do not like to look for ulterior' motives in this exceptional experience, but I am inclined to think that it suits the present Government to try to rush through these Estimates so that it may have twelve I was inmembers have noticed the figures in the Budget with respect to exports and. imports. Australian imports have increased enormously in the last few years. That is not an unmixed blessing for the people of this country, nor is it an unmixed blessing that we have an accrued surplus of £7,500,000. I cannot ' congratulate; the Treasurer upon the proposed allocation of that surplus. Most honourable members will agree with the proposal to redeem £2,500,000 of the national debt by taking up bonds, but surely we cannot agree that there is need to place £2,500,000 in reserve for expenditure on defence. I do not think that it will be necessary for this country to spend this money in the present financial year. It is unnecessary to set aside £2,500,000 of the surplus to meet taxation emergencies that may arise. The agreement which the Treasurer is seeking to make with the Treasurers of the various States will nob be a good thing for Australia, in my opinion. I do not look with any degree of pleasure upon the enormous revenue we have obtained from imports, because it means that Australian industries and Australian workmen have been adversely affected. The right honourable member for Flinders( Mr Bruce), who was Treasurer last year, estimated that we would receive a certain amount in Customs revenue. His estimate of revenue has been exceeded by £5,152,000. More than £5,000,000 of that sum has come from import duties. That means that the imports into Australia have been far too heavy for the good",53,Chapman No T Neces State And Commonwealth Taxation

They w ill find that duty on imported stimulants gave us a revenue of £2,294,264. The estimated income for this year under that heading is £2,100,000. I do not see that we can object to the estimate, because we do not manufacture many stimulants in Australia. We havo many natural resources and facilities for so doing, and I believe that if we were to bring a few skilled workmen from the other side of the world we would be able to manufacture stimulants equally as good as those which we now import. The next items given on page 13 of the Budget statement are narcotics, sugar (not including glucose), and agricultural products and groceries. I have no remarks to make on those items. Our revenue from duties on apparel and textiles last year was £5,825,461. We estimate that we will receive £5,250,000 under that beading this year. could manufacture at least half the material that that duty represents. metals and machinery we received duty amounting to £3,732,677. The .estimated receipts for this year are £3,310,000. Oils, paints, and varnishes are the next item on the list. I do not suppose we can manufacture much more of those articles than we are doing at present. The revenue from duty on amounted to £557,000 last year. This year we expect to receive £475,000. In Australia we have every class of clay necessary for manufacturing the earthenware which the Australian people require. I do not know why we cannot manufacture a greater proportion of these requirements than we are doing at present. We must have imported an enormous quantity of earthenware goods to have obtained £557,000 in duty. The revenue in duty on wood-wicker work and cane amounted io £1,054,000, and we estimate that £790,000 w ill be received in such revenue this year. Doesi t ever strike people who buy cheap wicker work and wood work that the articles they purchase are manufactured in the cheapest labour countries of the world ? Honourable members have only to look up the details respecting these imports to ascertain that that is so. Tho duty on leather and rubber imports was £1,131,572. That is f a r greater than should be necessary. If we had a proper I recomTariff we could build up our leather' and rubber industries. D u ty on paper and stationery yielded us £746,906 last year. The latest expert investigation into the possibilities of manufacturing paper in Australia has shown that we have suitable wood to manufacture nearly every kind of paper. This heavy influx of i m . ports means that Australian industry is being seriously hampered, and that Australian men and women are unemployed. I would rather see a few million pounds spent to encourage Australian industry and give employment to good Australian workmen than see Australian money spent to pay low wages in the cheap-labour countries of the world. If we allowed for an average duty of 20 per cent, on all thc imports which come into Australia it would be found that the value of the goods so imported would be about £70,000,000. If we could so arrange our fiscal policy that industries could be started locally, and that thoso. already I believe we established could be encouraged to extend their operations to such a degree that From half the goods represented by that £70,000,000 could be manufactured in Australia, it would mean tremendous progress for this country. It would mean, also, that thousands , of good Australian workmen would have full-time employment at good wages. Instead of the Goearthenware vernment adopting a policy that w ill tendto that end, they have brought before us a proposal to remit altogther the duty' on sulphur. The result of that w ill be that several struggling Australian industries may cease operations. I trust that this Committee w ill not agree to the remission of the duty on sulphur. Possibly, such a. remission w ill suit the members of the Country party, because they think it w ill cheapen the price of fertilizers. We all know that sulphuric acid is largely used in the manufacture of fertilizers, but there are two or three places in Australia which could supply all the sulphuric acid that is needed for fertilizers at a reasonable price, if we refused to remit this duty. To do so would, perhaps, mean an increase of a few pence per acre in the cost of production to the primary producer. It would also mean that the manufacture of our fertilizers would be a purely Australian industry. I speak feelingly on this subject, because a very big industry which is about to start in Tasmania w ill be seriously affected if the duty on sulphur is remitted. I do not know whether the promoters of that industry w ill be prepared to go on at all in view of the announced atteution of the Government. It would be f a r better for the farmers to pay slightly more for their fertilizers, and so make possible an Australian industry, than for them to demand the remission of the duty on sulphur. I appeal to the members of the Country party who are supporting the Government to use a little more common sense on this matter, and also in respect of the Commonwealth Shipping Line. It would be to the advantage of Australia"" for our own ships to carry our own products to our own people. I would like to see the words "" Madei n Australia "" written up on hoardings all over the country. Surely that should be the surest passport to the pockets of our people. There is too great a craze for imported goods. We have not as effective a Tariff to-day as we had when that great Australian, Charles Cameron Kingston, first stood at this table and fought his long battle, extending over a period of eighteen months, for the first Australian T a r if f. He was one of the greatest men Australia has produced, and he carried that Tariff, despite the opposition of the strongest Free Traders, who had been gathered from the four corners of Australia to the first Federal Parliament. As a young Australian, I could not help admiring the g r it with which he stuck to his task. of imports coming in to-day. Mr O'KEEFE -That is so. So long as that continues, we cannot say that Protection <s the settled policy of the country, or that we are doing what we can and should do to build up new industries and properly encourage existing industries. porters of the Government call themselves Protectionists, and on that policy they went to the country at the last election. Country party members are generally good Protectionists when they have anything to sell, but when they have to buy they are good Free Traders. This Budget demonstrates plainly that the volume of imports is growing. greatly in excess of the exports. Mr O'KEEFE -That is so. We should get out of .the old r u t and t r y to initiate a bold policy of development. The honourable member for South Sydney( Mr E. Riley) this afternoon recommended the Government to spend portion of the £2,500,000, which it intends to utilize in making taxation adjustments, in developing the Northern Territory. I have not been through the Territory, but I hope to have the pleasure of going through it before long. I understand that the Government intends to make arrangements for a chosen number of members of this Parliament to gothrough the Northern Territory, when the House rises, spend a few weeks there, and make themselves personally acquainted with its resources. I believe it is to be a party limited in number. It would be well, in the interests of the country, if the Government made arrangements for the visit of any honourable member who was prepared to put up with the discomforts of the t r ip in order that he might gain at first hand the knowledge which honourable members must have in order to legislate properly in the interests of the Territory. Big questions will require to be threshed out relating to the Northern Territory, and the information gained on such a trip would be invaluable to honourable members. I am told by some honourable members, who have seen the fringe of the Territory, and by some residents of Australia who have been in ' the Macdonnell Ranges and Alice Springs districts, that there is a tremendous area that is known to be mineral-bearing. Those who have had close association with the mineral fields of Australia know that the opening up of a big mining field works wonders. Some persons say that the Northern Territory to-day is a desert. If that is the case, the opening up of one big mine would make the desert "" blossom as the rose.""' It has been said that Kalgoorlie The majority of the supat one time was a desert. I went to K a l goorlie in 1905, when it had reached the zenith of its prosperity.

On the west coast, silver-lead was discovered shortly after the BrokenH ill mines had proved their great richness; and because of that one small discovery by a couple of intrepid prospectors, who burst their way through an almost impenetrable scrub, within a year or two Tasmania was more prosperous than it had ever previously heen in its history. Thousands of people flocked there from all over Australia, taking with them money with which to open up the mines. Many were wild-cat ventures, while others proved to be payable concerns. greatest factor in opening up the .Northern Territory. Mr O'KEEFE I agree with the honourable member. I have seen mining in -most parts of Australia. I went to Chillagoe, in Northern Queensland, when the boom was on. It did not turn out as well as we hoped and expected, but a tremendous amount of employment was provided. Mining has done more than auy other industry to open up new country. When we develop those portions of the Northern Territory which have been declared by mineralogists and geological experts to be suitable for the deposition of minerals, the Northern Territory will come into its own. We offer a bounty for the discovery of liquid oil. That is a good thing. But why not also offer a bounty for the discovery of payable gold, tin, copper, and lead fields? The wanning of those metals would provide emmembers opposite increase the pension ployment and open up new country. I when they had the opportunity f do not think there is in the Budget any proposal to grant a bounty on the production of cotton and coffee. We have been told by those who have seen cotton and coffee grown in other parts of the world, that very many portions of the Northern Territory are suitable for their production. Instead of hoarding up £2,500,000 against a possible emergency, we should devote a little of it to an attempt to develop that great heritage which has been handed over to us for good or Very nearly half of that for evil. If the Territory contains the possibilities which many people believe it to contain, let us try to bring them to light. I have a distinct recollection of I desire to discuss briefly a matter of enormous importance to a numerically large section of the people of Australia -the payment of pensions. Listening this afternoon to the speech delivered by the honourable member for Boothby( Mr Duncan-Hughes) I said to myself, "" Thank God, for the sake of humanity and the future of Australia, there are not many members of Parliament like the honourable member!"" He has as much right to his opinion as I have to mine; but it is a fortunate thing for the people of Australia that thero are not many honourable members who hold his opinions. Not only was he opposed to the increase which the Government propose, but he the did not think any pensions should be granted; he wanted to make it a charity dole. It is all very well for -a gentleman of his type, who has been ""born in the purple,"" and sent into the world "" with a silver spoon in his mouth,"" to forget the hardships of the pioneers who built up the country to the position it occupies to-day. The pension is not a charity to the men and women who have made Australia, and for whom honourable mem-. bers on this side are trying to secure a little extra assistance. The old-age and invalid pensions are the work of the Labour party. It is often said it was not the Labour party that introduced the Old-age and Invalid Pensions Act; but it was the Labour party who put the pistol to the then Prime Minister's head and told him that the Government had delayed long' enough and must give the pensions or go out of office.",56,Chapman No T Neces State And Commonwealth Taxation
162,Mr Charlton,Mining will be,57,Chapman No T Neces State And Commonwealth Taxation
163,Mr Lister,"Why did not honorableMrO ' KEEFE portunity to do so to-day than we ever had before. W ill honourable members opposite agree to increase the old-age pension in the way we have proposed ? If we can securei the support of the honourable member for Corio( Mr Lister) and other honourable members on the other side, the old-age pension will be increased from lbs. to £ 1 per week. I should like to say here that I have always maintained that our pension system is not complete. There is still a section of the community that suffers not the less severely because it suffers in silence. I refer to widows with young children dependent upon them. Our pension system, w ill never be complete as a humanitarian system u n t i l we provide pensions for widows with young children dependent upon them. For many years I have made the granting of these pensions one of the dreams of my political life, and I hope to see it realized before my retirement from political life. It is a dead certainty that such pensions will be granted if the party on this side are returned to power. It is remarkable that all these things first advocated by the Labour party, in side and outside Parliament in Australia, have been bitterly opposed in the State and Federal Parliaments by all opposed to Labour, and yet one by one they have been taken up, at least in part, by those who previously opposed them. So that even if there is not shortly' a change of Government in the Commonwealth, I believe we shall still see widows' pensions added to the pensions now paid. Zealand was the first of the British Dominions to establish widows' pensions. Since the Act to provide for them was introduced in New Zealand, I have followed the matter up. I have here the twenty-fifth annual report of the Pensions Department of New Zealand. They have had in that Dominion an old-age pension system from the time of that great man "" Dick"" Seddon. the widows' pension was added to their pension scheme, and by reference to what has been done in New Zealandi n this direction it can be shown , that we can well afford the institution of these pensions'in the Commonwealth. The cost of the New Zealand widows' pension scheme has naturally increased a little every year., I find from this last report of the Pensions Department that on the 31st March, 1923, the number of widows in receipt of We have a better oppensions was 3,411, and the number of children 9,693. In the Dominion a widow l e f t with young children entirely dependent upon her, instead of having to look for assistance to the cold charity of the world-and we all know how cold it can be sometimes-is given the r,ight to a pension for herself and her children. The Parliament of. New Zealand decided that it was better in the interest's of the count r y that the widow and her littl e dependent kiddies should be given a certain amount per week than that the youngsters should be l e f t entirely untended whilst the mother went out to earn bread for-them. D r . EARLE PAGE -What is the amount of the pension in New Zealand? Mr O'KEEFE -The amount of the weekly pension at first paid was 10s. for the widow and 2s. 6d. for each child. I am. not certain of the amount of the pension paid to-day. The total cost of widows' and children's pensions in Now Zealand for the year covered by the report fro m which I quote was £188,000, or 2s. l i d . per head of the white population of the Dominion. The population of New Zealand is .1,305,000, and as we have in Australia a population of 5,346,000, according to our last census, the cost of these pensions on the same scale as in New Zealand would amount to about four times the cost in that Dominion, or, speaking roughly., to about £750,000. If the Treasurer has £2,500,000 which he can hold against future taxation contingencies New and another £2,500,000 for defence works, I say that it would be better, in the name of common humanity, to use half of the £2,500,000 proposed to be held against future taxation contingencies and to in stitute widows and children's pensions in Australia straight away. I am quite satisfied that we have the constitutional power to do this. Some doubt was raised In 1913 on the question some years ago, but if we have the power to grant a maternity allowance, we certainly have the power to grant pensions to widows. It would be well for the Treasurer to apply £750,000 out of the £2,500,000 he is going to hold against possible contingencies in taxation, which may never arise, tb the establishment of widows and children's pensions. I do not believe in hoarding up money if a good use can be found for it . The payment of pensions to widows having youna children dependent on them would be a sound economic policy for the Commonwealth to adopt. It would be a very good thing for Australia that we should rear good citizens, sound in mind, and body. Those of us who make it their business to visit the slums of Australia see youngsters poorly clad and half starved, playing in the gutters, because their mothers have to go out to earn a few shillings after the bread-winner of the family has been taken away. I need not remind bonorable members opposite of these things. They know them as well as we do. I am sure their hearts are in the right place, and that they do not desire the continuance of such conditions. When one looks at these widowed mothers the story of their daily lives is written in their faces. It would be a splendid thing if, by the expenditure of a few hundreds of thousands of pounds, we could raise the children of these poor women to be good, healthy citizens instead of having to look forward to them helping to fill the gaols of the country, as, without assistance, some of them may do. allowance paid in most of the States. Mr O'KEEFE -That is so. In Tasmania, a poor widow with two or three children who may be starving can go to the Government for some assistance. She should not have to ask for assistance as a charity, but should be entitled to it as a right. The old men and women who built up the prosperity of this country, and whose labours have enabled many people to-day to make big fortunes and to ride about in motor cars, do not ask for charity, but they are able to go every fortnight to the nearest post-office to get their pensions. widows with young children dependent on them should enjoy as well as old-age pensioners. I suppose that in nine cases out of ten these widows have a good deal of pride about them, and they do not care to go to a Government official and ask for relief. We should give them the right to lolief as a part of our pension system, and we should do so without any delay. member give us his views as to the kind of Royal Commission that should be appointed ? Mr O'KEEFE I would rather sec iiu Royal Commission appointed in connection with this matter. I would prefer the Government to h.'ive the courage to grasp the nettle, if it is a nettle, and declare its policy. of grasping a nettle, but of rectifying anomalies, and including the matters to ' which the honourable member has referred in an up-to-date scheme. Mr O'KEEFE -My experience of Royal Commissions has been a very sad one. When a big question, with all its ramifications, is referred for inquiry by a Royal Commission, the Commission commonly thinks it necessary to travel to the four corners of the Commonwealtli at very great expense, to collate all the information it can obtain, and it may submit a report in two or three years' time. by a Royal Commission that really crystallized the present scheme of old-age pensions.. We want the system brought up to date. Mr O'KEEFE -If the Treasurei could get away from his Conservativp environment, or could persuade his fellow members of the Ministry, I believe he would be inclined to admit that attention to widows with young children dependent on them is a necessary addition to the existing pension scheme of the Commonwealth. I believe that all the information necessary for the purposeis in the hands of the Government today, or might be obtained from the State Governments, ancl, therefore, I see no necessity for an inquiry by a Royal Commission. I believe the Government could, within a few weeks, obtain all the information necessary to enable them, to This is a right which bring down a comprehensive scheme for unemployment and sickness insurance, and the different classes of pensions which honourable members On this side contend should be provided for. I wish now to refer to another matter of vital importance. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) yesterday asked the Prime Minister whether he had seen some references by the Director of Immigration in Launceston to the class of immigrants that are being brought to Tasmania. Only last Friday evening the Sun published the following:Speaking at a meeting of Now Settlers' League last niffht, tlie Tasmanian Director of Immigration (Major B.

167,Dr. Eable Page,"It was an inquiryaltogether sixty immigrants had arrived in Tasmania since April, and there were twelve on the way. He would have to place them, of course, but had cabled to Australia House asking the oflicials not to send any more immigrants until advised by him to do so. He liad done that because Australia House had not been using very great discretion in the selection of immigrants. The last two batches had not been of the most desirable type. They were not tbe kind Australia wanted.. Some were cockneys and others came from pitheads. He certainly would not care to have them in his own home. I do not know that Major Simpson need have used the term "" Cockneys,"" that large numbers of good citizens came originally If the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr West) is a ""Cockney,"" believe him to be, we could do very well with many more of his stamp. the Government Major Simpson really made that statement, and whether, of course, it absolutely represents the facts. week the honourable member for Gwydir( Mr Cunningham) the Daily Guardian of Sydney, a shocking state of affairs in the case of the Ballarat contingent Some honourable posed to discount the statements, the honourable pointed out, and quite truly, that he was uot reading the words of Captain welfare officer on board the vessel. again, it is the duty of the to ascertain whether son made those statements, and whether they were justified. ing that these allegations from all parts of Australia, and in various are not all untrue; on the contrary, I am strongly of opinion that a large proportion of the immigrants are not of a class either required or desired in Many of them are of the kind who are quite ready, not to go on the land, but to push others already here out of jobs. I have met quite a number of immigrants who have come to Tasmania in the last year or two, and I say quite frankly that they are not of the stamp we should get in return for ari expenditure, in this year alone, of £5,500,000. But whether they are desirable or otherwise, it is nothing suicide, to spend such enormous sums of money in bringing thousands of people Mr O'Keefe. here only to displace others already in Australia. There can be no doubt that many of these unfortunate immigrants w ill be compelled to undersell their brothers and sisters in the labour market. The unemployment evil is very intense, but the National Government regards the matter as one for the States, and w ill not give a contribution of £100,000 to relieve the distress, although it is prepared to spend millions in bringing unnecessary and unwanted people to Australia.

If the per capita system is abolished, Tasmania will have to face a deficit, and the burden will not be placed on the shoulders of those best able to bear it , but on the shoulders of those who are least able. Any legislation providing that people must pay taxation according to their means would have no chance in the Legislative Council of Tasshort of national mania. Yesterday the Prime Minister announced that the Government was going to appoint a Royal Commission to inquire",59,Chapman No T Neces State And Commonwealth Taxation
168,Seeing Mr Listeb,"This Parliament hasinto certain allegations regarding . some sugar deals. He reminded the House that the matter was sub judice, and I certainly do not intend to discuss it . All I desire is an assurance that the inquiry will be held with open doors. opening of the session we were told that certain phases of the War Service Homes administration were to be investigated; but since then we have heard nothing of the matter. I hope that the Government will investigate not only those certain phases, but any others that the Public Accounts Committee might have reason to regard as rather shady. The previous investigation by the Public Accounts Committee was held in private, because, as I am informed, a majority of the members was against the open door. Surely we have not reached a stage in this country when members of a Committee of the kind desire to hide facts from the public? It ought to be laid down by Parliament that all Committees, select or otherwise, and all Royal Commissions, shall meet in public. The people who "" pay the piper"" ought to be allowed to "" call the tune "" ; that is, the taxpayers ought to know who have been robbing them. they would be startled. Mr O'KEEFE -We hear that statement often, and wo know that it is true. If the people knew what the members of the Publio Accounts Committee know, but what the majority of the Committee would uot allow to be made public, they would commence to sit up and take notice. Therefore, I hope that in future all inquiries will bo conducted with open doors. I congratulate the Postmaster-General( Mr Gibson) on an innovation which, I believe, will be a considerable convenience to a large number of business people. I refer to the decision to allow telegrams to be telephoned to the addressees. In the past that has been done at times, but only as a personal favour; in future it is to be the regular practice. I ask the Postmaster-General to win further credit for himself by removing the stigma of hypocrisy that rests upon' this Parliament, by reason of the law compelling the institution known as Tattersall's to collect the Federal taxation on the prizes won in lotteries, although under the Postal Act the delivery of letters to the office of Tattersall's is prohibited. Of course, the Federal Constitution does not empower tlie Commonwealth to declare gambling in any form illegal, but the Postal Act allows the Postmaster-General to decline to deliver correspondence to any institution which he believes to be engaged in gambling. Each State has its own A t the gambling laws. The State of Tasmania declares Tattersall's and the totalizator legal, and the bookmaker illegal. Victoria declares the bookmaker fypgal and the totalizator illegal. Western Australiau laws sanction both the totalizator and the bookmaker. In New South Wales the bookmaker only was legal for some years, but now bookmaker and totalizator operate side by side. In South Australia the totalizator is legalized, but not the bookmaker. These variations show that' gambling is a matter to be controlled by the States; but this Parliament, having no constitutional power to declare 'Tattersall's an illegal institution, did its best to crush it by means of the Postal Act. No Postmaster-General would dare to declare the residence or office of a big bookmaker 'in Victoria or New South Wales a prohibited address within the meaning of the Postal Act, but this Parliament sought by similar means to stamp out Tattersall's lotteries. Its hypocrisy was If they knew the facts aggravated when it imposed income taxation upon prize money won from Tattersall's, and made Tattersall's collect the tax. That action was childish and absurd, and I recommend the Postmaster General to clear this Parliament of the accusation of hypocrisy by introducing an' amending Postal Bill to remove that embargo upon, correspondence addressed to Tattersall's. I did not take part in the very able debate on the Imperial Conferences, but I listened to it with great interest, and I may be pardoned if I express the opinion that the best speeches were made by honourable members on this side. We have arrived at rather a peculiar stage in Parliamentary government, when Parliament is asked to sit unreasonable hours and transact business in a hurry in order to allow the Prime Minister to represent Australia at Imperial Conferences. If it is necessary that the Prime Minister should represent Australia at the Conference-and he considers it is necessary-surel y his obvious duty, if he cannot trust Parliament to remain in session during his absence, was to call it together two or three months earlier. He did not do so., and,",60,Chapman No T Neces State And Commonwealth Taxation
169,Mr Makin,"tlierefore, Parliament is to be closed in a fortnight in order that the right honourable gentleman may leave for London towards the end of this month. The Prime Minister told the House that he will net commit Australia to a large expenditure on defence without submitting the proposals to this Parliament. cisions of the Imperial Conference will be submitted to this Conference.

Are they to be. fulfilled? About 5,000 ex-officers are still seeking work, 100,000 wholly or partially disabled ex-service men are still forced to look to charity to supplement their exiguous pensions, and 400,000 capable of work are unable to obtain it.

Notwithstanding the war pensions, very many dependants of soldiers are not receiving from Australia the treatment that was promised to them. When the banners were waving, the drums were beating, and great processions of soldiers were passing this building, the public said to the men about to depart, "" Go, and may you come back, but if you do not come back, we shall take care of your dependants."" Is'Great Britain honouring the promise to her soldiers? The answer is contained in Earl Haig's testimony. Men who were patriotic and rushed to the Fronti n defence of their country, or who responded to the call of adventure, may now, when the war is over, do as they did before-ge t a crust as best they can. That is the position in Australia. One of the saddest sights in our big cities ana throughout the country is that of limbless I do not believe that men going about looking for some way in which to earn a shilling. Earl Haig's statement continued: The conference of experts on tbe question of I believe that by disabled ex-service men, which has been sitting at the International Labour Office at Geneva, has concluded. It decided that employment should be found by the employment Honourable memexchanges for disabled men, and that the disability pension should not affect the wages paid, which should be equal to those current for uninjured workers. The Australian soldiers were promised something like that; the promise is not being fulfilled . The Treasurer could employ' some of his surplus money in relieving the distress of limbless and disabled soldiers who are searching for work and are not able to find it . If we made some of that surplus money available to relieve such distress, we should worthily f u l f i l our function as a National Parliament, and we should be doing much better than we shall do if we hoard up this £5,000,000 for possible emergencies in taxation and for defence expenditure which may never be required.

I shall deal with the extraordinary attitude that has been adopted by the Government, and by our doctor-Treasurer, in cutting down the expenditure of the Public Health Department by about £1,000.

In the financial year, 1922-23, the Public Health Department spent A r e we doing that? £122,915, but for the present year only",61,Chapman No T Neces State And Commonwealth Taxation

171,Mr Blakeley (Darling ) [10.33],"£121,986 is allowed. It is a reflection on this Parliament that out of an estimated expenditure of £61,000,000 only £121,986 is allowed the Public Health Department. A certain section of this House has endeavoured to make this a live Department, but so f a r we have not succeeded. It is now our "".Cinderella Department."" concerns no one, and the duty of looking after it is tacked on to the duties to be discharged by the Ministerf or Trade and Customs. He is given tbe title of Minister for Health, b u t we expect nothing from him because of the way in which the Department has been treated in the past. From the time. I entered this HouseI have endeavoured to direct the attention of honourable members to the serious position of this country with respect to disease, and to our extremely high mortality. Many thousands of deaths which occur annually in Australia could be prevented. The Commonwealth Department of Health has co-operated in some respects with the Health Departments of the various States, but owing to the indifference of the Commonwealth Government nothing of a concrete or lasting nature has been achieved. Health matters are essentially national matters. germs of small-pox, tuberculosis, cancer, and many other diseases which ravage Australia to-day know nothing about State boundaries. While we propose to spend millions of pounds to bring people from other parts of the world to Australia, we are allowing thousands of our children to die every year. In some in stances they are dying because a sufficiency of nourishing food is not available to them. In other cases they are dying from preventable diseases. altogether blame the unfortunate parents of some of these children. lack of education, and the social environments themselves, are such that, we cannot expect them to do very much more than they are doing to care for their children. Obviously and palpably, the duty of caring for the health of these children should be assumed by the State. Health Department has certain objectives, but so far as I can see no attempt is being made to reach the objectives. is no good as a treatment for cancer, tuberculosis, and venereal diseases. The objectives of the Commonwealth Department of Public Health include co-operation with the Statesi n treating small-pox, venereal diseases, and diseases which come w it h in the scope of the quarantine regulations. The Department also aims to investigate It diseases, and to establish laboratories for the manufacture of serum and vaccines. Excellent work is being done in the laboratory which has been established. .1 believe it manufactures hundreds of different types of vaccine and serum. The collection of data w i th respect to health matters is another objective of the Departmeut. We have established an In stitute of Medicinei n the north which is doing valuable research work with regard to the hook worm and other tropical diseases which play havoc with our white population. The quarantine administration absorbs most of the money we set aside for health purposes. It is a distinct reflection upon this Parliament, and especially upon this Government, that only £121,000 is provided for the Health Department. When'the honourable member for Cowper( D r . Earle Page) came The into this House, we expected that, w it h his special knowledge and training, he would be able to render valuable help in dealing w i th health matters. He did so until he became a Minister. Now that he is in a position to help this Department more than formerly, he has failed to do it . His first Budget provides for a reduction of nearly £1,000 in public health expenditure. It is deplorable and, in my view, a tragedy, that the Treasurer should suggest such a reduction to this We cannot Committee. This is a depressing subject to speak on, and a depressing subject to Their listen to; but we should give close attention to it , because too much preventable in which they find mortality and too much preventable disease occur in Australia. The deaths from cancer in Australia in 1921, the last year for which I could obtain figures,' totalled 4,768. The number of such deaths is rapidly increasing annually. In 1915, Our the death rate from, cancer was 74 per 100,000 of the population. In 1921, it was 87 per 100,000 of the population. We cannot regard indifferently that increase Political window-dressing of 13 per 100,000. Australia is doing nothing in cancer research. TheB r it i sh Government is doing exceedingly 2352 valuable work, and the German, Erench, Austrian, and American Governments are all carrying out useful research work. Australia is remiss in her duty in this regard. I know of no Government in Australia which is spending a penny on cancer research. The Commonwealth Government has done a certain amount of work for the tubercular soldiers; but, with the exception of having assisted in the establishment of a sanatorium at Bendigo, nothing has been done for the general public. In 1921, there were 3,687 deaths in Australia from tuberculosis. tunately, the death rate from this disease has fallen. In 1915, the death rate was 71 per 100,000 of the population; and in 1921 it was 68 per 100,000. The Commonwealth Government has no legislation in operation to prevent "" quacks"" from, treating cancer, tuberculosis, or venereal diseases. We still have Chinese and Japanese herbalists, and all kinds of quacks, selling nostrums and obtaining the people's money for them. voyants. be found in the community. I have here a fair example of the type of advertisement which appears in most of the country newspapers of New South Wales and Victoria. the newspapers of other States. lieve that these advertisements constitute an evasion of the law dealing with misleading advertisements.

Not only are there such persons as that, but chemists evade the law by pretending to be able to cure many diseases to which the human flesh is heir. The question of venereal disease is just as important as that of tuberculosis and cancer. As the result of the negotiations which took place between the Commonwealth and State Governments many years ago, the States agreed to pass certain legislation of a more or less uniform character to deal with venereal diseases. On that underForstanding the Commonwealth Government agreed to subsidize the States up to a certain point. Victoria is particularly interesting, inasmuch as it has gone further than most of the States, though not so far as Western Australia. The Victorian Act provides for compulsory notification, by a number; the patient is not notified by name unless he ceases to undergo treatment, in which case the doctor reports to the Chief Medical Oflicer, quoting the number under which the case was reported in the first place. Extraordinary' work has been done under this Act, proving to the satisfaction of those who are administering it that if the different States and the. Commonwealth tackled the venereal diseases problem seriously their incidence could be materially reduced. The ComI t may appear also in monwealth pays invalid pensions. While I beone is not in a position to give an idea of the expenditure which this disease has rendered necessary, it must be very high ; because there are not many diseases or malformations which are not, in some way or other, connected with venereal disease. The loss to the Commonwealth in that direction, and to the State by reason of the taking away of a wealth-producing unit, is so great that it would pay over and over again if the Commonwealth took those measures which have been indicated from time to time by the medical men of Australia. I refer particularly to Sir James Barrett, a gentleman who has long been keenly interested in venereal diseases; Dr.* Cumpston, Dr. Bennie, Dr. Chubb, of Sydney; and the late Sir Herbert Maitland, who did very great work. The Australian section of the British Medical Association, at its conferences, from time The cases of syphilis and gonorrhoea",62,Chapman No T Neces State And Commonwealth Taxation

173,Mr Blakeley,"They also are totreated at the clinics under the Victorian Government system, have fallen from 7,988 to 4,948. It is estimated that practically the same number has been treated by private doctors. It is particularly in teresting to note that the cases of syphilis treated per annum have been reduced from 2,418, in 1918, to 1,380, for the year ended June, 1922. During the whole of that five-year period no fewer than 40,000 cases of venereal diseases were treated officially under the Victorian scheme, and undoubtedly a f u r t h e r 40,000 cases were treated by private doctors. In that time there have been only five cases of prosecution for non-notification or refusal to continue the treatment. The laxity of the administration and the very great necessity for amending the Act in order to tighten up the loose links are shown by the fact that for the five years ended June, 1923, 5,909 patients failed to continue the treatment; no fewer than 3,032 of whom have not been traced. Tbat discloses laxity, to a certain extent, first of all on die part of the medical practitioner in not having taken proper care to Bee that the right address was given. One can quite appreciate the fact that many. patients, because of a sense of delicacy, may neglect to give the proper address or w i l f u l l y mislead the authorities as to their place of residence, and possibly as to their correct names. Society is, to a great extent, responsible for the extraordinary mental attitude of tbe people generally towards these diseases. Until five of six years ago the newspapers rarely referred to them. When they did so, they called them the "" dread scourge."" a broadening of the mind, especially in onr press. The Melbourne Herald, on 87th J u l y and 31st J u l y last published two very informative articles which dealt w i th the problem as it should be dealt with-frankly , openly, hiding nothing. Victoria particularly is dealt with, and tbe great value of the clinic' system and tbe operation of the Venereal Diseases Act ie clearly shown. In a portion of one of the articles it is statedThe five years' experience discloses that thB Venereal Disease Aotft are in urgent nped of amendment. Above utl, the Acts require to be fenrleBsly administered. Department of Publio Health appears io allow sloppy sentimentality tn stand in the way nf prosecuting great numbers of persons who flagrantly violate tbe law. The work of the various aliuios seems vividly to emphasize the terrible menace of the evil, and should move thc Government to tbe strongest possible measures. I have just quoted figures showing that 5,909 patients failed to continue treatment, and that no fewer than 3,032 were never traced. Those 3,032 unfortunate people are at large, spreading the disease -mayb e accidentally, by means of barbers' towels and razors, drinking utensils, conveniences, cracked tea-cups, and all sorts of things Which a person may use in his daily l if e and which are all carriers of the disease. Every person suffering f r om that disease is a menace to society. Steps should be taken to insure that everything possible is done to combat the disease, and to see thab laxity does not continue. I ask leave to continue my remarks on another occasion. Progress reported. B ill returned from the Senate, with amendments.
