Trado and Customs, upon notice1. With regard to the Minister's previous reply to questions in relation to the loss of Date of Flotation. the Dorrigo,. is it a fact that the provisions of the Merchant Shipping Act of 1854 which cover the transfer ana sale of British ships refer mainly to preserving the rights, privileges and responsibilities attaching; to the registry of ships under the British nag, and do not prohibit colonial governments exercising due precautions' for the preservation of life and property at sea within the limits of those colonies 7 2.

In Committee of Supply: Department of Home and Territories, £7,000, agreed to. Proposed vote-£168,469 . suggest that at this stage the Minister for Defence should take honorahle memhers into his confidence regarding the expenditure of the departments under his control. Sir Ministerf o r Defence) [2.54] -When the bill providing for an appropriation for naval purposes was before the committee, I promised to give a detailed account of the Government's naval expenditure when the estimates were under consideration. The estimates now before the committee relate only to new works; but when tbe naval estimates are brought forward I shall keep my promise by making a f u l l statement on naval matters. Yesterday I asked the Ministerf o r Defence, upon notice, whether any amount bad been included in the estimates for carrying out the recommendation of the Public Works Committee to establish a naval training college for boys at Geelong. money had been placed on tbe estimates for that purpose. I look upon this as one of ' tbe most vital matters that has ever come before this Parliament. Minister informed the House yesterday that from the time the training ship Tingira was taken over by the Commonwealth in 1912, at a cost of £15,000, u n t i l the present date, over 2,800 bluejackets and other naval ratings had been trained on her, and drafted to the Royal Australian Navy. trained 1,000 ratings fbr our fleet, and in the last six months it has trained 71. Tbe condition of the ship, as disclosed by tbe committee's report, is almost deplorable, and it is time we closed it up and moved to a better and more up-to-date establishment on shore, which is considered by the admiralty as the better system. But where shall we move, in view of the fact that we have to find 400 new ratings for the ships that a.'e being built? Those new ratings bave to be intensively trained in signalling, gunnery, seamanship, and other branches of naval work. Boys spend twelve months on the Tingir a before tbey are sent on board a sea-going cruiser, or to special classes at Flinders Naval Base. Apparently that ship w ill continue as a training establishment during this and next year, and w ill then cease to function. The report presented by the Public Works Committee on the 3rd September, 1925, after an exhaustive consideration of the matter, statedconstruction of the buildings such as are proposed. With regard to Flinders Naval Base, it was reported that the creation of a boys' naval training establishment there would entail just as much cost for buildings as would Geelong, and in addition a considerable amount for clearing. Moreover, it offered the vital objection of mixing the boys and grown men. W it h that view I entirely agree. Paragraph 22 of the committee's report, which is their recommendation, readsWith this reservation as to title, the committee is satisfied from its investigation that an establishment of the class contemplated is necessary, and that Geelong offers an ideal site for its location; and recommends that when the land becomes Commonwealth property, necessary construction work be put in hand as early as possible. As no amount is placed on the Estimates The Minister replied that no for carrying out tbe committee's recommendations, tbe question asked tbe other day by tbe right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) arises, Tbe"" Where are we in this matter?"" There is an annual wastage of 200 in the personnel of our fleet. Where can boys be trained in that number? It is highly undesirable to mix boys and men at Flinders Naval Base. The Public Works Committee decided in favour of an establishment at Geelong. During tbe war, the ship The Tingira has been gathering in annually about 300 boys at a plastic age, and bas been a God-send to thousands of lads who wished to go into the navy. If a lad wishes to go into the navy, he may go either via the Jervis Bay Naval College or by the Tingira",17,Canned Fruits Export Control Bill

The. spiritual, as well as the material, side is essential in a fighting service like tlie Navy. We cannot do without the right' spirit.' Material knowledge,' though important, is less essential. I do not know whether the Minister for Defencef u l l y realizes' the high educa-. tional standard that is necessary to enable petty officers to attain commissioned rank. Now that the Tingir a is to be scrapped, I suppose that enlistments, say,. seventen years of age, w ill have three months' training at Flinders Naval Base, a quarter of which w ill be given to education, and after that they w ill go to sea. I ask, is it possible for a man to study mathematics, algebra, trigonometry, and physios on board a vessel at sea, and to qualify for commissioned rank? From considerable experience, I know that only in exceptional cases w ill that, be possible. Thus, in two or three years there will be no petty officers qualified to take commissioned rank. The Minister or the Naval Board may decide to extend the time for educational training at Flinders Naval Base; , but then the Minister w ill bave .difficulties to face when he goes to the Treasurer for money. 200 or 300 each year in the personnel of the fleet, the men have to be trained somewhere. have been rejected for training purposes, and the men will have to be trained at Flinders.

On the subject. of efficiency, I could' quote hundreds of ""our leading naval men. On. the. 17th "" December, , 1893, K in g Edward VII . , who knew as much about the Navy.as any of his admirals, wrote to Sir .Henry Ackland, who was at that time, I . believe, in the Ministry, and urged that every possible step should be taken tomaintain . tbe efficiency of the .Navy.

' The Ministerf o r Defence is, to., a certain extent, being politically bludgeoned by the Treasurer .1 understand the. situation perfectly I have no doubt that he requested the.

I am also well acquainted with the views of all our leading naval authorities on this question, and they believe that we should follow the example of tbe Admiralty, which, while effecting great economies, is nevertheless carrying on tbe wort of training boys for naval service. I give a warning to the Government as to the position to which it is drifting. the Treasurer with all the sincerity I possess to provide at least £20,000 for exa dissertation upon the benefit of placing penditure at Geelong this year, so that tbe scheme may be established. provision to that extent at least is made, a deadly blow will be' struck at the efficiency of the Royal Australian Trouble will be caused two or three years hence in regard to the efficient manning of the Pleet, and dire trouble should we be engaged ih hostilities.

We mustjregard naval training as being quite different from military training. In tbe Surely light of the statement that has been made, I feel constrained to ask what has become of the proud boast made at the time the Royal Australian Navy was established ? Surely, if it were considered necessary in those piping days of peace to set up our navy as a unit separate from the British Navy, it is necessary toIf there is a day that we should maintain it .

I should like to see our I bave no possible, or at least with men who have been imbibing the spirit of .the Australian nation from their earliest years. imbued with the Australian spirit. When the Minister says ""No through that school are. But the training required for the Navy is different from that needed by the Army. It has been said frequently that the Australia a can adapt himself to any circumstances, and that is probably why our soldiers gave such an excellent account of them-' selves as they did overseas. The remarks of the honourable member for Wentworth should carry considerable weight on account of his naval experience. I believe that the only way to get men of tbe right type is to catch boys when they are young. The Public Works Committee strongly recommended that the naval training I urge establishment should be located at Osborne House, Geelong. I need not enter into the establishment tbere, where there Unless are fine buildings and a large bluestone residence, capable of providing accommodation for hundreds of men. 1 Navy. do not even consider, it necessary to attempt to justify the expenditure of £20,000 that the honourable member for Wentworth suggested would be required to establish the training school there.

38,Mr Lister,"Yes; all who have gonetlie work were to be done precisely in accordance with the wishes of the department, no doubt £80,000 would bave to be expended, but I think that it could be carried out at considerably less cost. Tbe Treasurer should consider the matter from the point of view of the safety of the nation. If that were done, provision would be made for the immediate needs. Another item to which I desire to refer is the sum of £8,000 for new buildings for tbe naval air service. This amount is altogether inadequate for present requirements. Prominence has been given in the press to tbe recent inquiry into the circumstances of the fatal accident that occurred a fewdays ago to two airmen from the Point Cook flying school. It was stated in tbe evidence that little or no accommodation was provided for married men employed tbere, and the fact was elicited that one of the victims had to travel 60 miles daily to and from his home. If proper accommodation for married men is not available in the vicinity of their employment, tbe Government should take early steps to provide it . I hope that tbe Minister for Defence will be able to influence tbe Treasurer in tbe direction indicated by the honourable member for Wentworth, and that tbe sum necessary to provide for tbe immediate transfer of the men from tbe Tingira to Osborne House will be voted. I should like the Minister to furnish the committee with further information on this matter before a vote is taken. Why should the Tingira be removed from Sydney at all ? condition. be replaced by another vessel. It will prove very expensive to train tbe boys on land instead of on board ship, and some good reason should be given for tbe proposal. The honourable member for Wentworth mentioned the number of men who had been trained on the Tingira, and had risen to high positions. Those who are. now to be trained on shore will not bave similar opportunities to become officers. months' training on the Tingira is preferable to three months at Flinders base. is proposed to train tbe men for three months on shore, and then put them on a ship. I hope that the Minister will explain tbe position. The municipality of Bandwick is anxious about the decision that the Government has come to regarding the Bandwick rifle range. Becently the range was handed over to the State Government, but, much to the annoyance of the local council, the Commonwealth authorities have reserved a strip of land running through it. The council claims that this will spoil the proposed subdivision, and that plenty of land is available at tbe Long Bay range. It is claimed that the whole of the range at Bandwick should be transferred to the State. At the Long Bay range riflemen walk nearly a quarter of a mile before they reach the firsj; firing point, and it is thought that this land, whicb at present is lying idle, should be made available for building purposes. The Government should sell the land to those who desire to live at the seaside. The Bandwick .council and the various progress societies interested claim that the military, authorities should not monopolise land for whicb they have no use. I shall reserve what I bave to say about tbe Navy until I have heard the Minister's reply to the honourable member for Wentworth. in the Estimates two references to the equipment which was presented to the Commonwealth by the British Government, the estimated value of which, spealdng from memory, was at the time £2,000,000. A considerable time ago, I referred to tbe fact that a good deal of expense was being incurred to prevent depreciation in leather and other equipment comprised in the gift. A very considerable portion of the gift equipment is, no doubt, now out of date. Honourable members are aware, that the Commonwealth has incurred large expenditure in reconditioning gift aeroplanes which bad been allowed lo lie and rot for some time before any attempt was made to use them. I should like to know from the Minister what is the present"" position with regard to this gift equipment received from tbe British Government.

I should. like to know whether there are any difficulties in the way. of disposing of' it Sir NEVIL LE HOWSE (Calare-Min ister for Defence) [3.33] The honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Marks) has raised a question concerning training for the Navy. It is known to honourable members generally that the honourable member. bas had a great deal of experience in connection with the Navy, and any opinion he expresses on the matter is worthy of consideration. He is perfectly well aware that the matter to which he has referred has received the greatest consideration from the Ministerf o r Defence and his advisers, and reference to the estimates and to the naval construction policy of the Government will show that we are passing through an extraordinary period in the history of our nation. D u r in g a little over three years, the Government is proposing an expenditure of nearly £7,250,000 to give effect to its naval construction policy. It is also providing for something even more important, and that is the necessary personnel... Honourable members have referred to the human factor, and the psychology necessary for the training of lads for the Navy, and they will recognize that the human factor is of even greater importance than is the construction ' policy. Those who recall the work of our Navy during the late war w ill recognize that at the outset we owed the safety of our homes to the fact that we were so. extremely fortunate as to have the Australia in our home waters. H ad it not been for this, our ports would bave been exposed to shell fire, and our people to the grievous injuries which would possibly have resulted therefrom. The honourable member for Wentworth holds very definite views on the subject of the training of boys for the Navy. Buti t has been possible to provide means for necessary naval construction only by the adoption for tbe time being of an altered system of training. I do not think that tbe honourable member f u l l y appreciates mentality between the Australian and English youth. Whilsti t may be necessary in Great Britain to catch boys very young, fromfourteen to fifteen years of age for training for the Navy, I do not think . that the same necessity exists in this country. Our youth aTe better developed, far better educated, and are drawn from a higher social class, living under better economic conditions than, speaking generally, the boys who are trained for service in the navy in the Old Country. The whole matter is under serious consideration, but I propose taking boys for training at a later age, and although they w ill be sent to Flinders tbey will not be allowed to associate either at mess or during training with the older men-there. I believe that the course I propose will meet the situation From the reports presented to me by my advisers, I bave no hesitation in saying that.when between 1928 and 1929 our two modern cruisers, our modern sea-going submarines, and seaplane-carrier are completed the necessary personnel will be available to f u l ly man these vessels. What is more important, from my point of view, is that .over 90 per cent, of it will be Australian-born We want something more than an Australian Navyi n name. It must be composed of Australians, and will be entirely Australian when we are able to f ill the higher ranks with boys who have gone through the Jervis Bay Naval College. Boys who have passed through that college and proceeded to England on the completion of their studies there have proved themselves most efficient, and in their subsequent training in England have not only held their own, but in many cases have surpassed lads trained in England. I do not wish to boast about our country, but I say that at no time has there been such progress made in connection with its defence as there has been during the last two years. Whatever view we may hold concerning defence, we are all agreed as to the need for it u n t i l something is established to take its place. I hope that that will eventually be found in the development of the League of Nations; by the representation upon it of all countries in the world, and the exercise of its moral influence to prevent war in the distant future. We have not yet reached that day, and, in the meantime, it is our duty to be prepared to the difference in defend as effectively as possible this outpost of the Empire. The honourable member for Corio( Mr Lister) and the honourable member for Wentworth have referred to the Public Works Committee, a body for which we all have the greatest respect, and whose work has beeu of great value to the Parliament. Whilst respecting the opinion of that committee as much as any other member of the committee, I have a duty to perform irrespective of its recommendation. I have to consider all that is connected with defence, and to urge the Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page) to find the means to give effect to what I believe to be the policy most vital to retain an effective defence. But there is no member of the committee who does not clearly recognize that it is not possible for us to defend this country against the attack of an enemy in the Pacific. We might hold off such an attack and protect Australia from invasion until the British Navy could come to our assistance. This country with a population of only 6,000,000 could not afford the expenditure necessary for its complete protection. I estimate that an expenditure of not less than £50,000,000 a year would be necessary for the next ten years to provide a defence to wholly protect Australia against any attacks from other countries bordering on the Pacific. Fortunately, there appears to be no likelihood of war in the Pacific. We are living on most amicable terms with our neighbours, but we must be in a position to defend ourselves if called upon to do so. I regret very much the necessity of curtailing any portion of tbe navy establishment, but some curtailment has been necessary, and I assure honourable members that the matter of naval training has been given very grave consideration. My own view is that it w ill be possible at the end of 1928-29 to re-introduce the system of boy training if it should then be found advisable or necessary. view of the liberal way in wbicb the Treasurer has met my demands for expenditure, I am not disposed to force upon h i m expenditure that is not absolutely necessary. In answer to the honourable member B i l e y ) , I may be allowed to say that the department has adopted a very sympathetic attitude concerning rifle ranges and the interests of rifle associations. I shall look into the matter of the rifle range at Bandwick. has been asked by the State Governments to give up certain lands in its possession. Last year, after a great deal of pressure, it agreed to the transfer of fhe whole of the frontage to Oxford-street, Paddington, to the New South Wales Govern^ ment. remove the buildings upon that property. Sir NEVILLEHOWSE I have already informed the honourable member for South Sydney that it is not the Federal Government, but the State Government, that is holding up the work there. I have great hesitation in agreeing to give up land which, although it may not be required by the Defence Dfe^ partment to-day, possibly w ill be required for defence purposes within tbe next 100 years. honourable gentleman occupy then? force then! I have adopted is to refuse to alienate federal property in the possession of the Defence Department. I have been prepared, as I did in connection w i th a property in Western Australia, to lease it to the State Government for 99 years at a rental of Is. a year. If possible, I shall apply that principle at Bandwick. It is always difficult, however, to dispossess people once they have established even a partial claim to an area of land. One body to whom I gave a 99-years' lease sent me a very plausible letter, saying that the land had been converted into recreation grounds, and that my approval was taken for . granted, because, as Minister, for Health, 1 would Tn appreciate that the need for recreation was more urgent than tbe need for defence. Of course, public health and defence are interdependent, because, unless the community is healthy, it can neither develop nor defend its possessions. Honourable members, must agree that tbe for South Sydney( Mr E. estimates represent a considerable advance upon the provision made in previous years. They w ill observe also that almost the whole of the money is to be spent in Australia. My object is to strengthen tbe navy by f u l l y equipping The Government and efficiently maintaining the fleet which Parliament has authorized, so that, should the necesity for defending Australia arise, it may Worthily uphold tbe ANZAC tradition.",22,Neville Howse Calare George S Head Does Not Lend Itself To The

48,Sir Neville Howse,"The policything to sav about the accommodation at Point Cook? Sir regard to the fact that the coroner's inquest on the recent fatality is proceeding, and that the whole matter is sub judice, it would be better to allow it to remain in abeyance until I am able to make a complete statement upon the defence estimates. The amount provided in the Estimates for the civil aviation branch is £2,680, as compared with £4,200 last year. All honourable members, particularly the Minister for Defence, will agree that the proposed vote is a very small sum for such an important service. We all are agreed that Australia should be able to defend itself should the necessity arise; but, fortunately, as has been observed by several honourable members, so far as one can see ahead, this continent is in less danger of foreign aggression now than at any previous time in its history. Tbe war risk, apparently, belongs to tbe remote future, but the bread-and-butter needs of tbe people are of immediate concern. Therefore, I again draw the attention of the Minister, who, I know, is sympathetic, to the need for providing a larger sum for the development of civil aviation. I have on many previous occasions urged the Government to agree to the extension of the aerial mail service from Derby to Wyndham. At present the Western Australian airways extend from Fremantle to Derby, a distance of 1,600 miles, and it is desired that the service should cover a further distance of 472 miles to Wyndham. At one time tbe annual cost of a weekly service from Derby to Wyndham was estimated Mt £9,000 per annum, but, by the use of a smaller and more efficient type of aeroplane, that figure could be considerably reduced. Landing grounds were estimated to cost £3,200. Even those sums are small in comparison with the expenditure that has been incurred in tbe more thickly-populated parts of the continent. With the exception of Darwin, Wyndham is the most isolated settlement in Australia. It has a mail service every six weeks for eight months in the year, and for tbe remainder of the year a very irregular service, if any. Naturally, the Defence Department judges all civil aviation proposals in relation to their monwealth. The Commonwealth Government regards the development of the remote portions of the continent as mainly the concern of the States; but I submit that a sparsely-settled area like the Kimberleys constitutes a menace to tbe whole of Australia. This Parliament has acknowledged that fact by paying large bounties to the Queensland sugar industry in order to encourage the settlement of white population in the north of that State. Such a development is highly desirable in the interests of the nation, but the present policy is responsible for ill-balanced development. North of the Tropic of Capricorn there are 6,000 white people on the western side of the continent, as compared with 180,000 on the eastern side. If the danger from the north, which the honourable member for WentAvorth( Mr Marks) thinks be foresees, should prove real, the weak spot in our ramparts will be the north-west of Western Australia. If landing grounds were established and a regular civil aviation service were conducted . along the coast, our aviators would acquire training and local knowledge which would be of immense advantage in the event of Australia being embroiled with another nation. So far as the Commonwealth's interest in k is concerned, the north-west might as well be part of the Chinese empire. To-day Malay poachers from the Dutch islands are gathering trepang off the north-west coast, and are treating it by boiling plants ashore. They carry on their operations month in and month out, but never within 100 miles of the ordinary tracks of steamers. The only wealth that is being won from the Kimberley coast is being taken by aliens without let or hindrance by what is supposed to be a sovereign Commonwealth. Some time ago, a young pearler saw a Malay lugger at work off the north-west coast. He boarded the vessel and compelled the Malay skipper to sign the log with an admission that he was engaged in taking trepang from Australian waters. I brought the facts under the notice of the then Minister for Trade and Customs, and, for all tbe interest he showed in the matter, this theft of marine wealth might as well",24,Neville Howse Calare George S Head Does Not Lend Itself To The

The north-west coast is absolutely neglected by Commonwealth departments. happens up there is not any Federal.Minister's "" pigeon."" I am sure that the Minister for Health will recognize that an aerial mail and passenger service is of the utmost importance to the health as well as to the defence of the north-west. The pathetic death of Lady Campbell illustrates the conditions there. This lady resided, with her husband and three children, at Waterloo station. preparing to leave for Wyndham-16 4 miles distant-for her confinement when she suddenly became ill . A messenger was sent to Wyndham for a doctor, who set out at once on horseback, but arrived too late to save the life of the unfortunate woman. From the time the messenger left the station until the doctor arrived at the station eleven days elapsed. If the aeroplane service for which I am now pleading had been in operation two lives would haAe been saved. Surely the narr ration of this tragedy should be sufficient to convince the committee of the stern necessity for an aviation service in that distant part of the continent. Australia cannot afford to sacrifice tbe lives of people who are engaged in opening up the out-back areas. I confidently ask for the Minister's favorable consideration of tbe urgent request of the residents in the extreme north-west of tbe continent. On several previous occasions I bave brought under the notice of the Minister for Defence the need for the erection of an aerodrome at Rockhampton. It bas been estimated that the 74 acres required for the aerodrome would cost about £3,170, plus tbe cost of preparing tbe area-£330-^makin g a total of £3,500. The Minister, in commenting uppn that estimate, said, "" As such a considerable expenditure is involved, I regret that tbe funds available for civil aviation services will not permit of any further action at present."" An aerodrome at Rockhampton would be a tremendous aid to the development of civil aviation in Queensland. That city, which has a population of 26,000, is the chief city of-central Queensapprove of it. I bave not mentioned this land, and is the port of a very rich pastoral, agricultural, and mining area. The residents of the back-country about Longreach, Clermont, Springsure, Rolleston, Barcaldine, Blackall, Winton, and What Nebo would be served by the establishment of an aerodrome at Rockhampton, for they would be able to reach tbe city of Rockhampton by aeroplane. In the absence of an aerodrome at Rockhampton, it is impossible to develop civil aviation there. The only landing ground for an aeroplane is the race-course, on which there are so many obstacles that an aviator places bis life in jeopardy if She was be attempts to land there, although some have successfully done so. The people of Rockhampton want an aerodrome where any aeroplane may land safely. The cost of £3,500 should not daunt the Minister, because it is a mere bagatelle by comparison with expenditure incurred by the Government to provide much less-needed facilities. When proposals for the construction of new railways are being considered, the question Avhether they will pay is not the only one to be studied. Railways are often built merely to open up new country. If tbe residents of the western part of Queensland, who, at the present time, are suffering from the effects of a drought, are to enjoy some of the amenities of life such as are enjoyed in the large centres of civilization, the Government must spend this sum of £3,500 to provide the proposed aerodrome. That would make it possible for the people of the western parts to travel to Rockhampton by aeroplane. A number of aeroplanes are operating in tbe back country of Queensland, and are becoming increasingly popular. I am pleased to say that up to date tbere bas not been a serious accident with them. Tbe Civil Aviation Department bas been starved for funds. The expenditure in that department last year was approximately £131,000a truly niggardly amount for a great public department. I give the Minister for Defence credit for taking a live interest in .civil aviation; be bas been to tbe back blocks, and is aware of the disabilities of tbe settlers there. I hope that he will give to this. proposal the measure of sympathetic consideration that its importance warrants, and will matter during tbe last few months, because I bave been waiting until the Estimates were brought forward.",25,Neville Howse Havin G Influence Upon The Defence Of Tbe Com

Proposed vote-£10,380 . potato-growers of Australia' have during recent years suffered from a succession of unprofitable seasons. The year before last . they bad too good a crop, and potatoes were so abundant that in many places it was not profitable to dig and ' market them. Last year tbey had. a fairly good season, and this year the average yield is about 2 tons impute motives to any' one; to the acre, which will not compensate them for previous bad years. They receive little or no benefit from tbe protection policy of this country, although tbey are nearly all good protectionists. They grow a commodity for the sale of which they depend on' the home market. potatoes are exported from this country, and the growers bave unselfishly supported duties imposed with tbe object of establishing new industries. For many years they have contributed their quota to the establishment of other industries. may do well, but over tbe period of the last 30 years their business has not been a flourishing one.' With a yield of only 2 tons to the acre, following upon bad seasons, the market is now being deluged with importations from New Zealand. There are two grounds of objection to those importations. First, there is the dan-' ger of potato disease being introduced. I have read that 25 tons of New Zealand potatoes have been condemned in Melbourne, and some time ago I asked tbe Minister whether any New Zealand potatoes had'been condemned in Sydney.. I-understand that...inquiries are still in progress with a view to supplying me with ananswer to that question. The danger of the introduction of the powdery scab disease cannot be. over-, stated. Now that mining has almost ceased. there, the city ofBallarat -depends largely upon the primary producers . in the surrounding country, of whom there is no more important section than the potato-growers. If the disease obtained a hold in the potato-growing districts near Ballarat, business people would be almost ruined, apart from the ruin of the potato-growers themselves. It is, a remarkable fact that tbe only shipment of New 'Zealand potatoes to Melbourne was condemned, and that Melbourne is the only port in Australia where New Zealand potatoes have been condemned. It is safe to assume. from those facts that there is laxity in examining, the imports elsewhere. I .ask the Minister not to be content with, tbe examination made in New South Wales. It is an anomaly that, although the Commonwealth Government inspects everything else coming into the country, the inspection of potatoes is delegated to. State officials. I do not wish to I merely state that the only shipment to Melbourne has been condemned, while many shipments to New South Wales have been accepted. I hope that the Minister will insist upon a rigid examination being made. Apart from the No effect of tbe importations upon the.price, of potatoes, the existence of the potato growing industry is threatened by the introduction of this disease. I turn from the introduction of diseasedpotatoes to mention the duty on potatoes. During some seasons they It is only once in several years that there is a shortage of supplies, and immediately that condition arises, there is no competition from abroad. The potato-growers have already asked for a duty of £4 a ton, and I hope that the Minister will expedite the hearing of their applica-tion by the Tariff Board. Evidence will be submitted showing the precarious position of many potato-growers. I hope that the Minister will instruct the board to attend. to this matter at otpce, and make an early recommendation to Parliament.",26,Neville Howse Havin G Influence Upon The Defence Of Tbe Com

Widespread indignation has been caused throughout Western Australia' by the increase in tbe retail price of sugar. to the action by the Minister are important. the sugar agreement was made, manufacturers and others in Western Australia bought sugar f.o.b.

That agreement imposed upon' Perth a disability that did not apply to the other capital cities.

I have frequently said'that every effort should be made to cheapen the cost of production in tbe north and north-west of Australia, and this can be brought about in tbe early stages at least by the Government facilitating' and cheapening the supply of petrol and crude oil at the various ports of the north. I know that tanks have been erected at Darwin, but whether for petrol or crude oil, to. meet the requirements of the public, I do not know. It is time that we had that information. The other day I saw some small 450-gallou tanks at the works of the Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited; and, if the people of the far north could obtain their petrol supplies in tanks of that capacity, it would be of tremendous assistance in helping the development oi the country. Petrol is required for the motor car, the motor tractor, and, in many instances, for pumping plants. I should like to know what the Government intends to do to enable the people of the Northern Territory to obtain petrol and crude oil as cheaply as possible.

EecentlyI had tbe pleasure of riding on a motor truck carrying 2£ tons of merchandise and mails over indescribable tracks in the Northern Territory, and the speed at which it travelled was a revelation to me. In two days we travelled 300 miles. If the Government established facilities for the bulk handling of oil, say, at Port Augusta and at the railhead, much of the cost of bringing supplies from Melbourne would be eliminated.

I have been in consultation with the Chief Commissioner of Commonwealth Eailways on tbe mat.ter, and inquiries bave been made as to whether it would be possible to distribute petrol in small lots from Darwin southwards, but so far nothing definite has been done. It will be necessary, I think, to wait until the petrol tanks that are being constructed there are completed. This work is under tbe control of the Department of Works and Eailways. It is estimated that tbe expenditure on it during tbe year 1926-27 will be £3,000, and that amount is being set aside for the purpose. The vote last year was £17,300. In view of the representations that have been made, I will bring the matter before tbe Government again to see whether, tvhen the tanks are completed, it will be possible to supply petrol in small lots to graziers and others in tbe Northern Territory who need it . The investigation made up to date show that it would be expensive to operate a scheme of the kind; but we may be able to.find a way out of the difficulty.

This bill covers the loan programme for the year 1926-27, as recently submitted with the budget. The total of the loan estimates for Commonwealth works, & c , is £10,560,499. Eor tbe redemption of the Port Augusta to Oodnadatta railway loans, it is necessary to raise £90,340. It is proposed also that tbe Treasurer shall raise moneys required by the Federal Capital Commission. The amount to be provided this year is £2,000,000. The total of these items is £12,650,S39. F r o m this there may be deducted the sum of £1,000,000 required for the Grafton to South Brisbane railway, the raising and spending of which is authorized by the Grafton to South Brisbane RailwayA c t . The total requirements for Commonwealth works, for the Federal Capital Commission, and for redemption loans not otherwise authorized, are thus £11,650,839. This is the amount of tbe b ill now before the committee, and f u l l particulars are set out in the schedule. The chief items of expenditure included in the bill for Commonwealth works, & c , areLand and buildings for the Postmaster-General's Department and construction and extension of telegraphs and telephones Commonwealth Railways Naval bases, floating dock, aviation buildings, buildings, and other defence works Advances for purchase of wire and netting Immigration-Advances of passage money, &a. River Murray Waters Act Subscription to capital of Amalgamated Wireless Limited Sundry works of various departments Subscription to capital of Commonwealth Oil Refineries . . Loan to Territory of New Guinea for works War Service Homes Belated payments for war loan purposes Total for works and war loan purposes As already explained, the bill also in cludes £90,340 for loan redemption purposes, and £2,000,000 for tbe Federal Capital Commission. Honourable members are aware that the unexpended balances of revenue appropriations at I movethe close of each financial year lapse. The unexpended balances of loan appropriations, however, do not lapse. As a result of this practice there was, unti l last financial year, a large accumulation of live loan appropriations, many of which could not be used. It was considered advisable to clear up tbe position by providing in the LoanA c t of last year for the lapsing of the unexpended balances then existing under the usual annual loan .appropriations of former years. A t the same time, provision was made for the f u l l amount of the loan expenditure of last year to be appropriated in the LoanA ct of that year. It is proposed to continue this practice. In this way, each year's loan programme can be dealt with as a whole by Parliament when the annual LoanB ill is under consideration. In accordance with this practice, provision is made in the bill now before the committee for the lapsing of the unexpended balances of the appropriations made in last year's Loan Acts. In addition, authority is sought in this bill for the expenditure of the f u l l amount of loan money required for the loan programme of this year. This provision regarding lapsing relates only to the appropriation of loan moneys; it . . £5,000,000 does not relate to the authority given by .. 1,474,500 existing Loan Acts for the borrowing of money. The effect of this is that author i ty still exists for certain moneys to be. munitions supply borrowed under the LoanA ct of last year, but monevs so borrowed can be .. 587,500 spent only for the purposes set out in the bill now before the committee. To.. .. .. 500,000 wards the programme of loan works for 1926-27 there is a considerable amount .. .. 348,380 .. 252,500 of loan money in hand or in sight.

If a railway were constructed from Camooweal through the Barkly Tablelands to Newcastle Waters,, it would, I have no doubt, not immediately, but later on, be extended through the Victoria River country to one of the ports in Western Australia-eithe r Wyndham, Derby, or Broome. In my opinion, such a line is the only one that would properly develop the whole of that rich area of country. I take it that honourable members are agreed that one of the most important matters w it h whicb this Parliament has to deal is tbe development and peopling of the Northern Territory. mately bound up w it h the defence of the Commonwealth and tbe maintenance of the White Australia policy. that honourable members w ill also agree that tbe right thing to do is to develop first, the good country, and not the bad country.

I believe that it is so, and I asked a good many questions on the subject. people told me that if I bad gone off the line I would bave seen better country, but others told me that if I had gone off the line, in other places I would have seen worse countiy. rally admitted that it would be an extraordinary thing if the telegraph line, which we followed, and along which it is proposed the railway should be constructed, should go through only tbe bad country, and that the country on both sides of the line should be better. question is whether this Parliament wil l agree to spend £2,000,000 or £3,000,000 on the first section of the railway fro m Oodnadatta to Alice Springs. agreed to the construction of that line. it is possible for Parliament to reconsider its decision in that regard. Perhapsi t is not, and if so it is very disappointing' to know that the money spent upon the construction of the line w ill be practically wasted.' If it were spent in developing the Barkly Tablelands we should have some result from it . We should be able to settle a number of prosperous settlers in that country. It would be stocked within a very short time, and after the construction of a railway would carry 10,000,000 sheep or more. A railway from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs will do practically nothing in the way of settling the country through which it will go. I estimate that that country, with 'the exception of the three patches O'f good country to which I have referred, is so poor that it would take from 150,000 acres to 200,000 acres to give a decent living to one famI t is in t i ily. We have a railway now to Oodnadatta, and a train once a fortnigh t is sufficient to cope with all the traffic there. I assume If the line is continued for 300 miles further north, I do not think it will be necessary to r u n more than one train a month to carry the traffic offering. We are going to spend between £2,000,000 and £3,000,000 on this line to attain this result. It w ill settle few, if any, people on the land.

People will travel their cattle, rather than truck them fro m that distance. I am unable to see how the construction of the proposed line north from Oodnadatta is going to be of any benefit to Adelaide. If tbe rivers and creeks were bridged, or some means provided to enable them to be crossed by motor traffic, the building of a good road over that country would,' in my opinion, be of quite as much advantage to the few settlers there as would be the construction of the railway. member get cattle in or out of that district in drought time without a railway 1 it would pay any one to send cattle by r a i l through Alice Springsi n drought time or any other time.

If the rivers and creeks were bridged and a few patches where there are loose sand-hills were made passable by a corduroy road, that would be all that is necessary, and the cost involved would be infinitesimal compared with the cost of the railway. In my opinion, to build a railway right through from the south to the north through the Northern Territory w ill £15,000,000 to £20,000,000, whilst a good road through the whole district might be constructed for £1,000,000, or less. The greater part of the road is already made, and the bad parts of it could be improved by comparatively little expenditure. possibilities of the country? possibilities, certainly, but I assume that no honourable member w ill contend that we should build a railway right through that country on the chance of discovering some rich mines. I do not think that would be a business proposition. I discussed the building of the railway and tbe quality of the country w i th a number of residents in the Northern Territory. One man, who has been there for 40 years, at Charlotte Waters, assured me that they only get one good season out of three; and that statement was confirmed by others whom I met. about 500 miles north of Oodnadatta. The settler to whom I referred told me that the r a in f a ll was about 5£ inches per annum. He said that if tbey could depend upon getting that r a in f a ll every year in two falls, they could manage to get along; but, unfortunately, there is only about 2-J to 3 inches of effective rainfall, and the balance of tbe annual f a l l comes in small falls of 10 or 20 points that do not do any good at all. would the honourable ber take the trouble to look at tbe sheep at Charlotte Waters?

What is proposed is that we should build a railway for 700 miles through bad country; with the exception of 40 miles of country most of which is only fair ,and only one small patch which can be called first-class country. In my opinion, the right thing for Parliament to do would be to develop the Barkly Tablelands first. To do that it would be necessary to build a line from Borroloola, cost anything from a port on the Gulf of Carpentaria. Some expenditure would be required at the port to accommodate deep-sea shipping, but it would not.be very much. pensive harbour. be necessary, but I am advised that that would not involve a great deal of expendiThere are mineral ture.

The Government should construct first the 35 miles from Borroloola, which' at present is impracticable for motor traffic.",32,Second Reading

Expenditure upon that scheme would be much saner than the sinking of large sums of money in the construction of the north-south railway. I do not desire to repudiate any agreement made by the Commonwealth with the State of South Australia, but the agreement does not specify any time within whicb tbe north-south railway must be built. The duty of Parliament is to develop the good country first, and tbe poorer country later, if circumstances justify a large expenditure upon it. I do not know why people have settled in the centre of Australia; but as they were encouraged by successive governments to go tbere, this Parliament has a responsibility to provide them with decent, well-watered roads. earliest possible date make the road for the whole distance from Oodnadatta to Darwin passable for motor traffic. That could be done at comparatively small cost. with the railway when it was constructed. representatives may be opposed to my suggestion; but leading men in that State with whom I discussed this matter agreed that the north-south line will be a white elephant. Those who have taken the trouble to ascertain the facts know that it will not be the benefit to South Australia that some people expect, and that, on the contrary, the taxpayers of the Commonwealth will have to pay heavily for the enormous losses that it is certain to make. Having seen the country, I am satisfied that the losses will be far heavier than have been estimated. BeforeI undertook this trip I was prepared to support the north-south railway, but what I saw along the route compelled me to change my opinion. Any practical man who is a judge of the quality of country for pastoral purposes could not help coming to the conclusion that the railway will incur heavy losses for the next 50 years at least. I doubt whether a railway over the first 600 miles north of Oodnadatta will, ever be profitable. The money that will be sunk in it could be spent with greater advantage on the good portions of the Territory, and, manifestly, that is the right policy to adopt. Even at this stage Parliament should pause before it votes money for even the Oodnadatta to Alice Springs section.

The House has voted certain moneys for building railways, and if it were possible to reconsider the position, I should strongly advocate the expenditure of money to develop pastoral country, such as the Barkly Tablelands, avoiding altogether any expenditure on country which the honourable member for Wakefield has described as a desert. It is quite possible that the honourable member for Riverina followed the telegraph track, which is, as has been suggested, the ordinary stock route; and although the land along that route may differ from some on each side of it , it would certainly enable one to for m some idea of the country generally.

The very fact that so many sheep were there is evidence of the carrying capacity of the country. Some of tbe finest sheep in Australia are bred tbere.

South Australians, I may tell the honourable member, do not run down their own country or foul their own nest. have unbounded confidence in the future of their State. It is regrettable that so many Australians can be found who will at any time decry their own country. Only a single word need be said to some people about tbe Northern Territory to cause them to cry "" stinking fish "" in a loud voice, and win applause from the crowd for doing so. We should be developing a race of bigger Australians, and honourable members of this Parliament should set an example. To hear some people' discuss the Northern Territory, one would think that it was a more hopeless desert than the Sahara. A good deal of country in the TJnited States of America is similar to the poorer areas in the Northern Terrieaten-out condition; and he could have tory, but we do not hear the Americans condemning it. They lose no opportunity of telling us that the TJnited States of America is God's own country. We should take a leaf out of their book. If we condemn our country, who will praise it? Although the honourable member for Eiverina said by interjection a few moments ago that the drought-stricken country that he passed through was looking splendid, I assure bim that it was nothing like so luxuriant as it will be in a few. months' time. It needs two or three rains to bring it into its prime. Wben people who have seen it at its best have described it to those who live in the settled areas, they have been disbelieved. In my opinion, the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Foster) has a better knowledge of the Northern Territory than any other honourable member of this Parliament. knows very much more about it than the honourable member for Eiverina, who bas merely made a flying trip through it. I suggest that the honourable member for Eiverina should suspend his judgment' for twelve months, and then make another trip through it. I feel sure that he would then admit the truth of the old adage, "" Second thoughts are best"". [6.13] I must express a certain amount [159] of admiration for the honourable member for Eiverina for expressing his opinion so candidly. Knowing the vast area of the Northern Territory as I do, I was They not surprised to hear his conclusions. It must not be understood that he has totally condemned the Territory, for he said quite frankly that some of the land in the eastern districts of it are equal to the best land in Queensland, and that there are large areas of first class country in its western districts. But his conclusions in regard to the southern areas are, in my opinion, quite erroneous, though be is not by any means the first pastoralist to express such views on a first impression. I feel sure that he, like many others, will alter his views after he has had more experience of the country. Tbe honourable gentleman travelled over a stock route that is traversed by thousands of cattle every year, and is kept in a practically had little opportunity to inspect the country either to his right or left. In brief, his view is that tbe country in the north, east, and west of tbe Territory is good, but that that' in the south is not worth the expenditure of public money on it. I have pointed out in this chamber on many occasions that it is impossible for any one to pass reliable judgment on the Territory without a much wider experience of it than can possibly be gained in one brief visit. My first impression of Central Australia was similar to that formed by the honourable member. WbenI went along the route of the overland telegraph line, I thought it was remarkable that cattle could exist there, but since that time. I have availed myself of opportunities to inspect the country for 100 miles or so east and west of that route. When one reaches tbe sloping country back from He certainly the telegraph line, magnificent land is found. Only recently I was at a station that breeds horses that are averaging £38 a head on the Adelaide, market. Will any honourable member suggest that horses commanding that price are not of high quality? In my opinion, Central Australia is quite suitable for the raising of sheep and cattle. AlthoughI realize that it will not be possible to run two or three sheep to the acre, my experience of the country enables me to estimate its carry-",39,Second Reading
155,"Mr Nelson (Northern Territory) Ing Capacity As, Roughly, One Sheep To 6","or 3 acres. Some of the land will carry five or six head of stock to the square mile, and it would be fair to say that it would take one sheep to 5 or 6 acres. It must also be remembered that there arc tremendous areas where the breeding of cattle, horses, or sheep can be carried on even in drought periods. I was in Central Australia in November last, before the last drought broke up, and, although the conditions in the northern portions of South Australia were most deplorable, cattle dying in all directions, I did not see one beast in Central Australia that could be described as being in poor condition. This was due to a superabundance of top feed and supplies of sub-artesian water at shallow depths. I do not suggest that this country is the garden of Australia, but I realize that it is capable of producing great wealth in sheep, horses, and cattle, to say nothing of its immense mineral possibilities. I had the pleasure, a couple of weeks ago, of being on what is regarded as an exceedingly small run in Central Australia; its area is something like 150 square : miles. Tbe owner has wisely sacrificed numbers for quality in tbe breeding of his stock. He has good horses and cattle, and he is getting better financial returns than other land-holders whose runs range up to 2,000 square miles. in many parts of Australia. has this owner been that in the next few years he will be able to retire. Recently he sent fourteen Clydesdale horses to market, and received as much for them as was paid for a whole trainload of horses dispatched from another station. This shows the false economy practised on some of the big holdings, where quality is sacrificed for quantity. The honourable member for Riverina had a better opportunity of inspecting the northern than the southern portion of the Territory. When passing through the southern part he proceeded along the stock route without deviating east or west. route in the north. able member travelled east and west to the Barkly Tablelands. Although the honourable member praised that country, I am inclined to think that Central Australia is more suitable for the small man who intends to raise sheep. The Barkly Tablelands are admittedly rich in Plinders and Mitchell grasses, and are supplied with sub-artesian water at depths varying from 200 to 300 feet; but they do not contain a stick of timber. The honourable members knows that, when one crosses that belt on horseback, one is unable for hundreds of miles to find sufficient wood to boil a ""billy. "" It is true that those tablelands are on the edge of the monsoonal belt, and get some rain every year, which cannot be said of Western Queensland; but I have known periods when the grass there was rank in some places and dead in others, and when there was no top feed for cattle, as there always is in Central Australia. A hundred miles east of Alice Springs one sees the "" old man "" salt bush growing to a height of from 15 to 20 feet over large areas. During the recent drought -the most severe experienced in the last 30 years-stoc k was kept fat on the run recently visited by me. The honourable member for Bass( Mr Jackson) and the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Stewart) recently visited this area, and can bear testimony to tbe truth of the statement that within six weeks of tbe time when rain fell there recently, prime cattle were sold at Alice Springs at £7 10s. a head. I submit that that is a far better price than is obtained at tbe northern end of the Territory, where it was recently boasted that £5 a head had been received. I do not suggest that the honourable member for Riverina had an ulterior motive when he spoke as he did this afternoon ; on the other hand, I feel disposed to applaud him for having had the courage to express his opinion on the country as he saw it. It is most unfortunate, however, that he did not have an opportunity to visit the pick of Central Australia, east and west of the overland telegraph route. Being a pastoralist, he naturally paid most attention to the pastoral possibilities of the Territory; but the promise of success in mining operations should not be overlooked. A week or two ago I inspected I also followed the stock various mineral deposits that have been opened up within the last few years.

A large capital expenditure is required for the establishment of the necessary plant and for ""the carting of flux, coke, and other material required for the treatment of the ore. The railway to be buil t in the Territory will assist these base metal propositions. I bave seen the "" s h o w s "" of which the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr try, and' those praised were indifferent Foster) spoke. I think that I can say, advisedly, that I know a good deal about Central and Northern Australia, because I have travelled hundreds of miles off the beaten tracks. The honourable member is interested in a. silver lead mine, which, if it were located in almost any other part of Australia, would command unlimited capital. Personally, I would not care to invest money in such a venture under existing conditions, because of the isolated position of the field and the high cost of carting mining requisites. I recently inspected the White Range country, where the hills average from 400 to 500 feet in height, are 2 or 3 miles wide, and 7 or 8 miles long. According to assays made by Government officials, the whole of these bills would yield an average return of 8 dwt. of gold to the ton. There is no mine on the Randi n SouthA f r i c a to compare with this field, and there are others equally rich. The further one goes towards the Tanami district the more promising the prospects become. I am confident that when the railway is extended to Alice Springs, and the carriage of mining machinery is facilitated, there will be the biggest "" s t r i k e "" of gold in the western part of the Territory that Australia has ever known. tion of the line open up that country? enable heavy machinery to be carted within a reasonable distance of that area over the worse portions of the track in the Northern Territory.

Sitting suspended from 6.SO to 8 p.m. country in the Northern Territory is deceptive from the pastoral point of view. Men who have visited the Territory have lauded certain areas as great pastoral country, and condemned other areas as poor country, and I have known that tbe areas condemned were really good councountry. The honourable member for Riverina compared the areas adjacent to the railway between Darwin and the Katherine River w i th the very poor country at the southern end of the Territory, which, in his opinion, is useless country. I can in for m h i m that there is a great difference between the carrying capacities of these areas. In the northern areas referred to tbe grasses grow to a height of from 12 to 14 feet, and the pastoralist who puts stock into that country can only expect them to die, because it is impossible for them to live on those grasses. That country cannot be compared with the country in the southern part of tbe Territory, which appeared to the honourable member to be valueless. No one going through that southern part of tbe Territory, even though it may be after a number of bad seasons, w ill find poor horses or cattle, and it is obvious that if horses and cattle can be kept in good condition during trying seasons, the land must have some considerable value. I know that after a number of years of scanty rainfall, and within six weeks of a f a l l of rain, f a t cattle were marketed from that part of the Territory. The conclusion at which the honourable member for Riverina has arrived is that the W o u l d the construcGovernment would not be justified i u constructing the line from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs.

I believe the construction of a line across to Wyndham is essential; but what we are concerned about is tbe development of the Northern Territory, and to confine our efforts to the northern part would be a fatal mistake. The honourable member for Riverina, on the track on which he travelled over tbe Macdonnell Ranges, met with a good deal of rocky country after passing Alice Springs, which would not be likely to favourably impress any one, but if he had deviated from the line east and west for from 50 to 100 miles, as he did in the northern part of the Territory, the carrying capacity of ment from the Government, much greater the country he would have been able to see would have been a revelation to him, and he would have returned from the Territory with an opinion of its resources very different from that which he has expressed tliis afternoon. other parts of the Territory the country east and west of the overland route is much worse than the country on the route itself? I was told that that is the case. country from tbe experience of settlers within the last five years. The impresber says that sheep raising was tried at sion was held, and is still held, that the country east and west of the north-south line in the central part of the Territory is more or less desert country. But a reference to the records of the Lands Dethat area during the last five years is sufficient to refute the statement that that country is worthless. There is a great deal of spinifex country there, but it is soft spinifex, and that is not bad country for cattle. I know some young men who settled in the Central Australia country within the last four or five years and are to-day in a position to sign a very substantial cheque. They started without capital, their only assets being their hands and the will to conquer; and they have conquered. Some of them are here now, looking for other young fellows to go back with them on the share system. They have found that under present conditions the cost of dog-netting their areas is prohibitive. They have found also that it is useless to employ the aborigines as they cannot be trusted. One settler found that with the employment of aboriginals his annual natural increase was about 27 per cent. When he dispensed with native labour and he and his partner took turn about at shepherding, tbe natural increase rose in one year to about 60 per cent. These men are satisfied that the country on which they are settled is sheep country. In the Arltunga district a man named Cavanagh has made a fortune out of sheep. He did not go in for a very extensive flock, but a flock of 5,000 or 6,000 that he could manage. It is proved that the country is sheep country. I do not say that it has a great carrying capacity, but the areas available are vast, and there is room for the settlement of hundreds of settlers. With sympathetic treatproduction might be anticipated from that Central Australia country. The Government might undertake to dog-net 50,000 or 100,000 square miles of that country and subdivide it for settlement, because the dingoes are the big menace to stock tbere.

He told that honourable member that at the time he was holding something like 2,000 square miles of country; but that if the Commonwealth Government would do for him what was being done for settlers in Queensland and would give him wire netting at a reasonable cost, spreading the payment for it over a number of years, and assist him in providing water, he would select 20,000 acres from his area of 2,000 square miles, would go in for sheep, and would never look back. the Government could take the rest of his provided by the Government on the stock area. the area occupied by Nickers is not an they are all right for one mob of cattle; exceptional area ih that part of the but, when the droving season arrives, tens country.

I would agree entirely with the honourable member were it not for the necessity for transporting fat stock, which causes me to hesitate in advocating motor transport as a complete substitute for railways. I have recently met pastoralists who had stock too fat to travel on the roads, and it would mean much to those A settler men if they could entrain their cattle and deliver them in sound condition. When buyers were paying £7 10s. a head for cattle at Alice Springs, they knew they would obtain £15 or £16 a head for the same beasts at Adelaide. If it is decided to substitute droving for railway transport, a vast improvement must be made in tbe stock routes. It is no wonder that Central Australia has a bad name for its cattle. The honourable member for Eiverina and the honourable member for Bass will admit that the stock driven recently from Central Australia to the head of the railway at Oodnadatta, and thence taken by rail to Adelaide, had to travel for three weeks with three drinks of water. Is it possible to land stock in good condition if they bave only three drinks of water in three routes of the Territory.

Mr Horwood, was so confident that water oould be obtained that after drilling for 350 feet he said that if the Government would pay for drilling another 100 feet he would drill a similar distance for nothing. The Government should make a searching inquiry respecting the policy of those controlling water boring operations. I have always held the opinion that the water conservation policy for the Northern Territory was wrong, because of insufficient attention being paid to the conservation of surface water by the construction of dams and the like. Throughout the Macdonnell Range country there are possibilities of water conservation. I know what has been done in this direction in the Mallee country of Victoria, and I suggest that the Government should borrow the services of some of the engineers of the State Rivers and Water Supply Commission of Victoria, who have been responsible for the reticulation of the Mallee country. That scheme consists of the conservation of tbe waters of the Grampians in a lake there, and their reticulation for a distance of 200 miles as the crow flies through the arid and sandy country adjacent to the River Murray. That is one of the most remarkable and successful schemes of water conservation in the world. If the engineers responsible for that work were sent to the Macdonnell Ranges for three or four months and instructed to report freely on the conservation of surface waters there, I am satisfied that it would be time and money well spent. amount of evaporation in that country? evaporation is great, but it is not great enough to prevent the conservation of water. Water is conserved at Broken Hill, and the honourable member knows that there is not much difference between the evaporation at BrokenH ill and that at Alice Springs. favour of Alice Springs. the rainfall at the Macdonnell Ranges, being of a monsoonal nature, is better for catchment purposes. Tbe railway from Marree to Oodnadatta is not in a good state of repair. The new locomotives that have been ordered, are too heavy for the line, and tbeir speed is limited to 25 miles an hour because of the bad state of the permanent way. The Algebuckina bridge is a remarkable structure, but because the new locomotives are unable to cross it a deviation of the line has been , made. always regretted building that bridge; a level crossing should be there. ber is, perhaps, right; but the bridge is there and the locomotives are unable to cross it.

In ray opinion, the Government is making no mistake in: seeking to develop the Territory from the southern end. listened with keen attention to the remarks of the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Stewart). AlthoughI have always been, and still am, of the opinion that the Commonwealth should honour its pledge to South Australia, my idea of the value of the country from Marree to Oodnadatta changed by a visit I have paid to it. I regret to say that those parts of Central Australia that I have seen are not nearly so fertile as I was led to believe they were. has not yet seen Central Australia. I have not been beyond Oodnadatta; but, as my opinion is unlikely to affect the construction of the railway from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs, I must say frankly that, although I have seen a good deal of what is called the desert country of Australia, the country between Marree and Oodnadatta is the poorest I have seen .anywhere. Whatever its condition may have been years ago, it has been destroyed by overstocking. Prom Hawker onwards, properties are pointed out that years ago carried 40,000,"" 50,000, and up to 100,000 sheep, which to-day are not carrying one-tenth as many. The salt bush there has been completely eaten out, and the -country is now a wind-swept waste.

The suggestion made by the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Stewart), that honourable members should be given every facility to visit tbe interior of Australia without heavy expense to themselves, is well worthy of the earnest consideration of the Government. Honourable members are expected to vote has been considerably huge sums of money for developmental works in these areas, and if tbey had a little personal knowledge of the country they would be able to spend the public money much more intelligently than they can possibly do now. It is remarkable that only two or three honourable members of this House have traversed the continent from north to south. In the circumstances, it cannot be expected that public money will be spent to the best advantage. I can understand the warmth of the honourable member for the Northern Territory in discussing this matter, for I was one of a party which contemplated a trip to the Northern Territory some eighteen months ago under his guidance. For some reason which has never been disclosed, the motor cars that were to have been used by the party were not made available. It has been suggested that the Federal Government should take over the noith-west of Western Australia, and that it, together Avith the Northern Territory and a considerable area of northern Queensland, should be controlled by this Parliament. The reason that the Government of Western Australia ia not willing to hand over that part of its territory to the Commonwealth is that it is afraid that the same wasteful expendiis a reflection ture of public money may occur there that has occurred in the Northern Territory, and that there Avill be just as little to show for it.

A perusal of the Public Works Committee's report in 1922 will show that that body first recommended the construction of a line through that country, and then a railway from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs. But the honourable member will do nothing towards the development of the Territory by advocating that it should be opened up by means of a motor road. As to the present motor traffic, it is time that road still use the old track. only a few spots at which some of the rivers could be crossed, particularly the Finke and the H u g h. I had the experience on my return journey recently of being stuck with a motor car in the middle of one of the sandiest stretches, because a drover had his cattle resting, at tbe very spot where a dry river bed had to be crossed. It is high time notices were erected warning drovers that they should take cattle across at some other point. The honourable member for Eiverina is credited with having said that owners will not truck cattle from Alice Springs, but I point out that in almost every in stance the sworn evidence submitted to the Works Committee was that they would certainly take advantage of railway transport, because it would pay them better to obtain high prices for good meat in the Adelaide market than to send down store cattle. I hope that the item w ill be passed as printed. rather reluctant to re-open a subject that has been discussed on so many occasions as bas the north-south railway. My only reason for rising is to reply to some of the remarks of the honourable member for Biverina. We now find that honourable members are not disputing the agreement made with South Australia so much as they are trying to prevent by every other possible means the building of the line. Great credit is due to the honourable member for Bass( Mr Jackson) and other honourable members who have visited the Territory and expressed an unbiased opinion concerning it . But some honourable members take every opportunity of advocating the construction of a line other than on the direct north-south route. In my opinion some of their statements are incorrect. A few days ago a motion tabled by an honourable member from New SouthI have always held that Wales was under consideration. He wished to obtain an advantage by a deviation through his State. A representative of Western Australia is also trying to get a "" c u t "" for that State. The honourable member for Biverina, I am satisfied, went to the Northern Territory with bis opinion already formed, and he has taken a biased view of the potentialities of the country. I have inspected a good deal of the vast area traversed by a motor him. It is true that owing to drought was declared; waggons could conditions, and because of a large acThere are cumulation of stock in tbe neighbourhood of Oodnadatta, the country immediately around that centre is eaten out, and is to some extent a desert; but it must be remembered that in 1906 the lower portion of the Northern Territory saved the stock of a large number of farmers in South Australia. My brother went to the Northern. Territory at that time with stock because of the drought in South Australia. The condition of the country then was the reverse of what it is to-day. I do not wish to discuss this matter at great length to-night,, but I should like to say that those who favour the construction of the line have nothing to fear. The bill authorizing its construction was passed by this House, and tbe agreements of 1910 and of last year have been ratified by this Parliament. To-day the survey of the line is being made, and I hope that in the very near future its construction w ill be begun. The honourable member for Riverina stated that the country between Oodnadatta and Alice Springs is of a very poor nature. said that for 700 miles it is of a poor nature. ber's description might, perhaps, be applied to the country for the first 50 or 100 miles north of Oodnadatta, but beyond that up to Alice Springs the character of the country gradually i m proves. The honourable member travelled over the stock route, and did not leave it to see what the country on either side was like. He is, therefore, not iu a position to give a reliable report of its character.

217,Mr Lacey,"The honourable memnorth, to inspect the country on either side of the stock route, he would havo reported quite differently about it . When I visited the Northern Territory last year, I departed from the stock route on the journey from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs, and I am convinced that the party of which I was a member would have been deceived as to the character of the country if it bad remained The honourable member told us that the country around Alice Springs is of a mountainous and rocky nature, but for the information of honourable members who have not' been there, I may say that for 12 miles north of Alice Springs the country is rocky and hilly, but after that you reach the fringe of Burt Plain, which extends for miles. statements of the honourable member for Riverina would lead to the impression that the whole of the country around Alice Springs is rocky and hilly, and unsuitable for grazing. second class country or worse, and I still say so. the honourable member. Immediately you get through the hilly country around Alice Springs you reach first class pastoral country. If it were not so far removed from centres of population some of that country might be devoted to the cultivation of wheat. rainfall. Works and Railways( MrH ill ) will, I think, bear me out when I say that when we visited the Territory in 1924 we were told that the rainfall of the district I refer to was 12 £ inches per annum. fall at Alice Springs for the last 45 years is 11 inches. annual fall does not occur in one shower, the honourable member for Riverina and the honourable member for Wimmera will admit that a rainfall of 11 inches is sufficient for the production of wheat. does not come at the time of the year suitable for tbe production of wheat. The country is good wheat-growing country if the rainfall were suitable. ( it is good pastoral country. We saw sheep in that part of the Territory looking quite as well as sheep to be seen in other parts of Australia. We had to drive the animals out of high on the stock route. grass in order to secure a photograph of a very fine flock of sheep at Ryan's Well. WhatI have heard the honourable member for Riverina say about that country has made me wonder bow much reliance can be placed upon his description of portions of the Northern Territory that I have not had the good fortune to visit. His pessimistic observations need not be taken seriously, in The view of the opinions which have been expressed by uninterested persons like the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Stewart) and the honourable member for Bass( Mr Jackson) and others who have visited the NorthernI said that it is all Territory. It has been said that the one thing that is necessary is a better supply of water on the stock route. When I visited the Territory, the Wells on the stock route were in good order, but there was not a sufficient number of them. Going up, we passed a mob of 561 cattle, and repassed tbe same mob twelve or fifteen days later. During that time these cattle had to go six days without water. That may seem to some honourable members to be extraordiI f it had a proper nary, but because of the heavy dews and the fodder available it is possible in that locality to drove cattle six days without water. During the time mentioned .the depreciation in the value of the cattle amounted to from 30s. to .£2 per head. The wells 011 the stock route should be kept in good order, and a greater number should be sunk. In reply to the opinions expressed by the honourable member for Riverina, I wish to place on record the views of other people who are acquainted with the conditions in the Northern Territory. The honourable member suggested that a committee should be appointed to inquire into the character of the country before tbe railway is constructed. Let me remind him that that has already been done. As .a matter of fact, more than one committee has reported on this project. The report with which this House is most'concerned is that",51,Nelson Th E Meat Works At In The Macdonnell Ranges

225,Mr Lacey,"I am contending that of the Public Works Committee. In 1922 that committee took extensive evidence, and some of its members travelled over a great portion of the Territory. presented a report to this Parliament recommending the construction of the railway. quote the opinions of some pastoralists as to the character of the country. Mr P. V . Ambrose, a pastoralist, gave the following evidence: Our lease demands that we should carry one beast to the mile. When we came here in 1912 we had 1,168 cattle, and now we have approximately 4,000, and have sent away a mob every year. We could carry more stock if we had more water, as the feed for a greater number of stock is available. A railway would benefit us whatever route it took, provided it came to within 200 or 300 miles of us. At present we get our supplies from Oodnadatta, although Katherine is nearer. The railway that would bring most settlement would be one from the south, because it is more fit for stocking purposes than the northern end. Here is a pastoralist living in the Northern Territory who has no interest in the southern end, and yet he expresses the opinion that the southern part of the Territory is more suitable than the northern end for stock. That refutes the testimony of the honourable member for Riverina. Another witness, MrA l f r e d John Cotton, a grazier in the Northern Territory, and also a grazier in Queensland, expressed the opinion that if a railway were buil t the Territory would be developed as other parts of Australia have been developed, and he saidTake, for instance, the railway from Hughenden to Cloncurry. I remember travelling over this route before the railway was built, when you could count the number of settlers on your fingers. Now since the railway has been built there are very many hundreds. country, capital must be encouraged to come. Why is it that to-dav the Argentine has £100.000,000 of British ""capital invested there? Because the Government of that country realize that to encourage development they must encourage capital, and offer sufficient inducement for the man with the money to invest. If you do the same in the Territory, plenty of capital will be available, for the wool-growing and stock-raising conditions are unsurpassed in any other part of Australia, owing to the formation of the country and its freedom from periodical droughts. This Northern Territory must be looked upon for many years to come as only a sheep and cattleraising proposition. speaking of the Barkly Tablelands he gave that evidence? Mr Lacey. to the Northern Territory generally. We do not say that the Territory is toIt day any more than a sheep and cattleraising proposition. I could quote extensively from the evidence given to the From the report I propose to Public Works Committee by men of experience in the pastoral industry who spoke in tenns similar to those I have already quoted. Mr S. J . Mitchell gave this evidence in answer to the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr. Mathews)I think that this north-south railway would benefit the Territory as much as many sanguine people think. I am very enthusiastic about it. I am too old to be influenced by sentiment in a matter of this kind. I am looking at the matter in a hard business-like way. The land is of value, and you cannot settle people there without giving an advantage to the whole of Australia, just as you cannot keep people from those lands without disadvantage to Australia. Ifi t were proposed to carry the central railway further west still, I do not say I would advocate the idea, but it would receive my serious attention. Such a railway would take us into very unsettled country. Sir Sidney Kidman, in giving evidence before tbe same committee, saidThere is no comparison between this and the Maree-Birdsville country. At times you can travel from the Macdonnell Ranges on the top feed, but there is nothing the other way. From what I know of the country, there is only one line of any benefit to South Australia, and that is the direct line-that is, the line to open up country which can be stocked with cattle. It is contended by all who advocate the construction of this railway, that it must be constructed in fulfilment of an honourable agreement with the South Australian Government. I did not hear the honourable member for Riverina say anything about the possibilities of mineral If you want development of virgin development in the Northern Territory. We who advocate the construction of the line contend that there are greater possibilities of mineral development there than in any other part of Australia. The quotations made by the honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr. Nelson) amply demonstrate that. I hope that the Government will not be influenced by anything that has been said against the decision to construct the line, but will finish the.survey as soon as possible, and proceed with the construction work immediately afterwards. I look forward to the first sod of the line being Mr Cotton not turned within the next twelve months. when I said the other day that the construe-",52,Nelson Th E Meat Works At In The Macdonnell Ranges

227,Mr Lacey,"No , be was referringtion of roads must be discussed in this House on a future occasion; the construction of spur lines for the Northern Territory will also have to be discussed. To make the present stock route into a road would entail a large expenditure. Heavy expense would be entailed, apart from the several crossings of the Finke River. A t one stage of our t r ip we travelled only 30 miles from daylight to dark without crossing the Finke River. To make that portion of the track suitable for heavy motor traffic would be enormously expensive. would not provide for the moving of stock from the Northern Territory to South Australia. Every one admits that the -country improves the farther north one goes. It is from the northern part of the line that the cattle w ill come. The country near Oodnadatta is not good. To be perfectly candid, the existing railway line goes through the worse country in the Territory. The last 120 miles before reaching Oodnadatta is greatly in ferior to that just beyond Oodnadatta.
