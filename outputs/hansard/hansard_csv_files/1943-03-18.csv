I have received from that man a letter enclosing a copy of the Queensland Worker, in which the Department of Labour and National Service advertises an urgent appeal for plumbers, as well as other tradesmen. Will the Minister for the Army release this man in order that he may take up his trade of plumbing?

In consequence of this, the court held that Mr Tonking was entitled to the net proceeds of the sale of the actual fruit which he had produced-which particular case were identifiable. members of the court emphasized additional evidence might have led them to assess the compensation altogether differently. Tonldng case lays down a final and irrevocable rule as to the method of assessing compensation acquired and pooled. The court, however, did say in. that case that the grower is entitled to the full value of his fruit; that this alone would be the "" just terms "" for which the Constitution provides. But the translation of these general propositions into pounds, shillings and pence is a task that cannot finally or satisfactorily be accomplished unless account be taken of the aims, methods and results of the acquisition hy the Commonwealth commodity concerned. pends upon its own organization methods of compensation. members will realize, the very of a pool in some instances enables a market to be preserved. is one of the relevant Without going into detail, I observe that, in considering the "" full value "" of a commodity that has been acquired, a clear distinction must be drawn between what may be called the "" individual"" "" mass "" acquisition of property. the Commonwealth building or piece of equipment, the acquisition generally leaves the market turbed. acquisition is to deal with a threatened shortage or a threatened glut, to create an altogether new, fair and stable market, and to prevent profiteering hand or the collapse of an industry on the other. "" Just terms "" in such cir1 cumstances cannot be fixed merely by endeavouring .to ascertain what price a grower would have obtained for his commodity in an open market. the market has been disturbed, or even destroyed, Dr. Evan. was entitled. AtI n connection w it h wheat, the honourable action, no member for In d i mentioned particularly had been given as to the the special position of what is called "" quota"" wheata grower's first 3,000 bushels-for which a price of 4s. a bushel is guaranteed. I do not think there is anything whatever in the judgments in the Tonking case which throws doubt in this on this arrangement. Doubt must rest, But I think, on an entire misconception of that the facts. They are these: An advance of 4s. a bushel is paid on the quota wheat. On the residue, ,an advance of 2s. only It is wrong to assume that the is paid, but, as sales take place, further advances will be made. In making payments from the pool, the necessary for products compulsorilj adjustments are made for variations in the quality of the wheat supplied. Additional payments are made to the actual grower concerned, in respect of the small quantity sold as premium wheait. For sub-standard wheat, deductions are made from the amounts payable to the grower concerned. The vital point is that the wheat pool-which , by the way, includes the proceeds of the flour tax-wil l in any event pay in respect of all wheat, both of the quota and surplus wheat alike, the net Each scheme deproceeds of realization, neither more nor and less. If the selling price of wheat is As honourable insufficient to repay the f u l l 4s. advance existence on the quota wheat, the difference will be made up from general revenue. SurThat, therefore, plus wheat w ill , therefore, not have to circumstances. subsidize quota wheat. Oin the other hand, if the price rose so high as to exceed the guaranteed price plus costs of handling, quota wheat would not have to subsidize surplus wheat. The net proand the ceeds of realization would still be paid Where by the pool to the grower. acquires a particular In most cases of general acquisition, the industry has been faced with a subundisstantial export surplus, for which the war But the very object of ""mass"" has closed the customary markets overseas. Acquisition has been resorted to in order to avert the disorganization and collapse arising from a glut on the home on the one market. Field peas, to which the honourable member for Wilmot( Mr Guy) referred, are an instance of exactly the opposite process-the acquisition of a commodity in short supply. The local demand, especially for A r m y purposes, Very often has rapidly expanded. The crop is small, too small, indeed, to meet in f u l l Aushy the exigencies of war. tralia's war-time needs. Acauisition was resorted to in order to ensure supplies for Service needs, and to regulate the marketing of any surplus available for civilian use. Price control alone would have prevented profiteering, but would not have secured the other important objectives. The terms of acquisition15s. a budiel to the grower-were fixed by the Commonwealth Prices Commissioner. A court is not necessarily hound to hold that a price fixed by the Prices Commissioner will constitute just terms of acquisition. But the appropriate administrative authority has taken the view that this particular price was just. I have been advised that the price before the war was certainly not more -than 8s. a bushel. Growers themselves know that the price now fixed is botli reasonable and payable. They could have got higher prices, no doubt, in an uncontrolled market; the merchants could certainly have got higher prices. Buyers, it is known, had to pay up to 30s. a bushel in. the year before acquisition took .place. It is not to be assumed that the Constitution makes the Commonwealth powerless to check profiteering in a case where considerations of defence make it necessary to acquire a commodity that is in short supply. "" Just terms "" are not necessarily synonymous with getting the very utmost that competition can squeeze out of the necessities of ithe nation in time of war. The commodities I have mentioned may be taken as typical of the mass or general acquisitions put into operation in order, either to rectify the ill effects of shortages in war conditions, or to avert the consequences of over-supply. There are, however, other commodities in respect of which the Commonwealth has not itself acquired and marketed a whole crop, but has obtained large supplies for service purposes, under contracts with processors whose own supplies are controlled by the Commonwealth, at prices fixed by the Prices Commissioner. Tomatoes and citrus f r u it s belong to this class of commodities. I do not wish now to repeat or amplify the statement. I made to the House on this class of transactions as recently as the 26th February. Broadly speaking, it was to the effect that the price fixed by the Prices Commissioner may be examined by a court. The principles upon which the Commonwealth has acted in carrying out plans for the "" mass"" acquisition of commodities have heen laid down by successive governments representing all parties in Australia, and have been supported in each case by representatives of the industry concerned. that was done in the case of wheat lands. Dr. EVATT T h a t is the exception. able exception, too. Dr. EVATT T h a t is what the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr. Scully) has pointed out. The position arising from the H i g h Court's decision as to the damages awarded in the apple and pear case may have to be clarified in subsequent proceedings. Apparently, the decision lays down no mechanical rule of universal application in the ascertainment of just terms of acquisition. It may well he inapplicable to other circumstances and other commodities. Summing up, it may f a i r l y be said(1) 'That under the Constitution no property of a citizen can be acquired or requisitioned except on "" just terms "" . (2) That the citizen is not necessarily bound by any departmental or governmental assessment of compensation. The citizen has the general right of testing such assessments in the court. (3) That no general rule can be laid down as to the precise measure of compensation in each case. Each scheme or each acquisition must be governed by its own peculiar circumstances. The just measure of compensation in any given instance depends upon the particular circumstances of the acquisition concerned, and these may and do vary greatly, not only from industry to industry, but from season to season as well. (4) That perhaps the hest working rule to be adopted both by departments and hy growers or owners is to obtain agreementi n advance if possible-as to the compensation payable; whilst",13,Acquisition Of Primary Products Validity Of Regulations Hig H Coubt Decision Blu E Peas Wheat

The honourable gentleman moved from point to point in a which jumps from peak to peak, but he was not nearly so sure-footed. In an endeavour to justify the increase of 20 per cent, which the Government .proposes to give to the returned soldiers, he used the basic wage as his measuring rod, and said : "" This is the iresult at which I have arrived."" I have heard from members of I hope that the the special committee which investigated repatriation matters many explanations of the manner in which it had arrived at the increase of 20 per cent. The deputy chairman of the committee ( Mr Watkins) said that it was "" a deduction from common sense"". Members of the committee who sit on. this side of the chamber have made other observations.

He then saidThe proposed increase is substantially the same as that recommended by the parliamentary committee, and the Government is of the opinion that it is justified, having regard to the increase of the cost of living since the commencement of the war That was his first pointthe general increase of wages That was his second pointthe present rate of pay of members of the forces, and the amendments which have been made in the rates of invalid and old-age pensions. He thus forsook the measuring rod of the basic wage, and relied on other factors, which are just as relevant to the increase of 20 per cent, as they are to the increase of 66$ per cent. If the honourable gentleman justify an increase of 605 per cent., I can see no reason why he should not use it also in relation to the of the honourable member for Does he regard it as fair that he should use the basic wage-which amount necessary to maintain the standard of living in this country-as measuring rod in computing the repatriation benefits that should he given to returned soldiers? I do not consider that it is. I should rather expect the honourable gentleman to be generous, and to say that the returned soldier is at least entitled to the basis upon which the wage of the average adult worker is computed in Australia to-day. that course, he would find that, as I pointed out in my second-reading the difference between the normal adult wage to-day and that paid in 1919 is 47 per cent., not 20 per cent, or less. The honourable gentleman said last night that no argument had been advanced in favour of an increase of more than 20 per cent., and that the organizations of returned soldiers were not interested in any different amount; have sought it from this Parliament. members of the special committee said repeatedly placed before them by any of returned' soldiers in advocacy of a greater Evidence has been placed before honourable members that, notwithstanding Mr Harrison. statements of the Minister and of members of the committee, the Victorian branch of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia asked for an increase corresponding to the increase of soldiers' pay, which is 41.67 per cent. If the Minister was aware of this he has deliberately clouded the position; if he was not, he had been misinformed. If the committee was aware of this fact, and suppressed it , it was at fault in so doing. The fact is that the returned soldiers of Victoria asked for an increase of 41.6 per cent., whilst those of New South Wales asked for an increase of 50 per cent. tioned that fact in his speech. uses .a given .basis to him an injustice, and I am sorry.

He has been moving from foot to foot in an is the lowest endeavour to justify his attitude in regard to the 20 per cent, increase, and he is not the making too good a showing. I draw attention to the following paragraph which appears on page 4 of the committee's report:The committee found that there was reasonable ground for a general increase of the rates of war pension. An outstanding factor in this regard was the comparison of rates of pay to memlbers of the forces and allowances to their dependants with the same items in respect of If he were to adopt the 1914 war. If that was the opinion of the committee, speech, and it knew that the soldiers' pay had increased by 41.67 per cent., I still cannot understand why it recommended an increase of pension rates by only 20 per cent.

I cannot accept those arguments in the light of what the Government is, in fact, doing. If pensions be increased by 50 per cent., the extra burden on the Treasury will amount to about £2,500,000, which will be used to reimburse fighting men who have suffered disabilities while defending our freedom and standards of living.

I have here a list of names of men employed by one such firm. There are 46 of them, and the weekly earnings of these men range between £16 and £25. The average for the 46 cases was £20 7s. a week. But I direct the attention of the committee to the fact thatj whilst only fifteen men out of the 46 worked 44 hours' ordinary time a week, a number worked 26 hours' ordinary time and 32£, 42J and 44 hours' double time. They received as high as £25 a week, while the men fighting in the ranks in the Army receive 8s. 6d. a day. For the industrial worker, the Government is establishing a national welfare fund, into which will be paid £30,000,000 a year, but it cannot find £2,500,000 in order to increase repatriation pensions by £2,500,000 for returned soldiers, yet it has brought down a national welfare scheme which is to cost, not £2,500,000, but £30,000,000. Does the Minister say that for the fighting man who has left his wife and children, perhaps in penury, while he goes to fight in defence of the country and suffers disability in the course of his service, this money cannot be found, although £30,000,000 can be found for the benefit of those who are already earning £15 and £20 a week? Let us see whether the national income is able to stand this increase. Let us compare the position as it obtained immediately after the last war with the present position. I quote the following figures supplied by the Commonwealth Statistician:Population. National Pensions. Increase. Per Capita. Percentage to Pensions. £ £ £ Per cent. 5,411,000 546,000,000 7,000,000 £100 per year 1.3 7,000,000 1,000,000,000 8,000,000 1,000,000 £145 per year .8 50 per cent., as it should do in accordance with the comparative daily wages paid to soldiers in the last war and this war. The committee cannot sidestep these facts. The Minister for Repatriation will not dodge the issuu by moving from one foot to another in endeavouring to justify the proposed increase of 20 per cent, on the one hand and 66$ per cent, on the other. The Minister must give better reasons than he has given for the 20 per cent, proposal before the committee will support it rather than the amendment moved by the honourable member for Warringah. the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender) and the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Harrison), I should like pensions for returned soldiers and their dependants to be much more liberal than is proposed in the -bill, and I am sure that all honourable members share that view. The fact remains that the all-party committee, on whose report this legislation was framed, and which was composed entirely of returned soldiers, recommended that pensions he increased by 20 per cent.",22,Australian Soldiers Repatriation Bill 1943

78,Mr Harrison,The Government,23,Australian Soldiers Repatriation Bill 1943
79,Mr Morgan (Reid) [3.43],"Lik eThe reasons for that recommendation have been given by the chairman of the committee, the honourable member for Ballarat( Mr Pollard), and other honourable members. The proper way in which to handle this matter is not by delaying the passage of this measure, but by referring the matter to the standing committee on repatriation, which is to be set up. I do not want to delay giving effect to the committee's recommendations for one moment longer than is necessary. The Government has made its financial arrangements for this year in accordance with the terms of this bill. I remind honourable members that the Senate challenged this House the other day. If there were an election and a change of government, there would he no guarantee that this legislation would be proceeded with. The honourable member for Parramatta ( Sir Frederick Stewart) was Minister for Health in the government which introduced the national health and pensions insurance scheme, but did not proceed with it because it could not find £2,000,000 with which to do so. It was left to a Labour government to introduce a national welfare scheme for the people at large and this bill for -the benefit of returned soldiers. I point out to honourable members that the agitation has not been against the proportionate increase of the pensions so much as against the meagreness of the pensions themselves. The Sydney Daily Telegraph carried out its agitation for an all-round increase of repatriation pensions on -the ground that men wounded in heavy fighting abroad were given pensions so parsimonious that they had to go to work before they were fit. The municipality of Narrandera circularized other municipalities in an endeavour to create an agita.tion for an increase of repatriation pensions. circular set outThere are men in Narrandera who have been discharged from service in the present Avar as medically unfit, and for pension are receiving a mere pittance. To receive only a small pension the onus is on the discharged man all the time, and he has to fight hard to secure even a small pension. No doubt there are similar cases in your area. The complaints that the pensions are parsimonious would not be overcome by an increase of 20 per cent., 50 per cent., or, in some cases 100 per cent. The problem Mr Morgan. is one of administration. Many of the complaints of returned soldiers in that respect will be overcome by this legislation. For instance, the onus of proof is transferred from the appellant to the ,Repatriation Commission, and the medical boards, assessment tribunals and entitlement tribunals. I think that that will ensure a larger measure of justice to applicants for pensions. Legal aid will be provided to returned soldiers in placing their claims before the various tribunals. The personnel of the commission is to be increased, and thereby the administration will, be strengthened. One of the most important improvements of tlie repatriation system will be the creation of the standing committee. Whatever complaints arise will be investigated and reported on by that committee. That should overcome many anomalies. When the strain of war is ultimately lifted, this country ought to be able to bear a larger increase of war pensions because the increased productivity of war-time should be reflected in peace-time. If this Government remains in office, further sympathetic consideration will be given to the matter. Honourable members should not accept the statement that an increase of the rate of pension by 50 per cent, will involve an additional annual expenditure of only £2,500,000. When repatriation benefits are granted to returned soldiers from the present war, the annual pensions bill may be £20,000,000 or £30,000,000. Consequently, it is erroneous to contend that an increase of the rate of pension by 50 per cent, will not involve a substantial additional sum. Parliament should ensure that the increase recommended by the parliamentary committee is granted, and if some honourable The members still consider that the pension is inadequate, the matter should again be submitted to the committee for consideration. [3.53] -The Minister for Repatriation ( Mr Frost), in introducing this measure, stated that the recommendation which is now -being attacked hy this amendment was probably the most important provision in the bill, because it increases the rate of war pensions by 20 per cent. The estimated cost of the",23,Australian Soldiers Repatriation Bill 1943
80,Mr Duncan,"HUGHES (Wakefield)increase immediately is £1,620,000 per annum. Consequently, honourable members have now reached the heart of the hill. Those who were not members of the parliamentary committee have the responsibility of seeing that returned soldiers are treated fairly. I .approach this matter, not with highrequest I sent the relevant documents on flown disquisitions upon the cost of living, or with comparisons with the cost of living in the past, but from the standsired to examine them and give to point of common sense, as the honourable member for New England( Mr Abbott) advocated yesterday, although there was some doubt whether he displayed that qualification to the degree which we believe him to have it. What is the position regarding this recommendation? First, the increase of 20 per cent, was recommended by the parliamentary committee, whose proposals, in the main, are incorporated in the bill; secondly, this recommendation has been approved hy the Government. scrutiny by the Repatriation Commission. gines that would be so, because the Repatriation Commission is the responsible body. should not decide whether the rate should be increased by 20 per cent, or any other figure! ments of the Repatriation Act may be properly referred to the Repatriation Commission for opinion, although Cabinet makes the final decision. member suggest that the Repatriation Commission should be asked to express an opinion as to whether the pension should be increased by 20 per cent, or 50 per cent.? Order! Wakefield is not obliged to answer the interjections of the honourable member for Wentworth. delighted to answer them. From his ministerial experience, the honourable member should know that it is only common sense for a Minister to consult with his department regarding .action to be taken. My third point is that returned soldiers' organizations in all States, with only one exception, have approved the increase of 20 per cent. Many returned soldiers live in my electorate, and at their repatriation post-haste to some of them for their consideration, because they demembers the benefit of their views. It may be only chance, but weeks have elapsed since I despatched those papers, and not one of the sub-branches has written to me to express its opinion upon the matter. Fromtheir silence, I can only .assume that they are, on the whole, satisfied; they do not consider that an increase of 20 per cent, is unreasonable. I am never over-inclined to give away to any committee my own right of personal judgment. A committee is advisory. Honourable members have the right to after decide whether they will adopt its recommendations. But the six members of the parliamentary committee represented very different political views, and each member personally had qualifications to express an opinion on this matter. Two members of the committee -Senato r Collett and the honourable memformer Ministers for Repatriation. Senator Collett is a man of very fair judgment. For that matter, I do not query the judgment of the other members. I have much respect for the honourable member for Ballarat( Mr Pollard), who made an excellent speech on this subject, just as did the honourable member for honourable member for Moreton is never inclined to underrate the claims of returned soldiers. Their recommendation of an increase of 20 per cent., taken in conjunction with governmental approval, and the approval, tacit or expressed, of The honourable member for the soldiers' organizations, makes a very strong case for the adoption of the proposed increases. I go so far as to say that, although Government supporters, in general, are not so enthusiastic about the claims of ex-soldiers as are honourable members on this side of the committee, such an imputation cannot be",24,Australian Soldiers Repatriation Bill 1943

It is not for me to set my judgment against that of the members of the committee on this subject. It is regrettable that six months should have elapsed since the committee's report was furnished. Undoubtedly, some increase of the cost of living has occurred in that period, and further increases will occur in the next six months; but no evidence has been submitted to show that the increase in the last six months has been exactly 15 per cent., or 20 per cent.; in fact, 50 per cent, may be a more likely figure than .20 per cent, in the near future. In my opinion, we cannot dispose of this subject properly by adopting a ceiling or a floor, for it should be considered in relation to the cost of living. The honourable member for New England( Mr Abbott) intends to move an amendment on that point, and I hope to speak to it in due course. It has been claimed that, if war pensions be increased by 50 per cent., the process of inflation will be accelerated; but such action would not have anything like the same acceleratincrease, neither can one be shown for ing effect as other Government actions are likely to have. This Parliament has just agreed to establish a national welfare fund, into which an amount not exceeding £30,000,000 is to be ' paid annually. That figure is considerably greater than the £7,000,000 expended annually for war pensions, to say nothing of our invalid and old-age pensions bill of for Warringah, in the hope that we may. £22,000,000 per annum. As the cost of living figures have been related to invalid and old-age pensions, surely they should be related to war pensions, for, with all due respect to invalid and old-age ject might show that some beneficiaries pensioners, this country owes far more to its war pensioners. I am concerned to ensure that ex-soldiers and their dependants shall receive a fair deal; but I am not here to urge that war pensions shall be increased by 50 per cent, if I do not consider that such an increase is justified. I consider, however, that war pensions should retain their value in relation to the purchasing power of money. I intend to vote for the clause, and I shall do so with a perfectly clear conscience, though doubtless some of my constituents will disagree with me on the point; but I consider that a more scientific approach should be made to pension rates, and that they should be varied in accordance with the increase or decrease of the purchasing power of money. matta) [4.5] -Despit e the innuendoes that have been thrown across the chamber to the effect that honourable members who are supporting an increase of war pension rates by 50 per cent, are actuated by political motives, I have not the slightest hesitation in supporting the amendment. The Minister( Mr Frost) has said that this proposal has no scientific basis. His statement was not original; in fact, it could have been taken from my second-reading speech, for I admitted that a completely scientific basis could not be found for a 50 per cent, increase. I pointed out, however, that a basis could be found for an increase of 42 per cent. The rates of pay of soldiers in this war are 42 per cent, in excess of the rates of pay of soldiers in the last war. But, if a scientific basis cannot be shown for a 50 per cent, the Government's proposal to increase the rates by 20 per cent. Last night, the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender) tried, persistently, but in vain, to get the Minister to indicate the basis of the 20 per cent, increase. I shall now add such persuasive powers as I have to the persistence of the honourable member cause the Minister to reveal the exact basis of the '20 per cent, proposal-if one exists, which I doubt. I believe that an analytical examination of the whole subunder this bill should, in fact, obtain an increase of 50 per cent, in their pensions, whilst others may obtain an increase of only 20 per cent. Others may get nothing out of this repatriation bill. I insist, however, that a comparison of the rates of service pay in the last war and in this one may properly be made in considering the rates of pension that should be provided. Pensions of all kinds always bear some relation to the wages and salaries enjoyed by the persons to whom they are to be granted.

92,Sir Frederick Stewart (Parra,"improved tremendously since 1920. Early in 1920, the rate of invalid and old-age pensions was 12s. 6d. a week, though when the rates of war pensions were fixed in that year, invalid and old-age pensions had increased to 15s. a week. The rate of such pensions to-day is 26s. a week, and shortly it will be increased to 26s. 6d. Since 1920, child endowment and widows' pensions havo been provided, and I hardly need to remind honourable members that only this week the Parliament has finally passed a bill to hypothecate an amount variously estimated up to £30,000,000 per annum for social services. I have no quarrel with these improvements. During the twelve years I have been a member of this Parliament I have consistently supported measures for the improvement of social conditions, and while I held ministerial office I had the honour to introduce measures to liberalize certain benefits of this nature. Seeing that civilians are benefiting so substantially from the improved outlook of the nation in this regard, surely 'the men and women who have served the nation at the battle-front, and those who depend upon them, should he given the best assistance that the nation can give them. 'Some reasons can no doubt be advanced against an arbitrary increase of the rate of war pensions by 50 per cent.; but siich reasons as I have heard have not influenced me greatly. In fact, the reasons given by honourable members for opposing this proposal have been most inconsistent and illogical. I have been amazed to hear some honourable members argue that the nation cannot afford such an increase. As the honourable member for Beid( Mr Morgan) is always, and sincerely, in the forefront of movements for social reform, I was astonished to hear him make such a statement Already this afternoon we have been told that the increase of the pension by 20 per .cent, will involve an annual charge on the Treasury of £1,600,000. If that statement is correct -the basis of it is the report of the special committee, supported hy the second reading speech of the Minister, and we accept it-it is a matter of simple arithmetic to calculate that the addition of 30 per cent, to the 20 per cent, would mean a further charge on the Treasury of [70] £2,400,000. It is true that, as the war proceeds, the number of pensions payable will increase. That, however, would not alter the differential as between the 20 per cent, and the 50 per cent. There is on the notice-paper of this House legislation designed to improve the maternity benefits. Speaking to that bill, the Minister stated that the cost of the extra benefits will be approximately £2,000,000, which is nearly as much as we ask, shall be added to the pensions of returned soldiers. Did honourable members tremble when they were told that the extra cost of the maternity benefits under the proposal of the Government would amount to that figure? Not a bit. That proposal, I hope, will be passed through this Parliament without dissent. I intend to support it. Whatever other reasons may be advanced against more liberal treatment of the returned soldiers and their dependants, I cannot understand the argument of inability to pay. We listened early this afternoon to a lengthy statement by the Attorney-General, setting out the factors which operate when the Government is determining what compensation shall be paid to civilians who are asked to surrender to the Commonwealth their goods or property. The right honourable gentleman went into very great detail; indeed, he apologized for the length of the statement. Did he mention once that a factor which influences the Government in the determination of the compensation that shall be payable is the ability of the Treasury to meet it? Not one word in that strain, and rightly so. If the ability of the Treasury to meet the cost is not a factor to be taken into consideration when Australians are surrendering goods or property, surely we should not make it a factor when women are surrendering their husbands; children, their fathers, and soldiers their lives. For the reasons which I gave when I made my second-reading speech, I support the proposed increase of 20 per cent. Quite a number of speeches have since been delivered, some of them in advocacy of the increase of 50 per cent., which the amendment of the honourable memher for Warringah ( Mr Spender) proposes. The honourable member for ,",26,Australian Soldiers Repatriation Bill 1943
93,Mr Pollard (Ballarat) [4.13j,"tor Collett, and the honourable member for Moreton( Mr Francis), probably had more distinguished military records than had the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Harrison). The view that tliey have expounded in their support of an increase of 20 per cent, is eminently sound. Moreton and Senator Collett have been Ministers for Repatriation. There were frequent agitations for increases of pensions during the regime of governments supported by the honourable member for Parramatta ( Sir Frederick Stewart). I vividly recollect the occasion when, from the benches opposite, I urged that an increase should be granted, in view of the lowering of the purchasing power of money compared with what it was when the pensions were fixed. The honourable member for Wentworth, who was either Minister for Repatriation or at all events a supporter of the then Government, remained quite unmoved. I do not believe that he gave the slightest indicaration every body, including the honourable tion of being interested in the matter, notwithstanding the fact that there had been a distinct upward move of the cost of living and that the purchasing power of money had depreciated materially. When one hears the honourable member characteristically assert that the increase ought to be 50 per cent., one wonders whether he has ever been or ever will be consistent, and whether he is merely playing to the gallery. There is one feature of his speech to which some attenhonorable member's speech should be tion should be paid. As usual, he introduced a story concerning a group of men in a certain city factory who, according to him, are earning extraordinarily high rates of pay. He did not elaborate the reasons for their high earnings. in a munitions establishment. gentleman omitted to state that high wages are earned by men not only in munitions establishments, but also in every other walk of life. Members of Parliament earn substantial incomes. Why should he always stigmatize the munitions workers? If they are earning extraordinarily high wages-whic h I deny-the reason is that early in the war t the Government of which the honourable gentleman was a member acknowledged its adherence to the continuance of Australian rates for civilian workers during the war. Does the honourable gentleman wish to depart from that policy ? Does he say that all our industrial awards should be scrapped and that we should cease to allow munitions workers to earn overtime The honourable member for rates during long hours of fatiguing work? Does he realize that munitions workers, members of Parliament, and -business men are the fathers, sons, daughters and relatives of the fighting men whose welfare we are now considering ? The returned soldier is the last man who would want to reduce the standard of the men in the industrial field because he knows ful l well that, if the income of the munitions worker-and , perhaps, the member of Parliament-is reduced, he will be due for a reduction of his standard when he returns to a civil avocation. The only way in which equity may be achieved in the payment of men who are in the forces and in civil employment is to member for Wentworth. industrialist and soldier on the same wage. Order! I remind the honourable member for Wentworth that the Chair has certain feelings and a limited endurance. It does not propose to endure the honourable member much longer. examined along the lines I have indicated, and should be exposed. He is aware that, in the group which he has mentioned, there may be returned soldiers of the last war, doing splendid service in a civil capacity. Does he desire that they should not be recompensed for the .additional exhaustion that is caused by their service during long hours in the factory? I hope that he does not; but His speech would indicate that he does. The honourable member for Parramatta ( Sir Frederick Stewart) and others have asked upon what scientific basis the committee recommended an increase of 20 per cent.

However, the committee did ask itself what factors it should take into consideration in arriving at a just estimate of the pension rate. It did compare the purchasing value of money in 1914-1S with that of the present time, and it found that the value of money had declined by 12 per cent. However, the committee did not recommend a 12 per cent, increase of pensions, because* it recognized that other factors were involved, and so it arrived at a figure of 20 per cent. for all the other factors? ber for Warringah ( Mr Spender) should not insist upon a too scientific valuation of services. briefed in a law case he might, if the judge were in a favorable mood, w in a verdict for his client for £20,000, and draw a fee for himself of £5,000. We also took into consideration the fact-and this weighed with soldiers' organizations, too-that 87 per cent, of pensionable men are, as members of the community, earning incomes as great as they are capable of earning. Other factors were taken into consideration, but I do not think that I ought to reveal them to the honourable member for Wentworth, the honourable member for Warringah, and others. Both the honourable member for Wentworth and the honourable member for Parramatta made great play on the fact that the Government had introduced a scheme of social welfare which was to cost £30,000,000 a year. However, they did not point out that the returned soldiers, and their wives and children, What would themselves be beneficiaries under that scheme. The honourable member for Parramatta referred to increased maternity benefits. I ask h i m, w ill not the wives of soldiers share in that benefit The honourable also? In the circumstances, how can we take any notice of the senseless prattle of the honourable member for Wentworth ? I congratulate the honourable member for Lilley( Mr Jolly) on the common-sense views which he expressed. He has six sons in the fighting forces, and he, if any one, should be concerned for the welfare of the soldiers. The fact that he supports The answer is that those who the Government's proposal indicates that it is essentially fair. The honourable member for Robertson ( Mr Spooner) also took a common-sense view of the matter. For my part, I am in favour of an increase of 50 per cent, or 60 per cent., or 70 per cent., or .any old percentage you like, but one cannot overlook the fact that it is necessary to preserve some relation between benefits to soldiers and benefits to members of the civil community. I hope that this clause will be agreed to, and that the 20 per cent, increase will be maintained. There is nothing to prevent the standing committee on repatriation, when it is appointed, to inquire into the matter further, at the request of the Minister, or the Repatriation Commission, or the returned soldiers themI f he were selves.

I have no hesitation in adding that the returned soldiers' organizations in my electorate have asked me to support this proposal.

That is as it should be, but it does not j u s t i fy the argument that the rate of 20 per cent is justified. This issue cannot be decided on personal matters concerning a man's war record. The honourable member for Ballarat cast a slur on the war record of the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Harrison). kind. I know the worth of the war record of the honourable member for Wentworth. ber for Wentworth had meritorious service. I u any case, this matter should be argued on merit, not on emotion. I shall examine the basis on which the special committee recommended an increase of 20 per cent. The committee is to be congratulated on its report in every respect but shows that the committee went to work with a w ill , in the interests of returned soldiers. That makes it all the more extraordinary that it should have recommended, without stating its reasons, an increase of 20 per cent. Under the heading of ""Rate of Pension"", the committee, in recommendation 24, saidHie committee found that there was reasonable ground for a general increase of the rates of wnr pension. An outstanding factor in this regard was the comparison of rates of pay to members of the forces, and allowances to their dependants with the same items in respect of the 1014 war. In the case of death of a member the rate of war pension in most cases is considerably below the payments received by the dependants, particularly widows with children, by way of members' allotment and dependants' allowances, up to the time of commencement of pension. If there were reasonable grounds for them arriving at that percentage, why did the committee not state them? It very effectively elaborated all its other recommendations. The honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender) has tin avail ingly tried 'to elicit fro m the M in of 100 per cent. Surely then, we are ister for Repatriation the basis on which the increase of 20 per cent, was determined. Either the Minister would not give the information or there was none for him to give. We did elicit from the honourable memher for Corangamite ( Mr McDonald) that the figure of 20 per cent, was made up of 11.6 per cent, for the increase of the cost of living since 1920 and S.4 per cent, for all other factors. That is rather a loose way in which to deal with such an important matter-S. 4 per cent, for "" all other factors""! Any one supportingthe amendment should give his reasons for doing so. We have agreed to 50 per cent, because we think that it is justified by all the circumstances. Opponents I did nothing of the of the amendment have emphasized the fact that the committee which recommended the increase of 20 per cent, consisted entirely of returned soldiers, and asked who were better qualified than returned soldiers to judge the requirements of returned soldiers. The New South Wales branch of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia advocates an increase of 50 per cent. It has been belatedly disclosed that the Victorian branch advocates an one. The formidable document increase of 41.6 per cent., that rate being equivalent to the percentage by which soldiers' pay has been increased since the last war. What happens now to the argument of those honourable, members who say that no one is better qualified than the special committee to say what, in fairness, should be given to the returned soldiers? The New South Wales and the Victorian branches would account for about 70 per cent, of the total membership of the league in Australia. That alone would j u s t if y me in supporting an amendment designed to increase the rate of pension by 50 per cent. I , however, do not rest my case on that consideration. The weighted average of adult wages has increased by 40 per cent, since 1920. I think the cost of living has increased in the same period by 11 per cent. The honourable member for Wentworth, in his admirable speech, demonstrated how the national income has grown from £537,000,000 in 1935 to more than £1,000,000,000 now. That is an increase justified even in erring on the side of generosity to the men who have defended and are defending Australia.""

How then can the Government try to justify increasing the pension of returned soldiers by only 20 per cent. cost of living increased? this matter cannot be determined only on the basis of the cost of living, because the productive capacity of this country has been greatly increased. Consideration has been paid by the Arbitration Court, in determining the basic wage, to the increased wealth of the country. The returned soldiers, particularly those who are incapacitated, are equally entitled to share in the increased wealth of the country. Some honourable members have declared that an increase of the rate of pension to 50 per cent, would necessitate the introcould produce the present output of war duction of a "" means test"".

But regardless of how they vote on this issue I give honourable members credit for advocating what they honestly believe to be correct. I do not impute to them political motives; and I am confident that the committee will ensure that the soldiers will receive equitable treatment. Sir [4.42] I have listened not so much with interest as with amazement to the discussion of this amendment. Most of the opposition to it emanates from honourable members who represent States other than New South Wales. They attacked representatives of New South Wales instead of discussing the merits of the amendment, and loud-mouthed interjectors from South Australia complained that the country could not afford a substantially increased pensions bill.

Of what use would such work be if we had no heroes to fight for us? w-e favour industrial workers in preference to members of the fighting services ? Industrial workers are not subjected to anything like the same dangers and hazards as are members of the fighting services. If I had my way I would put all the wharf-labourers who handle cargo for war purposes on the same rates of pay as soldiers. In fact, I would put members of Parliament, and all other people, on similar rates of pay. In our fight for democracy, there should be equality of sacrifice.

Such an increase would bring the rates into conformity, in some degree, with present-day conditions. I am particularly concerned about the position of war widows with children to maintain. We should do everything in our power to afford them the maximum assistance of which the country is capable. I support the amendment, and I hope that the Government will accept it. The honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender) has moved that the pensions payable to ex-soldiers and their dependants should be increased by a flat rate of 50 per cent, whereas the committee of returned soldier members of the Parliament which considered this bill recommended an increase of 20 per cent. Before proceeding to discuss that issue I wish briefly to appeal again to the Minister to liberalize the payments to widows and orphan children of soldiers. In my second-reading speech I compared the family income of the wife of a man absent with the fighting forces who had three children to provide for, with that of the widow of a soldier who also had three children dependent upon her. I indicated that the wife was 14s. a week better off, even under the recommendations of the committee, than was the widow with three children whose husband had made the supreme sacrifice. After his return to this country the husband may be able to re-establish himself in industry and to increase the family income substantially, but the unfortunate widow is not likely to be able to add much to her income. She will have a full-time job in maintaining a home for her orphan children and will have to depend upon her pension.

I attack the second point of the argument of my friends who are opposed to the increase of 20 per cent. Because high wages are paid to employees of the Civil Constructional Corps, or in secondary industries or munitions establishments, we should not on that account "" go mad "". It is quite wrong to argue that because a worker in a particular factory is receiving a lot of money we should not have regard to what would be just and generous to the returned soldiers. We have listened to speeches by the honourable members for Warringah son), Parkes( Sir Charles Marr), Parramatta ( Sir Frederick Stewart), and Martin( Mr MoCall). All of those gentlemen spoke of the representations for a 50 per cent, increase having been made in New South Wales. ber for Parkes said that the proposal that the increase should be 50 per cent, had been advanced on a representation from New South Wales. I maintain that the representation originated on the foreshores of Sydney Harbour. The remainder of New South Wales, with its is, so far as one can ascertain, on the side of the recommendations of the special committee. honourable gentleman is a long way out. to consider the record of the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes), who is known as "" the little Digger"" and is the idol of the returned soldiers. I invite it to compare the services rendered to returned soldiers throughout the last war and since by the right honourable member with those rendered by the honourable member for Warringah. Would the right honourable gentleman, who has given a life-time of service to returned soldiers, turn them down on this matter? member for North Sydney, I repeat, has given a life-time of service to the returned soldiers, and no man is held by them in higher esteem. He would not do any injury to them; to prevent it, he would give his life. He has not hesitated to stand by the recommendation of the committee after a .thorough examination of it. Let us analyse what we have heard from the honourable member for Warringah. He has stated that, as far back as the 23rd July, 1941, he wrote to the then government, of which he was a member, asking that the pension should be increased by 50 per cent. So far as this Parliament is aware, nothing happened in that respect. Between June and July of last year, every member of this Parliament was written to by the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Repatriation and asked to make any representations or recommendations' he might care to offer as to what might be done to improve the Repatriation Act in the light of the existing circumstances. The honourable member for Warringah had an opportunity to make representations for an increase of 50 per cent., but he did not do so.

160,Mr Francis,"The right honorablereceived from him. I am perfectly satisfied that, had the right honourable member for North Sydney considered in July, 1941, that the pension should be increased by 50 per cent., he would not have waited until to-day, but would have pulled this building down and "" raised hell"" to have the increase made. I regret the necessity to speak in this strain; but I have sat for three or four days under one-sided criticism, and do not intend to take any more of it. I want to make it quite clear that my record of service to returned soldiers will bear comparison with that of the honourable member for ""Warringah. ""When I entered this Parliament, I was an original member of the State managing council of the-Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, in Queensland. I had been district president in my district for three years, and president in my own town for more than three years. I should not ask returned soldiers to accept an increase of 20 per cent, if T considered that a higher increase would be proper. Urged by returned soldiers I came into this Parliament in order to serve my former comrades of the Australian Imperial Force. I have been a member of it for about twenty years. At the date of my election, I was receiving a 50 per cent, pension. I have not since collected one shilling of it. Having entered this House to serve particularly returned soldiers, I would not collect any pension, because, if I did so, every effort I made to assist the soldiers and their dependants would benefit me also. By not collecting; my pension, I consider myself free to leave no stone unturned to improve the conditions of my old comrades and their dependants. be proved by a letter which I wrote to the Repatriation Department on the day on which I entered Parliament; the letter is still on the file. The pension that I received while president of the league, I handed to the Distressed Soldiers' Fund. ""With that record, why should I now debate whether the increase should be 20 per cent, or 50 per cent.? This Parliament asked six returned soldiers to examine the matter. They went through the act and regulations, and discussed the matter from many angles for a considerable time. One of the many decisions at which they arrived was that to-day there is more money in the hands of the people, despite heavy taxation, than there has been previously. We considered that, accordingly, the pension ought to be increased. The committee had then to consider the amount of the increase. An infallible rule cannot be laid down; one has to inform one's mind of the facts. The committee sought the co-operation of the Commonwealth Statistician, and learned that between 1920 and 1942 the cost of living had been reduced by 5 per cent. It would not recommend that pensions should be reduced correspondingly. ' The next factor considered was the basic wage, which was found to have been increased by 11.7 per cent. The committee held the view that an increase of pensions by 11.7 per cent, would not be fair. Every member of it considered that the best fighting force in the world should receive the highest pension that could be recommended. We had to base our recommendation upon sound principles. We considered how much costs had risen between September, 1939, and September, 1942. We found that the cost of living had increased by 20.7 per cent., and the basic wage by 20 per cent. Those figures gave us an indication of what the increase should be. We spent more time considering .this matter than any other part of the report, except the question of eligibility. We were on the job almost day and night for 28 days. Every factor was carefully examined, and we eventually came to the conclusion that a 20 per cent, general increase would be the proper thing. We recommended an inThat may crease of 25 per cent, for widows, and one of 66$ per cent, for orphans, and I am prepared to go still higher on that. I am sorry to have to say-and it is not party politics, but a simple fact that there is a drift towards inflation at the present time. I am convinced that the Government is doing things which it should not do; that it is leaving undone things which it should do, and that its actions in this regard are accentuating the drift towards inflation. I am fully alive to that danger, and have put forward proposals to combat it. I have suggested that the members of the joint parliamentary committee on repatriation, who are soaked in the subject, and whose recommendations have been largely, accepted by the Government, should review these matters from time to time. member's time has expired, but if no other honourable member wishes to speak, ho may take his second period now. diers' organizations of New South Wales, with the exceptions stated, have supported the proposed increase of 20 per cent. Had this bill been considered immediately after the parliamentary committee had brought in its report, the committee would have been applauded for what it had done, and the bill would have been accepted. Unfortunately, there has been a delay of six months, and the letter written by the honourable member for Warringah on the 23rd July, 1941, has been resurrected. There is also the request from New South Wales for a greater increase. However, New South Wales is not Australia, though it is a very important part of it. As a matter of fact, all the representatives of New South Wales in this House, except the five who represent electorates around Sydney Harbour, are prepared to accept something less than 50 per cent. Last night, the Minister for Repatriation replied to the second-reading debate on this bill. I appreciate that he could not answer every point raised, but 1 regret that he made no substantial reference to the subject of widows' pensions, and that he did not answer the strong plea of honourable members on this side of the House on the subject of preference to returned soldiers. I regard that as vital, and I hope that we shall have no equivocation on the matter. During the second-reading debate, I suggested that applicants should be reimbursed, if successful, for expenses into-day of an amendment which will have curred in carrying their appeals before tribunals. No soldier may appear a second time before the Repatriation Commission or a tribunal unless he has fresh, relevant evidence to present. In order to get fresh medical evidence, he must consult a specialist, and that costs money. The Minister did not refer to that point, and there is no provision for it in the bill. I have foreshadowed an amendment providing for a full pension for soldiers of both wars who served in a theatre of war and are now suffering from tuberculosis. member may discuss that subject on the appropriate clause. shown clearly that the recommendation of the parliamentary committee for a 20 per cent, increase of the rates of pension was just. It has been accepted by the Government and by a great majority of honourable members as well as by almost all returned soldiers' organizations. Only a limited number is prepared to support the amendment asking for a 50 per cent, increase, and I am convinced that the best interests of returned soldiers are not served by pressing the amendment. Those who do that are, in fact, doing a disservice to the soldiers who will be thereby encouraged to hope that, some day, their pensions, will be further increased. Those who are supporting the amendment know that it cannot be carried, and I regret that it has been moved. -The honourable member for Moreton( Mr Francis) said that I had informed honourable members that the proposal for an increase of the rates of pension by 50 pei cent, had been advanced on a 1 representation by the New iSouth Wales branch of the returned soldiers' organization. That is not so. A t the beginning of my speech I said that, instead of the matter being discussed on its merits, there appeared to be an attack by honourable members from other parts of Australia on certain representatives from New South Wales. I resent this misconstruction of my remarks. The honourable member for Moreton begged the committee to support the recommendations of the special parliamentary committee on repatriation, yet he himself has given notice the effect of varying one of the committee's recommendations. I have not spoken on this bill before, but I have heard the whole of the discussion on the proposal of the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender). I have a great deal of hesitation in voting against the recommendation",34,Charles Marr Parkes Rights Where Would We Be I F They Laid

166,Mr Blackburn (Bourke) [5.20],"of the special committee,, because I think that that body has done a very fine piece of work, and I am particularly influenced by the arguments of my friend, the honourable member for Ballarat( Mr Pollard). Notwithstanding that, I have made up my mind to join the band from New South Wales. In the first place, even the members of the comanittee do not consider themselves hound by the exact terms of their report, because the honourable member for Moreton( Mr Francis) is himself the author of amendments proposing important deviations, which I think I shall support, from the recommendations of the committee. Therefore, no one is bound by the exact terms of the report. I have two points of view on this. The first is that I agree with what was said by the honourable member for Moreton about the inadequacy of the payments to widows and orphans. The honourable member himself suggested an amount for the widow with three children which would be more than a 50 per cent, increase of the pension which she now receives. The honourable member proposes that the amount paid to a widow with three children should be £5 12s. 6d. a week, but the committee recommended £5 Is. 6d. a week. The pension for a widow with three children is now £3 7s. a week; the bill proposes £4 7s. 6d. An increase of 33-J per cent, would give .£4 19s. 4d., and of 50 per cent., £5 0s. 6d. The £1 17s. 6d. a week, and the bill proposes £2 5s. 6d. An increase of 33-J per cent, would give £2 10s., and of 50 per cent., £2 16s. 3d. Those sums do not seem at all disproportionate to the needs of widows and orphans. It is important to notice that the committee paid considerable attention to working out the rates for widows and orphans, but the honourable member for Moreton has now been convinced by the discussion that the committee made an inadequate provision for them, as I think it did. "" member think that there is any section of people more worthy of consideration than the widows and orphans? remind the honourable member that he and the committee elaborately considered the needs of widows and orphans, and recommended for them an amount which is lower than that which the honourable member is now prepared to concede. My other point is that this represents what we may call the ceiling of social benefits. The benefits that are to be given to civilians under the National Welfare Fund Act will not in any way reach the amounts that will be given to the incapacitated soldiers and their dependants. In the words of the German proverb, ""The tree will not reach the heavens "". If we fix low benefits for the injured soldiers and their dependants, then much lower benefits will be fixed for civilians and their dependants. We have an illustration of that in our legislation to-day. The allowance to the wife of an incapacitated member of the forces is to be increased from 18s. a waek to £1 2s. In other legislation it is proposed that the wife of an invalid --pensioner shall receive 15s. a week. I want to see as liberal a scheme of benefits as is possible given to the civilians, who will benefit under the national welfare scheme. I do not know what is to be given to them. The scheme so far is nebulous. But I am sure that, whatever we give to the soldiers and their dependants will be more than what we shall give to the civilians and their dependants. Therefore I want to ensure that the soldiers and their dependants shall be given as much as present rate for orphans is we can give to them, in order that civilians shall also receive further social justice. A great deal of play has been made with figures in this discussion, and reasons have been adduced why the pensions should be increased by 50 per cent., or some other proportion. Some arguments have been based on the cost of living in 1920 as compared with 1942, others on the basic wage in 1922 as compared with 1942, and others on the general earnings of the community. Varying groups of figures could be cited according to the the honourable arguments that the different proponents wanted to support. WhatI am concerned with is the fact that this is a money bill, and therefore cannot be amended without the agreement of the Government and without being withdrawn.",36,Charles Marr Parkes Rights Where Would We Be I F They Laid

170,Mr Spender,"That is quite wrong.member has moved for the postponement of the clause instead of directly moving for a straight out increase of the rate of pension by 50 per cent., as he can achieve his objective in no other way. The honourable member has moved for the postponement of one of the most vital clauses in the bill. amount to the postponement of the bill itself? The bill cannot operate if that particular clause does not operate. As one with the interests of the returned soldiers at heart, I regard it as wrong to ask for the postponement of a bill which proposes benefits to people who are in very great need. I shall cite figures to show the benefit that will flow to a large number of individuals in this community immediately this bill becomes operative. The blinded soldier, with a wife three children receives, when the husband and three children, receives £4 a week for himself, 18s. for his wife and £1 2s. 6d. for his children, and £1 attendant's allowancea total of £7 0s. 6d. This bill proposes to raise the amount to £8 9s., an immediate benefit. The honourable member for Warringah, in order to put forward some specious amendment into which he has been propelled by certain organizations in and around Sydney, would ask for the postponement of that benefit, but I desire it to be given immeher in any financial sacrifice. diately. The totally and permanently incapacitated soldier, with a wife and three children, now receives £6 0s. 6d. a week. The bill provides that he shall receive £7 5s. a week, an increase of £1 4s. 6d. Honourable members may argue until they are black in the face whether the percentage should be based on the cost of living in 1914, 1920 or 1942; but what concerns the pensioners, who need the increase, is that they will receive the that the Government will consider inadditional payment as soon as the bill becomes law. Therefore, this legislation should not be delayed. A soldier, 100 per cent, incapacitated and unable temporarily to engage in any occupation, with a wife and three children, now receives £5 2s. 6d. a week. When the bill becomes law, he will be paid £6 3s. a week. If the Government agrees to postpone the clause, the bill will be delayed and the increased benefits that this measure will confer, will be held up for a considerable period. I hope that the Minister will not accede to the request of the honourable member for Warringah. To ask honourable members to agree to the postponement of the bill is not to serve the interests of those who will benefit under the measure. I am not completely satisfied with all the recommendations of the parliamenDoes that not tary committee, and I contemplate submitting amendments to two clauses. However, I congratulate the committee on its fine work. No matter how the committee was constituted, other honourable members would still have found possible grounds for criticizing its recommendations. I find no fault with any of its proposals, but consideration could with advantage be given to one or two matters. I refer, in particular, to the financial position of a widow and her children. A wife with is alive, allowances totalling £5 ls. 6d. a week. If he is killed, her allowances are immediately reduced to £3 7s. a week. When the bill becomes law, the amount will be increased to £4 7s. 6d. a week. WhilstI am in favour of that increase, I ask the Minister to consider, in the near future, the advisability of restoring to the widow and her family the income that she was paid when her husband was alive, so that his death will not involve the necessary amendment now? be considered by the parliamentary committee. The bill makes a substantial advance by increasing the payment to the widow and her family by £1 a week. That amount is still inadequate, but I believe creasing it. I have not spoken in favour of the amendment for increasing the rate of pension by 50 per cent, but I point out to the supporters of the amendment that some of the proposed allowances to children represent an increase of 66$ per cent. Figures can be manipulated to suit every argument, but what the pensioner will understand is that as soon as the bill is proclaimed, he will receive substantial additional payments. To him, that is the all-important thing.",37,Charles Marr Parkes Rights Where Would We Be I F They Laid

173,Mr Anthony,"The matter should[5.38] I did not participate in the debate on the motion for the second reading of the bill, because every honourable member was in agreement with it, and a prolongation of the discussion would have been neither necessary nor helpful. Now, however, the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender) has submitted an amendment to increase the rates of pension by 50 per cent. I do not support it. The circumstances in which the amendment reached this chamber are, to say the least, unusual and they are not, to my mind at any rate, likely to redound to the general welfare of the returned soldiers. Certain representatives of the Sydney press, who met me more than once in Martin-place during the summer, were most interested, for some reason that they did not explain to me, in securing undertakings from members of the Parliament of the Commonwealth, to submit motions for very substantial increases of soldiers' pensions. I dustrious person, I have examined the did not agree to give to the press any of my ideas regarding what should be done. . In my opinion, the Government has handled this matter with a great deal of acumen, which has not distinguished its treatment of certain other questions. the tail of that compliment. honourable member for Ballarat( Mr That is rather remarkable. Pollard) invited me, as he invited every other honourable member, to submit to the parliamentary committee recommendations for the improvement of the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act. In reply, I told the honourable member that I considered the committee was "" a jolly good one "", and that I had perfect confidence that its members, all of whom came from different walks of life, would reach a conclusion fair to the returned soldier. The members of the committee were on the spot; they had every bit of evidence which could be gathered on the subject; and they had the opportunity to consider the evidence in detail. I think the committee did a good job. I deprecate the attempt that is now being made to indicate that certain honourable members on both sides of the chamber are not prepared to do all that should be done for returned soldiers. This amendment has been moved by the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender). If my memory serves me correctly, the first intention was that it should be moved by the honourable member for Parkes( Sir Charles Marr). honourable member read that statement in the press. may be so. Unfortunately, in this country, we are obliged to depend upon ihe press for a good deal of information that should reach us through other channels. We get very little information from some sources that should be freely open io us. If I have been misinformed on this point, so have other honourable members. The honourable member for Warringah has been a member of this Parliament for a number of years. I well remember his arrival here. Being an inpages of Hansard, and they reveal to me that for some time the honourable gentleman was an independent member, but that later he became a member of the United Australia party, to which I belong at present. Subsequently he was a Minister. According to the Hansard index the speech the honourable gentleman delivered on this subject the other night was the first he has made on it in this Parliament. As a member of the Menzies Government the honourable member in July, 1941, felt moved to write a letter to the head of the Government of which he was such a distinguished member as the Minister for the Army recommending an increase of pensions by 50 per cent. I do not challenge the honourable gentleman's right to write such a letter, but I say that many circumstances in relation to army finances have altered since then. I was a member of the Government of which the honourable member for Warringah was Treasurer, and I say, too, that the honourable gentleman's attitude on financial questions now is a revelation to me. If he was satisfied that a 50 per cent, increase of pensions was justified in 1941,1 cannot understand how he can be satisfied with such an increase now, seeing that both the cost of living and the remuneration of the troops have increased since then.",38,Charles Marr Parkes Rights Where Would We Be I F They Laid

There is one quality of which I shall not boast at present, but which I admit I hold and share to some degree with the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell). It is a tendency to say things in this Parliament at times which may not suit some of my colleagues. The honourable member for Melbourne has distinguished himself in that regard on one or two recent occasions, but I do not know that he has quite collected the laurels. I make these observations in order to get in early. If I do not make them other honourable gentlemen may do so. The crux of this question in relation to the honourable member for ""Warringah is that, having made the discovery in 1941 that pensions should be increased by 50 per cent., this is the first occasion on which he has found it advisable to say anything about it in Parliament. That fact will take a little explaining. plain it. no doubt that the honourable gentleman will be able to split a few silk threads, but talking is one thing and convincing the other fellow is another. I have not been convinced by the honourable gentleman, is never convinced by any one who disagrees with him. opinion would not be worth two pence if I could be convinced by people who disagreed with me. We are in this Parliament, because we hold certain opinions. In the long run, however, we shall be judged by our records. Some of us could have made suggestions equally as florid as those made by the honourable member for Warringah had we been so minded; but I thank Heaven that we were not. Therefore, I stand with the Government on this issue. I also stand with the committee in which I have complete confidence. I stand, too, with the honourable member for Moreton (Mir. Francis) who is in charge of this debate on the Opposition side of the House. I compliment him on having just made what I believe remarks are to be one of the most effective speeches he has ever made in the Parliament. honourable member for Richmond( Mr Anthony) has summed up the position. He has said that if the amendment be carried the passage of the bill may be delayed and many people may be deprived, for some time, of the benefits which it provides. If a political crisis should occur during the period of postponement for further consideration it may happen that the measure will never be passed, and, therefore, many people would lose the benefits which the bill provides. Et is unfair to say that the benefits provided by the measure are limited to a 20 per cent, increase of pension rates. As the honourable member for Moreton( Mr Francis) pointed out, the benefits in certain cases will amount to 66 per cent. I understand that the Government intends to accept certain amendments relating to the treatment of tubercular soldiers. If it does so, some people who draw pensions under this heading will receive an increase of their pensions by more than 100 per cent. I regret that the honourable member for Parkes( Sir Charles Miarr), perhaps inadvertently, and in the tension of debate, suggested that members of the fighting services should return to Australia and fight for their rights. I do not think that that was a proper observation to make, particularly as our soldiers know that a government is in office which will treat them with full sympathy and will, itself, fight for their welfare. I remind honourable members that a parliamentary standing committee on repatriation is to be appointed, and that if need arises for a reconsideration of pension rates at any time that committee will give consideration to the subject. It will also be available to consider remedies for any anomalies that may be revealed. I suggest to the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender) that when on any future occasion he is afforded the opportunity of submitting a case to the committee appointed to consider repatriation, he should accept it, for I assure him that any representations he may make will be sympathetically considered.",39,Charles Marr Parkes Rights Where Would We Be I F They Laid

185,Mr Morgan (Reid) [5.47],"Th ealready expressed my appreciation of what has been done by both the Government and the special committee which was appointed for the purpose of preparing a report for submission to the Government. I very much regret the personalities that have been imported into the debate. It is deplorable to find some members charging others with insincerity in advancing what they consider might be of benefit to returned soldiers. The honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender) has done what he considered was right, and the committee must applaud him for the presentation of his amendment, even though there' is no likelihood of its being accepted. The honourable members for Wentworth ( Mr Harrison) and Parramatta ( Sir Frederick Stewart), and other honourable members, have supported it. The statement that it originated in "" a little wayside village like Manly"" does not carry any weight. Bo matter where it originated, it was taken up subsequently by the main body of returned soldiers in New South Wales, and was sponsored in the sub-branches throughout the State. Every sub-branch has wired its representative in this Parliament, to support whatever was recommended in the resolution that was carried by a gathering of New South Wales returned soldiers at a meeting held in the Sydney Town Hall. I have received a large pile of telegrams from subbranches in my electorate. I did not commit myself to support an increase of 50 per cent., because I had not seen the report-whic h had not then been released by the Government-o r the provisions of the bill. When I did see them, I told the members of different subbranches that I favoured a substantial liberalization of the pensions, and considered that, an increase of 20 per cent, was inadequate. I still hold that view, and consider that more should be done. No amount of money can repay the returned men and their dependants for what they have done on behalf of the nation. Although the germs of tuberculosis may have been dormant in some men before they left Australia to fight abroad, the hardships and other conditions that they endured must have aggravated their condition and have caused them later to become completely helpless. These men have given their service, whilst others have given their lives, leaving widows and children who are dependent on the nation for their support. The honourable member for Moreton( Mr Francis), in an endeavour to force others to accept his idea, made a deplorable atttack on the honourable member for Warringah. I have already congratulated him on the excellence of the report of which he was a signatory, and the care which obviously was exercised in its preparation. But every member of this committee is not obliged to accept the recommendations of the special committee. Although we appreciate what it has done, we still have the right to express our opinions; otherwise, there would be no need for a parliament, because the business of government could be left to committees. The honourable member for Moreton endeavoured to draw comparisons between the services rendered to returned soldiers by the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) and the honourable member for Warringah. That was the most deplorable' spectacle ever witnessed in this chamber. All ""of us know what the right honourable member for North Sydney has done for returned soldiers and the nation. He is not only respected, but also revered, by every returned soldier in the Commonwealth, as wel] as overseas, for what he did in the last war. He still loves all the returned men, and the nation which he then led, and would give his life, if need be, in their service, fighting for therm to the last. That is the spirit of the man who has been such an asset to this country. But 25 years ago he was .in his heyday, whereas the honourable member for Warringah was hardly out of knickerbockers. Yet the honourable member for Moreton has attempted to draw a comparison between the two men, in order to induce honourable members to support his idea. I repeat that the proposed increase of 20 per cent, is totally inadequate; consequently, I shall vote for a higher rate.

201,Mr Abbott (New England) [6.9].,"to pin myself down to any particular figure. This discussion has not changed my attitude, as stated .by me last night. I do not think that it can be denied that the repatriation pensions were based originally on the rates of pay of Australian soldiers in the last war. The New South Wales branch of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia has pointed out that the rate of pay of soldiers in this war is 41.66 per cent, higher than in the last war. Although 'there must be a connection between'the pay of serving soldiers and the pensions of repatriated soldiers, I do not know that pensions and pay should be increased in exactly the same ratio. A measure of justice would be given to returned soldiers if pensions were increased all round by 33^ per cent, and not 20 per cent., as is proposed in the bill. I would support an amendment designed to increase them by 33^ per cent. I deplore the low level to which this discussion has sunk. The war services of honourable members have been compared. My war services were lowly, but I tried to do my bit in serving for four and a quarter years in the front line. When personalities are indulged in not only from one side of the committee to the other but as between honourable members in the Opposition parties, it is no wonder that the people are beginning to hold Parliament and its members in contempt. My sensibilities were shocked when I heard one honourable member on this side of -the committee question the motives of the honourable member for Warringah' ( Mr Spender) and insinuate that he had moved for the postponement of this clause in order to prevent the repatriation bill from becoming law during the present sessional period. I hope that the rest of the discussion will be at the high level which the subject deserves. Sitting suspended from 6.15 to S p.m. [Quorum formed.] necessity for preserving the purchasing power of war pensions by periodical adjustments in order to meet the increasing cost of living. this objective, I shall move in committee the amendment that I forecast when amendment). speaking on the motion for the second The committee divided. reading of the bill, and I hope that the Government will accept it. -Last night I commended the Government upon its action in introducing this bill, but I intimated that I would support the proposal for increasing the rate of pension by 50 per cent. I realize that the Government will not agree to the amendment. If the committee accepted it, the Government, which has to provide the necessary finance, would probably withdraw the bill. I am committed to support the proposal, because, in my electorate, twenty sub-branches of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia have asked me to vote for it. AlthoughI pointed out to them that a parliamentary com : mittee, consisting of returned soldiers, recommended an increase of 20 per cent., my experience of soldiers is that they are more severe on their own kind than ordinary citizens would be. I object to the tendency of certain honourable members to stigmatize as insincere other honourable members who advocate the increase of 50 per cent. I am sincere, and I have given my reasons for supporting the proposal. The honourable member for' Warringah ( Mr Spender), in submitting his amendment, is just as sincere as are members of the returned soldiers' organizations. I shall vote in accordance with the wishes of my returned soldier constituents. At the same time, I realize that the Government will have to find hundreds of millions of pounds for purposes other than pensions and, therefore, it really rests with the Government to decide whether it will adopt the suggestion of the honourable member for Warringah. I understand that"" later an attempt may be made to adopt the Victorian proposal to increase the rate of pension, by 41 per cent, and, in that event, I shall support it. Surely we can vote calmly and dispassionately upon these issues, without being accused of insincerity when we wish to secure increased benefits for returned soldiers.

On the motion for the second reading of the bill, and later during the discussion of the amendment submitted by the honourable member for ""Warringah ( Mr with the merits of the amendment. In Spender), I explained why I considered that the proposed increase of the rate of pension by 20 per cent was inadequate. I ask the committee to agree to the amendment. .. 8 If this matter is approached dispas54 sionately, no objection can be raised to the amendment. Whatever might have 46 been said of the proposal to increase the rates of pension by 50 per cent., it cannot be applied to this amendment. The Stewart, Sir Frederick parliamentary committee admitted that the proposed increase of the rates of penTellers: sion by 20 per cent, does not rest upon McCall, W. V. a scientific basis.

A further factor is that the increase in the soldiers' rates of pay is 41 per cent. It is obvious that we cannot find a precise formula to determine what the exact percentage of increase should be, but those three factors should assist the committee in coming to a reasoned conclusion. I do not wish to go into the matters dealt with by the honourable member for Moreton( Mr Francis) this afternoon. The less we engage in personalities and odious comparisons in this matter, the better it will be for the measure and for the committee.

W i th all due respect to the special parliamentary committee on repatriation, its error in this case is evident.

The three considerations that 1 have put forward should compel every honourable member who approaches this subject dispassionately to support the amendment. On the figures given, it involves about. £800,000. In many other matters that have come before Parliament, w it h much less merit in them, we have cheerfully given away much larger sums. evident that the committee is -willing to grant a 20 per cent, increase of the rates of benefit, and is against the proposal for a 50 per cent, increase, but it is quite reasonable that the increase should be greater than the 20 per cent, which the special committee originally proposed. I was unconvinced by the assertion of the honourable member for Ballarat( Mr Pollard) that 20 per cent, was a reasonable increase. When asked by interjection why he insisted on it as reasonable, he replied that some regard was paid by the joint committee to 'the increase of the basic wage, but the rest of the argument which he produced he kept more or less a secret to himself. Whilsti t is difficult to lay down a definite standard for adjusting the rates of benefit, certain factors ought to be taken into account. We should consider the following four most carefully before arriving at a decision: (1) The rates of pay and allowances to soldiers to-day as compared with the same items in respect of the 1914-1S war; (2) the standard of livin g .represented by the average wage sheet to-day as compared with the same thing in 1920; (3) the increased cost of living due to our present economic and financial situation; and (4) the level of pensions that the country can be reasonably expected to bear, having regard to the large numbers who w ill go back to civil life after the end of the war. and also to the other burdens which the country w ill be called upon to bear in respect of reconstruction, including increased services to be brought into being at the end of the war. The joint committee based its 20 per cent, proposal on two factors-.first , a comparison between the rates of pay of the soldiers to-day and in 1914-18, and, secondly, the difference between the basic wage to-day and in 1920. If the committee's recommendation, made on the 14th September, was cost of living, and with it the basic wage, has materially altered since. From the 14th September to the 31st December last year the increase of the cost of living was 2.3 per cent. Since then the rate has gone up considerably, although the actual figure has not yet been notified by the Statistician, or published. The committee could not make the same recommendation to-day as it did in September last, but would have every justification for recommending an increase of at least 25 per cent. The honourable member for Warringah (M.r. Spender) and others have proposed an increase of 50 per cent., based on an entirely different set of factors, namely, the actual difference in the cost of living, combined with the difference in the nominal wage, now and in 1920, representing an increase of about 47 per cent., together with the difference in the soldiers' rates of pay which is 41 per cent. They chose to make it 50 per cent., which on the whole is on the generous side. It is too high when related to the considerations that I have mentioned, and so I find myself unable to support it . A fte r considering all the facts, I have come to the conclusion that the recommendation of the standing committee is too low, and ought to be raised, on to-day's figures, by at least 5 per cent., and, taking into account the other factors, by an additional 5 per cent., bringing it up to 30 per cent, or, in all the circumstances, the 33per cent, proposed by the honourable 1 member for Parkes, whose amendment I therefore support.

The honourable ' member for Warringah ( Mr Spender), who submitted certain -information, will acknowledge that honourable members are entitled to an opportunity to satisfy themselves that it is correct. able member for Corangarnite, who is a member of the special committee. I think that the honourable member said that the committee's basis was unscientific, but I suggest that it is rather unscientific to support a proposal to increase the recommendation of the committee from 20 per cent, to 50 per cent., and then to begin to make stabs at other percentages. It is rather undignified for us to deal with this very important matter in this way. I understand that the Government has stated that it proposes to constitute the special committee as a standing committee on a permanent basis. Honourable members would be well advised to accept the I suggested 25 or 30 per recommendations of the special committee, leaving to the standing committee consideration of the whole of the facts and whatever recommendations it may deem fit to make on the material placed before it. The matter is too serious for us to accept any proposition without further research and a closer examination than can be made during this debate. port what has been proposed by the honourable member for Lilley( Mr Jolly), which, so far as I can see, is the soundest proposition that has been made. At the moment, I am unreservedly in favour of the increase of 20 per cent, recommended by the special committee. It has been pointed out very ably by members on both sides of this committee that the investigation of that body was thorough and complete in every respect. To amend in any way what is proposed would be merely to make as,tab in the dark. I do not impute improper motives to honourable members who suggest alterations ; they have their reasons for doing so. The Government has accepted the proposal for the appointment of a standing committee, and the Minister for Repatriation ( Mr Frost) intends to make provision for it in this measure; consequently, there will be no excuse for a thorough and efficient examination not being made of any matter that is related to repatriation and the welfare of the returned men and women who will come under the provisions of this legislation. We ought to leave the matter as it isincrease the pension by 20 per cent, as has been recommended, and let the standing committee make another investigation and submit a further recommendation if that be considered desirable.",46,Charles Marr Parkes Rights Where Would We Be I F They Laid

220,Mr Baenaed (Bass) [8.31],"I supI am glad that the Prime Minister( Mr We are witnessing from a certain section Curtin) is present, because I . desire to address an appeal to him. The Minister for Repatriation ( Mr Frost) has stated that the Government proposes that the amendment that has been moved shall be rejected. I respectfully inform the right honourable gentleman that last night honourable members on this side endeavoured to induce the Minister to state the basis which, in his view, had been adopted in arriving at the increase of 20 per cent. That information has not been vouchsafed .to the committee. It is not for the committee blindly to accept the report of any body. There has been a full discussion on this matter. The three members of the special committee appointed from this chamber have expressed views as to how the 20 per cent, had been computed. Surely we have sufficient intelligence and judgment to determine whether or not that is sufficient! All that we desire is that not only just but also generous treatment shall be given to the returned soldiers. In view of the figures that I have given to the committee, I should like to know why at least 33 per cent, cannot be considered reasonable. AlthoughI proposed that the increase should be 50 per cent., I am not now inconsistent in supporting an increase of 33 per cent., because, if the major proposition were correct, obviously the minor proposition also must be justified. The major having been rejected, I can still with conviction support the minor. Compared with five months prior to the passage of the original act, by September of last year the basic wage had increased by 25 per cent.; the weighted average wage by 49 per cent.; and-the outstanding fact referred to in the report of the committee-rate s of pay by 41 per cent. Do not those figures afford complete justification for an increase of the pension rates by 33 per cent.? I cannot understand the attitude of the committee to this matter. The Minister protects himself behind the report of the special committee, and reads what is supplied to him by the Repatriation Department. I ask him now to state why, in the light of the three facts that I have given, the Government will not agree to the increase of 33 per cent. of the Opposition-the most inactive section when the special committee was engaged upon its taska disgusting exhibition of a ""Dutch auction "", in which they have demonstrated with great clarity to their own minds, that nothing less than an increase of 50 per cent, can be justified. Having been summarily dealt with by the overwhelming majority of the committee, they have proceeded with a ""Dutch auction"", and are prepared to accept an increase of 33 per cent -the lowest bidder not necessarily being the taker. Let us analyse the remarks of the honourable member who has just spoken. He has appealed to the Prime Minister( Mr Curtin) to overrule the Minister for Repatriation ( Mr Frost). He believes that, by specious pleading, he may divide Ministers on this measure. I inform him that the Government party decided that the bill should be placed before the House in its present form. All Ministers had the opportunity to discuss the matters that have been raised by the honourable gentleman. He has said that he does not find fault with the special committee, but that he has some fault to find with its judgment. The special committee asked every member of this Parliament, if he had any information to disclose, to furnish it in writing or by a personal appearance before it. The honourable gentleman neither wrote to nor appeared before the committee, but with all bis remarkable knowledge, waited until it had come to a decision. ber for Dalley appear before the special committee for the purpose of giving evidence ? satisfied with .the results of its labours. did not know what those results might be. ing the decisions of the special committee.

For the whole of the time during which the Government of which he was a supporter or ,a member had been in office, he had taken no part in an amendment of the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act. I have no recollection of his having reminded his own Government that it based existing rates of pay to soldiers on an act twenty years old. Tet he considers that a decision made five months ago must on that account be debarred. What are the facts? There is not to be a flat rate increase of 20 per cent. The special committee exhaustively examined every section of those, who are to receive pensions from the Repatriation Department. It is true that there is to be an all-round increase of 20 per cent.; but in the most deserving cases -the children of soldiers, who are unable to help themselves-the special committee has recommended, and the Government has accepted, an increase as high as 66$ per cent. I trust that the Government will accept the proposal in regard to tubercular soldiers who are paid the service pension, whereas they are probably entitled to the rate provided for tubercular soldiers-a n increase of over 200 per cent. To say that this is not a generous scheme is simply to beg the question. The honourable member for Warringah has said that the special committee had no scientific basis for its recommendation of 20 per cent. If I am not mistaken, one of the bases upon which he has made his caloulations is that the matter has some relation to the pay of the soldiers. I again remind him that it was the present Government which raised the pay of soldiers to the existing rates. Had the special committee accepted as a basis for computation the pay of soldiers while the honourable gentleman was Minister for the Army, it would have recommended considerably less than the proposed 20 per cent. It bers who occupied prominent positions in previous administrations, such as the honourable member for Warringah, and whose influence was undoubtedly great, did not contribute to an improvement of the circumstances of returned soldiers and. their dependants. was left to a different Government to do something for the returned soldiers who are living, as well as for the relatives of those who have died. were given an increase of f l , and the soldiers ls. not interfered with the rates of pay of munitions workers.

Arbitration Court to which he may appeal. member for Warringah were sincere in his desire to assist the returned soldiers, surely he could have done something while he was an influential member of previous governments. Also, he could have placed his views before the parliamentary committee which examined this matter, either orally, or in writing, to assist that body in arriving at its decision. But he did not do that. Instead, he comes here and says that nothing less than a 50 per cent, increase will meet the situation, and now that that proposal has been defeated, apparently he is prepared to compromise on a 33-J per cent, increase. No doubt, if someone moved that the increase be 25 per cent, he would support the proposal with the same enthusiasm as he brought to the moving of the previous amendment. matta) [8.47] -The Minister for Repatriation ( Mr Frost) has intimated that",48,Charles Marr Parkes Rights Where Would We Be I F They Laid

234,Minister Mr Rankin (Bendigo) [8.55],"1doubt that the Minister for Repatriation has a great deal of sympathy for returned soldiers, but he knows very well that the Government intends to bring down a number of measures that will cost much more than would an increase of war pensions by 33-J per cent. ""We .have already passed a vague social welfare measure which will cost this country £30,000,000 or £40,000,000 a year for the next four or five years; yet the Minister says that it is impossible to agree to a proposal to give an additional £2,000,000 or £3,000,000 to returned soldiers and their dependants. it is impossible. was said. knowledge that the honourable member for Bass( Mr Barnard) has of this bill :and of military matters generally is as scant as his hair. I say to the Minister -and to the honourable member for Ballarat( Mr Pollard), that, in my view, the parliamentary committee has done A good job, although I believe that members of it were obsessed with a single idea: They thought that they could get only a certain amount of money for returned soldiers, and that amount formed the basis of their recommendations. They did not realize that the Government would have the audacity to inaugurate a social service scheme which would cost between £30,000,000 and £40;000,000 a year during war-time; but that has happened. In order to gain the support of people in the lower income group on whom income tax is to be imposed for the first time, the Government announced that a certain proportion of the revenue so derived would be placed in a trust fund and kept for expenditure for social services after the war. . But the truth is that the money is to be used for war purposes. Order! The honourable member must keep to the subject-matter of the bill. Mr Chairman, I submit that I am dealing with the subject-matter of the bill. The question we are now discussing is can we afford to increase by 20 per cent. or 30 per cent, the pensions of the men who are fighting for our very right to exist. now discussing the postponement of clause 3 of this bill, and the honourable member is not entitled to refer to a measure which already has passed through both Houses. ber for Dalley was allowed to speak of a D.utch auction; if there is anything in the bill about that I have not seen it. The honourable member reminded me of the member of his race who said, "" What does it matter so long as we make a profit"" ? When it comes to a little bit of profit for the man who returns to this country with a war injury or suffering from the after effects I am afraid that the of malaria, a little bit of profit is made a big issue. When I hear honourable members opposite speaking of the rights of men who work in munition factories -perhap s I should say "" loaf "" in munitions factoriesI wonder if there is any justice in their minds. When one compares the sacrifices made by men during their years of service in the fighting forces with what is being done by those who work-as they say-in the coal mines, and for whose benefit it is proposed to expend between £30,000,000 and £40,000,000 a year on social services, one is tempted to ask what is wrong with Australia. Does the Government believe that, if it persists in its present purpose, the young men of Australia will on a future occasion rush to the defence of the country ? ving for the sake of the few shillings they get. serving in order to ensure decent living conditions for their wives and children. Why do we fight another nation? For one reason only-becaus e we believe that the conditions of life which that nation would impose upon us if it could are such that Ave would die rather than accept them.

The honourable member for Barker( Mr shall not hesitate to support its recomArchie Cameron)' said that the Government should be judged on what it has done. ""When I consider what the Government has done for the defence of Australia, for the Army, and for the soldiers and their dependants, all I can say is that its proper reward would be not more than a farthing in a hundred years. agree that we are not bound to accept the recommendation of even an all-party parliamentary committee, but before agreeing to accept any proposal at variance with its recommendation I shall want to be convinced that it is based on sound premises. I do not take my stand in opposition to the amendment because I a in slavishly adhering to the recommendation of the parliamentary committee. Neither do I charge with insincerity any honourable member who differs from me on this matter. However, I am convinced that my desire to further the interests of the returned soldiers is as strong as that of any other honourable member. I am now more convinced than ever that the opinion which I expressed during the second-reading debate is correct, namely, that Parliament cannot be expected to weigh figures and statistics, and fix a proper percentage for pensions increases. Those figures must be checked and examined, and this is not the place in which to do it. As one of the few members from New South Wales who do not support the amendment, I say that I shall be just as ready as any one else to vote for higher pensions when a recommendation to that effect is made by a properly constituted committee. As I said yesterday, if the parliamentary committee believed in September last that .a 20 per cent, increase would be a fair one, it might, if it were making its report to-day in the light of changed circumstances, recommend a greater increase, say 25 per cent. However, I am not suggesting that we should decide upon that figure. Before another variation is made, the whole matter should be gone into carefully. I am convinced that the standing committee on repatriation, when it is appointed, will give this question the consideration due to it If it recomdispute, and dragging in the rights and mends, within the next few months, that pensions should be further increased, I mendation. I am eager and anxious to discover ways in which to help the returned soldiers, provided action be taken in the proper way. I am convinced that the Government is doing the right thing in reconstituting the parliamentary committee. It will pursue its inquiries further, and Parliament will have an opportunity later to review the decision we are about to make. [ 9.11] -To a returned soldier it is distasteful that there should be a public debate on this subject of percentage increases. If honourable members think that they are getting on the right side of returned soldiers by precipitating a prolonged discussion on this issue, let me assure them, as one who has had something to do with the league, that they are making one of the worse blunders of their lives. Returned soldiers believe . that -a matter of this kind should be settled without having a dogfight in Parliament. I ask honourable members what we can give to a soldier in return for the loss of his sight. Put that loss in terms of money! Assess in money the loss of a man whose both arms are amputated at the elbows so that he is dependent upon some one else for the very meanest offices in life! How are we to assess his disability? How are we to decide whether his pension should be increased by 20 per cent, or 33 per cent. ? the worse. so. No monetary payment could compensate a man for the loss of his reason. A prolonged and acrimonious debate of this kind is unseemly in a national Parliament. That is why I , as one who has seen some service, have had little to say. I have great sympathy with some of the views expressed by the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Rankin). No one has stood up more manfully than he for the rights of returned soldiers. I maintain that this matter should be gone into carefully without turning it into a public wrongs of returned soldiers and^ thejr dependants.",51,Charles Marr Parkes Rights Where Would We Be I F They Laid

It would have been better, however, if the Government had pushed this bill through earlier instead of going on with its social service legislation. Some of them are of a most fragmentary and nebulous character, and have been referred to as subjects upon which there should be a dissolution of the Parliament and an appeal to the people. Bepatriation problems are of such importance that attention might well have been given to this bill before entering upon the long debate that has' taken place on those other matters. The parliamentary special committee has done good work, and has arrived at a fair decision. Bepatriation matters are a constant and continuing responsibility, which will not end with the passage of this bill. ""We should not say that, after granting a certain percentage increase of war pensions, the position should be left at that. Beturned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia will be an efficient watch-dog over this or any other government. the determination of our obligations to returned soldiers and their dependants to be left to the good sense and judgment of the league, rather than to any permanent parliamentary committee. The reconstitution of the committee is one of the unwise things that the Government has agreed to do, and its action will be regretted by it, or it3 successors in due course; but the responsibility devolves upon this Parliament to see, not only that every soldier who comes back from the war with ' injuries is looked after, but also that every widow, and every child who is left fatherless, is also cared for. That, again, is not a subject that should be discussed in this Parliament for days at a time. A committee representative of all political parties, or, as the honor-""When I submitted the amendment, I able member for Corangamite ( Mr did not make a speech upon it, because McDonald) has said-, consisting of men from the rank of colonel to that of a private soldier, has agreed upon certain recommendations""With great respect for the independence of judgment of the individual-and few honourable members exercise independence of judgment more than I do-surel y this Parliament can agree to what the Government has proposed in this instance, without a lot of fuss and bother, and without giving the impression to the people, outside that we are engaged in a sort of Dutch auction. I say that with a good deal of feeling. gentleman agree that the outlook has greatly changed since the Government has'brought down a scheme for the provision of £30,000,000 or £40,000,000 a year for increased social services? that that change has come about; but, if the financial status of the returned soldier changes much for the worse within the next few months, not this, but another Parliament will put that matter right. This bill is a very fair one, and is a great improvement on any measure of the kind placed on the statute-book for a considerable period. Until sixteen months ago, the Opposition was in charge The of the Treasury, and, as far as my memory serves me, it did' not appoint a committee to investigate the repatriation problems which were not beyond I should prefer the minds of many of us on this side of the chamber. ""We realized that they would naturally arise as soon as men returned from the theatres of war. Every war causes its own problems, and, similarly, the aftermath of war leaves special problems to be solved. ""What happened between 1919 and 1922 will not be a guide to us in deciding what we may have to do to meet the conditions that will arise after the present war. Bealizing the strong claims of the returned soldiers and of those whose menfolk will not return, I am convinced that this bill should be passed without lengthy discussion of the kind to which we have listened in this chamber in the last few days.

The honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron) expressed' the view that this matter should not form the subject of a political discussion; but, because certain honourable members of tbe Opposition have suggested amendments, we now have before us a sheaf of proposed amendments, circulated by other honourable members, providing for increases of the war pensions. honourable member for Moreton( Mr adopted the report of the parliamentary Francis) went out of his way to insult those of us who have espoused the cause of soldiers' widows. My amendment was that the pension should be increased by 13 per cent., yet the honourable member for Moreton has circulated an amendment to provide for an increase of 14 per cent.! Does he imagine that no other honourable member has the right to speak on behalf of the returned soldiers? He desires to have the honour of proposing the successful amendment. Yesterday I spoke on behalf of soldiers' widows, and I invited the honourable member for Barker and other honourable members to meet those women and say to them, "" This poor, God-forsaken country cannot afford to pay to you what you received when your husbands were alive"". invite honourable members to talk to those widows, and to consider the claims of their children. Honourable members can be brave and valiant in this chamber. This afternoon I referred to the men who serve in the malaria-infested swamps of New Guinea. We should ask them what they think about this discussion. IfI were invited to Organize the soldiers of this country to enable them to fight for their rights, I would do it. I will not be guided in this matter by political parties or opinions. whether I remain a member of this Parliament or not; but, so long as I am here, I shall not allow the position to be camouflaged by members who wish to submit amendments and object to amendments being moved by anybody else. I hope that the people of Australia will take cognizance of the fact that this Parliament has no intention to give to the widows and children of soldiers the rates of pay which they enjoyed when their bread-winners were alive. invite the honourable member for Dalley Sir Charles Marr. ( Mr Rosevear), whose electorate adjoins my own, to hold a meeting on the border of the two electorates, so that he may tell the electors that this Parliament has no intention to provide that the widows and children of soldiers shall be maintained at the same level as whentheir husbands and fathers were alive. I was fair in my remarks on the bill yesterday, and I commended the Minister The for Repatriation ( Mr Frost) fpr having ex-servicemen's committee; but we who are advocating an increase of pension rates are accused of having been influenced by representations that come only from New South Wales.

If the honourable member for Moreton has not made up his mind in accordance with the views of his party, that is a good reason for the postponement of the clause, so that he may have further time to consider it. I have been accused, of insincerity, and I resent that. I have not accused any honourable members opposite of being insincere. Two of the four members of the all-party special committee represent this chamber, and both of them have admitted that the proposals of the Government"" are insufficient. The honourable member for Corangamite ( Mr returned soldier members from constituMcDonald) has been eulogized for the speech which he delivered last night. What did he say? He admitted, in effect, that since September the Victorian branch of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia had advanced .the fact that the pay of soldiers had been increased by 47 per cent. The honourable member for Moreton, claiming to be the only one with the right to speak on behalf of the soldiers, has brought along an amendment aimed at increasing the pensions for widows by 14 per cent. I asked the committee to agree to increase the pension for widows by 13 per cent. The honourable member for Moreton now admits that he and the other members of the special committee made a mistake. The amount of increase I propose is lower than that proposed by the honourable member. member's proposal covers a wider field. wider? The special committee admitted that some pensions should be increased by as. much as 66$ per cent. The two cases I mentioned last night are deserving of the utmost consideration. Even if we do not increase the pensions of soldiers, we have a duty to the widows gnd the .orphans, particularly those orphans both of whose parents are dead, and as long as the Lord spares*me breath I will do all in my power to ensure that that duty shall be done. I shall support the amendment which the honourable member for Moreton prober this afternoon eulogized the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes), whose enthusiastic activity on behalf of ex-servicemen no one can doubt or surpass. Yet, although the right honourable gentleman, in his second-reading speech, recommended the acceptance of the bill as being the result of the report of the special committee, he has also brought along a sheaf of amendments. It would appear that only the Minister for Repatriation, members of the special committee, and the right honourable member for North Sydney are entitled to move amendments, and that encies in New South Wales are disqualified. The Minister for Home Security( Mr Lazzarini) may laugh, but if a government formed' from our ranks brought down a bill increasing the rate of repatriation pensions by only 20 per cent, he would be amongst those clamouring for a greater increase. I regret the intrusion of personalities into this discussion. Order! The honourable member's time has expired. Adoption of the amendment moved by the honourable member for Parkes( Sir Charles Marr) for the postponement of the clause for the purpose stated by him would compel the withdrawal of the bill in order that it might be redrafted. About six months has elapsed since the special committee considered the honourable this matter, and it has taken from September to now to get the bill before Parliament. If the amendment were carried it would be another six monthsbefore we should have another opportunity to consider the matter, because, after next week, Parliament will go into a long recess. For the benefit of those who will come within the ambit of this measure, I protest against any postponement, any withdrawal or any redraftingof it, and demand its immediate passage,, in order that the Senate may deal with",54,Charles Marr Parkes Rights Where Would We Be I F They Laid

286,Mr Hughes ( N O R T H Sydney) [9.68].,"although, perhaps, from different anglesit will assist the committee if I deal with them in a general way. Clause 18 proposes to amend section 39B of the principal act, and has relation to what may be termed the onus of proof. Proposed new section 39B is a most important -clause; it gives statutory form to the present practice of the commission, and makes clear that the provision in section -39B of the principal act which relates only to the commission shall extend to the board, an appeal tribunal, and an .assessment appeal tribunal. This provides that "" the commission, board, appeal tribunal and assessment appeal tribunal, in hearing, determining or deciding a claim, application or appeal, shall act according to substantial justice and the merits of the case, shall not be bound by technicalities or legal forms or rules of -evidence and shall give to the claimant, applicant or appellant, the benefit of any -doubt . . ."" By a further proposed amendment of clause IS the position of fche claimant, applicant or appellant is to be improved by deleting the word "" con-elusive"", so that the claimant, applicant or appellant shall have to furnish proof, but not "" conclusive proof"", to support his claim, application or appeal. Clause IS also inserts the following new .section:39c. A medical practitioner shall, in reportin the position where such a reference is ing on any claim in relation to a member of -the forces, set out in his report his opinion(«) in the case of a claim in respect of the death of the member-as to the cause of the death; and (b) in the case of a claim in respect of the incapacity of the member-as to the nature, cause and extent of the incapacity, and shall also set out whether, in his opinion, -the death or incapacity of the memher(v) has been contributed to in any material degree by the conditions of his war service. I desire to amend sub-paragraph v to read(v) has been contributed to in any material degree, or has been aggravated, by the conditions of his war service. .and to have that phraseology adopted in the bill wherever the qualification of a -claimant for a pension is referred to. The word "" aggravated "" is omitted from the 'bill as it now stands. I thought that such Mr Hughes. omission weakened the position of a claimant, applicant or appellant; and after consulting with the Minister and the Attorney-General, it has been agreed that the word ""aggravated"" shall be inserted. In order that the meaning of aggravation shall not be qualified by the words "" in any material d e g r e e t h e phraseology will read in every case as follows, "" contributed to in any material degree, or has been aggravated by, the conditions of his war service "". Wherever the bill deals with the qualification of a claimant, applicant or appellant, and the issue is whether the disability from which the claimant, applicant or appellant suffers is due to war service, or has been contributed to in any material degree by his war service, the following words are to be added, "" or has been aggravated by the conditions of his war service"". The Minister is thoroughly seized of the import of the amendments. I wish only to say, although I do not press the matter, that I should have taken the gravest exception to the clauses providing for reference to a medical practitioner of matters which go to the very root of the claimant's position, were it not for the fact that the honourable member for Moreton( Mr Erancis) has been assured that men suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis will not be placed necessary. I am satisfied that no man, no mattter how expert he may be, can say whether pulmonary tuberculosis from which the returned soldier is now suffering twenty years after the war .is, or is not, due to, or has been aggravated by, war service. But as sufferers from pulmonary tuberculosis are now assured recognition once it is proved that they were members of the military forces, and are otherwise eligible for a pension, the question cannot arise. This will be received by the tubercular men with immense relief. They will get the pension which the bill, as amended, directs shall be paid, and, once given, under section 31A of the principal act cannot be altered or taken away. This benefit is now being extended to service pensioners. Thus, we are free from many of the difficulties which previously confronted us in respect of this particular matter. I urge that the amendments be accepted. They have been carefully considered. The phraseology is somewhat difficult; but I am satisfied that the effect of the amendments w ill be to improve very greatly the position of a claimant, applicant or appellant. It is in the interests of the returned men that these amendments be made. I move That all the words after "" Principal Act"" be left out with a view to insert in lieu thereof the following words:"" is amended(a) by omitting paragraph (a) of subsection (2.) and inserting in its stead the following paragraph:' (o) the incapacity from which the member is suffering or from which he has died has been contributed to in any material degree, or has been aggravated, by the conditions of his war service; and'; and |6) by omitting from sub-section (3.) the word ' Act' (second occurring) and inserting iu its stead the word ' Division'"". eral) member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) has tabled a series of amendments, all of which flow from the alteration which he desires to have made in clause 18, In other words, if any question which which deals with the ""benefit of the is material to the case before any of these doubt"".

As himself responsible for the inclusion of [71] the Repatriation Act now stands the provisions dealing with the "" benefit of the doubt"" and "" onus of p r o of "" are of limited application, for the first one applies only to appeals before the commission, and the other only to appeals before the appellate tribunal. The provision in the bill ensures a much more comprehensive application of these rules, for proposed new sections 39 B and 39c provide that the "" benefit of the doubt"" rule shall apply to the whole range of authorities involved in the legislation. Proposed new sub-section 1 of proposed new section 3 9 B provides(1.) The Commission, a Board, an Appeal Tribunal and an Assessment Appeal Tribunal, in hearing, determining or deciding a claim, application or appeal, shall act according to substantial justice and the merits of the case, shall not be bound by technicalities or legal forms or rules of evidence and shall give to the claimant, applicant or appellant the benefit of any doubt(a) as to the existence of any fact, matter, cause or circumstance which would be [10.11] -The right honourable favorable to the claimant, applicant or appellant; or (It) as to any question whatsoever which arises for decision under his claim, application or appeal. point presently.

Of course the ""benefit of the doubt"" would still be given to the appellant.

I do not think that the word is essential, but the right honourable gentleman considers that it is desirable, and I have no objection to it. Proposed new section 39B (2) deals with the onus of proof, which is placed on the authority that contests the claim. The onus of proof extends, not merely to the entitlement, but also to the degree of pension. Proposed new section 39c is an attempt to give some reality to the real benefit of the doubt. When the medical practitionerand that includes the medical practitioner at every relevant stage, even before the soldier is discharged from the forcesentertains a doubt about the cause of a disability or death, he is required to state that doubt. Where the doubt is as to the cause or to the degree of incapacity, he is under an obligation to state it. Honourable members will see how that provision may work. A medical practitioner can say: "" This injury may have .relation to not. But it could be caused by war service "". In expressions like that, he will indicate his doubt about the whole matter.

The proposed new section goes onto support his claim, application or appeal, but the commission, board, appeal tribunal or assessment appeal tribunal determining or deciding the claim, application or appeal shall be entitled to draw, and shall draw from all the circumstances of the case, from the evidence furnished and from medical opinions, all reasonable inferences in favour of the claimant, applicant or appellant I suggest that the only words there which are material are "" in favour of the claimant, applicant, or appellant"". the phrase ""shall draw . . . reasonable inferences"". obliged to draw all reasonable inferences, whether the section so provides or not. not "" may draw "". words are "" in f avour of the claimant, applicant or appellant"". provides that the tribunal shall draw all reasonable inferences in favour of any person who makes a claim, application or appeal. The vital words are "" shall draw in favour of the claimant, applicant or appellant all reasonable inferences"". That must necessarily leave a great deal of elasticity to the tribunal, and that is why I am directing myself to the concluding portion of the proposed new section, which, I think, is important. It goes onand in all cases whatsoever the onus of proof shall lie on the person or authority who contends that the claim, application or appeal should not be granted or allowed to the full extent claimed. The amendment of the right honourable member for No r t h Sydney, in detail, In particularizing, there alters that portion by reason of its examination of the preceding sub-section 1, but does not alter its substantial character.

The right honourable member for North Sydney has had much longer experience in these matters than any one else in the committee, but I am told that the onus of proof section in the present act has given rise to many disputes. My anxiety is to cast upon the t r i bunal the burden of proving beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant's case should be rejected, and not merely the onus of proof, which is an elastic term and can be elastically interpreted by the tribunal. I do this for the following very definite reason. I know, and every lawyer knows, that if we simply provide for the onus of proof And the word "" all "", in in the act, the tribunal w ill say, "" True, all that is the onus of proof, but there is the evidence, and the conclusion we come to is so and so"". That is the approach made by tribunals. I do not think that gives to the soldiers the protection which It says "" shall draw"", is necessary. I apprehend that that is the view of the committee, and that we The important should force upon the tribunal the burden of excluding any other reasonable hypoThe section thesis for a. man's condition. Therefore, the amendment which I have circulated, and to which I draw the attention of the right honourable member for No r t h Sydney, because it is not my desire to cut across his amendment at all, is put forward by me simply with the desire to make certain that the soldier is put in a position where the tribunal must, in reality, establish and affirm beyond reasonable doubt that his condition or incapacity has no relation to his war service.

323,Mr Spender,"North Sydney has, of course, not altered the question of the onus of proof. ginally put in by me. I have reason to believe that it has not been interpreted in the way intended hy the right honourable member. That is why I have drafted and circulated an amendment to leave out the wordsThe onus of proof shall lie on the person or able doubt, that the applicant is not authority who contends that the claim, application or appeal should not be granted or allowed to the full extent claimed, and to insert in their stead the following words:The person or authority who contends that the claim, application or appeal should not be granted or allowed to the full extent claimed shall prove beyond reasonable doubt that the claim, application or appeal should not 'be fully or partially granted. I agree that that casts upon the commission an additional burden, and intended that it should do so, because in my judgment the onus of proof provisions which appear in the act which we are now amending have proved to be insufficient. The onus of proof provisions in the act do not amount to a great deal when all the evidence has been taken, because the tribunal w ill say, ""Yes, the onus of proof is upon either the appellant or the respondent, but there is the whole of the evidence, and, although we are enjoined by this section to draw all reasonable inferences in favour of the claimant, we do not think that this is a reasonable inference in the circumstances"". much elasticity in that respect, and for that reason we must impose upon the commission the obligation of proving its conclusion beyond reasonable doubt. in the nature of a respondent itself? placed on the commission which makes the decisioin and then has to satisfy itself that it has proved its case. doubt. posal. The clause, apart from making a common rale applicable to all tribunals, makes no provision which is worth very much, and for that reason I seek to impose on the tribunal the obligation of proving beyond reasonable doubt that the claim should not be f u l l y or partly granted, because, when a claimant goes to a tribunal and makes an application or appeal, the tribunal becomes, in effect, the respondent. I am seeking to make certain that its obligation shall be made quite clear-tba t it shall be for the commission to determine, beyond reasonentitled, either wholly or in part, to the relief which he claims. I consider that the matter is of some importance. gentleman consider that the burden of proof is capable of being discharged in a considerable number of cases? Under my amendment, the tribunal would have the obligation of establishing beyond reasonable doubt that the I claimant was not entitled to the relief which he was seeking. have to establish that? himself that he is right. is what happens now under the requirement of the bare onus of proof. Without completely altering the framework of the act, I cannot see how more can be done than to tighten up the provision. I reply, with respect, to the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) that the burden of proof is capable of being There is too discharged; because the commission w ill be acquainted of the details of the man's condition, and w ill have at its disposal all the medical advice. I can see no reason why it should not be told unthe tribunal equivocally that it must exclude any other reasonable hypothesis, and that, if it does not, it must grant the application either wholly or in part.

Irrespective of what the medical man may say, both the commission and the appeal tribunal are being told by the Parliament, in this direct and absolute way, to give to the member the benefit of the doubt. the right to see the decision and the evidence? In the past his chance of doing so has been very slight. is to be moved, dealing with the matter of new evidence. It deals more with reports from additional medical officers. I am confident that this improved provision will make the position in relation to the benefit of the doubt satisfactory. I am also confident that what the honourable member for Warringah seeks to obtain will be obtained in substance by the form of words that has been adopted. different from the one in the present act. Where it is provided that the tribunal shall act according to the substantial justice and the merits of the case, act. However, that should not preclude it shall not be bound by the rules of evidence, and shall give to the applicant the benefit of any doubt. That is the point. We propose to make it clear that the direction shall cover any possible fact or circumstance that might assist the claimant in his case. We also make it clear that the onus of proof shall be reversed, and we provide, in regard to medical evidence, machinery by which the applicant may take advantage of the provision. This amendment makes certain that, before the commission, the Entitlement Tribunal and the Assessment Tribunal, the applicant shall be in a better position than he was before. propose to accept all the amendments of the right honourable member for North Sydney? the first, are consequential. All facts which would be favorable to the applicant must he resolved in his favour if any possible doubt exists. -We wish to make certain the applicant shall receive the benefit of any doubt that exists. All honourable members have had experience of cases in which it would appear that the applicant was not given the benefit of the doubt. I have here particulars of one case in which a man was refused a pension, and I should like to know if , under the new provision, his case may be re-opened. This man was invalided from France to Britain, and from Britain to Australia, with a heart disability, which was recognized during the period from 1918 to 1921. According to the commission, the disability had evaporated by 1933, and was non-existent in 1938, yet in 1940 it returned in the form of total incapacity. The man lost his pension because of his failure to report for medical examination. When the condition returned, and it was established that he was totally incapacitated, his claim for a pension was refused. It would certainly appear that he did not receive the. benefit of the doubt. Of course, it may be that he was penalized because of his failure to report for examination. I believe there is such a provision in the him from consideration now that his disability has returned. The onus should rest upon the commission to prove that his present incapacity is not associated with his former condition. It is not surprising that honourable members, with a knowledge of eases of this kind, desire to put it beyond question that the onus of proof shall rest upon the commission, and that the applicant shall receive the benefit of any doubt that may exist. As honourable members are aware, the commission has files dealing with the cases of applicants, and on these files are confidential documents, including the soldier's medical history from the time of his enlistment. The applicant has no right to examine these papers, nor to know the grounds upon which his application is refused. The commission has the right to challenge the evidence submitted in favour of the applicant, and to examine witnesses called by him. On the other hand, the soldier has no right to challenge any evidence which may be submitted by the commission, or",65,Evatt Undoubtedly The Whether Or Not It Is Satisfactory Does Not

360,Mr Harrison (Wentworth) [10.54].,"examine any of the witnesses. The commission has the right to legal aid, but the soldier is precluded from obtaining such aid. Tribunal, in the case cited, hold that the present condition of total incapacity is not due to war service? already paid a pension to the soldier, it says that the total incapacity due to heart trouble is not attributable to war service, because the old disability has cleared up in the intervening years, and that the present incapacity is due to a new form of heart trouble. I do not know how that could happen. Something must be done to give to the soldier an even break. If the onus of proof is established beyond all reasonable doubt, we shall have achieved what we set out to do. This matter should have serious consideration, as it is the basis of justice to all returned soldiers. This is the most vital clause in the bill. The Attorney-General( D r . Evatt) has said that it is an improvement on the section of the principal act now proposed to be repealed. It would be a very poor provision if it were not an improvement on that section. Much of the complaint about the operation of the present act has relation to the onus of proof, and the proposed new provisions are merely an empty gesture. There appears to be only one way of establishing the onus of proof, and that is to set up >a tribunal in such a form that the soldier w ill be the applicant, the tribunal will be the respondent, and somebody else w ill determine the onus of proof. It seems to me that all of the words following the first paragraph of the proposed new section 39 B are unnecessary. section states(1) The commission, a board, an appeal tribunal and an assessment appeal tribunal, in hearing, determining or deciding a claim, application or appeal, shall act according to substantial justice and the merits of the case . We need not go further than that. If the commission acts according to substantial justice and the merits of the case, the onus of proof goes by the board. If the case has merits, the tribunal w ill decide in favour of the applicant, and, if the case is without merits, it w ill be decided against him. The Attorney-General( D r . Evatt) has laid stress on one or two Entitlement points, one being that the applicant must get the benefit of any doubt. What exactly creates a doubt, as contemplated in the proposed new section? I know Having cases in which several doctors have declared a soldier to be suffering from a particular disability, but when another doctor has ultimately reported that he is not suffering from that trouble, -the evidence of that doctor has on more than one occasion been accepted in preference to that of all of the others. Apparently the commission was waiting for a victory, and it immediately deprived the soldier of his pension. In cases such as I have mentioned, those who determine whether there is a doubt are the members of the commission. It may say that there is no doubt. It has decided, in the first place, whether a doubt exists and it then determines whether the benefit of the doubt can be given. The proposed amendment circulated by the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender) is as follows:That the words "" the onus of proof shall lie on the person or authority who contends that the claim, application or appeal should not be granted or allowed to the full extent claimed "", be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the following words: "" tbe person or authority who contends that the claim, application or appeal should not be granted or allowed to the full extent claimed shall prove beyond reasonable doubt that the claim, application or appeal should not be fully or partly granted"". When a soldier makes an application to the commission, who w ill decide whether there is a reasonable doubt and on whom lies the onus of proof? The commission would have the right, in the first place, to say whether there was a doubt, and, The proposed new secondly, it would have to convince itself that it had established the onus of proof. That is rather one-sided. We have the remarkable position that the respondent, who is instructed to give the applicant the benefit of the doubt, has itself estab. lished the onus of proof, and the same authority is in the invidious position of having to decide whether it had established the onus of proof. So the commission has to be the respondent and also the judge as to whether the",66,Evatt Undoubtedly The Whether Or Not It Is Satisfactory Does Not

362,Mr Harrison,Yes.,67,Evatt Undoubtedly The Whether Or Not It Is Satisfactory Does Not
363,Mr Rosevear (Dalley) [11.8],"onus of proof has been established. It appears to me that practically every case in which there is the slightest element of doubt will go beyond the commission to tbe various appeal tribunals, with the result that the hearing of the claims of soldiers will be considerably lengthened. ""When a matter reaches the appeal tribunal, the soldier will be in a less favorable position than before, because the commission will have satisfied itself that it has proved that he is not entitled to the pension. The matter then passes to another tribunal, similarly constituted, but, before it reaches that tribunal, the soldier is already handicapped by the fact that the commission has satisfied itself that he is not entitled to the pension. orable member call that a handicap? sumption is.that, as under the bill, the commission has the right to give to the applicant the benefit of any reasonable doubt, and is also accorded the right to determine the onus of proof, the decision will go against him. The case then goes to the Appeal Tribunal, with the man under the handicap that another body has established to its satisfaction that the facts are against him. The commission and all the other boards and tribunals before which the man may appear are required to give him the benefit of reasonable doubt; but decision as to what constitutes reasonable doubt rests with the commission, the board or the tribunal. The commission, board or tribunal is .required to establish the fact that the man is not entitled to the pension which he is claiming,, or grant the claim; but the question of onus of proof has not been by any means settled, because the commission, board or tribunal itself decides whether it has discharged the onus of proof. The returned soldiers will not benefit from the transfer of the onus of proof to the commission unless the tribunals established under the principal act are reconstituted. ter?' ing to graft a new limb on to an old tree. A civil case in which there is a. claimant and a respondent is decided by a third party, and one side or the other has to ' prove its case to the satisfaction of that third party; but that principle is not followed in repatriation matters because from tlie first tribunal to the last, regardless of where the onus of proof lies, the tribunal, which is the respondent, decides the case. There is need to recast the whole system in order that when the claimant, the returned soldier, and the respondent, the commission, are at variance the facts shall be decided on merit by a third party. Neither the bill nor the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender) gets over the outstanding difficulty that the commission, one of the parties, decides whether it has discharged the onus of proof which is cast upon it. I submit that it is not difficult for any tribunal which has the decision to establish to its own.satisfaction that it is right and the soldier is wrong. Until we deal satisfactorily with this situation, all the other conditions prescribed in this bill will go by the board, and there will be as many thousands of injustices done to returned soldiers after this war, when the commission will haye to discharge the onus of proof, as there were after the last war, when theonus of proof was on the soldier. also am very worried about this matter of onus of proof. Two or three years ago we inserted in the Repatriation Act a provision transferring, as we thought, the onus of proof from the soldier to the commission. We believed then that we had really succeeded in doing something of inestimable value to returned soldiers; but we were misled by the people who framed the amendment. There was a legal loophole. The old story that law is made by doubtful lawyers for the benefit of doubtful lawyers still holds good that Parliament is endeavouring to get away from established legal practice, and is consequently finding itself in a morass. a worse morass than that into which lawyers have put us in the last 150 years.

WhatI am worried about is . whether the returned soldiers suffering war disabilities and their dependants will receive a fairer deal than -they have hitherto received. The repatriation legislation and regulations are framed in such a way that it has been practically impossible for disabled returned soldiers to receive fair treatment. Any man appearing before a repatriation tribunal should be entitled to know the evidence against him; but no man is able, owing to the way the law stands, to know what has been adduced against him on the medical side. He is merely told that the tribunal has decided against him. He is just wiped off. How can a man or his representative rebut evidence when he does not know what that evidence is? Some of the decisions of the Repatriation Commission have been a scandal, an absolute disgrace to Australia. dealt with one case, and the Attorney General (Dr. Evatt) was a member of the court.! Ur. EVATT -That was Bott's case. know of one nian who was gassed in the last war. He was sent out of the firing line for three months, and the facts were recorded on. his medical history sheet. He then returned to the line and fought till the armistice. He then returned to Australia. Nine or ten years later, when some of those who knew the facts were dead and others scattered far and wide in Australia, he developed tuberculosis in the throat and died, leaving a widow and a large family. His medical He had a reasonable case. Any man except a doctor or some legal-minded gentleman would agree that he died from the effect of injuries which he received in the war. He had nearly five years' service. He had married a fine woman, and when he became ill , she, with the aid of their child of ten years, cultivated their irrigation block in northern Victoria. Since then, the man has died, do not and the tribunal and the legal-minded gentlemen can do him no further wrong. But he has left a widow and children, and they are entitled to consideration. If we agree to a clause which does not place the onus of proof on the appeal tribunal, I can only say that we are not giving a fair deal to these people. I hope that in this chamber there are sufficient honourable members who have the interests'of the soldier so mu'eh at heart that this matter shall be put beyond all doubt on this occasion.

There are few lawyers in the chamber, and they can easily be suppressed. ' I am certain that the Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt) would be delighted to go to bed and leave in the hands of his highly practical colleagues, the Minister for Repatriation ( Mr Frost) and the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Rankin), the task of formulating the necessary plain English to deal with this matter. object in view, the principal act provided, in section 39B, thai:Subject to this Act, the Commission shall, in the determination of appeals, act according to substantial justice and to the merits of each case, and shall give to an appellant the benefit of any reasonable doubt. Those words are repeated in the new clause, with the exception that the word "" reasonable "" is left out, the assumption being, as the Attorney-General has already pointed out, that the soldier is to get the benefit of any reasonable or unreasonable doubt. The truth of the matter is, as I said by way of interjection wants to have an appeal from Caesar to Caesar. appeal. I am in the same position as is the honourable member for Bendigo. I am just as anxious as he is that these men should receive proper treatment. anxious as he is that these unfortunate persons, who are labouring under some kind of disability, shall be able to secure a pension, or a continuation of their pension, or an increase of their pension. However, we have proceeded along the lines of asking the tribunal to act "" according to substantial justice and the merits of the case, and not be bound by technicalities or legal forms or rules of evidence, and give to the claimant, applicant or appellant the benefit of any doubt"". In adopting those words we have cast aside the experience of well nigh 200 years. It is time that some one arose in this Parliament to declare publicly that the notion that justice is hampered hy the rules of law and of evidence by lawyers for the purpose of serving the interests of the lawyers, is all ""bosh"". that the right honourable gentleman is not jesting, and that he realizes that we are attempting by the language of this clause to jettison the experience of the most eminent law-makers and justice-givers associated with the growth of British jurisprudence. So we speak in these vague terms, that we shall cast aside all Having that these legal technicalities and shall get to the substantial justice of the case; and the result of our best efforts is that we land in this Serbonian Bog of Difficulties which commonly arise from the flounderings of those who are not experienced in the use of clear English to express a plain idea.

394,Mr Brennan,"Yes; that is a goodhelp them out. I"" thought it necessary just to unload a few sentiments on that point, because they are entirely relevant to this very complicated and difficult clause. However, I think that laboriously, and with much complication, we have succeeded in conveying to the tribunal the very evident desire of the Parliament-and , on the whole, I am inclined to applaud it for so doing-that the tribunal shall exercise its quasijudicial functions a bit loaded against its gentlemen who, unfortunately, do not better judgment in favour of the soldier. I use the word "" quasi "" with trepidation in the presence of the honourable member for Bendigo, because one does not know how he will regard an expression of such doubtful origin. I hope that the tribunal will so exercise its functions; but I think soldier to get the benefit of the doubt that we are making' it difficult for it to do so. As the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Eosevear) pointed out, the tribunal, in the last resort, must decide the vexed question whether it has discharged the onus of proof. So, all our labours serve the somewhat ridiculous purpose of showing that we have overlaid this proposition with a great deal of superfluous language which has served the very purpose which the honourable member for Bendigo so strenuously desires to avoid, and which is entirely the work, not of lawyers, but of men like himself. The honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Harrison) gave an illustration to which I listened with very great attention. He cited the case of a man who had served in the war of 1914-18 and had developed heart trouble of some description. We know that there are many diseases of the heart. drew a pension in respect of his heart trouble. the language of the commission, that trouble "" evaporated "", and the disease ceased to exist. I sympathize with the honourable member for Wentworth in respect of that case. He pointed out that that soldier, after having drawn a pension for some sort of cardiac disease, was declared cured, and went about his business, but later had a complete breakdown from heart disease. Whetheri t was the same -disease, I do not know; but in respect of it he had been refused a pension. I can only express the hope that the tribunal will accept the language of this clause, as it is now supported by the Attorney-General, as a broad hint, at least-and , perhaps, there is nothing more in it than that:-that in such a case the pension should be renewed and continued. One cannot hope for more than that. I have very little confidence in this jargon; but I hope that, with sympathetic administrators of this law, we shall obtain substantial and just results for the soldiers in spite of the plain English of the always know what plain English is. -Our most difficult problem in respect of this subject is to express ourselves in language to explain that we want the when the commission is considering whether he is entitled to a pension because he has suffered from some disability due to war service. After all, what is a doubt? Of course, no doubt arises when a man suffered injuries which necessitated an amputation. But all cases are not so clear as that. Sometimes it happens that years after a soldier has been discharged from the Army he becomes ill and claims that his indisposition is due to war service. He may be examined by the most eminent doctors in the land, and a doubt would remain in their minds. But honourable members are now trying so to phrase this provision as to make it perfectly clear that the onus of proof that a man is not entitled to a pension because his disability is not due to his war service, shall rest with the Repatriation Commission. How can it possibly be proved ? That man It cannot be proved. The language which is used in the bill will make little Eventually, to use or no difference.to the phraseology of thfi act. The act provides that the commission shall, in the determination of appeals, give to an appellant the benefit of any reasonable doubt. The bill declares that the commission shall give to the claimant the benefit of any doubt. What is the difference between a "" reasonable doubt "" and a "" doubt"" ? We have to depend upon the Repatriation Commission, ana it consists of reasonable men, who are sympathetic to the soldier, and desire Ugive to him the benefit of any doubt. It any doubt exists in their mind, he will get",70,Evatt Undoubtedly The Whether Or Not It Is Satisfactory Does Not
395,Sir George Bell (Darwin) [11.40].,"the benefit of it. At any rate, I have no doubts in the matter. I have had as much experience of war pensions as any other honourable member, and I am convinced that nine men receive a pension, although their disability cannot be proved to be due to war service, for every man who is suffering a disability due to war service, whose application is rejected. The Repatriation who want to grant a pension to the soldier if it is possible for them to do so. The honourable member for Dalley( Mr authority, whether it be the board, the Rosevear) contended that the only remedy is to recast the tribunal. That will not make the slightest difference. No doubt can exist regarding a disability when the soldier first returns from the war. The difficulty arises when he lodges a claim many years afterwards. If he had never previously applied for a pension, no board of doctors can be sure whether his illness was due to, or aggravated by, his war service. The matter rests with the tribunal, which does not consist of men who must determine the claim on legal grounds. They are plain, ordinary, intel; ligent men who are sympathetic to the application of the soldier, and want to perform their duties in accordance with the spirit and the letter of the act. No new words that this committee can insert in the act can alter it to any degree, because the onus of proof already rests with the Repatriation Commission and the tribunals. Of course, they will not be able to prove definitely that a disability is not due to war service. In some cases a very grave doubt may exist, but still the soldier will get the pension. It is not possible for us so to amend the act as to make the position clearer than it is now. The tribunal has been most competent in the past, and new tribunals, if appointed, will consist of reasonable men, who, without prejudice, will interpret the will of this Parliament. The issue is whether a man is suffering from a war disability, which has affected his health, because he served in the war. After obtaining the best advice from medical practitioners, the tribunal will have one simple question to decide. I agree with the remarks c.l' the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) that the interpretation of words does not enter into the question. Sir George Bell. The whole matter will depend upon the decision of men of ability and sound 'judgment. Sitting suspended from 11.J/8 p.m. to 12.18 a.m. (Friday). Friday, 19 March, 19hS. a.m.] -Any one with experience of the dealing with claims by tribunals will, Commission consists of men I think, agree that in the great majority of cases no exception can be taken to the decisions made by the deciding commission or the appeal tribunal; but that does not mean that in every case the deciding body proceeds to follow the lines set for it by the act of Parliament. Probably all the members of the board, the commission and the appeal tribunal are soldiers. One member of the board must be a person nominated by returned soldiers, and one member of the commission must be the same, and probably all the members of the commission are, whilst two members of the appeal tribunal must be returned soldiers, the third being a lawyer. It does appear that the members of these bodies say to themselves : "" Well, we are returned soldiers, and we have the capacity to judge the merits' of returned soldiers' claims, and an insight into the returned soldier character which other people do not possess, and whatever the legislation says, we are going to do what we consider substantial justice "". An illustration of that is the case referred to in this chamber some years ago, .which led to the amendment being made in section 42w. That is the well-known case which went to the High Court in relation to a returned soldier named Bott. Bott had contracted rheumatism while on war service,and later received a pension for a chronic rheumatic condition. That pension was cancelled, and Bott made several ineffectual attempts to regain it. He then applied for an invalid pension, a fact which is material to what I shall say afterwards, and went to hospital. He applied again for his pension on the advice which he received from the medical man who examined him, and, being refused,, went to the appeal tribunal. What happened at the appeal tribunal was very interesting. The Commonwealth medical referee",71,Evatt Undoubtedly The Whether Or Not It Is Satisfactory Does Not
396,Mr Blackburn (Bourke) [12.18,"gave evidence, and the doctor from the hospital, who examined Bott, also gave evidence on his behalf, but the opposers refused to cross-examine. I quote the following from the judgment of Mr Justice Evatt, now the right honourable the Attorney-General, reported in 50 O.L.R., 253:On tie 24th February, 1933, the applicant was represented upon his appeal to the respondents by Mr T. W. McLaren. He called two medical witnesses. H. J. W. Brennand, Commonwealth Medical Referee for Invalid Pensions. He was duly sworn, and stated that not only was the applicant suffering from chronic rheumatism, but he was actually receiving an invalid pension on account of that very condition. Asked whether the condition was referable to the rheumatic fever which the applicant had contracted at Gallipoli in 1915, Dr. Brennand said, "" Yes, definitely, it is related to the old trouble"". The chairman, Colonel Ralston, asked Dr. Brennand if he hod seen the appellant's war history, and the reply was "" No"". Kenneth Smith, who was present on behalf of the Repatriation Commission, and inquired if he desired to ask Dr. Brennand any question. Dr. Smith replied ""No"" . Dr. Brennand's evidence was corroborated by Dr. J. E. Sherwood Dr. Sherwood was the doctor who had examined Bott at the public hospitalin the essential respects, namely (1) a present condition of chronic rheumatism, and (2) a definite medical relation between that condition and the contraction of rheumatic fever at Gallipoli. Again, the Repatriation Coramission's representative, though invited by the chairman to cross-examine the witness, asked no questions. In these circumstances, it is obvious that the applicant had made a "" prima facie case "" within the meaning of the proviso to section 45w (2). Nevertheless, the commission decided that tion of it. It may be said that these words Bott had not made a prima facie case. are polarized, that they have acquired a He had attended two doctors, each of certain relation to other words and a cerwhom said that he had this condition, tai n unnatural meaning, and that the and each of whom attributed it to war commission, if they still stand, w ill say: service, and the representative of the "" We disregarded them before and we Repatriation Commission declined to are going to disregard them again "". The cross-examine either doctor, but, in spite words proposed by the honourable member of all that, the Repatriation Commission for Warringah are more explicit than said that a prima facie case had not been the old words, and for that reason I think made out. What, of course, appears is that they are preferable. Sub-section 2 that the tribunal thought that the man of the proposed new section, if amended was not really entitled to a pension, and in the way which the honourable member it was not going to allow the words of the proposes, would, readsection to stand in the way of its refusal to give h i m a pension, and so it did refuse claimant, (2) It shall not be necessary for the to give hi m one.

On the appeal tribunal two of the members must be returned soldiers, and I understand that in fact all three of them are. Nevertheless, they disregard the language of the section when it prevents them from doing what they think that they ought to do. They say: "" It does not matter what the act says; here is a man who we think should not get a pension, and we are not going to allow the language of the act to force The chairman then turned to Dr. us to give h i m one"". I prefer the language of the draf t of the honourable member for Warringah to the language used by the act or by this clause, but I am very much afraid that, whatever words we put into the section, we shall, not be able to ensure that the appeal tribunals and the commission w ill obey the direction of Parliament. ' Eirst, we free them from being bound by the rules of evidence, and the technical rules of law, and then we give them certain directions. To my mind the great advantage of the proposal of the honourable member for Warringah is that it does propose to change the formula. We have had a formula, and we have seen it disregarded by the men charged with the administraapplicant or appellant to furnish",72,Evatt Undoubtedly The Whether Or Not It Is Satisfactory Does Not

There we are getting explicit English words instead of the legal phrase ""the onus of proof"". I prefer the explicit English words which the honourable member for Warringah proposes to put into the clause to the repetition of a' legal phrase, the use of which has not secured the result which it was intended to secure. member retain the words "" onus of proof "" ? I have read the section as the honourable member for Warringah proposes to amend it. I believe that it. would be much harder for the board, commission, or tribunal to ignore the language used by the honourable member for Warringah than to ignore the language of the present section or of the proposed new section contained in the clause. The proposed new section retains the phrase "" onus of proof"". The use of that phrase has failed to secure the results which this Parliament intended to secure, and I believe that it would be much better to depart from it and to use the plain English words which the honourable member for Warringah has circulated. The discussion that has taken place on this clause would not have arisen but for the general dissatisfaction caused by the administration of the act. As the honourable member for Warringah has pointed out, the act as previously framed placed a strong onus of proof on the Commission. In fact, section 45w provided that it was sufficient in making out a prima facie case for the applicant merely to aver "" that the incapacity or death of the soldier-resulted from an occurrence happening during the period he was a member of the forces or from his employment in connection with naval or military preparations or operations"". That is the simplest form of proof that could be laid down; yet there has been widespread dissatisfaction as to the manner in which the act has been administered. It would appear that that section has been honoured more in the breach than in the observance. The debate has disclosed the existence of a belief that, despite the present proposal, the administration may not be in accordance with the spirit and the letter of the act. Therefore, the matter should he made as plain as possible. I cannot see why such eminent lawyers as the Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt), the honourable members for Warringah ( Mr Spender) and Bourke. ( Mr Blackburn), and others cannot frame a provision that would give satisfaction to all parties. The desire of all is that it shall be made as plain as possible, in order to ensure that the spirit of the act shall he observed. It would appear that many of the claims that are coming before the department from returned soldiers of the present war are being rejected, although those men have been discharged from the Army because of medical unfitness. The particulars given to me disclose that, at the 31st December, 1942, there had been before the Repatriation Commission 39,853 claims, arising from the present war, for pensions by ex-members of the services or their dependants. Of that total, 5,050 claims by members had been granted and 5,998 had been rejected; and 12,735 claims by dependants had been granted, and 10,633 had been rejected; the totals being 17,785 granted, and 16,631 rejected. Therefore, it is essential that this provision shall be in the clearest terms. There would seem to be quite a prejudice against lawyers having a voice in the matter. They will not have a dominating voice in the administration, as only the chairman of the tribunal will be a lawyer. Medical men will have considerable influence in the administration of the act, as they have had in the past.

I wish to refer to another portion of clause 18, which, if allowed to remain in . its present form, will merely perpetuate the condition that has given rise to complaints. Proposed new section 39c provides(1.) A medical practitioner shall, in reportwill not bind either the commission or, ing on any claim iii relation to a member of the forces, set out in his report his opinion(a) in the case of a claim in respect of the death of the member-as to the cause of the death; and (6) in the case of a claim in respect of the incapacity of the member-as to tlie nature, cause and extent of the incapacity. The medical man is not to give reasons for his opinion, except when he entertains a doubt. It is the function of the tribunal to give a finding as to the actual cause of death or incapacity. It is now proposed that the medical officer shall practically decide the cause of death or incapacity, although the whole of the data and history may not have been before him. In the case mentioned hy the honourable member for Bourke, the doctor was asked by the chairman of the tribunal whether he knew the history of the case, and he replied that he did not.

I have had brought to my notice the case of a returned soldier of the present war. He has written to me stating that he and about 30 others, all returnees from this war, who have been discharged with chest trouble, have been told that they must have had the complaint .upon enlistment. His letter continuesMy first medical board on enlistment for the Australian Imperial Force consisted of two doctors, J. Bedford Elwoll and John Powell, both specialists on the Bepatriation Board. I did five months intensive training at Bedbank, Queensland, before embarking for the Middle East. After five months in Palestine and EgyptI was returned to Australia as medically unfit with asthma and emphyema. On applying for medical treatment after disany doubt"". charge I was told that I was not entitled to It as my complaint was not due to, or aggravated 'by, war service. Also Dr. Mindo of Brisbane, who by the way has not examined me, stated that in his opinion I must have been at least .65 per cent, disabled before enlistment. In a speech given by Mr Spender when he was Minister for the Army, at a recruiting rally, he stated that with the machinery at the Army's disposal (X-rays and such) no man would be able to enlist unless absolutely A l and therefore the onus would be on the Government to provide for any .man invalided back from overseas. Before enlistment I followed heavy work, such as quarry labourer and bridge rigging, but since my discharge I am unable to do heavy work, and I have not worked a f u l l week yet and it is costing me tipwards of £ 1 for medicine and treatment every week and so my wife and children are being made to suffer, having to go without things they badly need. Apparently, the commission acted on the opinion of a medical officer who had not even examined the returned soldier. Evidence of that nature should not be presented to or accepted by the commission unless it can be tested. Opinion given in that bald way should be entirely discarded. If provision is made that the report of a medical man may be accepted in the manner laid down, at least there should be the requirement that reasons for the opinion shall be stated.

Clause further verbally amended. clause limits unduly the grounds of appeal to an entitlement tribunal. I believe that there should be an appeal in all cases in which a claim has been refused by the Repatriation Commission or by an assessment tribunal. Eor instance, it is provided that no appeal shall lie when the disability is due to the wilful act of the claimant. Section 45AT of the act defines active service. It is within the province of the commission to say whether the disability is such that it shall be deemed to have been contracted in aatual contact with the enemy. Clause 33 amends section 45AU of the principal act by providing that upon the incapacity or death of a member of the forces, whose incapacity or death has resulted from an occurrence happening during the period from the date of his enlistment to the date of the termination of his service, and upon the incapacity or death of any member of the forces, whose incapacity or death has arisen out of, or is attributable to, his service, the Commonwealth shall be liable to pay the pension to him. But, if the death is, in the opinion of the commission, due to venereal disease contracted during-his period of service, the Commonwealth shall be liable to pay pensions to his widow and children. There, again, the matter is left entirely to the opinion of the commission, and. that is a state of mind from which there can be no appeal to the tribunal. Clause 33 further provides that the incapacity or death of a member shall be deemed to have arisen out of his service as a member, if it was the result of an accident which happened to him while travelling directly to or from his place of employment, or was, in the opinion of the commission, due to an accident occurring or to the contraction of a disease or an infection which would not have occurred or been contracted but for his being a member of the forces, or but for changes in his environment consequent upon his being such a member. There, again, the matter is left entirely to the opinion of the commission, and, as I have already said, there can be no appeal from a state of mind of the commission. I contend that there should be an appeal in all cases. Instead of setting out the cases in which there can be an appeal, an appeal to the tribunal should be allowed in all instances where a claim has been refused by the. commission. There should also be an appeal from the assessment tribunal. The assessment of claims has been the subject of many complaints. The entitlement tribunal has no jurisdiction with regard to claims; it merely decides whether an applicant is entitled to the pension. Then the matter goes back to the commission, which follows the decision given before the soldier is discharged from the Army. The Army Discharging Board states whether certain disabilities are due to war service, and mentions other disabilities which may not be due to war service. It specifies the rate of pension payable by a mathematical calculation. That is why soldiers sometimes receive paltry pensions amounting to a few shillings a week. The decisions of the ""War Pensions Entitlement Tribunal are frustrated because of this procedure. The matter should not be left to the Army Discharging Board. Assessments may have been made on a wrong principle, and contrary to the spirit and letter of the act, yet there is no appeal to the entitlement tribunal with regard to the assessment. The tribunal should have the final voice with regard to both the entitlement and the amount of the pension. The honourable member for Bourke( Mr Blackburn) has shown that there should be no obstacle to claimants obtaining complete justice. He cited an instance of gross injustice in which the matter was taken to the High Court, but apparently that court had no jurisdiction to deal with it. There was no appeal against a decision which was contrary to all principles of common justice.

Sir [1.8 a.m.] I support the contention of the honourable member for Reid( Mr end of the last war to about the year Morgan).

When the entitlement tribunal granted entitlement, the matter went back to the commission which had already refused the application. After that, the applicant has the right to appeal to the assessment tribunal, which is presided over by a legal man and two doctors. I agree with the honourable member for Reid that, if an application has been placed before a State board, and the applicant has then appealed to the entitlement tribunal and has been granted entitlement, the assessment of the pension ought to go automatically to the assessment tribunal, without having to be referred to the commission. of quick administration, rather than one requiring an amendment of the section. the Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt) will consider the matter. back to the assessment tribunal, after entitlement has been established, would not help the soldier.

During all those years he had received 50 per cent, of the full pension, but when the payment suddenly ceased, nearly six months was occupied in getting a hearing by the entitlements tribunal. The fact that the assessment tribunal had assessed the disability at 50 per cent, total incapacity showed that the pensions should have been continued, but owing to the operation of the act, he was deprived of the pension for about six months.

There are many moralists in the community, members of churches and other well intentioned people, who take strong exception to tbe women who fall into the category of de facto wives, but the fact remains that the principle of recognizing de facto wives was established more than twenty years ago. In the last twenty years the opinions of the community have greatly changed. I do not imply that moral principles have weakened, but there has come to the community a greater understanding of human weaknesses. War being what it is, I think that we should consider the fact that it creates unnatural circumstances amongst soldiers. Whether we like it or not, men do take de facto wives. I think I am justified on reflection in departing from the recommendation of the special committee in this matter, and I urge that the Government should take into consideration all the circumstances and the fact that twenty years ago we established the right of de facto widows to pensions, equally with legal widows. be permitted to grant the pension to both, if in its opinion it is right to do so. on a satisfactory basis. not operate to the detriment of the legal widow. some responsibility for the committee's recommendation. was rejected.

I urge the Government to give favorable consideration to pensioning both. The precedent has been established in the Widows' Pensions Act wherein the Commissioner for Pensions is empowered to grant a full pension to both the widow and the de facto widow, if he is satisfied that circumstances warrant it. Churches of all denominations and people with strong moral principles may hold that Parliament has no right to take cognizance of immorality, but the fact remains that the churches succour fallenwomen and care for their children. Christian Church did. practical sympathy in cases such as these. It is a Christian act to remove the stigma of charity from assistance given to women whatever their marital status may be. I know that parliamentary recognition of the claims of women who without having taken the marriage vows have lived as the wives of men will invite political repercussions and that some people will allege that this or that government has encouraged immorality. Nevertheless, former governments, Labour or non-Labour have from time to time, endorsed the principle that was laid down during the last war that the claims of de facto wives and de facto widows are equal to those of wives and widows.

I hope that it will be made to protect the interests of the legitimate wife, so that the position which has been referred to by the honourable member for Ballarat( Mr Pollard), in which a legitimate wife may be deprived of her just claim upon a soldier or ex-soldier in favour of an adulteress, will not be allowed to continue. I wish to raise a matter affecting another class of wife, namely the wife and also the child of a service pensioner. the existing legislation, they are entitled to consideration, provided that the child was born before the 2nd October, 1931, or that the wife was married before that date. I suggest that for the date mentioned there should be substituted the 1st day of July, 1938, in order to bring this legislation into line with that relating to war pensions. I see no reason why the wife or child of a service pensioner should be placed at a disadvantage compared with the wife or child of a war pensioner. matter which ought to be considered, but this bill is not the place to deal with it. tion bill. The committee which has done such excellent work in connection with other phases of repatriation should also have reported on this phase. The subject was brought to my notice by the Victorian branch of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia. That body has suggested that, as a matter of common justice, the definitions of "" wife "" and "" child "" for the purpose of service pensions should be brought into line with the definitions of "" wife "" and "" child "" for the purpose of war pensions. A man who is in receipt of a service pension is usually in poor circumstances, and the Victorian branch of the league believes that its request is cost of giving effect to the suggestion would be, but I submit that cost should not be the determining factor, although I realize that sometimes our conception of justice is based on a consideration of cost. If justice can be done, it ought to he done. I urge now what I urged in my second-reading speech, namely, that where a person who is totally incapacitated marries a second time, thesecond wife shall be entitled to receive a war pension. A totally incapacitated man needs the assistance of some one to care for him. A man who is bereft of his wife, and cannot look after himself, and who, moreover, has children dependent on him, may quite naturally desire that his children should have the care and attention of a step-mother. The woman whom he marries should not be disadvantaged by the fact that being married to Under section 45AC of a man who is totally incapacitated she for that reason faces the grim prospect of widowhood after, perhaps, only a few years of married life. me in regard to this matter and I promised to look into it. that assurance from the Minister. There is justice in the claim. A man who is totally incapacitated is sufficiently burdened without having to worry about what would happen in the event of his helpmate passing on before him, and, may be, leaving little children for whom he can do but little. -There is no reference in the bill to the person described by the obnoxious term de facto wife, although such a person is referred to in the report of the committee. It seems possible that, in certain circumstances, the clause may be construed to refer to persons living with and dependent upon a member of the forces. I believe that whatever gratuity, assistance or charitable indulgence, the committee might desire to extend to a woman in that situation in which she is described as a de facto wife, it will not do itself the injustice of reducing the status of a married woman by repeating, if it can be avoided, the use of that expression.",82,Charles Marr Parkes Which Again Granted Him Entitlement

484,Mr Brennan (Batman) [1.43 A.m.].,"I accuse myself of having suffered that expression to re-appear in recent legislation. Probably, if a woman were a member of this Parliament, sensitive to the honor of her sex, that would never have occurred. I hope that we shall take an early opportunity to remove that offensive phrase from the statute-book wherever it occurs. ""We cannot afford as a Parliament, or as a country, to write down the status of married women, or the status of the family. In fact, the preservabecame a member of the forces and for a tion of family life and the maintenance of the status of married women are among the objectives for which the grim struggle in which we are now engaged is being fought. I associate myself with those who reprobate this tendency to regard the marriage tie lightly. We can easily afford to be indulgent and even generous to women in an unfortunate position without that. With that observation I leave the matter, feeling that I have spoken, Mr Chairman, by your indulgence and the indulgence of the Minister also, inasmuch as this clause does not appear to relate specifically to a person in that situation; but it is time that the Parliament made a beginning to delete this objectionable designation and in doing justice to these persons, used more discreet and appropriate language than it has used in the past. a.m.] -The phrase de facto wife does not appear in this statute at all. It appears in a marginal note to section 36 of the principal act, and there is no definition of it in the act. Two questions arise on this point, and they must be kept apart. The first is the propriety of the use of the phrase; and the second is the propriety of making a payment to a woman whose relation to the soldier has been that of what we call a de facto wife. adulteress. that word; I do not like it . Canada has made a provision very much similar to the provision we have made. I . take it that the honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron) does not quarrel with the provision being made for this class of woman, but with the description of her as a de facto wife. I have in my hand a reprint of the Canadian Pension Act 1919-1936. Canada has made a provision for the woman who, though not being married to a soldier, was either recognized by him as his wife, or ought fairly to have been recognized by'him as his wife. In the case of the death of the soldier the Canadian legislation has provided since 191932 (3) A woman who, although not married to the member of the forces, was living with hi'm in Canada at the time he reasonable time previously thereto, and who, at such time, was publicly represented by him as his wife may, in the case of his death and in the discretion of the Commission, be awarded a pension equivalent to the pension she would have received had she been his legal widow, and the Commission may also award a pension if, in its opinion, an injustice would be done by not recognizing a woman as the wife of a member of the forces although there is no evidence that she had been publicly represented by him. as his wife: Provided that such woman shall not be refused a pension for which she would have been eligible under the provisions hereof if she had remained unmarried, by reason only of her having married the member of the forces with whom she had been living as aforesaid. The last proviso refers to the case of a woman who marries a soldier after the war. In the case of a disabled soldier, the Canadian act provides30 (5) If a member of the forces, in respect of a disability pension, was, before the 1st day of May, 1933, living with a woman to whom ho was not legally married and since that date such woman has continuously been maintained by him and represented by him as his wife, the commission may, in its discretion, notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (&) of section thirty of tbe amending act of 1930, if the said member of the forces has married or hereafter marries the said woman, award additional pension for a married member of the forces from the date of marriage or from the 1st day of August, 1930, whichever is the later date. That means that a woman who had that relationship towards a disabled other words an soldier would not receive anything unless he married her. The Canadian act also provides that a pension may be refused to the wife of a married soldier if she does not live w it h h i m and is not maintained by him.

I quite agree with those who object to the use of the phrase de facto wife in our statutes.

A soldier, the father of three children, was summoned to his home owing to the illness of his wife. He was granted a certain period of leave, but he overstayed it, because her condition was serious. When he reported to bis unit, he was sentenced to a period of detention for having been absent without leave.

523,Mr Harrison,"I regard as anin whose service they have fought gives to them a measure of preference. This will give to returned men the right to earn their livelihood, which they would find it very hard to earn if not given some help by a generous and grateful country. They ask for no more than that they shall be given the right to earn a livelihood, and should be given no less by a grateful country. Let us examine some of the reasons in support of preference in employment being given to the returned soldier. He has been taken out of industry, and placed in the service of his country. The man who has been at the bench loses his aptitude and efficiency in the years during which he is absent from it. This has been made obvious by no less a person than Director of Education and Vocational Training in the Department of the Army. Giving evidence before the special committee, he saidWe have taken men out of their normal civil employments and have changed them fundamentally. We have removed the motive that would actuate them in their civil life. We have taken from them, all striving to gain a livelihood. Shortly, we have changed them; they are different social beings. In the course of that process of change, we have put them into an environment in which they cannot get a ful l appreciation of the changes that are occurring in the economic and social structure. He placed his finger exactly on the core of the matter, in drawing attention to the fact that these men have been taken out of their avocations and placed in an entirely different atmosphere under completely different circumstances. They will return to civil life strange to the new economic set of conditions that have grown up, and will have lost the efficiency which was theirs prior to having been, called up. Lieutenant-iColonel Madgwick went on to sayThose men who aTO skilled tradesmen or process workers have two major advantages over the men in the Army. In the first place, they are maintaining and increasing their skill; and in the second place, they arc working in a changing economy, and are understanding the changes by reason of their participation in them. The man in the Army is losing his skill and is not being given the training that is being given to the ordinary civilian population. Therefore, when he returns to civil life he will have lost a good deal of the skill that he formerly possessed [72] and w ill certainly Hot have been trained for all of those new trades that developed during the war. That is a very clear exposition of the state in which the returned soldier will find himself when he is on the verge of being repatriated. No repatriation act could be complete, just or proper unless it gave preference in employment to these men, in order that they may be rehabilitated in the industrial economy of the nation. There is also another section of men who will need looking after-the younger men who have not established themselves in a trade or profession. Some of them may have served a portion of their apprenticeship, whilst others may have matriculated and completed one year in a faculty at a university. The Lieutenant-Colonel Madgwick, whole of their outlook may have been altered by their service. How often was it found after. the last war that a young man who had trained himself for a profession could not re-enter it upon his return? The outdoor life and the upsetting conditions had caused him to reorientate the whole of his outlook in regard to his employment. Some men found their way on to the land, whilst others took up an industrial occupation. Unless preference is given, these men will not be able to find their way back into industry. The country must nurse them back into employment, and give them the opportunity to re-establish themselves in industry. I know that this proposal cuts across the principles of the Government. It's concern is with preference to unionists, and the establishment of compulsory unionism. The Government of New South Wales, which is of the same party-political colour a3 the (Commonwealth Administration, proposes to enact legislation along those lines. Even with the country at war, this Government is enforcing the principle of preference to unionists. The Government believes in preference in employment to industrial workers, so surely it cannot deny as favorable treatment to members of the fighting services. If the Government believes that industrial workers, who are employed under favorable conditions, should be given preference, it cannot in fairness offer less to members of the fighting forces who are risking disablement or death under the most appalling conditions. I do not want to flog the issue, because it is undesirable at this time to .rouse party feelfor him a favorable reference to ings. If this benefit is not conferred upon the soldiers, although they may win the war for us, they may well lose the peace. There are 700,000 men in the forces, and after the war they will demand their rights. It will go hard with any government that denies them preference in the matter of employment. Dr. General) [2.47 a.m.] -The committee would render a disservice to the returned soldiers if it accepted this amendment. The policy of the Government in regard to preference to returned soldiers has been announced by the Prime Minister( Mr Ourtin) and is favorable to the general principle of preference. In answer to a question asked in the Senate, OB the 27th 3anuary last, the Prime Minister, as reported on page 12 of Hansard, said that the Government .believed that preference, although necessary, was far from adequate, and that what should be done was to obtain security of employment for servicemen. Returned soldier organizations are now insisting, not on preference in the narrow sense, but on the guarantee of employment. This bill is not the measure in which we should embody preference proposals. To deal with the matter in the crude way suggested would be unworthy of the Parliament and of the returned servicemen themselves. The amendment provides that regulations shall make provision for the granting of preference in employment to members of the forces. Does the honourable member mean all members of the forces whether they have been on active, combatant service or not, and whether they have been abroad or not? lost their skill, or the opportunity to acquire skill. now drafting legislation to deal with this matter, and I beg the committee not to prejudice the principle of guaranteeing employment to returned soldiers by accepting the amendment. The honourable member asks for preference in employment, but at what point-a t the point of engagement, during employment, or at the termination of employment? The honourable member made what was unionists; does he wish returned soldiers to be placed in the same category as unionists? preference to unionists. I said that the Government had declared itself in favour of preference to unionists, and therefore could not deny preference to returned is what the Government policy is. The Repatriation Act, which was passed at the end of the last war, contained no pro; vision for preference to returned soldiers. The matter was then regarded as one for State Parliaments to deal with. I believe in substantial preference to returned soldiers, but I ask those who think in the same way not to prejudice the application of this principle by insisting that regulations be issued under this bill to provide for preference. dealt with by legislation. most unsatisfactory to attempt to deal with it by regulations under the Repatriation Act.

535,Mr Curtin,"It is not. It is obviousto prejudice the broader policy of preference by accepting the amendment, but to get on with the . bill. I ask you, Mr Chairman, whether I am at liberty to discuss the clause as a whole, or whether I must confine myself to the amendment? The honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Harrison) has moved an amendment to the clause, and the honourable member must confine himself to the amendment. mixed feelings to the speech of the honourable member for Wentworth, who moved an amendment, the purpose of which is to give preference to returned soldiers. So far as I am concerned, the important factor is what is meant by preference to returned soldiers. Does it include nurses and other women in the services as well as men? When the Government proceeds to deal with the broad question of preference to returned soldiers, it should provide a measure of social justice, not only for the soldiers who have fought on the battlefields, but also those for whom the soldiers have fought. I agree that the lives of the soldiers have been disturbed, that, on their ultimate return to civil life, employpatriation measure. The special comment must be found for them, and that they must receive the protection of the Parliament and the country; but the claims of the men and women in industry who have been producing the munitions of war must also be considered. In many instances, industrial workers have been prevented from taking their place in the field, and that alters the whole principle of preference as we knew it after the last war. How can we say that the man who has been in uniform must be given preference over those who have been retained in industry because of their special skill and ability? There should be a balanced preference. The matter is one in which I take a lively interest, and I regard it from the broad aspect of the social security of the people. I desire to see a balanced economy after the war. T agree with what has been said by the Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt) and by interjection, by the Prime Minister( Mr said by the Attorney-iGeneral as to what Ourtin), who pointed out that the matter should not be dealt with in a haphazard way by accepting the proposed amendment to the clause under consideration. The Prime Minister has indicated that Separate legislation is needed, in order to make proper provision both for returned soldiers and for the other people to whom the right honourable gentleman has referred. The returned soldier has a right to the protection of this Parliament in the new social order which we expect after the war. [3.6 a.m.] -Among the less satisfactory features of this bill is the fact that no provision is made with regard to either land settlement or preference to returned soldiers. On the subject of land settlement, the special committee recommended that expert authorities be appointed to deal with it, and the Government has said that it will be.dealt with hy a rural settlement committee. How can we settle people on the land unless they have a reasonable chance of making a success of their holdings? Despite what the Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt) has said, I consider that the amendment submitted by the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Harrison) can be properly accepted as part of a remittee recommended that, wherever practicable, preference must be given to members of the forces in the matter of employment. Some criticism has been heard regarding the bluntness of the proposal of the honourable member for Wentworth, but the recommendation of the special committee is blunt enough. The decision of the Government regarding the matter was that the views of the special committee should be referred to an interdepartmental committee. It is stated that the report of the latter committee has been received and has been considered by the Government, but certain details remain to be finalized. The least that honourable members are entitled to be told by the Government is the nature of the recommendations of the inter-departraental committee.

Members have had no word of what has been said on the matter of preference ito returned soldiers in that report. The matter has lapsed and we know nothing about it. we have had up to the present is a statement that the matter will be dealt with later, when the increased powers to be granted to the Commonwealth shall have been determined. Honourable members should be supplied with the recommendations in detail of the inter-departmental committee, to enable them to decide whether they are sufficient to justify them in allowing the matter to stand in abeyance for the. present. As the special committee has made a recommendation on the matter which clearly comes within the ambit of the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act, we are entitled for the time being to safeguard the position by acceptance of the amendment. I have no objection to the proposal of the honourable member for Wentworth. As I read his amendment, it does not lay down an absolute and complete preference to every body, but it confines the preference to members of the forces. It states that regulations shall be made dealsay that'ing with this matter and it implies essentially preference to soldiers. It seems to me that the words ""to a member of the forces "" would include a member of the Citizen Military Eorces, and it would therefore be advisable to add the words ""who have been on active service under the terms of the act "". That would imply active service, especially service overseas. Note the words "" wherever practicable "". amendment is not sufficiently clear. If the regulations were made in that form, they could not be departed from. proposal of the honourable member for Wentworth it would be possible to promulgate regulations substantially for preference in employment to members of the forces, and that would include the Militia. I personally prefer that the preference should be limited to the members of the fighting forces who have been in a zone of operations. The amendment, which is in general terms, should be clarinotwithstanding legislation and pious fied by regulations, but that is better than hopes. Preference to returned soldiers no provision at all, because it would at least admit the principle. I can foresee many difficulties. There may be a choice as between the Militia and the auxiliary services on the one hand and rejected or wounded volunteers on the other. That is why the amendment should be couched in general terms. women. preference under this amendment. widen the provision, if it desired to do so. point has been settled elsewhere, I shall support the amendment. -The special committee, realizing that, although the matter of preference was somewhat outside its terms of reference, gave consideration to the subject in an atmosphere entirely devoid of politics, notwithstanding that all shades of political opinion were represented. None of us had any desire to make political capital. After examining all the factors of this most difficult problem the most that the committee was prepared to say was to Tlie evidence quoted in paragraph 22 directs attention to the necessity for all reasonable measures in the favour of members whereby the handicaps to which they are subjected by service can be off-set. The committee recommends that it be public policy that wherever practicable preference must be given to members of the forces in the matter of employment. The position of the country in this war is very much different from its position in the last war when the majority of our forces actually saw active service. Further, in the last war, no man of military age was prevented"" from leaving his employment to enlist, whereas this Parliament has prevented thousands of young men from throwing up their positions to carry out their ardent desire to enlist in the forces.

549,Mr Pollard (Ballarat) [3.15 A.m.].,"has been kicked around like a football by party politicians. The amendment of the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Harrison) will not achieve one scrap of preference for any returned soldier inasmuch as it does not empower either this Parliament, or the Repatriation Commission, to compel private employers of labour to give preference to -returned soldiers when seeking the services of men out of whose labour they will profit. People employ other people only to make a profit of some sort out of their service. If I , assuming I was not a returned soldier, and the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Rankin), a soldier in.the 1914-18 war, were competing for a job, I should get it, because I am more active and younger and would be more likely to do more work. flatters himself. I should at least try to work, but he would rest in the shade. ference to returned soldiers has operated since the last war. This amendment would not change the position in the least. The honourable member for Wentworth knows that it would not even change the position in respect of government employment. The political party to which the honourable member belongs, notwithstanding the preachings of some of its membersI am glad to say not all -ha s never applied the policy of preference to returned soldiers. The party contains some fine, capable returned soldier members, but, as the successor to the late Mr J. A. Lyons, as Prime Minister, the party chose not an ex-serviceman, but the man whom they thought would do the best job for the party-the right honourable member for Kooyong( Mr has been endorsed by the honourable memMenzies). party do in the Senate? never indulged in the humbug, cant and hypocrisy about preference of the sort indulged in this morning by the honourable member for Wentworth and those who have supported him. When the House of Representatives met to elect its Speaker the United Australia party ignored the honourable member for Bendigo, a returned soldier, who would have filled the Speaker's chair with great dignity, and bestowed the Speakership on the honourable member for Perth( Mr Nairn), who was not a returned soldier. Similarly, you, Mr Chairman, a non-returned soldier, were chosen to act with grace and dignity as Chairman of Committees. The honourable member for Parramatta ( Sir Frederick Stewart) had no qualms about opposing a returned soldier in his constituency. Honourable members opposite do not practise what they preach. For 25 years, preference to returned soldiers has been the policy of this country, but of what value has it been to ex-service men. The great industrial concerns and banking houses have not taken the slightest notice of it. One day in BallaratI met, in uniform, a returned soldier whom I know, and said, "" Good day, Jack, how are you ?"" and he said, "" Good oh-neve r better off in my life! I was on the dole for eighteen months and now I am in the Volunteer Defence Corps and I pet six "" bob "" a day and two "" bob "" deferred pay and 3s. 6d. a day for the wife and some more for the children. Peace on the home front at last!"" That is how preference has worked for that man and for thousands like him under the rule of anti-Labour governments. I am satisfied that if this Government remains in power it will make it unnecessary to mention preference because we shall provide jobs for all instead of the 5s. 9d. a week which governments composed of men of the same calibre as honourable gentlemen opposite doled out to them instead of work. My policy is that stated in the report of the special committee which the honourable member for Moreton( Mr Francis) and Senator Collett, who were members of the committee with myself as chairman. I remember that I was opposed at the last general elections by a civilian. I am certain that the honourable member for Wentworth did not send a telegram to him saying, "" Stand clown for Reggie Pollard; he is a digger "". Oh, no!

Why the honourable member should be obsessed about munitions workers I do not know. I warrant that the honourable member has loafed in a shady patch in his paddocks away from the heat of the sun. I have seen the honourable member sound asleep in this chamber when important measures were being discussed. It is high time that this traducing of munitions workers ceased. I accept the undertaking given by the Prime Minister( Mr Curtin) and the Attorney-Oenera-l (Dr. Evatt). I consider the amendment futile. [3.30 a.m.] -Not many honourable members have been asleep while the honourable member for Ballarat( Mr Pollard) has been speaking. The honourable gentleman was correct when he stated that a unanimous decision wasarrived at by the special committee which considered repatriation matters. That committee affirmed the principle of preference to returned soldiers. I disagree, however, with other statements made by the honourable member because I believe that if it was competent and wise for the special committee to affirm the principle exactly the same rule should apply to this Parliament. I believe that the time to affirm that principle is now. One member of the Opposition has suggested that men engaged in this country who are not allowed to leave their present jobs should be placed on an equal footing with the men on active service. A man who lives in comparative comfort and security and enjoys good wages has an opportunity to provide for himself and his family which is denied to the man who goes on active service. I believe also that the man who goes on active service loses several of the best years of his life in which he may qualify for a trade or profession. It is not only necessary, but it is also ordinary justice, to ensure that that man will have preference on his return home. I do not I thought that the honbelieve that the people of Australia will stand for any man being told in effect, ""Look, old man, we want you to fight for this country. Its safety depends on you; but when you-come back you will have to battle to get a job "". Recently the Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt) has had a good deal to say about that fair deal which he intends to give to returned soldiers. The honourable gentleman has gone out of his way to say how badly returned soldiers were treated after the last war. I repeat what I have said formerly that I do not subscribe to that, view. The returned soldiers were not badly treated. Large sums of money were expended in the interests of returned soldiers; but what the people did hot realize was that many men were not competent to get back into civil life when they left the Army because years of rigid Army discipline had, in some degree, destroyed their initiative. They found it almost (Corangamite) impossible to compete with men who had been here all the time. It was because of such things that there were so many complaints. It was not because the people, or governments, were unwilling to help the returned men but because in many instances they were unable to help themselves. Because of that experience of the last war, the non-party special committee arrived at a unanimous decision. I believe that it would not prejudice any future legislation for this committee to reaffirm the principle of preference to returned soldiers. It would at least show that we recognize that we owe a debt of gratitude to them which, mere money can never pay, and that we at least intend to give to them a chance to rehabilitate themselves as the people who have never been asked to go away have had an opportunity to do. Minister) [3.33 a.m.] I have no objection whatever to the committee reaffirming its adherence to the principle of preference to returned soldiers-that is what the special committee recommended-bu t I have an absolute objection to giving expression to that principle by the doubtful authority of a regulation.

That responsibility should not rest on the Executive alone. This is a problem of great difficulty. I do not wish to traverse what took place after the last war, except to say that this Government has continued a practice which has lessened the application of the principle of preference to returned soldiers in the Commonwealth Service in that university graduates have been appointed to the Public Service, even though, in the nature of things, they could not be returned soldiers. 10 per cent, of the appointees. that nature must be continued in the interests of efficiency of administration in the years to come; yet that practice reprenon-unionists, as well as to soldiers. Nonsents some departure from the principle of absolute preference to returned soldiers. ment to work by the present Government. Many things must be taken into consideration if the principle is to work satisfactorily, having regard to all the requirements. Among those who have served this country well, are numbers of workmen who are not enlisted men. There is a Civil Constructional Corps now operating in a place beyond the mainland of Australia. Those men areengaged in an active theatre of war and have actually been bombed by the enemy. Having regard to the quality of the service that they are rendering to the nation they are as much entitled to preference as are many men in uniform who have walked daily from their homes to their offices since the war commenced. I think that that principle would be acceptable to any Parliament. Much depends on the place and the nature of the service that a man has rendered. Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia prescribes what men may, or may not, join their organization. Men must have served in certain areas to be eligible for membership. member has pointed out, organizations of returned soldiers impose certain limitain the amendment. tions on membership.

I regret that I was not in the chamber when the Prime Minister( Mr Curtin) commenced his speech. However, I wish to address myself to the amendment moved by the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Harrison). The Prime Minister has suggested that the whole of the responsibility of making regulations rests with the Government; but I remind him that the amendment makes it mandatory for the Government to enact regulations for the purpose set out, and does not leave anything to the discretion of the Government. vernment to do what? make regulations for the granting of preference to members of the forces. ence?

588,Mr Rosevear,"That is so. Idebate. If honourable members opposite think that they will receive any encouragement from the soldiers for this form of preference they are mistaken. The great majority of the men who are serving in our fighting forces are either trade unionists themselves, or the sons of trade unionists. If they have won any right for themselves in this war it is the right to work, and not the right of preference in work. If they are fighting, as we are told, to make the world a better place to live in, I am sure that they are fighting for a world in which every man who is prepared to toil will be provided with employment without the necessity of any form of preference. ""We are aware of the humbug of the Opposition parties following the last war. After that conflict, the great majority of the soldiers upon their discharge from the forces were left to fend for themselves. It was not until a considerable period after the end of the last war that anti-Labour governments displayed any interest in the rehabilitation of the men who served in that war. The preference of employment then extended to returned soldiers carried the qualification ""-other things being equal"". However, whenever a job worth having was to be filled other things were never equal. ""When a pick and shovel job was to be filled or some other job equally laborious, the returned soldier had no great difficulty, particularly during the depression, in obtaining preference from anti-Lahour governments; but if the jobs to be filled were really worth having, the qualification "" other things being equal"" was applied to the detriment of returned soldiers. Honourable members opposite should realize that an issue of this kind, which they hope to capitalize for political purposes, might prove very detrimental to the war effort. The workers in this, and every other country, have been told that this war is a mechanized war; that it is being waged as much by the men in the workshops as by the soldiers on the battlenow hope to apply it. The trade unions field. ""We have encouraged the workers of this country to believe that their job of keeping our mechanical units serviced, and producing munitions and war material is of equal importance to the job being done by the man at the front. Certainly, it can be conceded that workers in the factories do not take the same risk as the men at the front; but it must also be conceded that the jobs which the men are doing on the industrial front are of equal importance to those being done by the soldiers in the front line. I have had an opportunity to study how the policy of preference to returned soldiers works out. I have in mind a case which occurred in a municipality in my electorate. A returned soldier from the last war who was living on his war pension had a son-in-law who.became unemployed. The latter and his wife, because of their straitened circumstances, broke up their home and went to live with his father-in-law. Subsequently, the son-inlaw regained the job he formerly occupied. Immediately after he secured the job a protest was made to the municipal council because the man was not a returned soldier. He was again deprived of his job, and the position was given to a man who had relinquished a permanent job in the Tramway Department in Order to take that particular position. That case illustrates how the policy of preference to returned soldiers can work out unjustly. In that instance, a man who had a permanent job sought to better himself by exploiting the policy of preference to returned soldiers even to the degree of throwing another man out of work and forcing him to live on the charity of his father-in-law who, as I have said, was a repatriated "" digger"" of the last war. The proposition contained in the amendment might have serious repercussions on the industrial front. I challenge honourable members opposite to deny the fact that the previous Government of which they were members made an agreement with the trade unions, particularly the Amalgamated Engineers Union, which must be repudiated or amended, before the policy of preference to returned soldiers can operate in the way that honourable members opposite under agreements with a previous government accepted the breaking down of important industrial conditions in order to embrace the dilution scheme. The honourable member for ""Warringah ( Mr Spender) was a Minister in that Government which agreed with the unions that after this war no word of preference to returned soldiers would be raised, that tbe orable members opposite cannot pat the dilutees must make way for fully trained workers on the back and persuade them tradesmen, who were members of"" tbe to work long hours, and to sacrifice many unions, and absolute preference of emof the customs and usages in their trade, ployment was to be given to members of flattering them into believing that the the unions. the Prime Minister carry out his promise the war as the job which the soldiers in to introduce a measure to implement the the trenches are doing, and then, submit principle of preference of employment to this proposal which is tantamount to a returned soldiers if there is any basis for complete repudiation of the agreements what the honourable member has just entered into with the trade unions by this said ? honourable member for Parramatta ( Sir occupations and declared that work on the Frederick Stewart) of the agreements industrial front was just as important as with the trade unions entered into by the That Government, as well as the present Government in which he was a Minister.

620,Mr Archie Cameron,"I shouldpletely different set of circumstances has arisen. The speech of the honourable member for Bass( Mr Barnard) was bad enough, but the honourable member for Dalley does not talk "" through the back of his neck "" ; he is one of the most able, persistent and consistent members of the Government party, and when he speaks honourable members on this side are bound to take notice of anything that he says. His statement is strictly in accordance with the one he made last year in this chamber when the death duties and other matters were being discussed. To-night the honourable member made perfectly plain the attitude that he and the wing of the Labour party to which he belongs will take. be the tail and not the wing, but it has a big effect on the course which the Labour party steers. When the honourable member for Dalley and those who stand with him speak their mind in the Labour party, whether in Parliament or in caucus, some of us on this side know that they are speaking for a very big body of Labour opinion. I therefore say with great regret that it will now be the bounden duty of the Opposition to show exactly where we stand on this question. member favour the amendment moved by the honourable member for Wentworth? honourable member had been listening he would have known what I favour. The objective of the honourable member for Wentworth is to make it quite clear to the Government, and to the rather red. end of the Labour party which is mixed up with it, that there is on this side a definite demand for preference to returned soldiers. The Attorney-General may refer to the matter being considered when the Commonwealth Powers Bill is fixed up. that it was going to be brought in next session. right honourable gentleman made a number of references to the powers of the Commonwealth. powers of the Commonwealth might be extended, but that preference would be given to the limit of the Commonwealth's powers. was not the consistency of statement between the Attorney-General and the Prime Minister that there should be. sistency. ever inconsistency there was between them, there is no doubt as to the absolute abyss that exists between the attitude of the Prime Minister on the one hand and the honourable member for Dalley on the other. member for Dalley is only one.. vernment's majority is not very large, and with the shadow of John Thomas Lang over the Labour party in New South Wales a number of us are looking forward to the June conference of the Australian Labour party. in Sydney with some interest, and also with some trepidation, because if there is one thing which we do not want in this Parliament it is the presence of J.

The statement of the honourable member for Dalley, was a revelation to some of us on this side. deny it. can do what they please, but the facts must go on record, and if these agreements have been made the Ministers or ex-Ministers who made them must stand up to what they have done. From my point of view, this is one of the greatest derogations from the policy of the Opposition that I have ever heard of, and one of the greatest slips and blunders, and whoever was responsible must take the blame. I submit that in the division of the act I did not say so. I said to which the honourable member for Wentworth's amendment refers there is no definition of a member of the forces. a member of the forces is defined as one who served during the war of 1914-18.

643,Mr Blackburn (Bourke) [4.24 Apart Altogether From The Potent Con,"the Labour movement outside will be astounded to hear that the Prime Minister proposes to compel private employers to give preference to ex-soldiers over non-soldiers. I go a certain length with the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Harrison) in saying that, if there is to be preference to unionists, the soldiers' rights should be protected. I agree with that, and the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act provides that no award of preference to unionists can be made to the prejudice of returned soldiers. Section 81A of that act providesNothing in any award or order made under this act, or in any agreement relating to indus1 trial matters, shall operate to prevent the employment of returned soldiers or sailors. Then follows the definition of returned soldiers. The effect is that, in those rare cases in which the Commonwealth Arbitration Court has awarded preference to unionists, it has made quite clear that preference is subject to the rights of returned soldiers, who are to be employed on the same basis as unionists, even although they may not themselves be unionists. In a waterside workers case it transpired that on the waterfront the firstpreference was given to soldier unionists, and second preference to unionists who were not soldiers, and to soldier non-unionists on an equal footing. That is the only law operating under federal authority in Victoria dealing with that matter. There is no State legislation so far as I am aware-and I am fairly familiar with the subject-that gives any preference to soldiers in private employment in Victoria, or protects their rights in any way. If there is to be preference to unionists, then there should be provision that they should not get preference over returned soldiers. If there is to be compulsory unionism, there should be a provision preventing it from operating to the prejudice of the ex-soldier non-unionist. My experience, and I think that it is the experience of the Minister for Health( Mr Holloway), is that upon the basis of the claim for preference to soldiers there were built up by unscrupulous men unions which were fighting the genuine unions in the interests of the employers. Ex-soldiers were gathered into those unions on the assumption that they were going to get preference because they were soldiers. The soldiers had no reason to be at enmity with the unions, because the unions took a very prominent part in the rehabilitation of the soldiers. Without worrying whether ex-soldiers were unionists or non-unionists, they helped all and did what they could to see that they were taught trades. The result of that and other measures is that in Victoria, where there has been no preference to soldiers, the unions and the returned soldiers have got on well.. In the trade union movement in Victoria some of the best and strongest and most militant unionists are men who served in the last war. I believe that when the men come back from this war, the bulk of them will want to join the unions, but if the promise of preference to soldiers in private employment is held out to them, there will again be people organizing Unions of soldiers only, and saying to them, "" Do not join the ordinary unions of wage-earners, but join the union of soldiers only, because by joining it you can get preference over non-soldiers "". That is very dangerous; it is one of the things that a fascist government would introduce. I am astonished at the revelation of the vear), and the definite assertion of the honourable member for Bourke( Mr Blackburn), that they are opposed to preference to returned soldiers. Normally, I should readily have accepted the statement of the Prime Minister( Mr Curtin), and I was prepared to do so to-night. I asked my colleagues to accept his undertaking that he would introduce in the next period of the session a bill to grant preference to returned soldiers. But we have heard the only two private members on the Government side who have spoken state their opposition to the principle. for Reid( Mr Morgan) and Bass( Mr Barnard) have said the same thing.' one iota on the report that I have signed.

I began with that, and I end with it. That is the recommendation of the committee, so far as I am concerned. I had asked the honourable member for Wentworth not to proceed with his amendment, but to accept the undertaking of the Prime Minister. However, the speeches of the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Rosevear), the honourable member for Bourke( Mr as he would wish. Blackburn), the honourable member for Reid( Mr Morgan) and the honourable member for Bass( Mr Barnard), who have declared themselves to be opposed to preference, alter the situation entirely. With them, the Government's majority of two is gone, and preference to returned soldiers is gone also unless we exert pressure on the Government. 1 support the amendment, and I intend to continue to fight for preference. When the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Harrison) moved his amendment I rather regretted his action, bematter for which provision should be made by regulation. But the Government is right in saying that it should be dealt with by legislation. However, when we hear speeches of the kind made by some honourable members on the Government side, we realize that, however honest the Prime Minister( Mr Curtin) may be in his intentions, it is necessary for him to get his proposal through caucus before he can present it to the House. I know that the honourable member for Bass( Mr Barnard) is in favour of doing everything possible for returned soldiers, but his first duty is to the unionists. knows that several members of my family are volunteers in the forces. also know that the Minister for Repatriation ( Mr Frost) has sons in the forces, and he naturally desires that full repatriation benefits shall be available to them. over this matter, but some of the Government's supporters.

In the light of the statements made by honourable members opposite to-night, in view of opinions expressed in the past by the honourable member for Batman( Mr able gentleman will not split straws over Brennan), and having regard to the inclusion of the principle of preference to unionists in other legislation, it is necessary to divide the committee on my amendment.

The details fully fledged tradesmen. The history of are set out in Statutory Rule No. 102 of 1941, which embodied the National Security (Engineering Trades Dilution) Regulations.

The guilds which were established for their protection furnished proof of the way in which these crafts jealously guarded their industrial rights.

The quantity of secondary production, particularly in the metal trades, before the war, was inadequate. able in the post-war period he must be given work in preference to the dilutee. in brief. The shortage was real. The position was such as would have arisen if quired and only 2,000 were available. it would be necessary for 8,000 medical students to be rushed through their course in twelve months or two years, and allowed to function alongside fully qualified medical men, and, in consideration of the doctors accepting this invasion of their profession, they would have to be assured that, after the war, the 8,000 men who had come in during the war would not have rights as against those which the original 2,000 enjoyed. That is what was arranged with regard to the skilled trades. The agreements provided that a register was to be kept of all the dilutees as they came into the trades. Local dilution committees were set up, and the reason for having a register was because the principle that the last to come should be the first to go, in the event of the skilled industries meeting difficulties a.m.] I regret that the amendment has after the war, was accepted. member got back to preference to the members of the forces.

It is about time that honourable members opposite lived up to their statements that we should make our country a land fit for heroes to live in. When the Government refuses to accept a proposal of this kind one becomes tired of hearing 3uch statements. Very little cost would be involved in implementing the amendment. I am greatly surprised at the attitude adopted by the honourable member for Warringah. His insincerity in moving this amendment is obvious, because when he was a Minister in previous governments, he did not attempt to have repatriation benefits extended along the lines he now suggests. The honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Harrison), who, at one time, was Minister for Repatriation, also failed to extend repatriation benefits in this way. I regard the clause as adequate. Sir [5.50 a.m.] -It is all very well for honourable members opposite to smile, and say that past governments which we on this side supported, failed to extend repatriation benefits as is proposed in the amendment. We have not been in office since Japan came into the war, and up to that time no Australian soldier was required to serve in malaria-infested countries like New Guinea. Very few men who serve in the tropics will escape that disease. Indeed, some hospital ships are crowded with malaria cases on every return voyage from the northern battle zone. Those men will require attention not for twelve months but for the remainder of their lives. The Minister for the Navy( Mr Makin) interjected that such cases will be embraced by the proposed Apparently, the Government is prepared to provide benefits in cases of this kind only as a part of some general scheme which has nothing whatever to do with repatriation. I repeat that soldiers who contract malaria should be afforded adequate medical treatment for at least twelve months after the date of their discharge from the forces. covered. Minister for the Navy does not suggest that soldiers suffering from malaria should be obliged to wait for this treatment until such time as the Government's proposed national welfare scheme is put into operation. We do not yet know the details of that scheme. At all events, if the Government is prepared to provide treatment for these cases under some general welfare scheme, it admits the wisdom of the amendment. Therefore, it should make this provision under this bill rather than under a measure not related to . repatriation.

The amendment is designed to make all soldiers eligible to receive this benefit for a period of twelve months after their discharge, regardless of whether their indisposition is due to war service. The Minister for Repatriation ( Mr Frost) said that all soldiers will be eligible to receive this treatment for three months or six months or even longer, if it is found that their illness is due to war service. If a soldier nine months after his discharge, applies for medical treatment, how can it be proved that his ailment is due to war service? Will be have'to appear before a tribunal?

This matter might begin to operate within a few days, but a vast system of medical and hospital service for every body is not in operation yet, and is not likely to be for some time, according to the Treasurer ( Mr Ohifliey), so that there will be a gap between the introduction of that service and the discharge of the soldiers', who may urgently need treatment in the next twelve months.

It seems reasonably certain that men discharged from the Army will have some disease latent in them, because of their services. If a man becomes ill , he may have to be treated by a general practitioner who is unable to diagnose an obscure tropical complaint. Because of his failure to obtain the advice of a specialist, the disease may develop rapidly, causing him to become a charge on the country. In the long run, the cost to the country would be greater than would be involved in free medical service for the short period during which the majority of the men would need it. I cannot understand why the Government is not prepared to accept the amendment. It would result in a considerable saving of man-power, repatriation benefits, pensions and general medical services. Repatriation) [6.31 a.m.] I cannot understand the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Harrison). He was a member of a committee which went into this matter with the Prime Minister( Mr Charles Marr) has stated repeatedly that Ourtin) and myself, the result of which was that the Government agreed that a member totally and permanently incapacitated by reason of any complaint, should if necessary be treated for twelve months. He was satisfied with that decision. There is not sufficient hospital accommodation to provide free medical treatment for all disabilities, whether war caused or not. The honourable member for Parkes( Sir Charles Marr) continues to "" harp"" on malaria. I have had as much experience of that disease as he has, and know the effects of it and the measures which have to be taken to guard against it. Any member of the forces who has any disability, will be cared for. The whole of the repatriation system would be broken down, if the Government were to accept responsibility for everything that was not war caused. All that is possible will be done. Wentworth ( Mr Harrison), Parkes( Sir Charles Marr) and Moreton( Mr prompted the special committee to reject Francis), have been Ministers of the Crown, and must recognize that the Repatriation Department does everything possible for those who have war disapresent rule. able gentleman agree with the Minister for Health that medical benefits are now available ?

I cannot accept the amendment. It would not confer any benefit on the returned soldier, and every facility for treatment is now afforded. I am unable to support the amendment. The special committee discussed this matter at length and from several angles. The committee was impressed mostly by the fact that any soldier with a disability due to war service may promptly obtain medical attention. The honourable member for Parkes( Sir appearance before a tribunal is necessary. That is not a fact. If a soldier who has been discharged contracts a disability due to his war service, he can seek advice from a medical practitioner appointed by the Repatriation Department, wherever he may be, and secure admittance immediately to a hospital. The committee should particularly bear in mind that, when the war is over our hospitals will be filled with very badly disabled soldiers. If men suffering from disabilities that are not due to war service are allowed to take up the available accommodation, bad and urgent cases which may need special treatment will not be able to obtain it in the hospitals. Those who have malaria can obtain automatic treatment.

The widows of these men will receive £3 8s. a week, compared with the £2 10s. a week that is to be received by the widow of a soldier on the lowest rate of pay. I cannot find justification for that. Regard must be had to the fact that men .who qualify for commissions are usually anxious to establish their families in suitable circumstances. The debate has disclosed the position in which a widow with children is placed on' the death of her husband, compared with her position during his lifetime. The anomaly is aggravated tremendously in the higher commissioned ranks. I do not know why credit is not given to those who hold such",119,Charles Marr Parkes Has Been Discharged And He Will Not Be
797,Mr Spender,"ranks. Having regard to their official position, their widows should not be given a mere pittance. There must be greater disparity than is proposed between these persons and those who are on the basic rates. The widows of men who received between 7s. and 18s. a day are to be given £2 10s. a week, whilst the widows of officers of higher ranks are to receive only £3 8s. a week. I urge the Minister to recast' the schedule so as to give a larger amount, to the widows of men on the higher rates. There is every justification for an increase of the rates throughout the schedule by at least' 50 per cent. A pension of £3 8s. a week to the widow of the highest ranking officer is a shocking tribute to the service rendered by such men. [6.44 a.m.] I expected the Minister to reply to the representations of the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr recommendation of the committee should Spender). I am completely in accord with what that honourable member has said. It is reasonable that men who, by their ability, rise to a high rank in the Army, should have extra pay, and that their widows should receive adequate compensation for the loss of income which they suffer by reason of the death of their husbands. It is all very well for the honourable member for Parkes( Sir Charles Marr) to say that we are all in the war together, and should be all on the same level. The fact is that we have not accepted that principle. In practice, the general and his wife have to maintain a higher standard of living than have the private and his wife. That is no disgrace for the private; it is simply a fact. I am surprised that the Minister has not attempted to justify the proposal of the Government, seeing that the financial loss suffered by the widow of a general is so much greater than that suffered by that of a widow of a private. I support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr stance that the 20 per cent, increase was Spender) with the greater pleasure because it was one of the recommendations which ithe Government rejected. The committee recommended an increase of 20 per cent., but the Government proposes to make a flat increase of 8s. for all ranks. I am a democrat, but the fact remains that every one is not on the basic wage. I cite the instance of a distinguished naval officer who was required to maintain a home commensurate with his rank. He also had to pay insurance premiums, and to maintain his children at a boarding school. He made an allotment of £18 a week for the maintenance of his family. 'His ship went down and he lost his life, and the income of his family dropped from £18 a week to between £3 and £4. Naval officers and professional soldiers, who devote all their energies to their profession, have little opportunity to build up an estate. Their normal expectation is that they will be able to support their family on their superannuation when they retire. I cannot understand why the have been departed from, and I ask the Minister to reconsider his decision. Repatriation) [6.52 a.m.] I cannot accept the amendment. It is strange that the only increase which the honourable member for Moreton( Mr Francis) has pressed should be for the officers. and is unworthy of the Minister. No one could have helped him more than I have done, and I have done it in the interest of the soldiers. difference after the last war in the rate of pensions payable to officers and private soldiers.

Many honourable members who found themselves unable to agree to a further general increase of the pensions rate expressed their readiness to support a proposal for increasing widows' pensions. These women have to adjust their way of living after the death of their husbands, and their only offence is that they have given their husbands to the service of their country. At present, the grim telegram announcing the death of a husband is followed very shortly by an almost equally grim communication announcing that, because of his death, the family income is to be considerably reduced. We cannot give the woman back her husband, but we ought at least to defer the second blow. In my amendment I am asking only that the diminution of income as between allotment and pension should not occur for a period of twelve months. There is a precedent for this in regard to what may be called civilian casualties. Widows who are not qualified under the general terms of the widows' pensions provision receive a compassionate grant for six months to enable them to adjust themselves to their new condition. In order to show the unfairness of the present proposal of the Government I cite the instance of the widow of a lieutenant. The man's allotment to his wife is £3 10s., but upon his death the widow would lose £1 a week. If she had one child her loss of income would amount to £1 8s. 6d. a week; with two children it would be £1 10s. a week; and with three children it would be £1 8s. a week. I maintain that some provision should be made to enable her to adjust herself to the altered situation. She would probably have to obtain a cheaper house, and make other suitable domestic arrangements. able member arrive at the figures which he has just cited? They were supplied to me by the Commissioner for Repatriation. The variation of the amount of loss in respect of different numbers of children is due to the differential increases of children's allowances provided for in the bill. Unless the committee accepts an amendment of this kind, the widows of soldiers will have to live on their previous savings, while adjusting themselves to their greatly reduced incomes. I suggest to honourable members that this amendment at least will strongly appeal to their sympathetic impulses, and I ask the Minister to accept it without a division. Repatriation) [7.1 a.m.] -The essential basis of the war pension scheme in Australia for both members of the forces and their dependants is a standard rate of pension in the .case of all ranks up to the rank of lieutenant. If the proposal of the honourable member for Parramatta ( Sir Frederick Stewart) were accepted, a drastic departure from this principle would result. In the case of a widow, with three children, of a soldier of the rank of private, she .would receive by way of pension under the amendment £5 Is. 6d. a week, whereas the widow and children of a lieutenant would receive £5 15s. 6d. a week. To pay war pensions at such differing rates would be quite opposed to the principle upon which the pension has been based in Australia since 1920. A departure from the principle in favour of one class would lead to pressure in the case of a member for pension to be paid for a period at the rate of his pay while serving as a member. The committee has already agreed to increase the pension of the first child of a widow from 12s. 6d. to 17s. 6d. a",121,General Pensions Rates Column 2 Column 3 Column 4

In view of this fact, and the departure from the principle previously mentioned, the Government cannot accept the amendment. a.m.] -It is obvious and regrettable that, although we are living in a democracy, the repatriation officials are opposed to every amendment which honourable members submit. The department has prepared answers in opposition to every proposed amendment that has been circulated. The case presented by the honourable member for Parramatta should receive the strong support of the committee. The wife of a young man may have been in receipt of from £7 to £9 a week, but on the enlistment of her husband the income of the home is greatly reduced. If her husband suddenly died in action, the widow's income would immediately be further reduced by 30 per cent, or 40 per cent. Have we no sense of our responsibility and no desire to honour our promises to do what is fair to the widows of soldiers? I cannot understand the Government refusing to give way in the slightest degree. If any amendment has merit, surely that now under consideration has. When the wife of a soldier suddenly becomes a widow she needs some period in which to adjust herself to her weakened financial position, and all that is asked for by the honourable member for Parramatta is that for twelve months she shall not be placed in any worse position than when her husband was alive. I hope that the Minister will reject the advice of the repatriation officials, and support the important principle embodied in the amendment. Otherwise we shall witness a travesty of democracy. a.m.] -If acceptance of the amendment involves a departure from principle I am not appalled by the fact, and I think that the Minister might well give the amendment the reconsideration that it deserves. There is great merit in the proposal of the honourable member for Parramatta ( Sir Frederick Stewart). I am not concerned about the social position of members of the forces, but I am concerned at the fact that when a woman loses her husband she has to expect almost immediately to have [73] to meet a position in which her income is considerably diminished. Figures were quoted by the honourable member for Moreton( Mr Francis) to show that a widow with three children is 14s. a week worse off than when her husband was still serving with the forces. vernment has given 5s. a week for each child, and the difference is now only 9s. a week. to ask that the allotment shall continue for a period of twelve months. If the children are young the widow will have to provide for their education and arrange for accommodation for them, if she herself takes a position. Because of the sacrifice of the father we should not make it appear that we are anxious to finish, as quickly as possible, our financial obligations to the widow and her children in respect of the father's service. If the amendment be not accepted a similar proposal will be submitted in the Senate, and probably be agreed to. It will then be sent back to this committee, and we shall be asked to agree to it. In order to obviate the necessity to agree to an amendment by the Senate, we should recognize the intrinsic merit of the proposal now. If the honourable member for Parramatta had had more time to circulate his amendment, it might have received closer consideration at the hands of the Government, but the fact that it has been hurriedly prepared does not justify its hasty rejection. We cannot do too much for the widows and children of the men who give their lives to keep this country free. This plea on behalf of soldiers' widows and their children should not fall on deaf ears. The former member for Melbourne, Dr. Maloney, was a noted advocate of the claims of women and children, and he would have warmly supported an amendment of this kind, regardless of the side of the chamber from which it emanated. The children of the nation are our living capital and we cannot do too much to help them. If there is lack of parental control to-day of children who have both parents to look after them, how serious will be the charge against us if we refuse the widow of a soldier increased financial support over a period of twelve",122,General Pensions Rates Column 2 Column 3 Column 4

We shall have introduced many new principles before the war is over, and the new order is established, and we should not be so conservative as to say that what was a principle of this act in 1920 must be a principle of it in 1943. a.m.] I am amazed that the Minister for Repatriation ( Mr Frost) is not. preher during her husband's war service for pared to accept the amendment moved by the honourable member for Parramatta ( Sir Frederick Stewart). The Minister is too big a man to have a little heart. He should let his head go, throw away the advice tendered to him by his hard hearted officials, tear up the notes they have given to him, and show bigness of heart. In order to prove the justice of the amendment, I shall compare the family income of "" A "", a person drawing a 100 per cent, pension, before his death with the amount received by his widow after death. On the present scale the family income would be a minimum of £8 15s. a week, and on the proposed scale £9 13s., an improvement of 18s., but after his death it would drop to £4 5s. a week, anomalies, but that which the honourable a loss on the present scale of £5 10s., and on the proposed scale, £5 18s. It is anomalous that his widow loses more under the proposed rates than she does under the operating rates. The Minister cannot challenge the authenticity of these are based holds good. The shock that a figures, which were supplied by officers of his own department who are well aware of the case. It is encumbent upon the Minister to get this matter into proper perspective, and to remove anomalies from the schedules contained in this bill. widow of a soldier who is killed or dies from injuries or disease sustained on active service with the widow of a man killed in a street accident in New South Wales. awarded £800 as lump sum compensation plus £50 for two children plus £1 10s. a week Commonwealth widows' pension, plus £1 a week and 10s. a week for each child under the New South Wales Widows and Orphans Pensions Act. How comparison with the way in which beneficent governments treat the civilians' widows. widow does not qualify for a pension under the Widows' Pension Act. woman receives £800 of capital which she can invest in a small business, whereas on the death of her husband the war widow is plunged into penury. Maintenance of the military allotment paid to twelve months after his death would enable the war widow to adjust herself to her new status. My plea, which is not in any way exaggerated, must touch the Minister's heart. It would cost the Treasurer little to comply with the proposal made by the honourable member for Parramatta. ask the Minister for Repatriation ( Mr Frost) to reconsider his answer to the honourable member for Parramatta ( Sir Frederick Stewart), whose suggestion has more virtue than many others that have been made in this debate. The discussion has brought to light many member for Parramatta is seeking to remove is the worse. I do not think that the Minister's reply that to accept the amendment would infringe the flat rate on which pensions woman suffers when she loses her husband should not be intensified by the additional shock of finding herself in sadly reduced circumstances as the result of her late husband's sacrifice of his life in the defence of his country. If we canCompare the lot of the not ensure that a war widow shall continue to receive the amount which she received while her husband was on active service surely we can afford to ensure that for the twelve months following his The widow of the civilian is death an amount equivalent to the allotment she received from his Army pay shall continue.

819,Mr Coles (Henty) [7.20 A.m.],"Ia.m.] I welcome the support of the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr come back to the chamber and announce Calwell) and the honourable member for Henty( Mr Coles) to the reasonable proposal which has been made by the honourable member for Parramatta ( Sir Frederick Stewart). The plight of a war widow deprived of the money that she was receivingwhen her husband was an active defender of this country was mentioned during the debate on the second reading. Several honourable members presented strong arguments in support of the Government maintaining a war widow on the same financial basis that she was on when her husband was still soldiering. The Government has agreed to pay child endowment for the first child of all such widows. Therefore, instead of losing 14s. a week, she will now lose 9s. The Treasury would, as every one must agree, suffer little loss if answers honourable member's suggestions all war widows were allowed to retain the £23 8s. a year which it is now proposed that they shall lose. My main concern is the widows on the bread line. RecentlyI was visited in my office in Sydney by the widow of a sailor about whose death she did not learn until she read it in the casualty list in a newspaper. She met her husband in England and married him there, and she told me that she had no friends in this country. The income of that woman who has three children drops from £5 to £3 19s. a week. I give the Government good marks for this bill, but I would give it a credit if it would yield on this matter. -In my second-reading speech, I said that the recommendation of the special committee on pensions for widows and orphans had not achieved what the members of the committee aimed at. I pointed out that a widow of a soldier killed on active service overseas lost 14s. a week as the result of his death. The Minister has gone a part of the way towards removing that anomaly by agreeing to extend child endowment to the first child of such a widow. That, however, still leaves the widow at a disadvantage of 9s. a week as compared with her financial condition when her husband was a member of the forces. I think that after pondering this matter at the breakfast table the Minister will that the proposal of the honourable member for Parramatta ( Sir Frederick Stewart) is worthy, and that it will be accepted. All I ask is that for twelve months after the death of her husband a war widow be paid by the Government the allotment which her husband made to her while he was alive in order that she may be enabled to readjust herself to her altered circumstances. of a private soldier with two children loses l is . a week on the death of her husband. tions have been in respect of families in which there are three children. I dispute the suggestion that all the Minister for Repatriation ( Mr Frost) does when he is to read a statement prepared for him by officials of the Repatriation Department. The Minister should not look to officials for decisions. He makes the decisions, with the approval of his colleagues in the Ministry and asks the officials of the Repatriation Department for the data to support them. What the Minister does is acquaint his officers of his decision and ask them to provide him with a detailed reply setting out the grounds of objection. The Minister is entitled to obtain from departmental officers whatever information is necessary to enable him to place before honourable members his view of the case. Sitting suspended from 7.30 lo 9.80 a.m. the committee is that a married woman who loses her husband on war service shall continue to receive for a period of twelve months the rate of service pay to which she was entitled while her husband was alive. The principle has been adopted from the Widows' Pensions Act, under which a widow who cannot quite qualify for a pension is granted a gratuity for six months in order to enable her to adjust herself to the altered standard of living made necessary by the death of her husband. In my opinion, that is one of the best features of the pensions system. I appreciate the action",124,General Pensions Rates Column 2 Column 3 Column 4

824,Mr Francis,"The proposal beforeof the Government in yielding to representations made by myself and other honourable members on both sides to grant 5s. a week for the first child. Our discussions sidered by the Minister( Mr Frost). have been based on a widow with three children, in respect of two of whom she receives child endowment. The amendment of the honourable member for Parramatta would improve the bill substantially, and assist a woman greatly in the time of her greatest need. Under the bill as drafted, a woman with three children whose husband is serving with the forces would receive 14s. a week less after the death of her husband than when he was alive. The concession to which I have just referred reduces that difference by 5s. a week, but she will have an income of 9s. a week less than before the loss of her husband. A payment of an addiditional 9s. a week for twelve months would amount to only about £23 a member. At an earlier hour I asked the Minister to consider the amendment during the suspension of the sitting for breakfast, and I hope that he is now in a posiit before the committee, which agreed to tion to say that he will accept it. a.m.] I cannot add anything to what has been said, except to urge the Minister( Mr Erost) to give to the amendment his favorable consideration. I believe that it would improve the bill, and I intend to much to bridge the gap that previously vote for it. a.m.] -I , too, shall support the amendment of the honourable member for Parramatta ( Sir Frederick Stewart). When a man is killed on active service the change in the family life comes more suddenly than after the death of the bread winner in civil life, following a 7 long illness. In the latter instance the* the suggestion of the Minister for Repatfamily has some time in which to adjust itself to the changed circumstances, but in the event of the death of a serviceman that change is sudden. The result is that in the moment of her greatest sorrow the widow has to face great financial difficulties. I ask the Minister to view the amendment favourably; but, should he not see his way to accept it now, I suggest that he refer it back to the special committee for investigation and report. I think that the amendment is reasonable, and might well be favourably conAny woman who loses her husband on active service is entitled to our deepest sympathy; but, should she have young children to care for, her position is most difficult, notwithstanding the various benefits she may receive under the repatriation legislation passed by this Parliament. I ask the Minister to accept the amendment. Not a great deal of money is involved. Repatriation) [9.37 a.m.] I hope that the honourable member for Parramatta ( Sir Frederick Stewart) will not press his amendment. I am impressed by the suggestion of the honourable member for New England( Mr Abbott) that this matter be referred back to the special committee which previously submitted a report to the Government. This matter was raised some time ago and I brought abolish the means test for widows. Later the Government agreed to make an allowance of 5s. for the first child of a family, in respect of whom no child endowment is paid. I have no desire to be hard on widows, but I think that the concessions already made are considerable. They do existed between the amount payable to the wife of a soldier before and after she becomes a widow. I trust that the committee will accept the clause in its present form. I should like to accede to the wishes of honourable members, but I cannot see my way to do so. matta) [9.40 a.m.] I cannot agree to riation ( Mr Frost) that I should withdraw my amendment in order that the proposal embodied in it may be referred to the special committee for investigation.

He would be a bold prophet indeed who would prophesy what will happen in the political sphere within the next few months. Every week men are losing their lives in the battle line, and we have no right to defer this matter. The Minister's statement that the financial position of the widow will be improved by the granting of 5s. a week in respect of the first child of a family has no significance. We are not asking for this payment in perpetuity, but merely for a time suflicient to enable a woman who has lost her husband in the country's service to adjust her economic conditions to her new circumstances. Eor the information of honourable members who were not here 'when this proposal was submitted to the committee, I repeat that the wife of a private soldier with one child receives by way of standard allotment and dependant's allowances £3 17s. ,a week while her husband is alive, but after his death that amount, after allowing for the concession of os., which has since been made in respect of the first child, will fall to £3 7s. 6d., a reduction of 9s. 6d. a week.

It is not only fair, but also is urgently required. The proposal comes within a different category from those matters which were discussed at earlier stages of the bill. In the first place, the benefit to the widow will not be permanent; it will continue for only twelve months. It is different from an adjustment of a pension' which may continue for many years. The proposal is to pay to the widow a sum which will tide her over a most critical period. This is not a matter upon which the all-party committee can give us any great assistance. All that is involved is a plain question of fact, whilst the extra cost is small in relation to the total pension. I urge the Minister to accept the amendment. It falls within an entirely different category from the other amendments which have been proposed, most of which involve questions of principle, and difficult calculations. This provision is to operate for only twelve months after the death of the soldier; but it is within that period that the widow requires all the assistance that can be given to her. The amendment provides only a temporary benefit. The benefit will operate for twelve months after the death of the soldier.

When service pensions were introduced into the Repatriation Acti n 1935, it w ill be recalled that one of the alternative' conditions to obtaining a service pension, was that an applicant should be permanently unemployable. A definition of permanently unemployable was then inserted in section 22 of the act, in the following terms:Permanently unemployable means permanently incapable by reason of physical and mental disablement of being employed in a remunerative occupation. I As that definition stands, a man may be deemed to be capable of being employed in a remunerative occupation, although he has no reasonable chance of being so employed.

This condition is I would not say that. satisfied when capacity for earning has gone except for the chance of obtaining special employment of an unusual kind. In connection with service pensions, as is the case with invalid and old-age pensions, the authorities tend to hold that if an applicant is capable of performing some class of remunerative work, he is not permanently unemployable within the meaning of the definition, although the getting of such work is only remotely possible. may becompletely untrained for such work.",129,General Pensions Rates Column 2 Column 3 Column 4

The commission feels that it can safely be left to the discretion of medical officers to form an opinion and make a recommendation to the board, after examination of the applicant.

Yes. I should like to hear the opinion of the Minister upon this matter. As are always a private member, he expressed definite views on the subject. I am confident that, if he were to speak his mind freely this morning, he would express even more emphatically and effectively than I did the opinion that the proposed new clause is justified. a.m.] I support the proposal, because it appeals to every honourable member who represents a rural constituency. Repeatedly, we encounter sad cases of hardship. Men who might be able to obtain employment in some capacity in a large city have no chance of getting a job in the small town or village in which they live. While they reside in those districts they are totally and permanently incapacitated, and they have no money or means to enable them to travel to the city in search of employment. In the name of humanity, I ask the Minister to accept the proposed new clause. a.m.] -Fo r seven years I administered the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act, and I considered that one of the mostvaluable authorities possessed by the responsible Minister was the opportunity to grant, in special circumstances, a compassionate pension. That opportunity was availed of only in extraordinary The Minister( Mr Frost) should have a similar authority for the purpose of enabling him to grant a compassionate pension. Many men are tated; but, because of physical defects, lack of training, or the locality in which they are forced to live, they are unable to earn any money. The Repatriation Commission should have a discretionary power to deal with those cases, and such a provision would enormously improve the administration of the act.

"" I agree with the right honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page) that the discretionary power should be conferred on the ""Repatriation Commission, which is responsible for granting or refusing this assistance. The proposed new clause, if adopted, w ill not involve a substantial increase of expenditure. the increase of expenditure. of the act at present results in hardship; but the difficulty can be overcome by granting to the commission power, in special circumstances, to make a compassionate payment to a man whose condition of health prevents him from earning any money. support the proposed new clause and ask the Minister for Repatriation ( Mr Frost) to give the fullest consideration to it. The value of granting some discretion to the Repatriation Commission at this point is that it w ill save a good deal of acute distress in the community. The difference between the f u l l pension of £2 10s. and the pension payable to a totally and permanently incapacitated person is substantial. This class of case constantly arises, but tribunals cannot deal with them. The applicant cannot prove that he is unable to work, although he has no chance of obtaining permanent or regular employment. The Minister should not dismiss the proposal lightly. If adopted, it will facilitate the administration of the act. No danger can arise from showing leniency in this instance. a.m.] I regard the proposition sympathetically. I do not know whether the honourable member for Bourke( Mr Blackburn) sought to draw a distinction between the class of person to whom he referred, and service pensioners. pensioners. . ber w ill recollect the comprehensive discussion that took place when a previous government introduced legislation to amend the act. The measure, which was long overdue, conferred great benefits on a long-neglected section of the conirauiiity. I should like to know whether the persons whom the honourable member has in mind are, or are not, included in the class eligible to receive the service pension. has been refused the service pension. am not thinking of permanently unemnloyable person, other things being equal, is eligible to receive the service pension. The Minister( Mr. Frost) should give to this matter his close, immediate and sympathetic consideration. In the modern world, it is very easy for a person to become permanently unemployable. If he does not fit into a niche, there is no place for him. If a person lacks the physical strength to enable him to fight for recognition, he must become a specialist, and rely upon skill and alertness to w in a place for him. This class of totally and permanently incapacitated person is most deserving, and should be eligible to receive the service pension. If the Minister has considered differentiating between the various classes of persons who are now entitled to receive the service pension, perhaps he w ill be good enough to study the class to whom the honourable member for Bourke referred.

An applicant shall not be denied a pension in respect of disability resulting from injury or disease or the aggravation thereof incurred during military service or in respect of the death of a' member of the Forces resulting from such injury or disease or the aggravation thereof solely on the ground that no substantial disability or disabling condition is considered to have existed at the time of discharge of such member of the ForcesI have had the opportunity of discussing sub-section 1 of proposed new section 23A with the representatives of the Repatriation Department. It relates to preenlistment disabilities. Sub-section 2 of section 23 of the act, although it has been slightly altered by an amendment moved in committee by the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes), can, for the purposes of my argument, be quoted as it appears in the original act, as follows:Notwithstanding that the origin of the cause of the death or incapacity of a memher of the Forces, who, after enlistment with those forces, served in camp in Australia for at least six months or embarked for active service with those forces overseas, existed prior to his enlistment, where, in the opinion of a board(a) the conditions of his war service contributed to any material degree to the death or incapacity. of the member ; and (b) neither the death or incapacity, nor the origin of the cause of the death or incapacity, was due to the default or wilful act of the member, the Commonwealth shall, subject to this act, be liable to pay to the member or his dependants, or both, as the case may be, pensions in accordance with this division. The proposed new sub-section 1 was prepared for the purpose of providing no deduction shall be made from the degree of actual disability of any member of the forces who has served in a theatre of actual war, on account of any disability or disabling condition which existed in him at the time at which he became a member of the forces, with a proviso that no pension shall be paid for a disability which at the time was wilfully and so on. I am told by the Department that, although on my reading of sub-section 2 of section 23 of the act there would be no obligation to pay the Mr Spender. pension in f u l l , the department does not make any deduction for any disability that comes within the section. That meets my objection, and makes sub-section 1 of proposed new section 23 A unnecessary. Sub-section 2 of my proposed new section 23A deals with the case in which a man is discharged from the forces w i th no substantial disability, and later becomes disabled through in j u r y or disease, or their aggravation, incurred during military service, or dies as a consequence of such in j u r y or disease. It would prevent the commission from taking advantage of the fact that no substantial disability was considered to have existed at the time of discharge, in determining whether a pension should be granted. AgainI am informed by the Repatriation Commission that, in actual practice and administration, both those aspects are covered. I accept that assurance, and in the circumstances I ask leave to withdraw my motion-. New clause-by leave-withdrawn . New clause 17A.

If he were given a full pension for tuberculosis due to war service, it would cost the Government only £2 ls. 6d. a week more to make up the service pension to a full pension, instead of the sanatorium cost of from £4 3s. to £5 l is . a week for his treatment in an institution, in addition to the service pension of £1 ISs. 6d. The granting to all tuberculosis sufferers of a full pension would, therefore, effect a considerable saving to the Repatriation Department. I understand that the Minister intends to adopt the proposed new clause, and I appreciate his ready acceptance of the representations made by me to him in this matter. I believe that it will do great service and bring about a large measure of relief to a section of our community, the members of which have been the greatest sufferers from war disabilities. By this clause they move up to the full pension. I am pleased to know that the Minister( Mr Frost) has agreed to grant the full pension to sufferers from pulmonary tuberculosis who have served in a theatre of war. They deserve every consideration, and I have done everything in my power to help them. As I have pointed out, in common with other honourable members, the cost involved will not be very great. I am pleased that after 25 years this Government has the credit of bringing in a comprehensive repatriation bill, including this very much needed reform. I congratulate the Government on all that it has done. a.m.] A supplement to this clause is really the question of the continuous payment of the pension while the patient is in hospital. I raised the matter at the time on the appropriate clause, but, owing to some misunderstanding or confusion, the necessary amendment was not made in clause 42. When the bill is reported from committee, I ask the Minister( Mr Frost) to recommit it, in order to enable a consequential amendment to be made, so as to allow the full intention of the Government and the committee to be carried into effect. New clause agreed to. New clause 17B. a.m.] I move That, after new clause 17A, the following now clause be inserted:"" 17B. After section thirty-one A of .the Principal Act the following section is inserted:' 31AB (1.) The Commission may, on special application in that behalf, grant a compassionate pension or allowance in any case which it considers to be specially meritorious, but in which the Commission, or, on an appeal, a Tribunal, has decided that the applicant is otherwise unqualified to receive such an award under this Act. ' (2.) The amount of any compassionate pension or allowance granted under this section shall be such sum as the Commission shall fix, but not exceeding the amount to which the applicant would have been entitled if his entire claim to payment had been upheld.'."". I submit that provision because one finds, from time to time, many cases which do not come within the ambit of the act, but in which I am quite certain that, if the commission were invested with this power, ii would be only too ready to see that the applicant got some assistance. Most honourable members know that such cases can arise undaidecxion 15ATJ... which provides that, where the incapacity or death of a member is not due to his default or wilful act, or does not arise from intentionally self-inflicted injuries, or from any breach of discipline by him, a pension will be granted, but where it is so due a pension will not be granted.

The commission itself, by tlie way in which it handles tbe matter, will be its own brake on the number of applications likely to be made, but I suggest that there should be this safeguard in the act in order to cover cases which are otherwise meritorious, but which fail to comply with its strict provisions. Repatriation) [10.43 a.m.] -As the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr only should govern tbe granting of penSpender) said, this is a very important matter. If the proposed new clause were agreed to, it would practically lead to another pension being granted. Those who fail to obtain a pension would apply for a compassionate allowance, and I do not know where the commissioner could stop. This matter was referred to in my second-reading speech, and it was thought that the Government had given sound reasons for not introducing such a system in the act, the basic principle of which must be a war pension, payable in respect of war-caused incapacity. The introduction of a compassionate grant system such as the honourable member for Warringah asks for, would lead to no end of confusion and odious comparisons between the value of the services of one man and another. The Governinent believes that all its fighting men are worthy of equal consideration, and does not consider that it is the desire of Australian people that special treatment should be given to those who have merited special recognition and have earned decorations and other honours on the field. The principle to be followed by this Government is that all who serve, and their dependants, shall be entitled to full provision in respect of the results of war service, To do otherwise would immedif.tely lead to undesirable controversy as to the relative merits of the services of individuals. A very important reason why approval should not be given to the proposed new clause is that it would In simply mean that in the majority of cases, where claims for a war pension had been refused, the application would be made for the grant of a compassionate allowance. Experience has shown that it is almost impossible to argue that any soldier did not have meritorious service. Moreover, in view of the tightening up of the onus of proof clause in the bill, the onus would be on the commission to prove in each case that meritorious service had not been rendered. This would be a most invidious task. The result can well be imagined, because every soldier to his friends and comrades is a hero. It is considered most undesirable to suggest that a pension should be paid to soldiers on a compassionate basis. One principle sions under the Repatriation Act.

My desire is to right what I regard as a very great wrong that is being done to many legal wives of soldiers, who receive no assistance by way of a pension when the husband has been killed, the natural or de facto wife receiving the whole of the amount payable on account of his death. After 1920, discretionary power was given to the commission to make the pension payment to both the legal and the natural wife.

A de facto wife may have been living for only a few years with the soldier subsequently killed, whereas the legal wife may have been a good wife to him for very many years. The Minister has replied to representations that I have made concerning a signaller who was killed on the 18th A p r i l , 1941, leaving a natural wife, an adopted child, and two ex-nuptial children residing in Victoria. He had also a legal wife. deliberations, took into account that, owing to the duration of the association, on a marital basis, of the soldier and the de facto wife-that is, from about 1936he was the de facto husband of the woman for only five years, during a portion of which time he was away at the war; but, because there had been issue, and also because the soldier had made a w ill in which he had appointed his de facto wife executrix and sole beneficiary, the commission gave the whole of the pension to her. It probably had no other course open to it . On the other hand, the legal wife had been married to him for very many years and may have been extremely good to him. He may have left her through no fault of her own. Yet she was deprived of the right to a. pension by the alteration made to the act in 1940. It cannot be argued that what I am proposing has not been done under other legislation of this Parliament. Under the Seamen's War Pensions and Allowances Act, the National Security (Civil Defence Volunteers) Regulations, and the National Security (War Injuries Compensation) made whereby both the legal and de facto wife may receive 50 per cent, of the pension. The Widows' Pensions Act provides that a de facto wife and a legal wife may each receive the f u l l pension. I ask the Government to agree to the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act being brought into line with the Widows' Pensions Act, and the committee to approve of that course. Pensions Act, it is possible for three women to receive a pension in respect of the one man. in my treatment of the subject; I am considering the case of only two women. The cost involved would probably not be great. The commission would have the discretion to make a double payment, if necessary. The honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron) said last night that he is not in favour of any compensation being paid to de facto wives. He added that livin g with a woman to whom one is not married is an immoral act, and should be stopped. The effect of the act at present is to give The commission, in its compensation by way of a pension to the woman whom the soldier alleges has sinned. I wish to obtain some justice for the legal wife, who has probably committed no sin. If she has sinned, and the commission considers that she is unworthy of being assisted, it will have discretion to refuse the pension. covered ? children are innocent victims of either mother. Absolute control would be in the hands of the commission. I therefore appeal to the Minister to accept the proposed new clause and thus bring this legislation into line with the Widows' Pensions Act as well as with the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act as it was before being amended in 1940. Repatriation) [10.53 a.m.] I regret that I cannot accept the proposed new clause. We, and I believe the special committee also, have given Regulations, provision is a good deal of thought to the position in regard to de facto wives.

This Parliament made a great mistake when it provided for de facto wives in that legislation. I agree that, if the woman concerned needs assistance, the Parliament should grant it ; but it should be by means of a special provision"" outside the Widows' Pensions Act. It is a pity that the two have been mixed. In the wife is being made worse; as a matter of fact, preference is being given to the de facto wife. That is a great mistake. No mention of a de facto wife should be made in either this legislation or the Widows' Pensions Act. Any assistance which the Parliament might give, should come out of a special fund and be given by way of a special grant. a.m.] -The Minister for Repatriation has not understood what the honourable member for New England( Mr Abbott) desires to do. He has stated that the policy of the commission is to give effect to the wishes of the soldier, and to protect the woman whom he had loved and cherished and desired to protect. The proviso inserted in 1940 enabled t h e commission to disregard that woman. The point made by the honourable member for New England is that the wishes of the soldier may be defeated if there is a rival claimant for the pension in the person of the legal wife. The honourable member desires to ensure that, if there are two claimants, the commission may, in special circumstances, give effect both to the soldier's wishes and to the claim of the legal wife by paying both.

A man who desired to enlist would wish to make provision for the woman with whom he was living. Although she was not his actual wife, he cared for her as if she were. In Canada, in the United States of America and Australia legislation has been passed providing for such cases. It may be desirable to insert a provision making it clear that the commission shall exercise its discretion in this matter in special circumstances only. Of course, the commission need not consider the claim of any but the legal wife if it chooses. I urge the Minister to accept the amendment. I do not wish it to be thought that I am seeking official approval for loose living or immorality, but I am concerned with facts. Under the law as it now stands it is possible for the legal wife to be deprived of a pension. been living with her husband until six months before his death. would be best to revert to the system which operated after the 1914-18 war, under which the commission was given the right to pay a pension to one or both women. The commission is a responsible body, and could be relied upon to give the matter careful consideration. I realize that this is a touchy question, and that various organizations will raise objections as soon as it is suggested that justice should be done to both women in the case, even though both may be equally unfortunate and equally innocent. The previous arrangement worked satisfactorily for more than twenty years; it was not varied until 1940. We should remember that, apart from the women concerned, there are also the children to be considered. I do not think that any honourable member would wish to penalize the children of an irregular union of the kind we have been discussing. under the present proposal, the de facto wife will be placed in a better position than the legal wife. take it that the honourable member supports the amendment. tions. is that the commission may, at its discretion, give a pension to one or both women. I do not altogether agree with the. principle of taking the soldier's wishes into consideration. Unfortunately, there are bad soldi*rs, and it is possible that a man might deliberately do an injustice to a perfectly virtuous woman. Therefore, we should revert to the position which existed before 1940. I know that church organizations and moralists will upbraid us for making this suggestion, but we cannot overlook the facts. No one can seriously suggest that if the committee accepts the amendment it will be encouraging the formation of irregular alliances. People do not enter into such alliances for the sake of getting a pension, but because they are the victims of unfortunate circumstances or have a warped outlook on the relations which should exist between men and women. a.m.] I support the amendment moved by the honourable member for New England( Mr Abbott). There is a growing tendency in this Parliament of males to derogate dangerously from the status of the married woman. I believe that if there were a woman member of this Parliament, a voice would have been raised which would have impressed honourable members and the public outside with the importance of the status of married women. I understand that the honourable member for New England now seeks to cure the ill effects of an amendment which was made to the Re-patriation Act in 1940 under which, in practice, discretion was allowed to the soldier himself to choose between the person with. whom he had entered into the solemn contract implicit in marriage and the person with whom he formed an",138,General Pensions Rates Column 2 Column 3 Column 4

A woman, who is a constituent of mine was shamefully neglected by her soldier husband, who refused to make any allotment to her. l i e went away with another woman prior to enlisting. She could not get any allotment herself, because at that, time the allotment had to be made by her husband in her favour. She had to apply to a court for maintenance, and she had some difficulty in getting her husband served with the necessary notice, because he had enlisted under a false name. order, but he said that he would not make any allotment, to her. That happened during the time when the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender)' was Minister for the Army, and as a result of that case the making of allotments became compulsory. In that instance the soldier was vindictive towards his innocent, legitimate wife. If the procedure proposed in the bill be adopted, that wife, in the event of her husband's death, will receive no allowance whatever. Some discretion should be allowed to the commission in this matter, because difficulty will arise only in exceptional circumstances. The special committee recommended that both women might participate in the pension, but that only one pension should be paid and it might be divided between the two women. The amendment proposed by the honourable member for New England( Mr Abbott) goes farther than that, and would, in some cases, involve the payment of a double pension. That would be necessary only in a limited number of instances, and the sum involved would not be large. I take it that the commission would exercise its discretion wisely. It would weigh the whole of the circumstances, and probably there would be children to both the legitimate wife and the de facto wife. It would be only fair that an allowance should be made to each, because they would have to support the children and look after them, and in many instances would not be able to take up outside work. The Minister( Mr Frost) said that the department should not be under the obligation to go into the merits of the respective claims of the wife and the other woman; but, after all, that has already been done by the Department. of Social Services. In the case of a deserted de facto wife, or widow, the department can pay a pension; but it has to be satisfied as to the facts of the case. A similar procedure could be adopted by the commission, so that justice would be done to both of the women concerned. a.m.] -The amendment proposes to restore the position that existed prior to the passage of the amending act in 1940. She obtained a maintenance No honourable member has yet explained why the principal act was amended iu that year. It would be interesting to know whether it was because of financial considerations, or whether other reasons actuated the government of the day. ably knows what sum was involved. that it was large. Since 1940 the Widows' Pensions Act has been passed, and under that measure Parliament recognizes the right of atleast three women to draw pensions in respect of the one man. It is possible, in the event of that man's death, for a divorcee, a deserted wife and a de facto wife all to draw pensions, because at one time or another they were either married to him or living with him. It is necessary to adopt a uniform principle with regard to the Widows' Pensions Act and the Repatriation Act. Some honourable members have, by interjection, stressed the difficulties that may arise if the,amendment be carried. Brigham Young had, I believe, about 17 wives and 56 children, and it is well that the Repatriation Department has not been called upon to deal with a problem such as he would have presented. It is far better to pay two women than to deny justice to the legal wife. An outrageous principle is incorporated in the act as it now stands', when we say that the man concerned shall have the right to determine who shall receive the pension from the Repatriation Department. I ask honourable members to consider what would be the position in actuality. A man deserts his wife in order to live with another woman.

930,Mr Calwell,"I cannot conceivein one case in a thousand such a man would say, "" My wife is the person who shall draw my pension when I die "", and disavow any claim of the woman who alienated his affections? The act now says, in effect, that the rights of the deserted wives have been extinguished by the mesalliance that her husband formed. If she had obtained a maintenance order against him she may have been able to do something in the courts, but a great many husbands disobey maintenance orders and some have been repeatedly gaoled, on the application of wives, by order of the court for not having complied with maintenance orders. Often, too, the woman for whom a man has left his wife has had children by him, and she pleads with the man's wife not to continue to have him committed to prison because of the suffering cast upon his little children. Standing Committee on Bepatriation. fear the public scandal of prosecuting erring husbands. women have abandoned their legal rights and allowed maintenance orders to lapse, because they have found it to be too expensive to keep on having their husbands committed to gaol. In every case the wife has suffered. The proposed amendment will restore her rights, at least under this act. If we have to choose between the present provisions of the act which denies the right of the widow, and another, which previously existed, in which the widow's rights were safeguarded, I should prefer the latter. I , therefore, propose to vote for the amendment moved by the honourable member for New England( Mr Abbott). I think that the overwhelming feeling in the committee is in favour of the amendment. If the Minister would consent to the postponement of the clause, he would be able to consult with his advisers and be in a better position to complete consideration of the matter later. That would be the wise course and I think that ultimately we could avoid dividing the committee on this issue. I. feel that I must support the amendment. It is an extremely difficult matter, and I understand that it caused much worry to the special parliamentary committee on repatriation. We must admit that it is wrong that a widow and her children can be robbed of their pensions by a. de facto widow and her children. One widow in Adelaide had to go. to work to support her child while the de facto widow and her children were pensioned. Whatever we do, we must not penalize the children. Many honourable members have received letter's from well meaning people on such matters as this. One writer suggested that in order to improve morals it was necessary to cancel pensions when venereal disease was contracted. What a cruel anti-social outlook! How evil it would be to penalize the innocent for the sins of the guilty. If the amendment be lost I shall ask that this matter be referred to the proposed a.m.] I cannot agree with the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) that, if we had women in this Parliament, the provision, which the honourable member for New England proposes to amend, would not have been made.

That order was issued by the British Ministry, which contains women, and has not been disallowed by the House of Commons, which contains more women. a.m.J -The Ministerf o r Repatriation ( Mr Frost) declared that the amendment, if agreed to, would cause trouble in the. Repatriation Department through officers having to decide whether two pensions should be paid or not; but there must be the same trouble to-day, because the officers have to decide whether the pension shall be given to what I might describe as the "" n a t u r a l "" widow or the real widow. All that the amendment asks is that the Repatriation Commission shall have the discretion to decide whether the circumstances justify the payment of a pension to each widow, .de jure or de facto. The quality of mercy would not be strained if the Minister agreed to accept the amendment. England have that discretion. the order cited by the honourable member for Bourke( Mr Blackburn) proves that there is nothing in the argument that women resent pensions being paid to de facto widows. It is of the essence of justice that wives or widows should not be deprived of their rights by de facto wives or widows, w i th whom a man may have lived for only a short space of time. : I ask the Minister to accept the amendment, and I would like the matter to be decided by the committee now. I support the amendment moved by the honourable member for New England. I am sure that the overwhelming opinion of this committee must be in favour of safeguarding the position of a woman whose husband has left her to make a home with another woman. That is all that matters to me, for I must confess that I do not mind very much what happens to women who have taken up with other women's husbands. I suggest that we should provide that the pension shall be paid to the widow, and that the de facto widow be provided for under the Widows' Pensions Act. That ought to settle the problem without further ado. Repatriation) [11.42 a.m.] -I cannot agree to pay the pension to two women.

My motive in moving that a parliamentary standing commitee on repatriation be appointed is to ensure that a permanent body shall be set up, with power to make exhaustive inquiries into any of the many questions which are sure to arise in the administration of this legislation. The great value of having such a committee was proved by the excellent work done by the special committee which reported to the Minister( Mr Frost), and on whose recommendations this bill is based. Those benefits will be retained by the appointment of a permanent standing committee. I shall not speak at length, because the Minister has indicated that the Government is prepared to accept the new part. Proposed new sections 56A to 56L are identical with sections in that part of the Australian Broadcasting Commission Act under which a parliamentary standing committee on broadcasting has been establis'hed. I believe that such a committee will be of great value to the Minister and the Parliament, as well as to soldiers in general, particularly the federal executive of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, which, no doubt, will be the body through which most of the recommendations to the Minister will come. shall not oppose the proposed new part; but I take this opportunity to draw attention to the fact that we are creating so many committees that it is impossible for members of Parliament to give proper attention to the functions of such bodies. Some honourable members are on several committees. arrived when the Government should overhaul the various committees now in existence and their functions. ' In my opinion, the number of committees should be considerably reduced. It would be better to have a few standing committees with definite functions to perform. The functions of the proposed committee are affecting repatriation which either House to it. In my opinion, some of the committees now in existence are making -work for themselves, and are spending time on such work which could be spent otherwise to better advantage. Proposed new section 56c requires every member of the proposed committee to make and subscribe a declaration in accordance with the form set out in the sixth schedule. I am a member of the Standing Committee on Public Works; but, so far as I know, I have not been required to make any such declaration. I ask the Government to give serious consideration to a reduction of the number of committees. Repatriation) [11.56 a.m.] -The Government does not oppose the insertion of the new part. The Prime Minister( Mr Curtin) promised to accept it, because he realized that the special committee had done a good job. Should any matter affecting servicemen arise on which the Minister desired information, he could refer it to the standing committee for investigation. The intention is not that the committee shall investigate individual cases, but rather that it shall deal with matters of principle, or such matters as the extension of the number of hospitals or sanatoriums. It will be observed that, the committee will deal only with matters which are referred to it. I do not think that the committee will need to meet often; but its establishment will mean that an investigation of any particular matter can be made quickly should that course be considered desirable. As to the value of committees, I can speak with some experience, because I was a member of the committee which, after investigation, reduced the loss associated with the acquisition of apples and pears from £1,500,000 in one year to less than £300,000 in the following year.

960,Mr Spooneri Shall Not Judge,"I do not agree that the appointment of this proposed committee is unnecessary. It is thoroughly justified by the debate which has taken place on this bill. I say, frankly, that but for the knowledge that the Government was going to accept this amendment, I should have found myself obliged to reconsider my attitude towards the proposal to increase the rates of pension under the bill by 20 per cent.; I , personally, do not think that that increase is suflicient to meet present conditions although it might have been sufficient to meet the conditions existing when the special committee concluded its deliberations nearly six months ago. The proposed committee will keep abreast of developments in the repatriation sphere, although it need not sit regularly, because it . will deal only with matters referred to it by this House, or the Senate, or the Minister. It will not have power itself to initiate inquiries. It is not very likely that subjects will be remitted to the committee very frequently. However, a doubt still exists in the minds of honourable members generally whether the rates of benefits and pensions agreed upon under this measure are fair. Such a subject could be referred to the committee; and it would reassure honourable members generally to know that the matter was being intensively studied by a committee constituted in this manner. The right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) asked whether the committee would be composed of returned soldiers only. No provision is made in that respect. The proposal is that the committee shall consist of four members of the House of Representatives and two members of the .Senate. The special committee consisted entirely of returned soldiers; but there can be no guarantee that that will be the case in the future. should be given. M.r. SPOONER,-That is so. It may be advisable to appoint an honourable member to the committee because of his special knowledge of the subject. A particular honourable member may be personally acquainted with the operation of repatriation legislation in other countries. I should imagine that a wise government would see to it that a substantial proportion of the members of the committee were ex-servicemen. I accept the proposed new provision because it will give to the House during the months ahead some guarantee that should the bill prove to be inadequate to meet existing conditions our decisions under the measure will be further reviewed and adjusted accordingly. I sincerely hope that the amendment will be adopted, and that as soon as possible after the measure is proclaimed the Government will ask the committee to be set up to examine the new rates of pensions in relation to existing conditions. I congratulate the honourable member for Henty( Mr Coles) on proposing this amendment, and commend the Minister for Repatriation ( Mr Frost) on accepting the principle embodied in it. The principle has already been adopted by Parliament with respect to other legislation. Section 84 of the Australian Broadcasting Act, which deals with the Joint Parliamentary Standing Committee on Broadcasting, readsThe powers, privileges and irnnumities of the committee and its members shall, subject to this part, be those of each of the Houses of the Parliament and of its members and its committees. It is highly desirable that the powers, privileges, and immunities of the Broadcasting Committee be also enjoyed by the proposed repatriation committee. Indeed, it might prove to be dangerous to deny this protection to the proposed committee. I hope that the honourable member for Henty will embody that provision in his amendment. It is desirable that the committee should have all the powers, privileges and immunities now enjoyed by Parliament itself in order that neither the committee nor any of its members may be embarrassed with litigation for doing something for which no member of the Parliament could be proceeded against. I think that that omission from the honourable member's amendment is unintentional. I also suggest that the amendment might be improved in another respect, although the matter I am now about to raise may be controversial. The Australian Broadcasting Commission Act provides that the Minister or either House of Parliament may refer any",146,Committee On Repatriation
961,Mr Pollabd,No such guarantee,147,Committee On Repatriation
962,Mr Calwell (Melbourne) [12.9],"matter to the committee; but it also provides that the Minister shall refer to the committee any such matter which the Australian Broadcasting Commission, or the body known at the commencement of the act as the Australian Federation of Commercial Broadcasting Stations,' requests him to refer to it. Similar provision should he made with respect to the proposed repatriation committee. Minister should be obliged to refer to the committee any matter which the Repatriation Commission, or the body known as the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, requests him to refer to it. Several honourable members opposite appear to fail to understand that the principles on which the proposed committee is based are wise, practical and beneficial. abused. abused. The parliamentary system and the executive system can be abused; but the principle involved in the amendment strengthens the Parliament in relation to the Executive, because the committee is to consist of members of both Houses-in practice this means members of all parties -wh o will he equally as well advised on repatriation matters as is the Minister himself; and the committee must report to the Parliament, and not to the Minister, on any matter so referred to it. Thus, the proposed committee, which will probably be the same as the special committee whose report formed the basis of this measure, will be an integral part of our repatriation machinery. There is nothing wrong with that. The commission can play its part, discharging its special responsibilities under the act; and the committee can deal with such matters as are referred to it, and so play an equally important part in advising honourable members from time to time on all matters of major importance affecting repatriation. appointed by the Parliament either as statutory bodies, or in the form established under the National Security Act, have already justified their existence. Mere hostility to the committee. system, and attacks such as those uttered by the honourable member for Adelaide( Mr Stacey) on previous occasions, which, no doubt, he will utter again when he gets the call from the Chair, do not destroy the validity of any of the contentions which have been advanced in support of the principle of the amendment.. The more we have of the committee system in our parliamentary structure, the better it will be for the Parliament, for the Executive, for all The persons concerned with the legislation involved, and for the people generally. In the Congress of the United .States of America, every bill that is introduced is referred to an appropriate committee of each House and reported upon before debate ensues, in order that its passage may be as speedy as possible. In the British House of Commons, the President of the Board of Trade, for instance, and he is only one of several Ministers be similarly empowered, can, and does, set up committees to examine various proposals, and these committees have done extremely valuable work in making recommendations which subsequently have been embodied in legislation. Some of that British legislation has been copied in this country. Therefore, I cannot see that any real argument can be advanced against this principle, and I strongly urge the proposal now before the committee, and in again congratulating the honourable member for Henty( Mr Coles) I urge him to include the substance of section 84 of the Australian Broadcasting Act in his amendment. I ask him also to consider the advisability of recognizing the right of the Repatriation Commission to refer matters to the proposed standing committee through the Minister, because the time may come when a Minister for Repatriation will be at loggerheads with the Repatriation Commission, and may misuse his power in the same way as some honourable members have suggested that parliamentary committees may misuse their power. I contend that the federal executive of the Returned Sailors, Committees which have been Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia is competent to bring matters of moment under the notice of the proposed standing committee, and that the Minister for Repatriation should be obliged to submit to that committee any matter placed before him by that thoroughly representative organization.",147,Committee On Repatriation

964,Mr Calwell,"Any system can beSir [12.18] I am in favour of appointing parliamentary committees to deal with matters of national importance, particularly public works, but repatriation is an entirely different matter. If we are to have a parliamentary standing committee -on repatriation, why should we not also have parliamentary standing committees on army matters and such subjects as invalid and old-age pensions? I submit that every honourable member of this chamber has a responsibility to see that justice is done to the returned soldiers and their dependants. I do not wish to criticize the parliamentary committee whose report formed the basis of this legislation, because I consider that that body did an excellent job. It presented a good report, which, as I have said, has been largely incorporated in this measure; but that should finish the work of the committee. In view of the thorough overhaul now being given to repatriation legislation, I trust that there w ill be no occasion, in the near future at least, to make further alterations to it . If , however, further adjustments become necessary, say, through an increase of the cost of living, surely such matters could be determined equitably by the Minister for Repatriation in conference with the Repatriation Commission. My fear is that the setting ut) of a standing committee on repatriation w ill result in undue interference with the work of the Minister and of the Repatriation Commission which is a quasi-government body. In addition, the proposed body would be called upon to undertake an immense amount of work because of the many questions that would be raised. overcome quite easily.

I am pleased also that it is to the honourable member for Henty that credit for placing this proposal on our statute-book w ill go. I was disappointed that the parliamentary committee did not accede to my request, which I made so f a r back as August last, that members of Parliament be given an opportunity to place their views before it . However, in a letter to the committee I made the following suggestion:The precedent set in the Broadcasting Act by the setting up of a Parliamentary Standing Committee might well be followed in regard to Bepatriation so that same, and the administration thereof, would bo constantly under the purview of Parliament and many of the injustices complained of would be automatically dissipated. This would constitute a more democratic form of control and in keeping with the principles the war is being waged for. There would also be much constructive work for the Committee and it would be in a position to act promptly to meet each situation that may result from war conditions and we would not have such occurrences as happened in the case of disabled Militiamen for whom no provision for pension had been made after two and a. half years of war. This happened to a constituent of mine, an original ANZAC who was in the landing at Gallipoli, served four years in the last war and sixteen months in this one as a member of the Home Forces, yet on being discharged in January of this year, following an in j u r y sustained while in the service, he found himself without pension, sustenance, employment, and he ended up on the dole. His application for a pension was refused on the ground that there was It could be no provision in the Repatriation Act covering his case. The result was that, because of his disability, he was unable to obtain employment, and he ended up on the dole. That occurred two and a half years after the outbreak of the present war. Had the administration been f u l l y alive to the situation, it would have made provision for such cases, and that unfortunate soldier would not have been obliged to go on the dole despite the fact that his disabilities resulted from war service. I realize that",148,Committee On Repatriation
965,Mr Baejstakd,Surely that could be,149,Charles Marr Parkes Honourable Member For Henty Mr
966,Mr Morgan (Reid) [12,"21] I amnew problems arising out of this war keep the administration very busy, and there can be no doubt that a standing committee on repatriation would be of great assistance to the commission in dealing promptly with various anomalies that arise from time to time. Members of Parliament are constantly receiving representations from their constituents on repatriation matters, refer that matter to the standing comand they would be pleased to have an opportunity to put their problems before such a committee. In addition, there are many other matters which the proposed body could investigate, such as land settlement for returned soldiers, after care, vocational guidance, housing and so on. The payment of a gratuity to soldiers returning from this war is also an important matter. There is no reason why that question should not be discussed and determined now, so that soldiers will know what to expect when the war is over, and the payment of a gratuity will not be made a political football, as was the case after the last war. I have no doubt that if a parliamentary standing committee on repatriation were in existence at present, much of the acrimonious debate that has taken place on this measure would have been avoided. Honourable members could have placed their views before that committee, and many problems could have been solved without being ventilated in this chamber. Even the increase of pension advocated by certain honourable members opposite could have been discussed; in fact, I see no reason why the honourable member for ""Warringah ( Mr Spender) should not place before the standing committee his views in regard to an increase of pension rates. I trust also that the proposed body will investigate the possibility of consolidating the Repatriation Act in order to present it in a mnach simpler form than it is at present. The problem of small pensions about which many complaints have been made in this chamber could also be tackled. I agree with the suggestion of the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr [12.32] I shall support this amendCalwell) that the returned soldiers' organizations and the Repatriation Commission should have recourse to the proposed standing committee in the same Mr Morgan. way as the Australian Broadcasting Commission has recourse to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Broadcasting through the Postmaster-General. When the Broadcasting Commission or the Federation of Commercial Broadcasting Stations makes representations to the Postmaster-General on a particular matter, there is an obligation upon him to mittee. Similarly, the reference of repatriation matters to the proposed standing committee should not be left to the discretion of the Minister for Repatriation. After all, tlie ex-servicemen are the people most vitally concerned in repatriation matters, and they should have direct recourse to the proposed standing committee, through the Minister. If it be necessary first to satisfy the Minister or Parliament that a matter is one that should be discussed by the committee, there will be unnecessary waste of time and useless repetition of discussion. In fact, there would be no need for the committee at all. Therefore, I agree with the suggestion of the honourable member for Melbourne The precedent already has been established in the Australian Broadcasting Commission Act, and I hope that it will be followed in this case. Matters affecting returned soldiers and their dependants should be thrashed out thoroughly in a non-party atmosphere. In his second-reading speech upon this measure, the Minister himself said that it should be above party politics, and the same sentiment has since been expressed by the Prime Minister( Mr Curtin). My only regret is that we on this side of the chamber have been bound to a large degree by party decisions, and have not had the same freedom to speak upon these matters as has been enjoyed by honourable members opposite. In many respects, we have been hamstrung in this debate, and have had to sit idly by while motions embodying principles with which we were entirely in accord were submitted by honourable members opposite. ment, because I consider that it is a good one. In his second-reading speech the honourable member for Moreton( Mr Francis) suggested the setting up of a",149,Charles Marr Parkes Honourable Member For Henty Mr
967,Mr Hughes (North Sydney),"standing committee on repatriation, the functions of which he outlined briefly. I agree with the honourable member for Robertson ( Mr Spooner) that the recommendations of the parliamentary committee were a material factor in assisting decisions to be made in regard to many repatriation matters. From the inception of the repatriation legislation it has been my practice to consult with the soldiers, and I have been guided by them on many occasions. I can say, with justification, that I have been guided by them and by none other. The original rate of pension was fixed on the recommendation of the soldiers, and increases have been made from time to time, so far as I am aware, on the advice of soldiers' organizations. Practically every amendment of the act has originated in the soldiers' organizations, through which the returned man has made himself articulate. The parliamentary committee which was appointed to deal with this matter accomplished its work so ably that honourable members, almost with one accord, are desirous of making the committee a permanent part of the mechanism of this Parliament. ' standing committee deal with? ber suggested that the committee should make its report to the Parliament. I agree with that view. I support the proposal to appoint a. permanent committee, because it will be charged with the -special duty of acting as a liaison between the returned soldiers' organizations and the Parliament. It will attend to duties that it is well qualified to perform, and it should submit at least an annual report. mendations, of which I was justly proud. But the committee should not be galvanized into activity only when matters are referred to by the Parliament. It will protect the welfare of returned men, and bring urgent matters before the Parliament. I strongly support the proposal, for, if the Parliamentary Standing Committee had not been proposed, I , like the honourable member for Robertson ( Mr Spooner) should not have been able to support the government in limiting the increase of the rate of pension to 20 per cent. sincerely congratulate the parliamentary committee which compiled the recommendations for the amendment of the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act. Having studied its proposals most carefully, I consider that the committee did an excellent job. All members were returned soldiers who were well qualified to recommend to the Government proposals for improving the present repatriation system. This bill is based upon the recommendations of the committee. The committee, which was appointed to do a specific job in a limited time, admirably discharged its responsibilities. However, I object to the number of committees that has been appointed, first, by the Menzies Government, and, later, by the Curtin Government. The committees, which were appointed two years ago, were given important work to do, but I believed that their inquiries would be completed within a month. I was mistaken. Their number has been increased, and some honourable members are attempting to serve on three of them. One honourable member, who is associated with several committees, told me that he did not know which meeting to attend. The committees have travelled widely in the Commonwealth, with large and expensive staffs, and many of their reports have not been, and never will be, studied. I resigned from one of the committees a fortnight ago, although I believed, when I became a member of it nearly two years before, that I could render useful service. The committee was given two important jobs. First, it investigated the proposals for the construction of the Canberra Community Hospital and submitted to Parliament certain recomSome honourable members, defending the appointment of the committees, declared that their investigations have saved the Government large sums of money. I shall recount my experiences. The proposal to erect the Canberra Community Hospital was examined by the Public Works Committee.

970,Mr Stacey (Adelaide) [12.35],"Ishow why the repatriation committee will not be a success. The estimated cost of the construction of the new hospital was £134,000. Although the buildings have not yet been completed, the expenditure on the building to date is £1/8,000. The Public Works Committee also investigated the proposal for the construction of the new abattoirs in the Australian Capital Territory. The estimated cost of the work was £32,000, but the expenditure will exceed that figure by nearly £30,000. Those examples illustrate tbe futility of inquiries by committees. Often their recommendations are disregarded without examination. The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Broadcasting has done some good work, but its action in recommending continued publication of the A.B.G. Weekly has aroused keen criticism. The TEMPORARY Order! The bill contains no reference to the A.B.O. Weekly. infinitely better work could be done withbelieve that in the future the work of this out the appointment of the Standing Committee on Repatriation. Once the committee is appointed it will become permanent and will find for itself plenty of work to do. Its inquiries will necessitate long trips to distant parts of Australia. The proposed committee will get into the same rut as that into which previous committees have fallen. Its expenses will be considerable and I consider that better work could be done through rhe Minister and the department. The number of Cabinet Ministers has been increased, and departments have expanded enormously. The whole position is farcical. I shall not support the proshould convince honourable members of the posed appointment of the Standing Committee on Repatriation. Another reason why I object to the committee is that the Standing Committee on Broadcasting recommended the continuance of the A.B.C. Weekly, although its losses total £600 a week, and only 3 per cent, of the licenceway at all, certain members of the comholders subscribe to the journal. From those remarks honourable members will understand that I am definitely opposed to the appointment of parliamentary committees. Sitting suspended from 12.^5 to 2.15 p.m. glad to know that the Minister( Mr Erost) has agreed to accept the new clause proposed by -the honourable member for Henty( Mr Coles). The committee system of doing our business may be open to criticism, but I think that that is very largely a matter of one's point of view. Having had some experience of committees working for this Parliament, I am quite satisfied that the all-party committee system does very useful work, provided that the committees' recommendations are acted upon by the government of the day. I believe that the proposed repatriation committee will serve a very useful purpose. It will give an opportunity to the Minister to have questions inquired into, it will be an avenue through which the commission itself can have matters referred to it. provided that the Minister is prepared for members of the Parliament to have subjects referred to it for investigation. Repatriation over the years has been a subject of very great controversy, and I Parliament will be considerably lightened and much more expeditiously performed if we are able to have such subjects referred to a committee, a report made to the Parliament, which can subsequently be discussed, and the recommendations considered not only by Parliament but also by the Government of the day. I heartily agree with the new part, and support it. I shall oppose the new part proposed by the honourable member for Henty( Mr Coles), because I think that if anything foolishness of having such a committee as a standing committee, it should be the results of the debate in this chamber. It appears to me that on every occasion on which an honourable member challenged the committee's report in anj mittee took it as a personal affront. They appeared to think that, because they had been appointed to investigate repatriation problems on behalf of the Government, every honourable member should have surrendered his rights as a representative",151,Charles Marr Parkes Honourable Member For Henty Mr

Strangely enough, we find that some members of the committee have come briefed with a sheaf of amendments altogether contrary to the committee's recommendations, proving conclusively that the committee itself did not investigate the whole position thoroughly. Yet, repeatedly, when we make suggestions from this side of the chamber we are told to be good boys and sit down, because the whole subject has been investigated, everything is in hand, and all is right with the world. I disagree entirely with that point of view, and I can see only a repetition of this sort of thing if the special committee which has been sitting is converted into a standing committee. We have a parallel to the proposed committee, in many committees in existence. The Broadcasting Committee is a severe headache to the commission, and, I should say, to the Minister also. We have appointed a commission to administer the provisions of the Repatriation Act. It has done a really good job, and its work will be extended, following the the proclamation of a new Repatriation Act. Side by side with the commission is the Minister. If Ave appoint a committee to cast its shadow over both the commission and the Minister, the commission will be unable to do its work satisfactorily, whilst the Minister will not be able to give the necessary attention to the task he has in hand. Therefore, both he and the commission will become mere ciphers, subject to examination by the committee itself. With all due respect to the members of the proposed committee, I do not think that -it will provide a complete representation of the views of members in this Parliament. If we are simply to delegate our duties to a committee appointed from both sides of the House, we may just as well pack up our bags, and leave the whole task in the hands of the committee. Another objection, I think, suggests itself. We know that on one side of the House sits a party which is rigorously disciplined. It has to obey the rules of caucus whether it believes in them or not. We have had instances of this when members the chamber have been members of a committee and signatories to its report. Indeed, one member pointed out in the debate that they were handicapped by not being given the liberty which honourable members on this side enjoy. Whilst we have three members from one side of the chamber rigorously disciplined, who, once they have signed on the dotted line expressing the wishes of their party, are not permitted to depart from the committee's recommendations, and even ready to interpret Government policy, we are likely to have a lop-sided committee. Honourable members on this side, who are not disciplined by caucus methods like honourable members opposite, but are more or less free-lances, axe placed at a disadvantage. Such a committee cannot reflect impartially the decisions of its members, or the views of all parties in the chamber. For these reasons, I oppose the appointment of a committee. [2.23] -The reference made by the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Harrison) to the Broadcasting Committee is very much to the point. When that matter came before us in June of last year, I expressed the opinion that there was no need for such a committee, hut the recommendation for the appointment of a permanent committee had been made by the Joint Committee on Broadcasting. No recommendation has been made in this case by the special committee that it should continue to act, or that some other body of a similar kind should carry on in the future. modesty of its members. be so, but we have no assurance that the committee which is to he appointed will be identical with the one which made the report which has been before honourable members during the debate on this bill. All of us agree that the committee has done good work in the preparation of its report. Having said that, I am free to discuss the whole matter without being suspected of antagonism to any individual. The question is, whether there is to be a permanent committee to deal on the other side of with repatriation which may or may not be composed of returned soldiers, who.",152,Chairman To Do So Or It Will Provide An Opportunity

977,Mr Duncan,"HUGHES -That maymay or may not be identical with those who sat on the special committee. W it h that premise, we may discuss the proposal broadly on its merits. I consider that, if any committee ought to be reconstituted just now it is not the special committee, but the public accounts committee, which is much more needed in this country at the present time. The amendment of the honourable member for Henty( Mr Coles) is a lengthy one, and contains a good deal that is of interest. Eor example, the members appointed, shall hold office as a joint committee for the duration of the Parliament, b u t ' shall cease to hold office as soon as the House of Representatives expires by dissolution or effluxion of time, or upon their ceasing to be members of Parliament. Thusi t is not to be a continuous committee, but w ill be subject to disruption at any time by contingencies over which it w ill have no control. The proposed new section 5 6 J providesThe committee may, subject to this section, sit and transact business during any adjournmemt or recess as well as during the session, and may sit at such times and in such places, and conduct their proceedings in such manner, as they deem proper. The most important of the proposed new sections is 5 6 L , which proposesThe committee shall, subject to the provisions of this act, consider and report to the Parliament, upon every matter affecting repatriation which either House of the Parliament, by resolution, refers to tlie committee and upon every other such matter affecting repatriation referred to the committee by the Minister. Those are very wide powers There are indications that the committee will be expected to do a considerable volume of work. that, in my opinion, such a body would not be the appropriate one to act as a consultant to the Minister. able gentleman is himself vested certain powers, and may take such advice as he thinks fit.

If he requires advice, it can be furnished to him by the Repatriation Commission, body in this matter. it, he will not have the overlapping is inseparable from a series of committees dealing with work of the same which is always undesirable. Mr Duncan Bugh.es. the other hand, the decision is that there must be a reference to some other body, I consider that a preferable body would be the returned soldiers' league which already has branches in the various States, and a great deal of material which would assist its work from the beginning. Not only could it do this work in a specialized sense f a r better than it could be done by a parliamentary committee, but, in addition, it would not be torn from its duties in the way in which a of the committee, when committee appointed from this Parliament would be. I have always understood that "" one man one job "" was one of the objects of the Labour party. That is a theory to which I do not subscribe; but having members of Parliament performing all sorts of other duties, and being liable-as they undoubtedly w ill be in this instance-to be drawn to all the States, one cannot expect them to be able properly to carry out the prime duties that they have been elected to perform. For the reasons that I have given, I consider that it is not desirable that this committee should be appointed, and I shall vote against its appointment. have already said that, to a very large section of the community, this is a vital piece of legislation, concerning which there has always been a considerable degree of controversy, contention and difficulty. On that account, there are good reasons for the appointment of a standing committee. But there are equally good reasons in opposition to such indeed. a proposal. Sof a r as I can see, the proposal of the honourable member for Henty( Mr Coles), w it h the addition I state quite clearly which the Minister( Mr Frost) proposes to accept, w ill place that honourable gentleman in the position of being a mere The honorcipher in the control of repatriation with matters. The original proposal of the honourable member for Henty contained will quite enough power to enable the committee to be called together. That could be done by a resolution of either House which is the prime of the Parliament.

The original proposal further provided that the Minister himself, if he considered that difficulties were likely to arise and that he ought to be informed fro m an outside source apart from those contesting the matter, could request the committee to furnish a report to him. The returned soldiers' league might be at loggerheads with the Repatriation Commission. The Minister might not be sure as to which body was right and which wrong. Desiring to be advised, he could enlist the aid of the committee. But, under the present proposal, which, I understand, the Minister intends to accept, he will be in grave danger of becoming a mere cipher. It providesThe Minister shall refer to the committee any such matters concerning repatriation which the commission or the federal executive of the Returned Soldiers Association requests him to refer to the committee. I cannot visualize any possibility of the Minister rejecting such a request, pass through the Minister. have no alternative; he will have to refer the matter to the committee. The addition to the original proposal has been made by the honourable member for Henty at the instance of the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell). The proposed amendment is as follows:The Minister shall refer to the committee any such matters concerning repatriation whicli the commission or the federal executive of the Returned Soldiers' Association requests him to refer to the committee. This provision departs entirely from the proposed new part which the Government was prepared to accept from the honourable member for Henty( Mr Coles) in which it was provided that requests might be referred to the committee by the Minister or the Parliament. It is now proposed to give an outside authority power to order the Minister about. meaning. English words have lost their meaning. While I can see nothing wrong with the proposed new part of the honourable member for Henty, I warn the Minister that if he accepts the amendment of the honourable member for Mel[74] bourne ( Mr Calwell), he w ill become a mere cipher who may be ordered about by an outside authority. approach the consideration of this proposal with mixed feelings. I have sat on parliamentary committees which have done useful work, and have reported either to the Prime Minister or to Parliament. In no previous instance have the members of a parliamentary committee taken any important part in sponsoring, in this Parliament, legislation embodying recommendations of the committees, of which they were members. This right has been reserved for the members of the special committee on repatriation. I have supported its recommendations because I believed them to be sound, but, during the last two days we have witnessed the deplorable spectacle of members of the special committee, while reserving for themselves the right to move amendments to clauses embodying their recommendations, at the same time attacking all and sundry who dared to move other amendments. Surely it is the right of every honourable member to move amendments if he feels that he can improve the bill before the committee. Our experience in connection with the Broadcasting Committee was very different. A non-party measure was introduced into Parliament based upon the recommendations of the committee, and it was considered by honourable members in a non-party spirit. In the case of this bill, however, while government supporters have stuck solidly to the measure, opposition members have fought among themselves over many of its provisions. If that is to be the result of the parliamentary' committee system, then the sooner it is abandoned the better. I have a strong suspicion that this committee system w ill develop; and if it does, then so far as repatriation is concerned, I see no reason for having a Minister for Repatriation or a RepatThat is not its riation Commission.

I am prepared at all times to listen to representations from their properly constituted organizations. league can submit proposals to the Minister, but I do not believe that it, or any other outside body, should have power to direct the Minister what he shall do. Therefore, I propose, with great reluctance, to vote against the proposed new part. I submitted my suggestion for the improvement to the proposed new part in perfectly good faith, and I did so because there is a precedent for it in the Australian Broadcasting Act which was passed last year. The very words of the amendment to which exception is taken were copied verbatim, with the exception of an alteration of terminology by substituting the word ""repatriation"" for the word "" broadcasting"" from subsection 2 of section 85 of the Australian Broadcasting Act. The objections of the vear) were not raised by any other honourable member in this chamber, or in the -Senate, when the Australian. Broadcasting Bill was under discussion. The sub-section referred to statesThe Minister shall icier to the Committee of shaping repatriation policy in the any such matter which the Commission or the body known, at the commencement of this Act, as the Australian Federation of Commercial Broadcasting Stations requests him to refer to the Committee. The Australian Federation of Commercial Broadcasting Stations is as much an outside body as is the returned soldiers' organization. the interests of 100 commercial broadcasting stations, and it is by no means so important in the social, national and general life of the community as the returned soldiers' organization. The argument being advanced now about ministerial responsibility could have been put forward about nine months ago when we were considering the broadcasting measure, but it is really only an afterthought. The bogy of danger to ministerial responsibility has been destroyed, and should not influence one vote in this chamber. The joint parliamentary committee set up under the Australian Broadcasting Act has dealt with many matters referred to it by the Postmaster-General. I The have not heard from that Minister or any other member of the Government, or from any member of either House of this Parliament, that section 85 of the act has undermined ministerial authority in any respect. We talk about ministerial responsibility, but may I offer the suggestion that, .because of the absence of a standing committee of the kind contemplated, and because of the over-emphasis that has been laid upon ministerial responsibility for the last twenty years, we have had to wait that time for an amending repatriation bill. Had the committee system operated earlier, and had there been less desire on the part of a few Ministers to subordinate the whole of the interests of the Parliament to their particular interests as Ministers, there would have been better legislation by this Parliament and more progress in this country than there has been. The talk of ministerial responsibility leaves me cold. By seeking to strengthen the proposed new part submitted by the honourable member for Henty( Mr Coles), I thought that I was helping to give to the Parliament as a whole some share in the responsibility years to come. After all, it is not the Ministry which controls the destinies of this country. Parliament, over the centuries, has always been jealous to see that neither the King nor the Executive invades its rights and privileges. The whole history of parliamentary government is one long story of the k parliament insisting that its authority is paramount. Therefore, I hope that the Minister will agree to my amendment of the amendment of the honourable member for Henty.

It is vital to a proper handling of the problem that administration through a commission acting under the Minister should he in the first place non-political, and in the second place that it should not be duplicated by the settingup of two authorities which may appear . to exercise equal authority. Let me give an example. I see the Minister for the Army( Mr Eorde) on the treasury bench. The administration of the Army involves the making of important decisions on matters of policy. organization and use of troops. But it also, as we all know, involves a host of little questions affecting individuals which are sent to the Minister, and which have to be dealt with"" in an administrative way.

I amnot going to bother my head about them. Let the committee administer and deal with these matters "". The Minister would be in an intolerable position if he had to give a decision subject to appeal, not to the Parliament, not to the Prime Minister, not to his colleagues, but to a committee of Parliament. I venture to say that no self-respecting Minister for the Army would want to undertake the task of administration in those circumstances. orable member for Melbourne, whose passion for the parliamentary committee system will begin to diminish only when he is admitted to the Ministry, says, "" The perfect idea is to have parliamentary committees "". The first object of administration is to get work done, to get it done justly, and to uphold the authority of those who have to do it. The proposal before the chamber now will inevitably undermine the authority of the Repatriation Commission. What will happen to the chairman of that commission and his colleagues if, all the time, when a matter comes before them in the ordinary course of administration, they are given -to understand by some honourable member or members of Parliament that, unless the matter is dealt with in a certain way, they propose that it shall be dealt with by the parliamentary standing committee? It involves the I repeat that this committee will not be like the Broadcasting 'Committee, of which my friends, the honourable member for Boothby (Dr. Price) is a member and the honourable member for Melbourne is chairman. The Broadcasting Committee Ls not concerned with administrative matters. It is not deciding as between Jones and the Crown or Brown and the Crown. It is concerned with what should be the broad policy of broadcasting in Australia. On that sort of matter a parliamentary committee can redo first-class work, but I repeat that a proper understanding of the administration of this country requires that no parliamentary committee shall be an administrative body. Administration is for the Government of the country and for the heads of the departments and commissions which operate under the Government. The best service will be rendered to Australia when that principle is recognized and when, if any one has the desire to discuss administration, he can discuss it plainly across the chamber with the Minister concerned. But duplication and division of authority will not bring reputation to the parliamentary system. I sho.uld like the Minister to say, not that he will accept the proposal as a whole, but that he will provide for a committee that will deal with matters referred to it T by either House of Parliament by resolution. If that were done, large issues would be> referred to the committee, but we should not have the same real danger from the corporate wisdom of members of the committee in those circumstances as we should otherwise have.

I want to make certain that the umbrella which we have been told is being provided for the protection of soldiers does not contain too many holes. My amendment would give a definite direction to the committee to deal with the adequacy of the pension. I see no virtue in adopting the proposed new part. The idea of appointing a committee to examine proposals to be placed before the Parliament is not new. As the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) said, the Congress of the United States of America has had a committee system in operation for many years. Every proposal for legislation is examined by the appropriate committee. The committee system operates also in the British House of Commons. Happenings in this Parliament, however, during this week should convince honourable members that the committee system would be of little value in this Parliament. Ever since the honourable member for Moreton( Mr repatriation matters than any committee Francis) spoke on Tuesday last there has been an almost continuous debate'on this subject. We have had an excellent committee in operation. Almost every member who has risen to speak has praised the committee for doing what he described as "" a fine job of work"". Nevertheless, as the debate proceeded, speaker after speaker indicated that the judgment of the special committee was wrong. Such matters as the rates of pensions, eligibility for a pension, the person to whom the pension should be paid-matter s into which the special committee had inquired-were discussed, notwithstanding that the special committee was much better informed on those subjects than were the members in this chamber. It can be said, too, that the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia is, in general, better informed, and more sympathetic regarding the needs of the returned soldier than are most members of Parliament. The league devotes its energies to the interests of service men. Some of its most prominent officers do little else. They work without hope of reward. I am convinced that they are more concerned for the welfare of this country in general than are many members of this Parliament who have spoken on this subject. The special committee was guided largely by the opinions of those men, and I had hoped that the Parliament also would have been guided by them. The debate in this chamber this week does not reflect credit on the Parliament, nor does it commend the committee system. Im mediately «a bill is introduced in the Congress of the United States of America it is referred to the appropriate committee. That committee examines the proposition; but, I repeat, the presentation of its reports is not followed by a week's debate in Congress on the subject upon which the committee has reported: If we intended to follow a similar course in this Parliament I should support the proposal. However, my faith in our committee system has waned considerably during recent years, and, particularly, during the last few weeks. I now consider it to be of little, or no value. The Repatriation Commission is a competent body. It is better informed upon appointed by this Parliament could inform itself over a period of months, or years. The commission advises the Minister; and the Minister is responsible to this Parliament for the administration of the Repatriation Act. It is now proposed to appoint a standing committee to inquire into every matter which the Minister may be requested by returned soldier organizations to refer to it. The commission and the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia are mentioned as the most suitable bodies to submit requests for such inquiries. Any branch of the latter organization which is dissatisfied with decisions of the commission could ask the Minister to refer such matters to the proposed committee. We can easilj imagine what will happen. Obviously, the proposed committee will not he free from party politics. The Minister will be able to refer to it any matter as he himself decides. In those circumstances, ministerial responsibility will go by the board. Does any honourable member",159,Chairman To Do So Or It Will Provide An Opportunity

1003,Mr Coles (Henty) [3.20],"Nothingproblems which deeply concern the people whom our repatriation legislation is designed to benefit. Certainly, the committee will relieve the Minister of many of his burdens. The description of the proposal as a buck-passing proposal is unjustified. Surely, we can put aside party politics and consider repatriation problems without bias. Such an attitude towards our repatriation legislation will enable all parties to pull together. Indeed, it may bring nearer the formation of a national government. no objection to the principle involved, in the setting up of this committee, but I have certain objections to the details of its proposed functions. The Repatriation Commission has done a good job in the past, is still doing a good job, and I have no doubt will continue to do so in the future, provided that its administration is not interfered with. Under the constitution of the proposed standing committee, for reasons very well explained by the right honourable member for Kooyong( Mr Menzies), there is every probability that the work of the commission will be interfered with. If that could be avoided, I should be prepared to support the proposal, and I suggest to the honourable member for Henty( Mr Coles) and to the Government that adequate safeguards would be established if the word ""policy"" were added after the word "" repatriation"" wherever occurring in proposed new section 56L. The effect would be that the committee could report upon any matter affecting repatriation policy. That would remove any possibility of the committee interfering with the administration of the Repatriation Commission. I trust that the honourable member for Henty and the Government will accept my suggestion. is much to be said in favour of the establishment of a standing committee on repatriation. One good reason is which usually is associated with committee meetings, in contrast to the envy, hatred and malice which too often is evident in parliamentary debates. To those who would attack the committee system, I point out that the envy, hatred and malice displayed in the course of this debate has not come from members of the special committee which investigated repatriation matters, but from other interests in this chamber. This debate has shown that the setting up of the proposed committee is necessary in the light of the widely-held viewin this chamber that amendments of the Repatriation Act will be necessary in the near future. The falling value of the f l indicates that the proposed committee will be called upon to investigate certain matters almost at once. Strong support for the committee system has been expressed by Professor Bland, of Sydney University, who drew the attention of the Broadcasting Committee to the tremendous success of that system in the Congress of the United States of America, where important bodies such as the Foreign Relations Committee are now functioning, and in the British Parliament, where committees such as the Standing Committee on Estimates and Accounts is doing excellent work. Professor Bland's idea was that committees should not interfere in any way with a body such as the Repatriation Commission or the Australian Broadcasting Commission, hut that they maintain an adequate liaison to keep Parliament in touch with developments and to advise Parliament on the various matters. With that end in view, it was laid down that the Broadcasting Committee should discuss only matters referred to it by either House of Parliament or by the Minister. The procedure that has been adopted is that should the committee find anything which it considers should be investigated, it asks the Minister to refer that matter to it. That practice has worked splendidly with the present Postmaster-General (Senator Ashley), but there is always a danger -There that a hostile Minister may seriously obstruct the work of the committee. I shall mention three practical points which have arisen from my exthe unity, peace. and accord perience of committee work: First, it is absolutely vital that parliamentary committees should confine their investigations to questions of principle and not deal with questions of administration. Once a committee starts to play around with the administration of bodies such",161,Chairman To Do So Or It Will Provide An Opportunity
1004,Mr Ryan .(Flinders) [3.26],I have,162,Chairman To Do So Or It Will Provide An Opportunity
1005,Dr. Price (Boothby) [3.28],"as the Australian Broadcasting Commission or the Bepatriation Commission or attempt to take into their own hands consideration of individual grievances which are not matters of general prin ciple, the whole parliamentary committee system w ill become so cumbersome that undoubtedly it w ill collapse. Secondly, I am glad that under this proposal the suggested personnel of the committee is small; it consists of only six members. This is a small Parliament of only 110 members, and we have not the personnel, nor do I . think that the country can spare the funds, to set up big comnrittees. I am sure that my colleagues w i ll agree that the Special Committee on Broadcasting which consisted of six members, and 1 which was under the chairmanship of Senator Gibson, was more workable than the new Broadcasting Committee with its personnel of nine. In that connection, one calls to mind the story of .a commission which founded one of the, Australian colonies. sisted of ten commissioners, and which, allegedly, spent most of its time at meetings explaining to members what had 'happened at the previous meeting. Perhaps that is an exaggeration, but it indicates the danger of unwieldy comrnrittees. Personally, I should like to have seen the proposed committee even .smaller than is now suggested. third point I should like to make is -one to which consideration might be .given when Parliament meets again: It would be a great improvement if it were provided that a chairman of a parliamentary committee could not also be a member of another committee.' Such a rule would mean that a chairman of a -committee would be able to give his -entire time to the work of that committee, to his parliamentary duties, and to his electorate. It is not f a i r to burden any man with an undue volume of -committee work. In the past there have been instances of honourable members .sitting on three or four parliamentary -committees, and I contend that at least the chairman of a committee should have :no other committee work. 1 pay a tribute to the members of Parliament, who, in war-time, have carried out onerous duties on various -committees. criticism of certain committees in this chamber, but, based on my experience on the Broadcasting Committee and on continual contact with members of other committees, my view is that these bodies have done a wonderful job for the country. A t this juncture, I desire to counter the untruthfu l libel published in a newspaper recently. It stated that members of parliamentary committees did most of the work in their own States, and were paid allowances for doing it . As every one knows, members of committees, who work in their own States and home cities, do not receive an allowance. Members have devoted months to committee duties, and have never accepted one penny as travelling allowance, because they were residing in their own State. If certain sections of the press must throw slime at members of parliament, they should see that the slime is real, and not a tissue of This conlies. I have pleasure in supporting the appointment of this committee. The committee system has functioned most successfully in GreatB rita in and the United States of America, and I think it w ill be successful in the Commonwealth, particularly if the improvements which I suggested are adopted. I support the original proposal of the -honourable member for Plenty( Mr. Coles), but I object to the amendment that he proposes to accept, and I shall not vote for it . The amendment to which I take exception provides thatThe Minister may refer to tlie Committee any such mutter concerning repatriation which the Commission or the Federal Executive of tlie Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia requests him to refer to the Committee. The Returned Sailors, Soldiers and A i r men's Imperial League of Australia is not controlled by the Executive Or by Parliament. The naming of this organization in legislation of this nature is unique. The Repatriation Act provides that any organization representing returned soldiers throughout the Commonwealth may submit to the Minister certain names of desirable appointees to boards and the commission. I have no objection to the insertion of similar 'There bas been much words, but I take exception to making",162,Chairman To Do So Or It Will Provide An Opportunity
1006,The Mr Blackburn (Bourke) [3.37],"the league the only body which can approach the Minister with a request to refer matters to the committee. The effect of the amendment is that the league will be the sole medium between the Minister and returned soldiers. This body has its own constitution. Recently it has favoured the policy of excluding from its membership members of the Citizen Military Forces, or soldiers who had not been sent abroad. Of course, the league has a perfect right to exclude from its membership whomsoever it pleases. ing a proposal to include members of the Citizen Military Forces. arrogates to itself the right to exclude any returned soldier from its membership .should be the sole medium of communication between returned soldiers and the Minister. I should not mind if the body were an organization including all returned soldiers without discrimination. But it is a great mistake to give to this organization, which is not controlled by the Executive or by x Parliament, the monopoly of being the sole medium of communication -between returned soldiers and the Government, That principle is wrong. In addition to that, the league adopts policies upon national matters that are not the policies of all Australians, or of all returned soldiers. Some returned soldiers have refrained from joining the league because of its policies. I have no quarrel with the organization, but any national organinew clause as follows:zation which has the power to exclude soldiers from its membership and does adopt policies not acceptable by all soldiers should not have the right to be the sole medium of communication between returned soldiers and the Government. Repatriation) [3.42] I cannot understand the objections raised by the honourable member for Bourke( Mr Blackburn) to the amendment, which provides that the federal executive of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia may place repatriation matters before the Minister. returned soldiers' organizations have a similar power? they should not have a similar power. ticular organization? for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) saw merit in the proposal, but I see no reason why any organization should be specifically named. The amendment is superfluous. There is nothing to prevent other organizations from making representations to the Minister, who may refer the matters to the proposed committee. I cannot accept the amendment submitted by the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender).

In that way, he will have real value because the purchasing value of his pension will remain constant, notwithstanding the upward or downward movement of the cost of living. This is somewhat different from the provision in relation to invalid and old-age pensions, in which case there is a flooring below which pensions cannot fall without the consent of this Parliament. I consider that the method which I now propose is the fairer. I cannot imagine that exception would be taken by any one to a variation of the amount received, corresponding with the rise or fall of the cost of living, so that the returned soldier and his dependants may continuously occupy the same position, irrespective of money",165,Chairman To Do So Or It Will Provide An Opportunity

But ex-service men and their dependants are entitled to claim that we shall ensure that they will not be placed in an impossible position owing to variations of money values. In my opinion, no other section of the community has an equal claim. The amendment merely lays down the main principle, leaving the detailed arrangements to be covered by regulations. In the first instance, the Crown Law officers drew it in a form suitable for regulations to be incorporated in the act. Although the proposition may have considerable results under certain conditions, it is so simple that a returned soldier will be able to gather the gist of it from a cursory examination. The details, scientifically worked out, can be incorporated in regulations.

Immediately the cost of living fell, and a reduction was indicated, strong opposition clause be inserted:would be met with from ex-servicemen's organizations, &c. The work the involved at each change would necessitate the whole staff of repatriation branch officers working day and night for a fortnight, during which period all other work would necessarily cease. This would result in delays, and hardship to claimants arid appellants would follow. Other types of payments, such as medical sustenance, unemployment sustenance, educational allowances and living allowances bear some relation to war pensions, and increase one without increasing the other would cause misunderstanding. Such payments would have to be adjusted at the same time as pensions were adjusted in order to avoid anomalies. The different rates of war pensions, service pensions and prescribed allowances, either fixed or maximum rates, number well over 200. In very many cases the payments to a family consist of various kinds of pension or allowance. They consist of war pension and service pension; war pension and fifth schedule amount; war pension and education allowance. The possible variations are numerous.

Since then, the senior Ministers present discussed this amendment w i th the Repatriation Commission and w it h Sir Gilbert Dyett, federal president of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, before his departure for Melbourne this morning. Sir Gilbert has a close and intimate knowledge of the effect which failure to accept this proposal could have upon the widows, and after f u l l discussion with him, the Goernment decided that it is justified in accepting the principle of the amendment, with the proviso that the period be limited to six months after the death of the soldier. Honourable members can rest assured that the Government is f u l l y in sympathy with the principle of the amendment, but it is informed by its legal advisers that the amendment may have far-reaching implications in its present form. Therefore, the GovernI ask the honourable member for Parramatta to withdraw his amendment, and to accept the assurance I am giving on behalf of the Government. understand that the honourable member for Parramatta ( Sir Frederick Stewart) arranged w i th the Minister that the period of six months should date from the time of the notification of the death might be of no benefit to the widows of many men who died in Malaya, because more than six months would have elapsed in their case before they received notification. to that. honourable member for Parramatta, I ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

I desire to inform the honourable member that I have conferred w i th Mr President and Mr Speaker and that it has been agreed to meet the request as subsequently modified by the honourable member, i.e., that the number in each State be reduced to one copy-that for the State library, wherever it is possible to do so and where the cost involved is not appreciable. 1943, the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) asked the following question, without notice: I have received a letter from the Batman Women's Organizing Committee in relation to the making of adequate supplies of brandy available in small quantities for medical use. I ask the Minister for Supply and Shipping whether he will give an assurance that adequate supplies in small quantities w ill be made available for this purpose?

COAL MINI NG INDUSTR Y: JUMBUNNAA ND the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) asked me whether I would give early consideration to the augmentation of the coal supplies of Victoria by re-opening, at Jumbunna and Outtrim. coal-mines which were worked by private enterprise some 40 years ago, but which had subsequently been closed as the result of the influence of the colliery proprietors of New South Wales. I am now in a position to inform the honourable member that the question of re-opening these mines has already been considered by the Commonwealth Coal Commission, and it appears that, apart from the difficulties associated with the mining industry generally, there are certain technical problems associated with both fields. On the general question of augmenting Victorian coal supplies, the commission is of the opinion that this can",169,Adjournment Australia N Soldiers Repatriation

What has been the .production over the past twelve months to date? relate to matters under the jurisdiction of my colleague, the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Ward), who will furnish the relevant information to the honourable member. The answers to the remaining questions are as follows:3. The latest recorded twelve-monthly .period the position has become more acute. The is that ending on the 20,th February, 1943, and in respeot of that period the figures are 827,250 tons. 5. For specific foreseen demands, estimated requirements are 15,000,000 tons. This figure does not include additions to reserve stocks. 6. For the same period as No. 3-15,028,56 8 tons. The honourable member will appreciate that stoppages do not occur in a regular cycle, and figures taken over twelvemonthly periods at varying dates must necessarily fluctuate. the 16th March, the honourable member member that typewriters were impressed [75] Has the Minister for Transport seen the secretary of the Australian Communist party, published in the Sydney Sunday Telecongress of the Australian Communist party; if so, will the honourable gentleman state what class of priority has been granted to these delegates and, if the issue of such priorities indicates that the need for imposing restrictions upon travel is not so pressing now as it has been, will he consider the extension of similar facilities to the wives of soldiers? I have caused inquiries to be made in respect to the granting of rail priorities to delegates attending the national con-gress of the Communist party and desire to point out that 25 travel permits were issued and' not 50 as indicated in the Sydney Sunday Telegraph. In accordance with Priority Permit Travel Regulations 1-8, all delegates attending conferences are placed on No. 4 priority. This priority granted to the Communist party is the same priority as granted for church conferences, conferences of trade union organizations, wheat-growers, and other recognized bodies who periodically convene conferences to conduct the business of their organizations. This procedure has been followed since the introduction of the permit system on the 1st July last. The issuing of such per. mits to delegates attending conferences does not, in any way, indicate that the . heavy strain imposed upon the railway systems has eased, but, on the contrary, request of the honourable member for me to consider the extension of similar facilities to the wives of soldiers is one which has, at all times, received the CF.reful and sympathetic consideration of myself and my department. As far as I am aware, all applications from soldiers' wives for priority travel have been granted where it was found-that the travel was necessary or advisable. honourable member for Lilley( Mr Jolly) pressment of typewriters in Brisbane.

The Stationery Officer, Queensland Lines of Communicat ion Area, tried, by advertising and other means, to obtain typewriters, prior to the visit of Captain Ramsay,, and was unable to obtain sufficient machines to meet the needs of the Army. For this reason Captain Ramsay was instructed to proceed to Queensland to obtain the typewriters necessary. Two hundred and eighteen typewriters were purchased in Brisbane at an average cost of £19 each. Over 500 firms have been called on in Australia, and there has been only one -complaint, from the Queensland Pastoral Supplies Proprietary Limited, 27 Bowenstreet, Brisbane. Thisf i r m had at least twenty machines-som e of them not in aise-and 20 per cent, of this number was called for, this being the usual percentage taken from commercial houses.

TAX EXEMPTIONS ; SUFFERERS EROM the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) asked me a question and regarding service chevrons and tax exemption for men serving at Darwin. I now desire to advise the honourable member that service chevrons are awarded for service in any area which, under the order governing their issue, is declared to be a "" theatre of operations "" for the purpose of that order. Tlie question of what areas are to be declared theatres of operations is decided by the Commander-in-Chief. H is decisions in this matter are based on the operational situation from time fo time and -the matter is kept constantly under review. The mandated territories of New Guinea and Papua have already been declared theatres of-operations. Darwin has not heen declared a theatre of operations, but recent events there w ill be taken f u l l y into consideration in the current review of the matter. W it h regard to taxation deductions, the Treasurer has approved that members of the Australian M i l it a r y Forces who serve for a period longer than six months in Papua, New Guinea, or any other territory of the Commonwealth which is not part of Australia, w ill be exempt from income tax while so serving and. that such exemption w ill continue until the group year following the financial year in which they return to Australia. It w ill thus be seen that members serving in the Northern Territory are not, by reason of that service only, exempt from payment of income tax. This matter w ill also be kept under review in accordance with the progress of operations, and I shall direct the Treasurer's attention to the honourable member's representations. On the 4th March, 1943, the right honourable member for Cowper( Sir",171,Impressment Of Typewriter S
1050,Mr Forde,"On the 12th March,Earle Page) in a question, ruithout notice, asked me whether I would give consideration to extending leave to persons who developed malaria during the fourteen days' leave which they were granted upon return to Australia from tropical areas. I now desire to advise the right honourable member that an instruction has been issued to provide that the leave of a member of the military forces who has been granted recreation leave or disembarkation leave and who is admitted to hospital during such leave, is to be extended so that he will receive the full effective period of his leave. Mir. Curtin-On the 4th March, 1943, the honourable member for Richmond( Mr the military authorities some time before Anthony) referred to certain soldiers on leave from New Guinea who desired to visit their wives and families in New Zealand but were unable to secure seats on the plane. I desire to inform the honourable member that Army regulations provide that if sufficient leave is available signs of mental disorder and was given to members of the forces who have the requisite authority and time within the leave period to proceed to and return from their home town in New Zealand they may do so. The only practicable method would bs by air, but members are required to make their own bookings, pay their own e.vpenses outside Australia, and are warned that passages booked may be cancelled at any time owing to priority bookings which are not available for leave travel. Inquiries made by the Department of Civil Aviation with regard to the availability of seats on the SydneyAuckland service indicate that early this month the traffic officer of Qantas-Empire Airways received an inquiry from Victoria Barracks, Sydney, for twelve seats for soldiers from Sydney to Auckland and return on a fixed date. The position was that for the next trip only three seats were available, and the priorities for the return trips were governed by the New Zealand authorities. The inquirer was informed that it was impossible to obtain twelve scats on one trip without priority, and he was referred to the Department of 'Civil Aviation. However, no application was made to the department, and if it had been made it could not have been granted for one trip. I am assured that Qantas-Empire Airways always give as much preference as is possible to soldiers returning home. It is pointed out, however, that available aircraft are limited and no guarantee can be given that those granted seats will be able to return on a fixed date. The position at present is that all priority and non-priority 'seats are booked up to the 17 th April'next and there are reservations beyond that date. ment made by the honourable member for Deakin( Mr Hutchinson) on the 12th February, 1043, regarding a soldier who was suffering from a mental disability and was discharged from the forces. The honourable member stated that the mental disorder of this soldier was known to any hospital treatment was given, and indicated that that fact would emerge clearly from a letter which I had written to him in response to his representations; Continuing, he said that some months after his enlistment, the soldier showed leave to go to his home on the 17th June, 1942. He returned to camp on the 20th June. The honourable member went on to sr.y that shortly afterwards the mental disorder was again noticed and once more he was sent home on leave. I should like to point out to honourable members that, at the time of writing to the honourable member for Deakin, I was unaware of the fact that the soldier had. been given leave on the 17th June, and for that reason no reference to that fact was made in the letter which the honourable member read out in the House. I have had further inquiries made, and it has been reported to me quite definitely that the soldier showed no signs of mental disorder on the 17th June, 1942. He was a member of the Australian Army Ordnance Corps Train-ing Depot at Bendigo, and was employed in the regimental aid post directly under the eye of the regimental medical officer. This officer states that the soldier had not appeared on sick parade, nor were any signs of mental disturbance noticed. He did, however, appear somewhat highly strung and in need of a rest. As he had leave due to him, the regi^yntal medical officer gave him a few days home leave on the 17th June, 1942, and may have told him to report to his area medical officer if he did not feel well whilst on",172,Malaria Leave Treatment Of Soldier Sufferin G From Mental Derangement
1051,Mr Forde,"I wish to refer to a stateleave. The soldier returned to camp and said that;.he had seen the area medical officer, who had extended his leave, but that he was anxious to get back to camp. Further leave was due to the soldier and the regimental medical officer again sent him home on the 28th June, 1942, but states quite definitely that there was no sign at that time of mental derangement. I might here interpolate that the reportwhich I have received from the medical officers in my department is ' that the soldier's trouble could quite easily have been in its early stages on the 28th June, and that, although on arrival at his home the soldier may have appeared -quite mental to his relatives, he may not have volunteered his delusions or acted strangely to other persons. Had this soldier shown signs of mental derangement, I have no doubt that action would have been taken to ensure that he had proper medical care. However, he certainly gave no such indications to the medical officers at his camp, and appeared only to need rest and change. In these circumstances, the officers can hardly be blamed for having sent him honie rather than to hospital. In his speech on the 12th February, the honourable member for Deakin stated thatafter the soldier returned on the 2Sth June, his sister and other relatives noticed his mental state and communicated with the authorities. I am not sure whether the honourable member intended to convey that the soldier's sister and his relatives had not noticed anything unusual in his behaviour during his previous period, of leave at home between the 17th and the 20th June; but, it might be fair to infer that that is the case, since the sister, in her letter to the honourable member, made no reference to any unusual signs before the 28th June. If that inference be correct, it would be quite apparent that the soldier was, at that time, showing no signs whatever of any serious mental disorder. As a result of information conveyed by the soldier's relatives shortly after he arrived 1942. One of the questions asked him home on the 28th June, instructions were given to the medical officer at. the Heidelsuffered from nervous breakdown or berg area to go and see the .soldier at his home. On his arrival, the doctor noticed that the. soldier was in a mental state and suffering froiti hallucinations. He, therethe soldier's mother died in Mont Park Mr Forde. fore, instructed the soldier to report to 115th Army General Hospital, Heidelberg, but this the soldier refused to do. The medical officer, considering that the soldier should be taken .care of, called at 115 th Army General Hospital, reported the case, and the hospital authorities arranged for the, soldier to be brought by the Provost Corps to the hospital. The honourable member informed the House that when the military police arrived to take the soldier away they intended to take him to the Russell-street gaol; but I feel sure that if the soldier's relatives were of opinion that the military police had intended to remove the soldier to Russellstreet then, either they misunderstood what was said to them by the military police, orelse the military police misinterpreted the instructions which were given to them. The report which I have received is quite definite that it was the intention of the hospital authorities who gave the instructions to the military police that the soldier should be brought to hospital. It will be appreciated by honourable members that the Array had no indication'at all. of the soldier's mental derangement before his sister communicated with theauthorities, and immediately steps were taken to have the soldier transferred to hospital. In fact, the soldier reported himself to the 115th Army General Hospital on the 4th July, 1942, the day after the military police had called at his home. It will be apparent, therefore, that the honourable member for Deakin was not in possession of the full facts when he informed the House that the mental disorder of the soldier was known to the military authorities some time before any hospital treatment was given. With regard to the medical history of this case, I should like to place before the House the following facts which I have received from competent medical advisers: The soldier presented himself for medical examination, prior to enlistment, at Heidelberg on the 6th January, was, ""Has any member of your family mental trouble?"" He answered in'the negative. Inquiries have since been made, and it has been ascertained that Mental Hospital, and that her brother was also a patient in a mental hospital some years ago. Had this information been disclosed at the time of enlistment, further inquiries would have been made before the soldier was accepted for service. At the time of his admission to the military hospital, on the 4tli July, the soldier was suffering from schizophrenia, a disease which arises from constitutional causes, and could not be induced by military service. I drew the attention of the honourable member to this fact in my letter of the 2oth January, and in his. statement in the House he expressed surprise that such a statement could be made. He pointed out that the soldier at his enlistment was a "" perfectly sane, normal and intelligent man and was passed physically fit and .taken' into the Army. He continued .that what subsequently happened was not known except that the' soldier was attacked by a mental disorder. honourable member concluded by saying that, when a man enlisted and was accepted as medically fit, the Government had a definite responsibility to him. My' reply is ' that the med'ical opinion is unanimous that the di -case from which this soldier suffered was constitutional and arose from a presoldier lost. The honourable member disposition and not from the circumstances of his military training. The soldier certainly was passed as medically fit by the Army; but the medical officers who passed the soldier were relying upon his own statement that there had never been any mental trouble in his family. Surely they are entitled to rely upon such statements and cannot he expected to carry out independent and searching investigations into the family history of every person who presents himself for enlistment. The constitutional predisposition of this soldier to the complaint from which he is rfow suffering could not be determined by clinical examination. A correct reply on his part to the inquiry concerning the family history was all-important. The honourable member suggested that because the soldier appeared quite normal at tbe time of liis enlistment and some time afterwards became subject to violent mental trouble, the mental trouble must be attributable to the circumstances of his military training. I cannot agree that, because the illness manifested itself for the first time after the soldier commenced his military training, it must be attributable to his training, nor does competent medical opinion accept that proposition. I quite agree that if the Army accepts the services of a man whois perfectly normal and healthy, and that subsequently, as a result of his services, the soldier's health is broken, the Government has a responsibility to see that he is properly cared for and provided for; hut I cannot agree that the Government is responsible to care for every person whose health is broken after, but not as a result of, military service-particularl y in cases such as this, where the soldier has not given his complete medical history. Again, I would repeat that had the soldier disclosed the fact that his mother and her brother had suffered from mental The complaints, further inquiries would have been made, and it is quite possible that the soldier's services would never have been accepted. The final matter regarding which I wish'.to place further facts before the House concerns the valuables which the stated on the 12th February .that the soldier had been admitted to the Australian General Hospital on the 9th July and was transferred to Royal Park on the 11th July, where he lost certain valuables, including some money. He continued that a person admitted under these circumstances should have his belongings checked and should not be left' in possession of documents which would be in danger of being destroyed by himself or by others. In this regard, 1 would like to say that a searching inquiry has failed to reveal any' record of this soldier having been in possession of money or valuables on his admission to 115th Australian General Hospital. When subsequently he was transferred to the Royal Park Receiving House he had in his possession seven military badges, an Army pay-book and 9d. in cash. Since the soldier was not, at the time of his admission to the hospital,' in possession of the valuables which unfortunately cannot now be traced, it can hardly be said that the Army is responsible to make good the loss to his relatives. The history of this soldier after his admission to the Australian General Hospital is that he became rapidly worse, and it became clear that his treatment could no longer he continued at the hospital. He was certified "" apparently insane, suffering from schizophrenia"", and was transferred on the 11th July to the Royal Park Receiving House. The considered medical Opinion was that further treatment -would not enable him to resume military training for some time, and that his complaint was not attributable to his military service. He was therefore discharged from the Army on the 27th July, whilst in the Royal Park Receiving House. Up to and including the date of his discharge from the Arniy he was the responsibility of the Army, who paid all expenses to that date. After the 27th July, responsibility for the soldier was taken over by the Public Trustee of Victoria as a case to be supervised by him. During August, the soldier's sister, who was a frequent visitor to him, stated that he appeared to_ be fairly normal, and expressed her willingness to care for her brother. He was detained until the 12th September, under further treatment and observation, and on that date, as he appeared much better, be was discharged from the receiv' ing house to the care of his sister. At the time of his discharge from the receiving house, however, he did not appear to have been completely restored. His bank book and insurance policy were held by the Public Trustee. The bankbook showed a credit of £41 Os. 3d., and the Public Trustee claimed an amount of £6 12s. 4d. from the estate for maintenance charges from the 27th July to the 12th September, which was the period between the date of his discharge from the Army and the date of his discharge from the receiving house. The soldier was still liable for service under Part IV . of the Defence Act, and some time after, his discharge from Royal Park Receiving House he was given notice .of call up. He reported on the 12th November, 1942, and was classified on the same day as "" permanently unfit for military service"". The action for call up was in order under the provisions of Part IV . of the Defence Act.",173,Malaria Leave Treatment Of Soldier Sufferin G From Mental Derangement
