You have to wonder.

There are two result of a very bad deal that the government fundamental myths that Labor likes to cut with the big players such as BHP, Rio propagate when it talks about this tax. The Tinto and Xtrata. The words of Fortescue first is that the mining industry does not pay boss Andrew Forrest, a man who has had ties enough tax and that a profits based tax is to the Labor Party and to other political required. To begin with, the mining industry parties, were that the MRRT is 'the bastard currently pays state based royalties as well as child of the RSPT'. He said that it is the company tax. A company tax is, in effect, a bastard child of a tax which was ill thought profits based tax. So let us dispel that myth out and so hideously complicated in the first straight away. place. They are very concise words from Mr In a desperate attempt to wage some type Forrest. This tax will make Australia one of of class war on the industry, the Labor Party the most expensive places on earth to invest made the absolutely extraordinary claim that in the mining sector at a time when other the Australian miners are only paying around nations are doing everything possible to 13 to 17 per cent tax.

How perverse! deliberately shoot themselves in the foot Perhaps this tax is an attempt by this when faced with such extraordinary Prime Minister to return to the so-called opportunities for growth and for increasing glory days of the Hawke government, when living standards and the economic prosperity of its people.

There will be a lifting of the Also, the superannuation guarantee threshold for small business at the same time generally will, over time, be lifted from nine as an efficient resource rent tax is introduced to 12 per cent. In following the debate on the as part of comprehensive tax reform which superannuation guarantee over a long period goes back to the Henry tax review. I have been in the camp of those who I am in the camp which says that supported 15 per cent as the goal. I was efficiency and a profits-based mechanism is persuaded on this position by those who say good while inefficiency and a non-profitsthat, if we are serious about having a based mechanism is bad. This is not a statessustainable retirement savings structure for versus-Commonwealth argument; it is an the future of Australia, given its argument about efficiency versus demographics-the ageing bubble that is inefficiency. Therefore, I think this is a coming through-the figure of 15 per cent is sensible move. This tax is the first of the the one that will deliver. I will be interested substantial taxes in this parliament which I to hear from those who try to argue have supported. I did not support the flood otherwise, either through the argument that it levy.

It is a judgment call, and I think it is for profits-based, efficient taxation is the going to be right.

Fast-forward down the wrong track and prevent our nation just three years to 2010-11, and it is from concentrating on the things that are estimated that mining companies will pay truly important, such as improving our $23.4 billion in taxes and royalties to the nation's productivity, encouraging federal government-an increase of 58 per investment, improving equality of cent in just three years. opportunity for all firms, large and small, As a nation we should be recognising that and reducing red tape. What is important is we are currently receiving windfall taxes making sure we have a stronger economy to from the mining industry, and as a nation we build a stronger nation. Unfortunately, our should be using these funds to pay off government fails to understand this. It fails government debt and to build up a surplus to understand that no country has ever taxed again, a surplus that was wrecked and wasted itself into prosperity and no country has ever by this current government through their built its wealth by adding tax after tax after reckless spending. Instead, we see this tax, as we have seen this government do. government, instead of banking these This tax is being sold by a series of myths. windfall profits and taxes received from the We have seen the government up to their old mining industry, still borrowing over $100 tricks in peddling this bill to the public using million a day to fund its reckless spending. a series of misrepresentations and untruths. The second myth that is being peddled is The first misrepresentation and untruth that this new tax will help small business. Of peddled by this government is the line that course, everyone wants to help small Australians are not getting their fair share of business; it is a motherhood statement. But the profits of the stuff being dug up out of these bills will force all small businesses our own backyard. Anyone listening to across our nation to have to find an extra speakers from the government on this debate three per cent of their payroll in would get the impression that we have superannuation. This will result in the hoards of foreign mining companies majority of businesses being worse off, even mining companies to negotiate the mining after reduction of the company tax rate. An tax version 2. No wonder the result is that analysis of the government's own figures these three big companies like the tax. They demonstrates that these bills are nothing know that it will give them an unfair other than a tax grab. competitive advantage in the marketplace According to the government's own against their smaller competitors who were figures, in 2010-13 it is budgeted that these locked out of this negotiating process. These new taxes will raise $4 billion. But they will bills were a policy done by deal rather than a only give back in that year $1.1 billion. In policy developed through extensive the following year, 2013-14, the consultation and detailed consideration, and government's own figures show that this tax they are an example of what happens when is budgeted to raise $6.5 billion. But, again, business gets the better of slow-witted it will only give back $2.5 billion. That is a politicians without commercial knowledge. $2.9 billion tax grab in 2012-13 and a further We have seen, in just a few months, how tax grab of $4 billion in 2013-14. These the assumptions relied on by the Treasury figures expose the true intent behind this carbon tax modelling are not worth the paper mining tax and these bills. It is nothing other the modelling is written on. This legislation than a shameless tax grab, designed to create is badly flawed also, because it relies on the illusion of an early surplus, deceptively modelling using a highly-volatile commodity dressed up and marketed with a falsehood of cycle. I will give a couple of examples. In helping small business when it simply has June this year, iron ore prices hit close to the aim of plugging holes in this US$200 per tonne, but last month the spot government's budget and making up for its price had collapsed to US$116.90 per tonne. reckless spending and failures. Look what happened to iron ore prices When we look at the process of how this following the GFC. They simply fell off a policy and how these bills evolved, it is a cliff, going in a very short period from close textbook example of how not to do it. Firstly, to US$200 per tonne to less than US$70 per following the debacle of the mining tax tonne. Coal prices fell off the same cliff with version 1, we had a new Prime Minister the GFC. But this is not unusual, and it promising to negotiate with the mining should not have been unexpected. This is industry. However, instead of negotiating how commodity cycles in prices have risen with the mining industry, this government and fallen over the last 200 years. To think did a secret deal behind closed doors with that the future will be any different is naive. our three biggest mining companies-BHP While it is possible that for a short time Billiton, Rio Tinto and Xstrata-and the commodity cycle may continue to defy excluded their more than 320 smaller gravity, the weight of our 200-year history is competitors.

You would need more our 'five for one' people swap with the than a crystal ball to be able to predict where Malaysians rolled up again with our three big iron ore and coal prices will be next year, let alone where they will be in five years. Therefore, because of the modelling used by mistake: this tax will make investing in this government-the secret modelling that Australian coal and iron ore projects less no-one has been able to see-it is highly attractive than investing in those overseas questionable whether the tax will deliver the and less attractive than investing in resource streams of revenue that the government projects that are not subject to the tax. claims it will. Compared to the current situation, it will The ideology behind this tax also penalise high-risk projects. demonstrates that we have a government With this legislation, Labor has which fails to understand the concept of announced a range of policy changes that all superprofits. These only occur in the short seem on the surface to be very favourableterm in a competitive market. Superprofits an increase in compulsory superannuation, are the reward for human ingenuity and small business infrastructure spending and a entrepreneurship. Superprofits drive cut in the company tax rate, for example. But innovation-the innovation that creates our what happens if the mining tax does not raise wealth and prosperity. But the government, these funds as expected? On the current with their socialist tendencies, see estimates, between now and 2020 the cost of superprofits as simply windfalls for evil the initiatives that Labor says are funded by capitalists. Mining, like all other industries, the mining tax adds up to $58 billion. But, relies on entrepreneurial insight for success. according to the Treasury's own estimatesIt is a risky business, where superlosses are estimates for which the modelling is just as likely as superprofits. The current hidden-the mining tax will raise less than mining boom is no accident. Australian $39 billion. The key assumptions remain miners were not simply sitting on their hands secret. A structural deficit has been built in when Chinese and Indian businesses decided through this tax. to go on their current buying spree and drive These bills also demonstrate the prices up. Australian miners have spent time, commercial naivety of members of the money and effort in searching out mineral government, who, although well deposits and developing the capacity to credentialled in economic theory, are simply exploit these resources. Had there been no clueless when it comes to the real world of demand for these resources-had the business. The flaw in this tax is that, unlike increased demand from China and India not with royalties, multinational companies have occurred-these miners would have lost the ability to use transfer pricing-shifting much of their investment. overheads, debts, expenses and profits from The ability of exploration and mining country to country-to reduce their taxation companies to raise equity and capital for liability. Further, this new tax, because it future projects is critical to the development only applies to coal and iron ore, gives large of our nation. There is a real threat from this mining companies involved in mining other tax that smaller miners will find it even minerals the ability to shift expenses and harder and more expensive to raise funds to profits between different mines. Although invest in the first place. At a time when dark transfer pricing is not permitted in Australia storm clouds are gathering on the economic and the ATO has wide powers to determine horizon, the very last thing this government whether companies are engaged in transfer should be doing is hitting our exporters with pricing, there remain many perfectly legal a big new tax which our overseas ways that companies can achieve the goal of competitors do not have to pay.

I do believe that has significantly narrowed the basis on Australians have the right to expect the which the ATO can act on transfer pricing, benefits of the mining boom to extend which undermines the fundamentals of this beyond the mining industry itself and to tax. spread right across the country.

Everyone knows, and it is no powerfully read speech, but I will disappoint great secret, that this government has never her by saying we will not be supporting this balanced its books. It has never balanced the tax, and for that there is a very simply budget in the time it has been in office. The reason. Apart from during the very unique whole problem with the continual conditions in the 1970s, when we had the proposition of taxes from this government is petroleum resource rent tax, it has not been that they are only trying to cover up their the habit of the Australian government to out-of-control spending. The problem for hack into sectors to try to capture some of this government is that every tax they the surpluses in one sector, when it looks like conceive of and dream up never quite covers it is doing well, to the exclusion of others. up their runaway spending. Like most countries in the world we have always had an economy-wide income tax, an The great problem for the government as economy-wide withholding tax and an they negotiate this MRRT is that they can economy-wide company tax, and that is by see that even by 2019-20 the mining tax will far the best way to protect an increasingly not be large enough even to cover one of internationalised world of trade and their commitments: the increase in commerce-the golden goose that is laying superannuation for workers.

I wonder how many small for particularly small businesses to keep businesses have thought that is good for their paying more and more and more at a time cash flow.

The rights to the majority of this taxation incentives and reductions for resource base are vested in the people of businesses and individuals in our country; Australia and in the Crown.

Royalties do not take into account low-income earners; raising the the profitability of a mining operation and, as superannuation guarantee age limit from 70 such, will still tax mining operations when to 75; and changing concessional no economic rent is present and will recover contribution caps for people over 50 with only a small proportion of profits when rents low superannuation balances.

These are just three of the concerns that As I have stated in this place many times the coalition has with the MRRT package of before, we in the coalition recognise that our bills brought before this House. We call on economy will face many challenges in the the government to take heed of them.

The both Australia's current economy and its coalition left the current government with future prosperity. As I have said in this place that position of strength. The Howard before, the Australian people deserve to have government paid off $96 billion of Labor a say on the future prosperity of this great debt, leaving this government with $50 nation.

However, this Labor tax package, which has serious implications government has managed to turn that $50 for the Australian economy broadly and for billion in the bank into over $107 billion in the mining industry specifically. net government debt, which is accumulating more debt at a rate of $100 million a day, As the federal member for Longman, I with an interest bill of $20 million a day. would be remiss if I failed to articulate my serious concerns about the implications of It is here that the philosophical difference these bills for my electorate.

We on local economy is based on tourism, light this side of the House believe in lower taxes industry and manufacturing, which will all and in growing the productive capacity of the certainly feel the impact of this tax package. economy.

Climate change and the However, no-one is under the illusion that environment present a problem; not only do we will forever be able to rely on mining to we get a tax but we get the single largest prop up our economy.

Yet to be savvy about how we ensure that our another Labor tax. current resources will ensure our future It is the design of this tax that is security.

I raised my concerns in some detail with Under subsection (1), the mining profit is the government and I am pleased to adjusted to $91.25 million, and the MRRT recognise its interest in supporting these amendments which would help to rectify the I think the Greens should reflect on their problem with the tax's problematic start-up own conduct, given the situation in Tasmania point by raising the threshold to $75 million right now where the Greens-Labor with the tax phased in to $125 million.

When it In closing, I acknowledge that I would comes to the MRRT, I do not believe that the have preferred a genuine super profits tax on government followed proper process when it all sectors of the economy, including sat down with just three big mining banking. But I do see merit in returning a companies to design the tax. Nor do I think it fairer share of the resources boom to the is fair that the end result treats those same community, and the MRRT will, in fact, big companies relatively better than small achieve that. What these amendments will do companies, especially when those small is go some small way to ensuring that the companies are their competitors. MRRT is collected more fairly. My concern has nothing to do with trying Question agreed to. to water down the MRRT for the benefit of the mining industry. Of course they should pleased to be supporting the Minerals pay their fair share, and when their raw Resource Rent Tax Bill 2011 because, like material is public property and the times are the member for Denison said, although it is good they should pay a premium back to the not perfect, it is about time that we made a community. That is exactly what the MRRT start in Australia on taking a fair share from will do, and I support that. Nor is there a Australia's mineral resources that we all own simplistic correlation between my support as the Australian people and only get to sell for a higher MRRT threshold and the cutting once.

This grant will help East Ringwood Clinic to expand the number of consulting rooms and to update a pretty tired old building. I met with Dr Dilip Hoole, the director of GP services at the clinic, who has been a driver in the quest for the upgrade. The practice itself dates from the 1950s and originally was converted from a house which appears to be much older than that. It has small rooms and a steep staircase, and the entrance is a walk down a narrow side alley as the front steps are not accessible to many people. The clinic currently has four consulting rooms on the ground floor, with a treatment room up the steep internal stairs, which are a major challenge for many of the older clients and injured patients who visit the clinic. This $150,000 grant is very good value for money for the Commonwealth, especially when it is added to $120,000 of the clinic's money. The clinic's consulting rooms will be increased from four to six, enabling the clinic to employ an additional two full-time GPs. This measure is expected to enable the clinic to treat up to an additional 2,000 patients per year. The treatment room and pathology lab will be moved downstairs, making it easier for the elderly to access these services. The upstairs area will be renovated to house the administrative sections of the clinic and establish two new psychology rooms. Most importantly, the front entrance will be improved by removing steps and installing a ramp for easier access. Another clinic in the Deakin electorate will receive a $300,000 grant to help extend their clinic-that is, Sheehans Medical Centre in Blackburn South. Sheehans Medical Centre has purchased a property next door and for two years has been planning to demolish the house to build a car park. The lack of a car park has restricted the ability to expand the clinic as council guidelines require four car parking spaces per practitioner. With the grant, the clinic will demolish the house and build new consulting rooms once the car park is finished. The permits are through, and the building works are ready to commence as soon as the demolition is done and funding is approved. The new car park will now cater to around 17 car spaces, allowing the clinic to add new rooms and extra practitioners. This is important because a local clinic recently closed in the area and the surrounding area has three large nursing homes that the clinic services. The demand for the clinic is such that at present they are full and have a large waiting list, which is common to many practices in my electorate. I commend the Primary Care Infrastructure Grants program. It helps local clinics expand their operations and deliver expanded GP services where families need them, not only in my electorate of Deakin but right across Australia. Stirling Electorate: Reid Highway Overpass major win for my electorate of Stirling. On 12 November, the Liberal state Minister for Transport, the Hon.

265,Mr Keenan (Stirling) (16:02,"It is my pleasure today to inform the House about aoverpass. I have been campaigning for the construction of this overpass since my election in 2004, and indeed beforehand, and it is a pleasure finally to see it completed. Hundreds of local families had expressed to me their concerns about this notorious black spot and that is why I continuously fought for it to be fixed. Before the construction of the overpass, the intersection was rated as one of Western Australia's worse crash zones, and that is why it has been a project worth fighting for. The notorious black spot hosted 400 crashes, with four fatalities, over the previous decade. The intersection carries approximately 60,000 vehicles a day, and the overpass will now improve both time efficiency and safety for those who use it. I commend the work of the state Liberal government which fully financed this $30 million project. It is of deep concern to me that there was no federal government contribution to it. My constituents have been promised in every state and federal election since 2004 by both the state and the federal Labor Party that they would make a contribution to this overpass. Sadly, nothing has been forthcoming. The previous state Liberal opposition recognised this problem area and they addressed the issue within two years of their election. By contrast, the previous state Labor government promised the people in Stirling in 2004 and again in 2005 that they would fix the problem, but they never delivered on this promise. The opening of the long-awaited and long-overdue overpass will greatly enhance the safety of all users of the Reid Highway, and I will continue to fight for improved infrastructure on Stirling roads and ensure the safety of all of my constituents in Stirling. That overpass comes on the back of the opening of the Reid Highway-Alexander Drive overpass, which was completed through contributions from both the state and the federal governments. That overpass was opened some eight months ago, and I congratulate the Minister for Transport, Troy Buswell, on seamlessly moving workers in the construction crew onto the overpass at Mirrabooka Avenue and on the subsequent cost savings associated with completing those two very important projects. Road infrastructure is vitally important for improving efficiency, for allowing people in Stirling to get about the electorate and to get in and out of town as quickly and as seamlessly as possible. The completion of this much needed overpass and the earlier much needed overpass at Alexander Drive is of great importance to the people of Stirling. I commend the state government for completing them. (Time expired) Holt Electorate: Community Awards that I am proud to host in my electorate. The first is the 2011 Community Spirit and Leadership Awards, to be held on Monday, 5 December, and the second is the 2012 Holt Australia Day Awards. This year marks the 10th anniversary of the Community Spirit and Leadership Awards. It is an amazing community event. It is very difficult to describe the feeling amongst the community when representatives from up to 55 schools come to celebrate this event, which up to 300 people can attend. For this event, I ask schools to nominate one particular student. That one student embodies what it means to contribute to the overall life of the school community. It says a lot about the quality of the schools involved that they send exceptional students. For example, one of the award recipients last year helped plan and organise a fundraiser for a fellow student with a disability, which raised $13,000 to go towards essential walking equipment. There are many other stories like this, ranging from saving lives to providing bread each day for school breakfasts. MAIN COMMITTEE",271,Constituency Statements
266,Mr Byrne (Holt) (16:04,"I rise today to inform the House about two upcoming eventsDown my way we get a lot of bad press about our young people. But I like to say, through conducting this particular event, how proud I am of the many kids and students who live in my area. These kids are there making a difference. I think we will probably get about 44 students at this event, nominated from about 44 of the 55 schools that participate. I also like to communicate, on behalf of our community and on behalf of people here, how proud we are of them and how we recognise their achievement. Too often we read in the national media and the local media about what our kids are doing wrong. I think it is important for us as a parliament and as a community to acknowledge what our kids are doing right. I think this ceremony, on behalf of us as a community, acknowledges their contribution. The other really important awards are the Holt Australia Day Awards. I think it is also important to acknowledge what it means to be an Australian on Australia's national day. WhatI think that means, in a very understated way, is service to the community-not seeking headlines, not seeking the electronic media, but actually making a real-life difference to people every day. Again, I think it is important for us, on behalf of the community, to acknowledge those contributions, which often go unheralded in the mainstream community. So those two great events-the Community Spirit and Leadership Awards and the Holt Australia Day Awards-symbolise and celebrate what is best in our community. And that is our young people, through the Community Spirit and Leadership Awards, as well as the general community from all walks of life who make our community a better place to live and work. Ryan Electorate: Scouts and Girl Guides a quintessential part of an Australian childhood. They encourage our younger generations to engage in community service, support their peers and learn valuable life skills, including teamwork and leadership. Scouts and Girl Guides provide a wonderful outlet for our children and at the same time teach them invaluable life skills. My electorate of Ryan was hit hard by the floods in January, affecting homes, businesses, livelihoods and, of course, community organisations. In particular, local Scouts and Girl Guides groups lost many of their halls and facilities. These groups are not-for-profit organisations, so this damage has had long-term detrimental effects. Almost 12 months on, some of these groups are still not back in their huts, with the Auchenflower Scout Hall remaining closed, mainly due to flood damage. Over the past year I have received many calls for help and support from local groups. I am always happy to support these worthwhile organisations, as they provide a continuing commitment to our youth generation after generation. They encourage young people to play a constructive role in society as responsible citizens and active members of our community-although, I must say, as a scouting mother I do feel that the first badge they earn should be one for sewing. I vividly remember many long nights trying to sew those badges on straight on my son's shirt. I was delighted to attend the recent John Oxley Girl Guides awards ceremony. Congratulations to all the girls who have achieved so much. However, I particularly want to acknowledge Jennifer Hall from the Kenmore Ranger Guides. On a visit to the Mater Hospital in Brisbane with her Girl Guides unit, Jennifer discussed ways that she could help the hospital as part of the service component of her Baden-Powell award. Jennifer decided to make beanies for premmie newborn babies. She chose the ambitious target of 800 beanies-the MAIN COMMITTEE",272,Constituency Statements
267,Mrs Prentice (Ryan) (16:07,"The Scouts and Girl Guides movements have long beennumber needed at the Mater each year. Conscious of the challenge of the task ahead, Jennifer enlisted the assistance of local community groups. By the end, she achieved a truly amazing result-more than 6,800 beanies. These were collected and distributed not only to the Mater but to hospitals in need throughout all of Queensland. It was wonderful to hear Jennifer sum up the project in her own words: I felt immensely proud of what I achieved as a Girl Guide with the community and know that we did make a difference. It taught me many skills; not only communication, project management, and logistics, but also the need to say thank-you to every knitter for their wonderful contribution. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Jennifer and, indeed, Girl Guides all around Australia. They are indeed our country's future leaders. Greenway Electorate: Schools Ms ROWLAND (Greenway) (16:10): I rise to mention a number of very exciting developments that have recently occurred in the schools in my electorate of Greenway. The Greenway electorate has benefited greatly from Labor's record investment in schools through the Building the Education Revolution program. Over the past two weeks I have had the absolute privilege of officially opening brand-new facilities at no less than six Greenway schools, thanks to the federal government's record investment in education. Toongabbie West Public School, Seven Hills North Public School, Bert Oldfield Public School, Vardys Road Public School, Barnier Public School and Mary Immaculate Primary School have all recently officially opened their new multipurpose halls, new classrooms and school refurbishments in what have been very exciting times for schools in my electorate. I would like specifically to praise the efforts of all the school communities and especially mention the hard work of their principals, including Brian Firth, Denise Prowse, Libby Gledhill, Amanda Connelly, Rod Gibbs and Paul Devlin. I believe one of the best parts of being the member for Greenway is visiting the fantastic schools in my electorate. I am extremely proud to be the member of a government that invested so much in the future of this country by investing in its schools. I am extremely privileged to represent in this place so many wonderful schools and school children. Nobel prize winner William Yeats said 'Education is not the filling of a pail but the lighting of a fire.' I know that teachers and principals in the Greenway electorate inspire their students in this way every day. During these recognition ceremonies all school principals, as well as parents, support staff and young people themselves have expressed to me their sincerest gratitude for receiving such a significant investment in their school's infrastructure. Until a Labor government chose to stimulate the economy during the GFC by investing in our young people, some of these schools had not seen any new developments in school buildings since they were first established, some of them more than 50 years ago. By investing in education we are indeed investing in the future of this country. I have mentioned on a number of occasions in this place the power of education to enable our young people to reach their full potential. This government, through the BER program and also through another great passion of mine, the National Broadband Network, is affording our young people the best possible opportunities indeed to reach this potential. Thanks to the NBN, all Australian schools, TAFEs, universities and higher education institutions will have the connectivity they need to develop and collaborate on innovative and flexible educational services and resources, to extend online learning resources to the home and workplace and MAIN COMMITTEE facilities to offer students and learners who cannot access courses via traditional means the opportunity of more online virtual learning. The schools in the Greenway electorate will benefit greatly from these developments and I look forward to seeing these schools continue to grow into the future. In closing, I would like to mention the exceptional academic performance of another fantastic Greenway School, Patrician Brothers College in Blacktown. In their NAPLAN tests for 2011 they achieved outstanding results in both year 7 and year 9, which saw them top the Parramatta diocese. I praise the work of principal Santo Passarello and all St Pat's staff and congratulate their students on this wonderful achievement. Gippsland Electorate: Mobile Phone Coverage communities in my electorate which do not have access to reliable mobile phone coverage. In doing so, I call on the government to reintroduce a mobile phone black spot program to assist telecommunication providers to expand their reach into some of our smaller regional centres throughout Australia. The government currently has no plans to improve mobile phone coverage, which is in contrast to the policy of the Liberal-National Party coalition of providing $30 million to target mobile phone black spots. That was a policy that the coalition took to the 2010 election, and I urge the government to adopt our position in the interests of regional growth and community safety. It is the issue of safety, in particular, that I want to focus on today. I want to refer to an email I received this month from a constituent of mine, Mr Alex Gray, who lives in Combienbar. I do not expect other members to know where that is. It is quite a remote part of the East Gippsland area. It is an area which is difficult to service and which has no mobile phone coverage whatsoever. Recently the landline service also failed, and my constituent had to travel about 50 kilometres to Cann River, at his own expense, for the privilege of reporting the service breakdown to Telstra. I would like to quote from Alex's email to me: The safety implications of not having a reliable communication service are obvious. Only a couple of months back an overseer on a nearby property had a near fatal accident on a four wheeler and had to be airlifted to hospital. If this had have happened in the past few days, when there was no phone service available, he may not have survived. There is also the major concern in our area of bushfires. The need for a reliable communication service is obvious. Unfortunately, in this case it took several days to repair the landline service. As we approach the summer bushfire season events like this highlight what an unsatisfactory risk is posed to my community if we do not improve our mobile phone services. I urge the community of Gippsland to prepare early for this year's bushfire season. Nothing takes the place of extensive preparation and development of your own bushfire survival plan to protect your family and property. I also hasten to add that members of a community should not rely on the emergency alert system that the government has rolled out across Australia at a cost of about $26 million. I am not condemning that system in any way whatsoever; I am simply making the point that you should not depend on it completely. Also, do not expect to receive timely advice in an emergency situation, because some of the most bushfire prone areas in my electorate are those that have the worse mobile phone coverage and the emergency alert text system that has been rolled out will not reach many people in the Gippsland area. MAIN COMMITTEE",273,Constituency Statements
268,Mr Chester (Gippsland) (16:13,"I rise to raise my concerns on behalf of several smallAs the system is developed further-and there are plans that messages will be able to be sent based on the location of the mobile phone-it will be critical that mobile phone black spots are eliminated in many of these regional areas I have talked about. From some of the national parks around the Latrobe Valley, to the Grampians in the high country and to some of the more remote coastal areas in Gippsland, the areas with the worse mobile phone coverage are the most likely to be affected by bushfires this summer. It would be illogical to keep spending money on expanding and improving the emergency alert system without also investing in infrastructure to fix the mobile phone black spots in regional areas like Gippsland. On a completely unrelated point it has come to my attention that one of our attendants, Amy Constable, will be leaving us in a couple of days. Amy was just in the chamber a few moments ago. She is going to study in Leeds for six months. We wish her well. She has been a great asset to the parliament. Restoration of the Julie Burgess colleagues and good afternoon. Last Saturday evening I had the great pleasure of joining the new Mayor of Devonport, Mr Steve Martin, and many other dignitaries to relaunch the wooden ketch Julie Burgess, which is the last in a long line of vessels owned by the Burgess family, a family held in high regard who once played a very large part in Victorian and Tasmanian maritime history. The Julie Burgess is known far and wide in maritime circles. It is recorded as a vessel that should be preserved because of her history and role in Tasmanian and mainland waters. The 68-foot ketch was built from blue gum in 1936 by Mr Ned Jack of Launceston. The boat was engaged in the Bass Strait crayfishing industry since her launch, except for war service when she was used as a cable ship in Bass Strait at the outbreak of World War II. After that time, and service doing lots of other things, the Julie Burgess went into disrepair and has been languishing ever since. In 2009 the Devonport City Council, under the first round of the Getting Communities Working and the Local Jobs streams of the Australian government's $650 million Jobs Fund, received approximately $1.87 million to refloat and refurbish the Julie Burgess. The beautiful, young-looking, 75-year old Julie Burgess hit the water and last Saturday, like most boats, looked even more magnificent in the water than when out of it. I want to congratulate the Devonport City Council, and I particularly congratulate former Devonport Mayor Lynn Laycock for nagging me, this government and her own council to get the funding for this. I also congratulate Alderman Graham Kent, Peter Higgins of the Julie Burgess Trust Special Committee and the many others who have joined them to bring this project to fruition. I also acknowledge Margaret Griggs, who started with the project and is now the full-time project officer, along with the members and officers of DEEWR who have put this project together. Not only have we refloated a magnificent ship but we have also given terrific skills to the people and the shipwrights who brought her back to her former splendour. We now look forward to working with the community to get her working as a tourist vessel. At the same time, the additional funds that are part of the project will be used to get the maritime MAIN COMMITTEE",275,Constituency Statements

Armenian Genocide United Nations convention on genocide defined the term as follows: In the present Convention, genocide means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such: (a) Killing members of the group; (b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; (c) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; (d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group; (e) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group. Clearly the Jewish Holocaust was in the mind of the framers of this convention. However, another extremely troubling incident of genocide in modern times was that of the Armenians living in the Ottoman Empire in what is now modern day Turkey. What occurred was the deaths of between one million and 1.5 million Armenians between 1915 and 1923. Consistent with the definition of genocide, these deaths took place with the clear intent of destroying Armenians as an ethnic group. Deaths occurred through outright massacres. They also occurred as a result of deportations and forced marches which were designed to create conditions leading to death. Deaths comprised up to half of the Armenian population of the Ottoman Empire. Recognition of these atrocities by governments of the world as genocide is of vital importance to all Armenians wherever they may be. This is an important issue for my electorate, which has a large and thriving Armenian community. It is estimated that 40,000 of the 50,000 Armenians in Australia live in the three federal electorates of Bradfield, Bennelong and North Sydney. For Australian Armenians, including those in my electorate of Bradfield, there is a legitimate call for the Australian government to recognise what happened during and after the First World War as genocide. Some 20 countries around the world have declared these events as genocide. These countries include Canada, France and Germany. It is time that the Australian government also recognised what happened in the early decades of the last century as genocide. The horror that occurred to these millions of Armenians, our fellow human beings, reverberates through time, impacting on the whole Armenian community, including the millions of descendants of those who were directly affected. The call that this event be labelled genocide is not to apportion blame to any current government or country but to recognise what happened for what it was and in turn to provide a basis for healing and acceptance by both the Armenian community and the world as a whole, and to provide a basis for continued awareness with a view to ensuring that atrocities of this nature never occur in the future.

271,Mr Dreyfus (Isaacs,"Cabinet Secretary and Parliamentary Secretary for Climatetremendous educational benefits for students and of course supported jobs in our community through the economic downturn in 2009 2010. I will also mention the upcoming launch of the Stephanie Alexander kitchen garden at Aspendale Gardens Primary School. Two weeks ago at the Parkdale Primary SchoolI joined acting principal Leanne Armao and the wider school community to officially open the school's federally funded $3 million multipurpose centre. This remarkable upgrade incorporates a full-sized gymnasium, canteen and learning area and gives students a state-of-the-art facility that was only a pipedream before the announcement of the stimulus package. I would like to acknowledge the past principal of Parkdale Primary School, Craig Johnson, for his dedication not only to the school but to seeing this project through from the planning stage to near completion. Thanks must also be given to acting principal Leanne Armao, school council president Craig Fry, former school council president Lee-Anne Harrison, the staff and the school community for their contribution to their success of this facility. Last week it was Aspendale Primary School's turn to celebrate the official opening of their federally funded $2.3 million dollar library and learning centre. This dedicated facility was the first major construction project undertaken at the school since the 1950s and delivers a new library and six additional classrooms which are tailored towards an open-plan learning style that transforms conventional teaching practices. Credit must go to Aspendale Primary School principal Phil Anthony, to the staff, school council president Cameron Gosling, former school council president Fiona Smith and the whole school community for making this historic upgrade a success. This FridayI will join with Keysborough College principal Heather Lindsay, Acacia Campus principal Andrew Sloane and the wider school community for the opening of the college's $1.97 million science centre. The college is a multicampus school, where over 80 per cent of the students come from a non-English-speaking background. Recent graduates from the college have continued their education in science, engineering and biomedical fields at university. This new science centre is a fantastic addition to the college and will further enhance the educational and employment opportunities for our community. Finally, on 9 DecemberI will join Aspendale Gardens Primary School to launch their $60,000 federally funded Stephanie Alexander kitchen garden. The Stephanie Alexander Kitchen Garden program was made possible by a $12.8 million federal government investment over four years. Students at Aspendale Gardens Primary School have the opportunity to grow, harvest prepare and share fresh food while learning the importance of making healthy choices. Aspendale Gardens Primary School's garden incorporates vegetable plots, fruit trees, a compost system, a worm farm, a hothouse and a chook pen. I know that the students are very excited about their garden and about learning about healthy eating and where their produce comes from. Hasluck Electorate: Schools members we often have the privilege of interacting with schools within our electorates and on 15 November, a Tuesday, I had the privilege of visiting four schools in my electorate with the state Minister for Education, Minister Constable.

272,Mr Wyatt (Hasluck) (16:25,"I rise to speak about schools in the Hasluck electorate. Asclassrooms and looking at the work that they were doing with children whose learning challenges were being met by the enthusiasm of teachers. Then we had an assembly, and I was eventually dragged up to dance. It was afterwards that I felt in my joints the after-effects of doing an Aboriginal dance, but it was a great interaction. The next school was Yule Brook College in Mannington, a school that had a tremendous reputation and whose numbers then dwindled. The school took a different approach and it has become a member of the board of independent public schools. The staff are looking at the way in which they engage their students, provide for them and make learning meaningful. In that context, there was a tremendous attitude and a framework of positivity. I found the same at Clayton View Primary School with Frank Scarfone and his staff. Then we went to Darling Range Sports College, which in the afternoon opened a new stadium that was an election commitment by the coalition during the 2008 state election. The local candidate at the time, Nathan Morton, negotiated with the premier for that stadium because he recognised the tremendous opportunity it provided the sporting college to give these young people high-quality facilities that would enhance their abilities within the sporting arena. But what I want to finish on is the spirit of the teachers in each of those four schools-their absolute enthusiasm to ensure that children within their care and under their teaching were achieving destiny pathways, which kids were talking about. I had the opportunity of talking with children in the classrooms, and the enthusiasm that came from the kids was great. WhatI also saw was evidence from numerous teachers who think outside the square and who want to provide a learning environment that is rich and engaging. When I went to Clayton View Primary School, the last one I visited, the enthusiasm of the students about having the Minister for Education there, and the dialogue they had, was incredible. When I spoke with the teachers during the lunch break I had the opportunity of interacting with a group of people who were totally committed and caring. I acknowledge all of those four schools. the time for constituency statements has concluded. Broadcasting Services Amendment (Review of Future Uses of Broadcasting Services Bands Spectrum) Bill 2011 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. Amendment (Review of Future Uses of Broadcasting Services Bands Spectrum) Bill 2011. This bill seeks to do two things. Firstly, it seeks to amend section 35A of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 to defer the initial statutory review of whether to allocate one or more additional television broadcasting licences. The current act requires a review to be conducted by 1 January 2012. This amendment will defer that date to 1 January 2013 to allow for the completion and reporting of the Convergence Review, which is scheduled to report to the government in early 2012. Secondly, the bill seeks to amend the act to expand the scope of the statutory review to consider possible uses of the unassigned broadcasting services band spectrum available for both television broadcasting services and non-broadcasting services. MAIN COMMITTEE",278,Constituency Statements
273,The Deputy Speaker ( Mrs D'ath,"Order! In accordance with standing order 193,",279,Bills
274,Mr Turnbull (Wentworth) (16:28,"I rise today to speak on the Broadcasting ServicesThe expanded scope of the review will examine any impact that the introduction of new services using the unassigned broadcasting service band spectrum will have on current broadcasting services and consumers. As the statutory review will no longer exclusively examine the commercial television broadcasting services, this bill moves section 35A to the relevant section of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 to part 3, which covers the planning of broadcasting services spectrum. Importantly, the deferred review reporting date will allow, as I noted, for the convergence review to be completed and to report. The convergence review is a very important step in reevaluating the fundamental principles underpinning the media's regulatory environment. It is prudent that any review into the use of the so-called sixth channel broadcasting services band spectrum take into account the convergence review's recommendations. Given the rapid advances in technology-which will be ever thus, I fear, characteristically well ahead of the legislation and the policy and regulation-it is important that our legislation reflect insofar as it can the ever-expanding possibilities for spectrum allocation. It is for this reason that the coalition is supporting this bill. It is a prudent step to provide further time for the convergence review to report. Spectrum is a finite resource and, as such, requires careful planning and management in order to maximise both public and private benefit. There has been a great deal of debate surrounding the question of what to do with the broadcasting services band spectrum or the sixth channel spectrum since the switch-over to digital television was considered in the 1990s. There are currently seven frequency channels of broadcasting services band spectrum that are available to deliver television services. They will be reduced to six once the digital switch is complete and the seven megahertz broadcasting spectrum digital dividend that will exist as a result of the completion of the digital switch-over and spectrum restack also underway will create the opportunity for either a sixth television network or use with new technologies. As I mentioned, this issue of the creation of a sixth channel or a fourth commercial network has been a long-running one. While it has been possible with analog transmission to accommodate a sixth channel, successive governments have deemed the environment not appropriate for the introduction of an additional commercial network. Indeed, the commercial broadcasters have argued-and I suppose you could say that they would argue that, wouldn't they?-that there simply were not the revenues to enable an additional commercial television network to be licensed, at least not the revenues available that would enable it to be profitable and, indeed, to enable the commercial broadcasting industry to continue to fulfil the expensive obligations it has to provide, for example, Australian content and drama and the other obligations that they bear. To what extent these arguments are valid depends a lot on the economic circumstances and the technology. The cost of running a television station from a technical point of view is much reduced; however, the cost of content, if anything, is becoming more expensive. It is a moot point. I recall 20 years ago when the Ten Network went into receivership and I was advising the new owners, Westpac, about how to restructure the Ten Network, which we were able to successfully do. There are a lot of people, a lot of so-called media experts at the time, who said there was not even room for that network to survive and that there was not room in Australia for more than two commercial television networks. A lot of very credible figures made that case. Now looking back that seems absurd. SoI just note in passing that, while I am MAIN COMMITTEE not signing up to the proposition that there is not a commercial basis for an additional commercial television network, I think we have always got to review these assertions of what the economics of the industry are in the circumstances at the time and take into account that everybody has a vested interest-or everyone in the industry does. In 1997 the Howard government allocated the sixth channel spectrum for use by community free-to-air broadcasters and maintained the restriction on the establishment of a fourth television licence. In 1998 this policy was extended until December 2008 and the media reform package introduced in 2006 offered the first signs that there may be some certainty over the use of the sixth channel spectrum with the then prime minister announcing spectrum would be auctioned off to allow for two digital services. This policy was overturned in 2007 and the future of this spectrum has become much less certain. The way Australians now consume news, entertainment and other content is rapidly changing and we have to rethink our basic assumptions about how we access and consume digital content. Regulators are constantly faced with the challenge of creating policy that keeps pace with technological change while taking into account the potential future demand for services. Australians are rapid adopters of new technology and in regard to the means of accessing content we now have more choice than ever before. With the advent of tablets, smartphones, smart TVs, IPTV and, of course, the arrival of cloud computing, the traditional media landscape is almost unrecognisable from what we have today and the environment is only becoming more competitive. We are moving into what I have described elsewhere as arguably a post-channel environment, which has very significant implications for regulation. So much of our protection of Australian content, or our promotion of Australian content, is premised on there being limited number of channels licensed by the government which enable the licensee to broadcast content into the homes of Australians. A condition of having one of those channels is to have so much Australian content, so much drama, so much children's content and so forth. As long as those channels are basically the only ones that were available for most Australians, that regulation had some force. But now in a thoroughly IP world we are in a position where, increasingly, the fundamental business model of free-to-air television is under question. There are people that are saying the business model of free-to-air television is doomed. I do not think there is any evidence-right at the moment anyway-to suggest that that is a realistic prophecy. Having said that, those people who predicted doom for the business model of newspapers ten years ago, and in some cases even five or six years ago, were being criticised as doomsayers. This is a rapidly developing area and we are seeing creative destruction-if that is the right term-on a very large scale. Rupert Murdoch himself famously said that, as I frequently repeat-although on one occasion he told me he did not recall saying this, but I know he did say it. It was a very profound insight. Mr Murdoch said that the internet will destroy more profitable businesses than it will create. That has certainly been so for his company at least. What this means is that we have a very different media environment. What is the appropriate means of regulating or promoting Australian content if the free-to-air channel becomes less and less important as the medium through which Australians view digital content, especially drama and children's programs? One can see free to air becoming increasingly dependent on live events-a grand final or the latest newswhere turning on the program a day later or even a half-hour later is of no benefit to you. What about the other types of cultural content that are so important? MAIN COMMITTEE It is a brave new world. This area of convergence poses huge challenges, most significantly in the area of entertainment-drama in particular. The United States internet movie download company Netflix is now the largest source of internet traffic in North America. That is something to reflect on when we talk about the benefits of the NBN, because the bulk of the bandwidth on the NBN will in fact be used for exactly the same thing: video entertainment. Netflix accounts for 30 per cent of peak downstream traffic in the United States, and similar digital content-that is to say, video entertainment, video streaming and downloads-brings the total up to over 50 per cent. That is what the internet traffic in the United States is largely made up of. Why is that? I am not suggesting that that is the most important part of internet traffic-far from it-but the reason it takes up so much of the traffic is that they are very big files compared to an email or most business data. There are more than 45 million users of IPTV, internet protocol enabled television, worldwide today. That number is rapidly expanding. It is expected that the Asia-Pacific region, our region, will have the largest number of subscribers to IPTV. That means that every television set will become connected to the internet and that a consumer will be able to view a video on YouTube, a movie download, streaming video content, video content delivered by a newspaper website such as the Sydney Morning Herald or the Australian-any video content that can be delivered over the internet. Those channels that used to be fixed windows, the only windows through which you could see content, are now just some among an almost infinite range of windows or portholes through which consumers can see content. In September, the Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy released a discussion paper on the allocation of spectrum. It said that ACMA should take five principles into account when allocating spectrum: 1. allocate spectrum to the highest value use or uses 2. enable and encourage spectrum to move to its highest value use or usesIn other words, ideally not have the government telling people what they should do with the spectrum but allow it to be determined by the market3. use the least cost and least restrictive approach to achieving policy objectives 4. the extent possible, promote both certainty and flexibility 5. balance the cost of interference and the benefits of greater spectrum utilisation. So the convergence review is being asked to report. But none of the questions it is being asked to report on are easy so that we can better understand how these priorities have shifted in the new environment. There are some very important questions, over and above the ones I have canvassed, that need to be addressed. How do we maximise long-term revenue from allocating spectrum in an environment where the licence holders are now competing not only with each other but with other companies delivering content over the internet? The big content providers used to be the free-to-air television stations and Pay TV channels. But it is now, increasingly, what are called the over-the-top companies-Google, Amazon and many others-who are able to deliver content over the internet directly to the consumer as and where the consumer wants it. We have to address how vital services, such as emergency services and police, and railways, who have specialised spectrum requirements, are going to be addressed. They are more dependent on the allocation of spectrum than ever in a wireless world. How do we MAIN COMMITTEE ensure-and this is arguably one of the most challenging issues for the review-that the old objectives of regulation, such as ensuring a level of local content, are maintained when the government no longer has control over the delivery platforms, when we move into a postchannel environment? This is a gigantic issue for the Australian film and television industry and for Australian-content providers generally. As the department's discussion paper notes, digitisation of broadcasting means that a sixth TV channel, for example, could deliver as many as five standard-definition streams, or multichannels. If it used newer coding technologies such as MPEG4, it could deliver even more, possibly up to 10, multichannels. But we have to ask ourselves whether spectrum of this kind, which could be used for so many other applications-it can be used for what we call generically mobile data-should be allocated for broadcasting at all. High-speed broadband is now delivered on a fixed-line basis to most premises, and that will be so whether the government continues with its fibre-to-the-home rollout or whether other, more cost-effective technologies are deployed, as we have recommended, and wireless broadband continues to become more and more compelling because of the functionality of mobility. In that environment, there is a powerful argument for saying that spectrum should, as far as possible, be allocated in such a way that it represents a neutral platform that can be deployed in accordance with market demands, consumers' demands and preferences, for whatever content they seek-whether it is video or some other form of content, and obviously different types of content and videocommunications. All in all, this is a prudent measure, but I think we need to be very alert to the changes that we are seeing in the digital world. There are huge issues associated with this. What we have seen, for example, in the newspaper industry has very big implications for our democracy. We often talk about quality journalism. I think some people think that that means an article in the Australian, the Age, or the Sydney Morning Herald as opposed to something in the Daily Telegraph or the Herald Sun. That is not the case. When we talk about quality journalism we are talking about journalism in the traditional sense, where journalists are paid or employed to go out and make inquiries, do research, ask questions and actually do the legwork, which of course takes time and costs money. There is nothing cheap about good journalism because it takes time and journalists have to be paid. The resources that are available to newspapers are shrinking all the time. They have traditionally been the place where most of our quality journalism has been deployed, because they have had the space. The decline in revenues, in advertising, has been extraordinary. It was not so long ago that we used to talk about the Fairfax broadsheets, the Age and the Sydney Morning Herald, as having 'rivers of gold'-classified rivers of gold. Those classifieds have moved, substantially if not entirely, onto an online environment. The owners of those assets-and they shared this error with newspaper owners everywhere else in the worldfacing the classic dilemma of every incumbent who sees a challenge to their existing franchise, had the choice of whether to move onto the new technological platform themselves and cannibalise their own legacy business, or try to protect their legacy business for as long as they could. But the truth is that, if you take the latter course of action, which is what most publishers have done, you end up with your legacy business being cannibalised; it is just that it is cannibalised by somebody else. MAIN COMMITTEE But the critical thing is that the revenues that were available for advertising in newspapers-the classifieds, almost entirely now, and, increasingly, display advertisingwhile they have not moved in the sense of 100 cents in the dollar to the digital platform, have been replaced by advertising which is much, much cheaper and more cost-effective and, in most cases, has greater functionality as well. Who nowadays would imagine ploughing through pages and pages of newsprint, as we used to, to find a flat to rent or a car to buy or to see if somebody had found your lost goldfish? All of that has gone by the by. That type of challenge is also seen as being there for free-to-air television-although, as I said earlier, I am not as gloomy about their prospects. If there is a question that the media inquiry that the government set up-in a pretty transparently cynical, even by their standards, effort to have a slap at News Ltd-should be looking into, and of course it is something that the convergence review should take into account as well, it is: what are the implications for democracy of the decline of journalism? The Americans are very alert to this. What happens, what is the quality of the democratic process-perhaps not here in the federal parliament but in a state parliament, or in a local council-if there are no longer any journalists, if there is no longer a business model that can support the journalists to do their work: to report on what is going on, to question, to probe, to be a challenge-to undertake the traditional role of the media? Who guards the guardians when there is no business model to support journalism? This is a gigantic issue. We often talk about the anxieties and neuroses of politicians, and every three years or less we face the judgment of our electors and they may well choose, right or wrongly, to throw us out. But the most anxious people in this building are not in the chamber anymore; they are in the press gallery. There are hundreds of journalists up thereand the younger ones are the most anxious-who are asking themselves: 'HaveI signed up to an industry that really has a future? Where is the revenue, where is the business model, that is going to support my job?' And they see the newsroom shrinking. They see their ability to do the research, do the work and actually fulfil the traditional role of journalism being diminished. So this raises big questions for the importance of public broadcasting. Many could make a case that it is now more important than ever because obviously it is not as threatened by this, being supported by the taxpayer. So these are important, vital issues. We should, and it is appropriate to, put off this question of the allocation of the so-called sixth channel spectrum. But the issue that we need to turn our minds to as parliamentarians-and I think all Australians need to think about this-is: what price our democracy when journalism no longer has a business model that can support it? We tend to assume that everything about the internet and the digital world is good. Most of it is good, but there are some very big implications. Until now we have had the dogged determination of hundreds of journalists working away, holding us to account, holding lots of other people to account, sometimes getting it right, sometimes getting it wrong, but nonetheless playing their role in our democracy. Do we really imagine that that can be replaced by a world of Twitterers-or tweeps, as we Twitterers are called-bloggers and Facebookers? Is that really going to cut the mustard? Is that going to be enough? We have read a lot about social media being a great adjunct and addition to news gathering, but is it a substitute for it? Can it replace it, or will we just be left in a sort of wilderness of opinion? We support this bill, but it raises issues of great moment and issues that I trust all of us in this place will be focusing on. It gets back to what Jefferson said. He of course had plenty of MAIN COMMITTEE disagreements with newspapers. They were even more pungent in those days than they are today. He said that, if he were given a choice between a government with no newspapers or newspapers with no government, he would choose newspapers every time. I think all of us recognise the important role of the press and of freedom of the press, but we also have to recognise that the business model that has supported it-whether it is the press in terms of newsprint or free-to-air television news-is under very, very serious threat. There are big issues for our democracy in the area of convergence. Ms ROWLAND (Greenway) (16:57): I would like to thank the member for Wentworth for sharing his quote from Mr Murdoch. It is interesting that Mr Murdoch viewed the internet as a business rather than as a social investment or an investment in people and communities. It brings me back to the point that the internet is but one application of high-speed broadband rather than the end of it. Also, the member for Wentworth mentioned the importance of technology-neutral platforms in the context of this bill, the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Review of Future Uses of Broadcasting Services Bands Spectrum) Bill 2011. I will discuss this further on. There is a clear preference for and a clear recognition of Long Term Evolution, LTE, abiding in these amendments, which I will discuss later. I rise in support of this bill, which essentially proposes a revenue-neutral extension of a statutory time frame for a review by the minister of whether to allocate one or more commercial television licences in the broadcasting services bands. This extension is to allow for the findings of the convergence review to be received and considered prior to this ministerial review, which is a logical course of policy deliberation, on which I will also elaborate. Despite the seemingly innocuous nature of these amendments, the effect of these provisions reflects the profound and ongoing evolution of our spectrum management, its implications for the broadcasting space and potential future uses of spectrum in the realisation of the digital dividend. In addition to the extension of the statutory time frame by one year, for a review to be conducted before 1 January 2013, under the proposed amendments the bill also amends the scope of that review to reflect the multiple and often competing uses for the unassigned broadcasting services bands spectrum. This is a logical and desirable amendment. It is consistent with the current convergence review being conducted, which is consulting on the critical issues associated with the ongoing designation, allocation and use of this precious spectrum for future generations. At the outset, I think it is vital we acknowledge the importance of these provisions for telecommunications, radiocommunications, broadcasting and indeed a future convergent communications environment as we shift to platform, technology and content neutrality. We have one opportunity to get this right and, as I have previously commented on in other relevant legislation in the radiocommunications space, there is one lesson that we must adhere to regardless of where we stand in the policy debate, whether we favour future uses for mobile wireless data or indeed commercial television licensing-that is, we must never underestimate the future. In Australia we have an enviable reputation for our regulatory environment, which is by and large globally recognised for its robust nature and logical development. As we approach Long Term Evolution, LTE, and reach the point where we must decide how we maximise the reutilisation of the sweet spot in the radiocommunications spectrum following the analog restack, we must do so in the most informed and forward-looking way possible as well as extract the maximum value, and MAIN COMMITTEE consistency with the public interest, for what I believe to be the most precious of our scarce resources: spectrum, a finite concept which is used but not consumed and which, when allocated, confers enjoyment of both flexibility and certainty for its licence holder, and the value of its use can be optimised. I would like to turn briefly to what this bill does. In addition to amending the time frame and the scope of the ministerial review to be conducted under section 35A, it is relevant to note that these provisions will shift to part 3 of the Broadcasting Services Act, which deals with the planning of the broadcasting services bands-that is, it reflects the fact that it will not necessarily be the case for this review to be confined to the allocation of additional commercial television broadcasting licences and, indeed, this is a reflection of a ministerial consideration that will be made in a convergent environment rather than limited to one aspect of broadcasting licensing. Madam Acting Deputy Speaker, it may look innocuous, but it was always perplexing for me, as a practitioner examining these elements of the legislation, to have these provisions located in part 4 of the act rather than in part 3, for how could one enable reallocation of broadcasting services bands for anything other than a BSB designation? I know it would not occupy front of mind for many people, but it is very pleasing for me to see that this has finally been resolved. The Broadcasting Services Act sets out a process for the allocation of new licences for certain services defined as being capable of using broadcasting services bands spectrum. There are also limits on the actions of the regulator, with the ACMA not permitted to allocate a new commercial television broadcasting licence in an area where there are already three in existence, unless the minister has firstly conducted a review. I would now like to turn to the nature of the broadcasting services bands because it is useful to provide context for these amendments. The Broadcasting Services Act defines 'broadcasting services bands' to mean: (a) that part of the radiofrequency spectrum that is designated under subsection 31(1) of the Radiocommunications Act 1992 as being primarily for broadcasting purposes; and (b) that part of the radiofrequency spectrum that is designated under subsection 31(1A) of the Radiocommunications Act 1992 as being partly for the purpose of digital radio broadcasting services and restricted datacasting services. That is, the broadcasting services bands are currently defined in a non-convergent term either for broadcasting for digital radio or for datacasting. This is relevant because, under the proposed amendments, section 35A will instead operate to facilitate a review of this usage under the broadcasting services bands. It is also important to note that the amendments do not foreclose the possibility of any decision being made on its future use, including that of additional commercial television services. Although the scope of the review will be broadened, no predetermination is made as a result. The term 'designation' is used in the definition of the broadcasting services bands, and it is important to note the relationship of this term with that of the allocation process. Broadcasting services bands spectrum is only considered as available for allocation if the regulator, the ACMA, makes a determination in relation to that spectrum. Under these amendments, it is clear that the new section 35A review is not constructed to revisit any availability of BSB spectrum for national or commercial television broadcasting services in an area, nor those parts of the BSB spectrum that will be relocated as part of the digital dividend process that is MAIN COMMITTEE set out under the Radiocommunications Act. This distinction is relevant in understanding the precise nature of the spectrum management framework, the role of the minister and the role of the regulator in this regard. This distinction, which is picked up in the Convergence Review materials, also highlights how Australia, like many parts of the world finding themselves in the process of convergence, has different planning regimes for spectrum that is used for broadcasting versus spectrum that is used for other services such as telecommunications, including wireless broadband services. Convergence increasingly means that this once-logical rigid separation is questionable. The conduct of the review to be undertaken by the minister under section 35A is also set out in the proposed amendments. These are mandatory yet nonexhaustive, with provision made for any relevant matters to be taken into account. The specified list of requirements includes the objects of the Broadcasting Services Act, planning criteria, spectrum availability and the impact of new television or other services on both the broadcasting services bands as well as on consumers. I would like to turn to the issue of convergence and its relevance to these amendments. The phenomenon of convergence was once actually a hotly debated point, and I recall in the Productivity Commission's landmark review of telco regulation in 2000 that the concept was indeed hotly contested between stakeholders about what it was, how it could be defined, what its impact would be and what regulatory approaches should be adopted, if any, to address it. Today, of course, it is the subject of understanding how our past regulatory distinctions between elements such as spectrum that is allocated for broadcasting services and spectrum allocated for other purposes such as mobile data were distinguished on the basis of carriage and connectivity versus content provision. Today we accept that a delivery platform does not define or confine content provision. As the Convergence Review papers point out, this has led to a blurring of the distinction in how spectrum is regulated. While the allocation of spectrum for television is currently regulated by the Radiocommunications Act, viewing the same content via a catch-up service is primarily regulated by the Broadcasting Services Act. In a convergent world there is, again, a question as to whether these separate spectrum management regimes are appropriate. It is also useful before examining the bill in the context of the Convergence Review to take a snapshot of how far the Broadcasting Services Act has evolved since 1992. Back then, some of its key elements were five channels of free-to-air broadcasting and Sky Channel narrowcasting in pubs and clubs, and the subscription broadcasting moratorium was expiring. Now the services relevant to the Broadcasting Services Act oversight include five free-to-air channels plus digital HD or SD simulcast and multichannels, over 100 channels of subscription television, interactive services, video on demand, streamed video and downloaded video. I would like to make mention of the structure and substance of the Convergence Review currently being undertaken, which continues this methodical and stakeholder driven process of informing crucial policy in this area. The Convergence Review Committee has released a series of discussion papers ranging from licensing, content and competition to community standards. In particular, I would like to focus on discussion paper 2, which is highly relevant to this bill, concerning spectrum allocation and management. The introductory comments of this paper reflect my earlier remarks concerning the importance of sound spectrum management policy. It says: MAIN COMMITTEE Spectrum is a scarce national resource. It represents a key platform for the delivery of media content and communications. How this spectrum is planned and managed by government will have an impact on the achievement of the objectives reflected in the principles for the convergent communications environment. The Convergence Review paper I have mentioned also highlights the five regulatory principles which the ACMA has adopted in its spectrum management undertakings and in providing guidance to stakeholders about the regulatory approach to this spectrum management. In the context of the above regulatory approach, key issues for the Convergence Review include the following questions: how could public interest considerations relating to the carriage of broadcasting content be dealt with in a converged spectrum management approach-in the amendments to the 15-year spectrum grants for the Radiocommunications Act last year, I noted that there was no jurisprudence in this area on what constituted the public interest under those similar provisions; what are the possible implications for spectrum management policy of the enhanced efficiency of broadcast spectrum resulting from digitisation; how might pricing for broadcasting spectrum and related licences be dealt with; and how might the rollout of digital radio in regional Australia and the allocation of the sixth television channel be managed in the new environment? Consideration of all these questions are, again, all instructive in illustrating the sound policy process which underlies the amendments before us. In conclusion, the sixth channel, channel A, has been debated since 2000 and certainly even before that. In the 2006 amendments, we had the auction process announced for two digital services, channel A being for in-home narrowcasting and channel B for mobile TV. We have, of course, progressed since then and in January last year we had the DBCDE discussion paper which canvassed the option for the digital dividend. We found stakeholder differences-which I think we all expected to find-between, for example, community broadcasting, free TV, subscription television and mobile operators. In June last year the minister announced that the contiguous block in the high-range UHF band would be released. The ACMA consultation on the digital dividend, whatever the outcome, clearly favours recognition of long-term evolution. The Convergence Review is logical and sensible. Despite all these questions I have discussed, one thing is certain: the dynamic and ever-changing nature of this environment is both predictable, because it actually will change, and very exciting, because we do not know precisely how it will change. I commend the bill to the House, because it is a logical process of enabling the minister to prudently consider the outcomes of the Convergence Review before a decision is made. Services Amendment (Review of Future Users of Broadcasting Services Bands Spectrum) Bill 2011. The key purpose of this bill is to seek to amend section 35A of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 to defer the initial statutory review of whether to allocate one or more additional commercial television broadcasting licences. The current provision requires the minister to cause a review to be conducted by 1 January next year. The amendment will defer the date to 1 January 2013. We are told that the rationale for this is allowing for the completion and reporting from the Convergence Review, which is scheduled to report to the government in early 2012. MAIN COMMITTEE",279,Bills
275,Mr Fletcher (Bradfield) (17:10,"I am pleased to rise to speak on the BroadcastingThe bill also amends section 35A to reframe and expand the scope of the statutory review so that the review will consider possible uses of the unassigned broadcasting services bands spectrum available for both television broadcasting services and non-broadcasting services. The expanded scope of the review will also examine any impact the introduction of new services using the unassigned broadcasting services bands spectrum will have on current broadcasting services and consumers. I will make three points in the brief time available to me. Firstly, I will express the view that the amendment, as far as it goes, is a sensible one and is supported by the coalition. Secondly, I will talk about the broader context of this review process. As the member for Greenway has just noted, the review is part of a broader process under which the so-called digital dividend is being realised through the transition of television broadcasting from analogue to digital. With the greater efficiencies permitted by digital broadcasting, spectrum is freed up both within the broadcasting services band and outside the broadcasting services band. Much of that spectrum has already been reallocated, and clearly this bill addresses the question of the remaining spectrum, so I will talk about the importance of that spectrum and of the reallocation process, particularly in the context of wireless broadband. Thirdly, I will reflect on some of the observations that have been made by the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy in this area, particularly concerning wireless broadband in recent years. I turn firstly to the basis on which the coalition considers that these amendments are broadly sensible and ought to be supported. The need for a review is not contentious. Spectrum will become available as a result of the completion of the digital switch-over and the spectrum re-stack process. That freed-up spectrum will be available for a number of potential purposes. There has been debate surrounding this issue, certainly for as long as I have had the privilege of being involved in the communications sector, which includes my time serving on the staff of the then communications minister in the late 1990s. At that time, this process commenced-the Howard government in 1997 allocated the remaining spectrum to community free-to-air broadcasters and maintained the restriction on the establishment of a fourth commercial television licence. Subsequently, there was an announcement in 2006 that spectrum would be auctioned for two digital services. However, this was overturned by the current government following the 2007 election. Since that time, the future use of the spectrum has been uncertain. The Convergence Review Committee was established by the government in 2010 to look at the future use of the broadcasting services bands spectrum and the purposes for which it might be used. The central logic of the bill embodying this amendment is that it does not make sense for the statutory review to be conducted by the deadline presently specified in the act in the light of the fact that, as of the deadline, the convergence review will not have reported. There are complex issues facing the commercial television industry and, more broadly, the communications sector. In coming to grips with some of those complex issues, the input from the convergence review will clearly be important in determining the optimal use of this spectrum. As the shadow minister has already pointed out, the historical divisions between broadcasting spectrum and other kinds of spectrum are now hopelessly outdated. It is clear that this spectrum and many other kinds of spectrum can be used for a whole range of MAIN COMMITTEE communications services of many different types, all of which are based upon fundamentally consistent underlying technologies. Therefore, the legislative premise that the different kinds of spectrum are to be dealt with in wholly different ways is also completely outdated and the amendment to give effect to a capacity to consider non-broadcasting uses of this spectrum is highly sensible. That brings me to my second point. The amending legislation here, together with the broader public policy process, which was referred to by the member for Greenway earlier and concerns the realisation of the digital dividend, should remind us of the fundamental importance and value of spectrum for a range of communications services, particularly a range of broadband services. It is evident, as you look around the world, that it is accepted that the use of radio frequency spectrum for the delivery of wireless broadband services is considered to be of the highest importance. Interestingly, in the United States, the Federal Communications Commission has recently given its full support to the development of mobile broadband in that market. The chairman of the Federal Communications Commission has been quoted in recent days, speaking at the GSMA Mobile Asia Congress, as saying the following: The Commission is making a concerted effort to make sure that mobile broadband operators have enough spectrum to support the increasing number of smartphones and tablets coming online. This is not something that anyone anticipated, planned for or predicted several years ago but it is a very significant issue, particularly in large densely populated markets with smartphone and tablet penetration. We need to tackle the looming spectrum crunch by dramatically increasing the amount of spectrum. I venture to suggest that one of the issues which will be absolutely central to this review, as it is conducted under the amended terms set out in proposed section 35A, will be the capacity to use this extra quantity of spectrum for additional mobile broadband purposes. Of course, that would come on top of the program of work the government already has underway to make available additional spectrum under the digital dividend process through an auction process, with the expectation that the bidders are likely to include all of the existing mobile communications and mobile broadband operators. There has been an explosion in the growth of wireless broadband services. Consumers have taken up these services with enormous enthusiasm, and the government's stated program of conducting auctions recognises the enormous consumer enthusiasm for wireless broadband services. I think there is very little disagreement on any side of the House that wireless spectrum and wireless broadband are of enormous importance. That brings me to my third point. The Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy has made some reflections about the use of wireless for the delivery of broadband services. For example, I draw the House's attention to what Senator Conroy had to say about OPEL, the network that was going to deliver wireless broadband services under the Howard government's Broadband Connect program in a contract announced in mid-2007. Senator Conroy described OPEL on repeated occasions as the 'dog of the product'. This is puzzling given that OPEL proposed to use the same spectrum, the 2.3 gigahertz and 3.4 gigahertz spectrum, as is now to be used for the wireless broadband network to be provided as part of the National Broadband Network. MAIN COMMITTEE Indeed, Senator Conroy's confusing and conflicting views about wireless broadband were also revealed in an interview on The 7.30 Report in 2007, where he said about the OPEL network: If you pick up your cordless phone while you’re using your Internet, your line can drop out. If you use your microwave, your line will drop out. There is a puzzling contradiction between these high-minded consumer warnings being given by Senator Conroy in 2007. I am sure they were motivated purely by a desire to ensure that consumers were not misled, because apparently wireless broadband was deeply flawed-even to the extent that, if your microwave was turned on, you were not able to use wireless broadband-and that the purity of their motivation was only slightly tempered by their enthusiasm, which they have maintained in government with the National Broadband Network, for wireless broadband. I repeat that the spectrum proposed to be used and the speed-a 12-megabit per second peak speed-now proposed by the government under the National Broadband Network are absolutely identical to the OPEL product which was so remorselessly bucketed by Minister Conroy, the then opposition spokesman, during the 2007 election. Indeed, it was not just the opposition spokesman on broadband who appeared to have a conflicted view, because the then opposition leader, on 19 June 2007, had this to say: People in regional and rural areas deserve every bit as good a service as those in the big cities. Our fibre-optic-to-the-node plan will offer high-speed broadband to 98 per cent of Australians regardless of where they live. When you look at some of the technical deficiencies in wireless and problems in terms of being able to access speeds of 12 megabits per second using wireless then we believe we have hit upon the right technology. In other words, the member for Griffith was then arguing that fibre was the only sufficient technology and that wireless, going out as far as 98 per cent, was inadequate-a view that the government seems to have changed markedly since it has come to the position that wireless is the appropriate technology to use in the 93rd percentile. I will make my position on this perfectly clear, lest I be verballed, as is regrettably common when it comes to dealing with the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy. I am a strong supporter of wireless broadband, and I have been a consistent supporter of wireless broadband, but the point I am drawing to the attention of the House is that the minister has displayed no such consistency. For shabby, short-term political purposes, he spent most of 2007 ruthlessly bucketing wireless as a technology for the delivery of broadband. Suddenly, in the last couple of years, he has had a road-to-Damascus conversion and now accepts the proposition that wireless is a vitally important technology for the use of broadband. Presumably, he would no longer assert, as he did on 10 August 2010, commenting on the coalition's policy at the last election to use wireless as a component for the delivery of broadband that 'it will consign Australia to the digital dark ages'. It is truly confusing to try to understand what the minister for broadband actually believes. I really do not advise anybody to look for intellectual or logical consistency in the observations delivered by the minister for broadband. They tend to be influenced heavily by expediency. I do make the point that the legislation before the House today, and indeed other aspects of the government's legislative program, are predicated correctly on the view that wireless spectrum is an asset of great value and that we ought to think very carefully about MAIN COMMITTEE how we can best optimise, in the public interest, the use of the limited spectrum resources that we have. And as part of that we ought to consider very carefully the use of spectrum, which presently falls within the broadcasting services ban. I have no doubt the review will consider that issue and it will weigh up the competing technologies which are available, and the optimal uses of that spectrum and the optimal regulatory settings, so as to facilitate that spectrum going to its highest value use. Consistency in politics and policy is a fine thing. As I have demonstrated, that is not something that you would look to from the current Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, but on this occasion we are nevertheless delighted to support his legislation. need to pick up on some of the comments made by the member for Bradfield. The issue he exhorted us to consider is that he did not wish to be verballed, but I think he did a pretty good job on verballing the minister and the government. Whereas those opposite have placed enormous emphasis on the benefit of wireless in the delivery of broadband in this country, we have sought moderation. By that I mean that as it currently stands today, and until there are potential improvements down the track-we are seeing the rollout of 4G networks that are promising much better speeds than what we have now-wireless technology has a place, but not overwhelmingly in the delivery of data or the delivery of broadband, particularly in heavily urbanised areas. Where we have sought to bring wireless or looking at putting that into the mix where network constraints, for instance the actual rollout of fibre, would not necessarily be the best method of getting broadband to people, wireless would be best in other parts of the country. In particular wireless will certainly fill a gap in regional areas where, for example, wireless does meet a problem in heavily urbanised areas where a great number of consumers on the network at any time, using a wireless network, will find that the speeds that they believe they are entitled to do not match reality. We have certainly not ruled out the use of wireless-we would incorporate it within the network-we just do not believe in the overall reliance upon it as those opposite would beBradfield leaves we will not have a quorum and we will fall over so, if you need to leave, wait until someone comes to replace you. So either get the phone and ask them to send someone up or do not move. My apologies for the interruption to the member for Chifley. about being verballed on wireless and I think it is important we set the record straight. We have had a very stirring defence of the OPEL contract. At no point in time, and it was borne out certainly in the Joint Standing Committee on the National Broadband Network hearings held in Sydney, did the 19 broadband plans put forward by those opposite ever have a costbenefit analysis attached to anything they proposed, yet they are seeking to defend here and now the value of what they had previously put forward as valid and worthy public policy. We are certainly trying to fix once and for all, in a major way, the gaping hole that has existed in providing uniform access to the provision of high quality broadband-fast broadband. We are doing it. But within the context of what we are discussing here today this all gets caught up in the matters we are currently concentrating on in the course of this debate.

It is being reflected already, or noted, that it will amend 35A to reform the scope of the statutory review so it will consider the possible use of the broadcasting services band spectrum. Putting all that dry talk aside, what this is looking at in simple terms is how we allocate additional commercial TV broadcasting licences. There was a time in this country when such a debate would have caused a great amount of discussion in the public domain. Anything to do with the delivery of TV-who was controlling it, what we actually watched on TV-would have provoked a great deal of discussion. Where we are at right now is a reflection of how far things have moved, and a lot of this has moved as a result of people being able to exercise different content decisions-that is, the way they actually receive information, the way they interact in the public space through the internet. It has been an incredible thing to witness and we are truly a part of what right now is a phenomenal turn of events. We are looking at a whole range of mechanisms as to how we get information and how we relate to the outside world. Obviously this legislation that is before us is in part a recognition that there are a lot of examinations taking place right now about how technology is changing the way information is delivered. The minister is convening the Convergence Review, which is an exceptionally timely review because it is looking at the policy and the regulatory framework as it exists within a rapidly changing industry environment. That review, being chaired by Glen Boreham, would look at how to best match policy regulation within the environment. AgainI reflect on the fact that we are seeing amazing changes in terms of diversity of choice. Something that was mentioned earlier was the value of IPTV and other platforms available to people so that they can access what they view, whether it be through iTunes or through Netflix, and also the way that people may use the internet even for things such as listening to radio or being able to access other forms of media. In these debates, particularly in terms of the impact of technology on society, we generally find that people are pessimists, believing that technology will have a detrimental effect, or optimists. And then there is a whole bunch of people who just get on with life and adapt to the technology around them. I stand as an optimist, believing that technology continually seeks to improve what people have available to them and that people willingly embrace that new form of technology. People are now actually calling for greater diversity of choice in what they have available to them. You can see it, for example, in digital TV. Broadcasters are recognising that people do want choice. They have seen it through pay TV and the multiplicity of channels available to viewers there. It is happening in digital TV and it is happening on the internet. The member for Wentworth was reflecting earlier on the predictions of gloom and doom that had been made at a given point in time in relation to one particular broadcaster, Channel 10. He indicated that he did not necessarily believe that gloom and doom should be applied to Channel 10, and he was right. But he also indicated concern about what might happen in delivery of analysis through news. What happens to people who are journalists when the business model comes under increasing pressure within media outlets, particularly in the print media? What happens to the quality of analysis? What happens to the delivery of news and the way things are reported on? I have to say that view on what is happening in print conflicts with his rather optimistic view about broadcasting and what happened to broadcasters in years past. I am surprised by his degree of pessimism. If it is true that in a dynamic market people MAIN COMMITTEE will fill the void when there is demand, then I think we will see evolution. We will not see the collapse of journalism as we know it today; we will see the use of technology combined with people's demand for quality. As a result of that we will see things evolve. People are themselves taking control of the way in which content is delivered. For example, most people have taken up the option of what is available on YouTube. I do not necessarily subscribe to the quality that exists via that channel, but what it has done is challenge the notion that the only way you get content is if you stick with TV and that commercial TV or public broadcasters are the only ones able to satisfy an appetite or a demand that might exist for content. That is effectively what is being recognised within the convergence review, which I referred to earlier. It is currently calling for public submissions and is looking at this whole issue. I will not go through all of the principles here but the noteworthy ones are, for example: 1. Citizens and organisations should be able to communicate freely, and where regulation is required, it should be the minimum needed to achieve a clear public purpose. 2. Australians should have access to and opportunities for participation in a diverse mix of services, voices, views and information. 3. The communications and media market should be innovative and competitiveand, importantly6. Australians should have access to news and information of relevance to their local communities, including locally generated content. The issue of content and the point that I made earlier about the pressures being borne by the current business models that exist within the media industry mean that we are having to make really hard decisions about how we will maintain local content quotas, the way in which we expect content will be provided, and how we will satisfy local demand while recognising that there is a great diversity of choice and expectation by people that they will be able to either hop onto the internet and look at what is happening on TV or listen to something different on radio and be able to participate in that. So it is not just a one-way street. There is also recognition within the convergence review that our regulatory framework in the past has operated within silos. I liken it to former Prime Minister Paul Keating, when he was Treasurer back in 1986, commenting on the fact that you could be either a prince of print or a queen of screen. That debate on cross-media ownership back in the 1980s really reflected our view back then that there was regulation for print and regulation for broadcast and that there was not much convergence. In fact, the convergence review itself recognises that there is a great degree of mixing of mediums and that people will need to cross over a variety of mediums to exist in the modern world. Certainly that review, which is expected to be brought down in March next year, will be critical in shaping the way that we respond to technology in a policy and regulatory sense. The bill before us now is sensible. I think we on the government side welcome the opposition's support for it, because it is common sense to wait for the convergence review to finish and report to government and to then make decisions about the future use of spectrum. As others have remarked in this debate, the spectrum itself is of critical importance to the country. Decisions about allocation need to be made sensibly. We need to balance a range of interests, and certainly in terms of whether an additional channel comes online we do need to make that decision in the context of what might come up in the convergence review. MAIN COMMITTEE Certainly, and at the end of it all, I am very optimistic about the way in which we need to balance a whole range of decisions-the types of issues being dealt with in the convergence review and the power of technology that will further liberate what Australians can do locally but also what they are able to showcase to the world. Obviously people want to know where they are getting their information from, the interests that are behind that information and the transparency required. Ultimately, people want to have a lot more control and choice and they want to have the freedom to express themselves and take advantage of technology that is available a lot more these days. Certainly this bill is very mindful of that, as is the convergence review. I am looking forward to the release of the convergence review and, ultimately, the response to the review. I commend this bill to the House. Transport) (17:40): I am very pleased to thank members for their contributions to the debate. The Broadcasting Services Amendment (Review of Future Uses of Broadcasting Services Bands Spectrum) Bill 2011 provides for the conduct of a review of the possible uses of the last remaining channel of broadcasting spectrum, known as the sixth channel, by 1 January 2013. This is an important review and one that should be conducted after the convergence review has been completed in the first half of 2012.

Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave) Legislation Amendment Bill 2011 Second Reading Transport) (17:42): I present the explanatory memorandum and I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill is to make key reforms to give effect to proposals, developed by an industry working party, to reform the portable long service leave arrangements in the black coal mining industry. This group comprised representatives from the New South Wales Minerals Council Ltd, the Queensland Resources Council, the CFMEU Mining and Energy Division, the Electrical Trades Union, the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union, the Association of Professional Engineers, Scientists and Managers Australia, the New South Wales Colliery Officials Association and the Mine Managers Association of Australia. I commend the participants on their collaborative approach and their commitment to the future success of the unique black coal mining industry long service leave scheme. Employees in the black coal mining industry have accessed portable long service leave entitlements under the terms of federal awards since 1949 which in turn were funded by an excise on coal production. Since 1993 the funding of entitlements has been through an employer levy scheme and administered by the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave MAIN COMMITTEE",292,Bills

280,Mr Albanese (Grayndler,"Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure andFunding) Corporation. Employers are reimbursed when they have made a payment to an eligible employee in respect of their entitlement. A priority concern of the industry working party was to ensure that the long service leave entitlement applied universally in the black coal mining industry. Amendments were made in 2009 to address this concern-extending the preserved award based long service leave entitlements to all the eligible employees who did not otherwise have an award derived long service leave entitlement from 1 January 2010. While the 2009 amendments addressed the priority concerns of the working party this bill seeks to further these reforms by providing for the remaining proposals of the working party. This bill legislates the minimum long service leave entitlement for all eligible employees in the black coal mining industry based on the precursor award entitlement. Provision is made for all eligible employees, whether full time, part time or casual, to accrue long service leave in the black coal mining industry. An eligible employee will be entitled to long service leave when they have completed a period, or periods, of qualifying service totalling eight years or more. A key imperative of the working party proposals was to improve the operation of the scheme so that the amounts that employers are reimbursed from the Coal Mining Industry Long Service Leave Fund in respect of long service leave payments more closely correspond to the amounts that they have paid into the fund by way of levy. The bill therefore changes the basis on which the levy is imposed and facilitates changes to the employer reimbursement arrangements. This bill provides for a greater compliance role for the corporation. The corporation will have the power to require persons to produce information or documents and standing to pursue alleged contraventions of a civil penalty provision on behalf of the Commonwealth. Additional penalty provisions have been included and existing penalty levels have been increased in line with contemporary standards. This bill also makes changes to the structure and representation of the board of directors of the corporation to better reflect the current industry representative status of certain employeerepresentative and employer-representative groups, and to increase the terms of directors from two to four years. The bill also establishes a regime for transition from the award-derived long service leave scheme to the new statutory long service leave scheme established by this bill. The government is very pleased to facilitate these amendments proposed by the industry working party, and I am very proud to have had the unexpected opportunity to move the second reading of this bill in the House of Representatives. There is no doubt that this bill will provide significant benefit to both employers and employees in the black coal mining industry-employers, who contribute such a great deal of wealth to this nation; and employees, who work so hard to deliver that wealth for their families but also in the national interest. I commend this bill to the House and I congratulate the CFMEU Mining and Energy Division, other unions and indeed employer groups who have been here this week to indicate the broad cross-sector support that there is for this important legislation. operation of the Main Committee this afternoon. MAIN COMMITTEE",295,Bills
281,The Deputy Speaker (Ms Ae Burke,"I thank the minister for assisting the smoothLeave granted for second reading debate to continue immediately. Ms LEY (Farrer) (17:47): The coalition agrees with the government around the intent of the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave) Legislation Amendment Bill 2011 and has no arguments with it. I do not propose, therefore, to repeat the information provided by the minister, but I will simply make a brief summary for the purposes of our side of the House. Following award modernisation in the black coal mining industry, long service leave entitlements were deducted from employees' wages as part of their award provisions. Entitlement to long service leave had been tied to time worked in the industry, as opposed to time worked with a single employer, since 1949, with recognition given to the fact that individual employers should not be required to fund the full long service leave entitlement when the employee may in fact have been working for a number of employers over the years. It is interesting-if I might just refer to the Bills Digest-to reflect on the history of the legislation. During his second reading speech on the State Grants Coal Mining Industry Long Service Leave Bill 1949, on 24 October 1949, the then Minister for Defence and Minister for Post-War Construction, John Dedman MP, stated: … it would be impracticable for the cost of the leave to be made the full financial responsibility of the individual employers … During their working lives, many employees have changed from one employer to another, and it would be inequitable to place the cost of all such employment solely upon present day employers. Some collieries are not financially capable of meeting the additional cost involved by the leave. Many employees have been employed in the past by colliery companies that are no longer in existence. Moreover, employers would be reluctant to employ men with previous employment in the industry because of the additional liability for long service leave that their employment would involve. This would tend to make labour less mobile than is desirable within the industry, and could result in a loss of skilled labour … Broadly, the scheme now placed before the House in this interdependent set of three measures is that an excise of 6d. a ton will be placed upon coal produced by those employees in the coal-mining industry who will receive the benefit of long service leave. The proceeds of this excise will be placed in the Commonwealth trust fund and from this fund the Treasurer of the Commonwealth will be empowered to make grants to the States. That pretty well sums up the background to why we are here today and the history of this slightly peculiar piece of legislation, given that it does not apply to all other industries. In order to promote workforce mobility and a more equitable system, a determined excise was placed in a Commonwealth trust to fund the liability when it came due for each coal miner. This bill seeks to reinstate the pre-award entitlement to leave, also extending the entitlement to long service leave to casual and part-time workers. Since its introduction, there have been some significant changes in the administration of and methodology for long service leave in the industry. Employers now pay a payroll levy of 2.7 per cent, paid into the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave) Funding Corporation. Yet award based long service leave was terminated under the Fair Work system. So provision was made via the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave) Funding Amendment Act 2009 to maintain long service leave entitlements through the payroll levy and Commonwealth transfers to the corporation on behalf of all eligible employees, including non-award employees, from 1 January 2010. This bill will provide greater certainty to employees and employers; and, as noted by the minister, industry, unions, employers and employees are all wholeheartedly in support of it. The coalition also echoes that support. I thank the House. MAIN COMMITTEE second time. I call the ever-efficient member for Makin! Mining Industry (Long Service Leave) Legislation Amendment Bill 2011. As the minister quite rightly has pointed out, this bill is the result of a working party having done some work in respect to the recommendations and the reforms that are obviously being debated today and form the basis of this legislation. Having said that, it was also interesting to listen to the minister's second reading speech and the comments he made in respect to it, because long service leave per se is a matter that this government and our side of politics have been very much in support of for many, many years. In fact, others would and might properly say that here in Australia we have long service provisions that many other countries in the world would dearly like to replicate. At the end of the day, it is all about ensuring that people who work within industries are properly remunerated for their service with those industries, and part of that remuneration comes in the form of long service leave and similar entitlements that go with any employment. This particular bill does make some key reforms to the black coal mining industry long service leave scheme. These are, as the minister quite rightly pointed out, important reforms that have been developed by the industry working party and, as I understand it, have the support of key employer and employee associations in the coal mining industry. I think that that is an important point that we need to make: the reforms do have the support of both employers and employees. It is not often that we see that being the case. In fact, all too often we see conflict between the employer and the employees in terms of what they believe is fair and appropriate compensation. But, in this case, it seems that we do have agreement between both parties, and that is commendable. It is commendable because it is my view and always has been my view that, where you get cooperation between employers and employees, you ultimately get the best outcomes. I note that, in some European countries, many companies have embraced that principle in a very strong way, where they have tried to come up with a structure for their industries whereby the employees share in any profits that are made by the employer. It seems to me that, if we could replicate that in Australia-more so than what is currently the case-it might be a good thing both for the profitability of the companies and for industrial relations more broadly and more generally. These reforms include a legislated minimum long service leave entitlement; an improved approach to how long the service leave levy is imposed, to more closely align amounts paid into the fund with reimbursement amounts; a greater compliance role for the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave Funding) Corporation; minor changes to the structure and representation of the Coalmining Industry (Long Service Leave Funding) Corporation board; and transitional arrangements to facilitate the transition from the award long service leave rules to the new statutory entitlement rules. The changes benefit both employers and employees, as I have said, and are vital to the ongoing success of this industry. The last point I would simply make about this matter is that right now, as I speak, we are debating the minerals resources rent tax in the other chamber. One issue that is absolutely relevant to that debate is that it applies to both the coal and iron ore industry sectors. It has also been alleged by speakers opposite, time and time again, that the future of the coal industry will in fact be impacted as a result of policies that this government is introducing.

In fact, quite the opposite seems to be occurring. But, more importantly, to have this legislation coming through the parliament at the same time as those claims are being made. I believe is quite significant and, quite frankly, highlights that the views being expressed by members opposite about the possible damage to the coal industry as a result of the other legislation are simply not borne out by the representatives of the coal industry themselves.

Service Leave) Legislation Amendment Bill 2011 I note that there is broad industry and union support for the legislation. I, too, am happy to support this bill and associate myself with the minister's remarks. This legislation presents a fair outcome for the people who dedicate their working lives to what is a very tough occupation. I am proud to say not only that coal mining is in my family, with both a brother and a brother-in-law working as miners in the industry, but that my electorate of Dawson also has a substantial part of its population working in the coal mines in the Bowen Basin. The enduring image of a coal miner with hard hat and blackened face is still a pretty valid stereotype. Although coalminers use different methods today, it can still be a demanding way to earn a living. Today's coalminers still endure long working days; in fact, today's coalminers still endure long working weeks. Today's coalminers endure hard physical work. They often spend many days, weeks or even months away from family and friends. The money is often very good but, unfortunately, too much attention is paid to the monetary rewards and too little attention is given to what coalminers endure-what they forgo, what they miss out on-and what they contribute to our economy and our lifestyle. Just as the booming coal mines of the Bowen Basin have shaped the national economy, the coalminers who work in those mines have shaped the economies of regions which support the resources industry, like Mackay. Some of the changes to our economy present us with challenges; there is no doubt about that. For most, however, the booming regional economy is very much welcome. It is welcomed by most people, except perhaps for the Greens. If there is one thing the Greens cannot stand it is someone who works hard and makes a good living, and the Greens will stop at nothing to destroy the coal mining industry, other mining industries and all other endeavours that allow hard workers to earn more than a part-time basketweaver would. If the economic vandals in the Greens had their way, a very high proportion of Central and North Queensland residents would be earning less than a part-time basketweaver-a lot less. With such a high percentage of people still employed in the coal industry, the culture of regions like Mackay changes to suit. Lifestyles and families are forced to adjust to the demands of shift work. The demands of working seven days on and seven days off, the demands of working night shifts and rotating rosters are incorporated into how a family lives and how the regional community provides assistance and services to those families. We are blessed to be part of the boom in the Mackay region and in Dawson, but we should keep those MAIN COMMITTEE",298,Bills

It is a legitimate occupation, despite what the Greens contend, as is any other type of work in the coal mining industry and the resources sector. These workers deserve equitable access to long service entitlements. It is important that these workers be entitled to long service leave on the basis of service in the industry rather than service with a particular employer, given the nature of shift and transience within the industry. Under the Howard government, in 1999 an industry scheme was established to support funding of long service leave entitlements. I am pleased to say that this bill ensures continued fair access to long service leave entitlements for workers in the coal mining industry. I commend the bill to the House and am glad that it has bipartisan support. Ms LIVERMORE (Capricornia) (18:01): I rise to support the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave) Legislation Amendment Bill 2011. This bill will deliver key reforms to the coal mining industry's long service leave arrangements and ensure that industry employees are given a fairer, more flexible provision to obtain their long service leave. On coming to office, the government moved quickly to ensure that legislation was passed in 2009 to ensure that long service leave arrangements for coalminers contained in industry awards were preserved in the transition to the new Fair Work system of modern awards. We did that to preserve and remove from any doubt a secure system for recognising and paying long service leave accrued by workers in the black coal mining industry. There was a recognition then, however, that the 2009 legislation, while a necessary minimum to have in place in time for the 2010 transition to modern awards, would need to be revisited to transform the award entitlement to a statutory entitlement to long service leave and to address other concerns. The bill we are debating today picks up on those matters, which could not be fully addressed in time for the 2009 act. This bill provides amendments to four acts relating to the coal mining industry's long service leave arrangements and includes fairer provisions for qualifying for long service leave for employees, better arrangements for employers to access the scheme and minor amendments to the structure of the Long Service Leave Funding Corporation. As we have heard from other speakers in the debate, the coal industry has a unique set of arrangements for the accrual and payment of long service leave entitlements, dating back to 1949. Coalmining has a long history in this country. It is a history characterised by miners seeking to improve their working conditions through determined negotiation and at times industrial action. Hard-fought gains, such as portable long service leave, should be given every protection and should continue to be updated, as we are doing here this afternoon, so that their application keeps pace with changes in the industry. I am pleased to say that with the passage of the 2009 act the government guaranteed the continuation of those long standing long service leave arrangements in the black-coal mining industry. That was important, because the long service leave arrangements developed for the industry addressed the specific circumstances of coal mining and sought to give miners similar entitlements and protections to those of workers in other industries. For very good reason, coal mining industry employees are entitled to transferable long service leave based on their time in the industry, not their time with an individual employer. Mobility of the workforce has always been a feature of the coal mining industry, and the ever-increasing demand for skilled and experienced miners will make it even more likely that miners will move from mine to MAIN COMMITTEE mine and from employer to employer as opportunities open up for them. The long service leave scheme was designed to accommodate this mobility as well as to protect the entitlements in the event of company insolvency. It is not so much of a problem today but was certainly a real concern at earlier times in the industry's development. Under the coal industry long service leave scheme, funding for long service leave is maintained by an industry scheme created by the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave Funding) Act 1992 and related legislation. Since 1993 the funding of long service leave entitlements has been through an employer levy scheme and has been administered by the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave Funding) Corporation. Under the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave Funding) Act 1992 employers are reimbursed from the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave Funding) Fund for any long service leave payments they make to an eligible employee. The preservation of existing award based entitlements to portable long service leave in the black-coal mining industry and the administrative arrangements to support it were a priority for those in the industry at the time parliament passed the 2009 bill. Since then there has been a concerted effort by those from across the industry to come to agreement on outstanding matters. This bill gives effect to proposals developed by an industry working party to further improve the operation of portable long service leave. This has been a collaborative approach and credit goes to the many industry leaders and representatives who demonstrated their commitment to the future success of this important and unique long service leave scheme, among them the Mining and Energy Division of the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union, the Queensland Resources Council, the Mine Managers Association of Australia and a number of other trade unions representing workers in the coal industry. The changes put forward by this group and adopted by the government benefit both employers and employees in the industry. Employees in the black-coal mining industry now have a legislated minimum long service leave entitlement. Provision is made for all eligible employees, whether full-time, part-time or casual, to accrue long service leave in the mining industry. An eligible employee will be entitled to long service leave of up to 13 weeks when they have completed a period or periods of qualifying service totalling eight years or more. As the member for Dawson described, coalminers certainly earn that long service leave in the work they do and the very long shifts they work. A new rule for calculating qualifying service will mean that employees will be able to have their service recognised when there are breaks in service. The eight years of qualifying service can be calculated as the total number of years of service, with breaks in between, as long as a break does not exceed four continual years. For employers the bill provides for an improved approach to how the long service leave levy is imposed on them, to more closely align amounts paid into the fund with reimbursement amounts. There is a greater compliance role for the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave Funding) Corporation and change to the structure and representation of the board of directors. All of these amendments go to creating a legislative long service leave entitlement that is backed up by consistent and transparent administrative arrangements so that it works in the interests of employees and employers in the coal industry. The importance of having that certainty and fairness has been brought home to me by the case of Daniel Vincent, who came to see me earlier this year in Moranbah. Daniel is the kind MAIN COMMITTEE of person the coal industry relies on for its success. After serving his apprenticeship he has built a career in the industry working for BMA. Daniel came to see me because he discovered that his time as an apprentice-four years during which he worked hard to learn his tradewas not accredited towards his qualifying service in the coal industry, because at that time he was not employed directly by a coal mining company but instead by a group training organisation, which is a very common occurrence in the industry. I have brought Daniel's situation to the attention of the workplace relations minister and I continue to correspond with him about it. I am assured by the minister's office that the kind of case that Daniel has described was one that the working group gave consideration to in coming up with these reforms. Consequently, I believe that following the passage of this legislation Daniel will be in a position to ask the corporation to recognise the four years of his apprenticeship as part of his qualifying service in the coal industry for the purposes of accruing his much deserved long service leave. I will continue to work with Daniel, and with the further support of Daniel's union and the minister I hope to get this matter resolved once the legislation comes into effect on 1 January 2012. This bill is further proof of this government's commitment to the coal mining industry, and particularly the miners-the men and women-of the Bowen Basin, whom I am very proud to represent in this place. Ms KING (Ballarat-Parliamentary Secretary for Infrastructure and Transport and Parliamentary Secretary for Health and Ageing) (18:09): I thank the members for Makin, Farrer, Dawson and the member for Capricornia for their contributions. I particularly want to acknowledge the member for Capricornia, who has been a very long-standing advocate in this place for the rights of mining workers and represents a number of such people in her electorate. I thank her for bringing the attention of the House to the particular case. It makes it a very real example as to why this bill is necessary. The bill gives effect to proposals developed by an industry working party to reform portable long service leave arrangements in the black coal mining industry. I commend the industry and employee participants on their collaborative approach and their commitment to the future success of the black coal mining industry long service leave scheme. As the minister said at the commencement of this debate, the government is happy to propose these amendments which will benefit both employers and employees in the black coal mining industry.

Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment (Significant Incident Directions) Bill 2011. I signal from the outset the coalition's ongoing support of the measures being put in MAIN COMMITTEE",299,Bills
286,Mr Ian Macfarlane (Groom) (18:11,"I rise today to speak on the Offshoreplace in response to the 2009 Montara oil leak and the subsequent commission of inquiry. Incidents of this nature are always intricate and, as a result, the response should be multifaceted. Also as a result, related issues have come before this place several times as the Commonwealth government, the opposition, the state governments and the industry have worked through the details of the national response and how best to implement a suite of measures to safeguard the oil and gas industry, the people who work within it and, just as importantly, the environment in which it operates. The provisions of this bill are the next step in ensuring Australia's regulatory regime is as robust as possible, with a clear view to taking all appropriate precautionary measures to prevent such an incident from occurring again. The purpose of the bill is to amend the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006, the OPGGS Act, to specifically enable the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority, known as NOPSEMA, to issue a direction to a petroleum titleholder in the event of significant offshore petroleum incident occurring within the title area that has caused or might cause an escape of petroleum. The direction would require the titleholder to take an action or not take an action in relation to the escape or possible escape of petroleum and its effects, and may apply either within or outside the titleholder's area. The bill will therefore insert new provisions into the OPGGS Act that will clearly enable petroleum titleholder if a significant offshore petroleum incident has occurred in the titleholder's area that causes or might cause the escape of petroleum. The direction may, among other things, require the titleholder to take action to prevent or eliminate the escape of petroleum or potential escape of petroleum and/or to mitigate, manage or remediate the effects of an escape of petroleum. The proposed amendment will help ensure that the Commonwealth has the full ability to provide for the remediation of the effects of all escapes of petroleum in the event of an oil spill incident and is one of a number of legislative amendments being introduced to improve the regulation of the offshore petroleum industry following the Montara incident. This issue has been the subject of an intensive and extended consultation with industry and its representative bodies as part of the Montara investigation. As I have indicated, there is full bipartisan support for the government's response to this incident. Indeed, there is a public expectation that the parliament will take all appropriate and necessary steps to preserve the balance between the important economic sector of the oil and gas exploration and extraction industry and the protection of workers and the environment. To date Australians have generally viewed the expansion of the gas industry as a positive thing or at the very least have considered it as a benign development that does not adversely affect their own way of life. However, the Montara incident, which I should say was the first incident of its type in Australia for 25 years, and the disaster in the Gulf of Mexico have changed the way offshore oil and gas exploration and development is viewed in Australia. This industry is now subject to a greater level of public scrutiny and concern than ever before. But this intensified scrutiny is not something the industry or the government should shy away from. Rather it is an opportunity to enhance an industry that is fundamental to the energy and resources sector. Just as people are more aware of the nature of the oil and gas exploration and extraction industries, they are also increasingly aware of the scale of the projects, the MAIN COMMITTEE level of investment they attract, the economic benefits and the job opportunities they create. Thousands of jobs and billions of dollars of investment are at stake, which is why it is essential to get things right. In the wake of the Montara and Gulf of Mexico spills there is a compelling need for improvements to the regulation and oversight in the offshore oil and gas industries both here and globally. The response of the parliament should be guided by the fact that the public demand and deserve to have the confidence that authorities responsible for the oil and gas sector and the wider resources industry in general are able to perform. Offshore exploration and drilling is something that is essential to Australia's future and to our economic growth but also to our energy supplies. It will continue to play that fundamental role, which is why a solid and comprehensive national framework for regulation and response is absolutely essential. As I have made clear, the coalition supports the government in making sure that a robust and reliable set of measures is put in place to regulate the offshore oil and gas sector. The objective is not to unnecessarily shackle the sector but to ensure that it can grow and develop in a way that does not harm the workers in the industry nor the environment. The coalition have taken a cooperative and constructive approach to this issue and on this issue at least so has the government. That is why the coalition will support the government on this measure. I commend the bill to the House. Groom and with you in the chair, Mr Deputy Speaker Sidebottom. I am pleased to rise in support of the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment (Significant Incident Directions) Bill 2011. Around 95 per cent of Australia's petroleum resources are found offshore and some of it has been found offshore from the member for Corangamite's electorate. The search for oil offshore is very difficult, very expensive and often fruitless but it is obviously vitally important to our economy. And it is dangerous work, as anyone who has been to an offshore oil rig knows. That is why the isolated workers who work on these rigs are appropriately remunerated for that extra risk. Since 1965, 3,000 oil and gas wells have been drilled in Australian offshore waters. During the last 15 years we have averaged about 110 new wells drilled offshore per year. It is difficult and very complicated work and I commend the incredible expertise of our miners, drillers, offshore engineers and the like and the people who support them. The industry employs about 11,000 people and generates more than $22 billion in export income. Australia is the world's fourth-largest LNG exporter and in 2009 produced 559,000 barrels per day of crude oil. Australia also has an excellent safety record and a strong regulatory framework, but we have not been without incident. Most recently, many people will recall the Montara oil spill. Back in August 2009, petrochemicals began spewing into the Timor Sea from the West Atlas rig off the Western Australian coast. For more than 10 long weeks, the well leaked at least 400 barrels of crude oil and gas every day. The well owner, PTTP Australasia, finally plugged the leak by pumping 3,400 barrels of heavy mud down a relief well. Last year, in the United States, that shoreline also faced a major offshore disaster with the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, when 11 men were killed in an explosion and oil leaked from the well for three months. It is estimated that at least 4.9 million barrels of oil leaked into the Gulf of Mexico. MAIN COMMITTEE",302,Bills
287,Mr Perrett (Moreton) (18:18,"It is always a pleasure to speak after the member forThe risks in this very important industry are high and any major incident can cause significant harm to people and the marine and coastal environment. While Australia's offshore industry has a very good reputation, world leaders in fact when it comes to safety, we must do whatever we can to further minimise the risk in such a highly hazardous industry. After the two significant spills in the United States and in Australia that I previously mentioned, the community needs greater confidence in the industry to undertake offshore petroleum exploration in a safe way. Our marine and coastal environments are especially vulnerable to major oil leaks and we must do whatever we can to prevent these events. I note when looking at the North West Shelf particularly, the north-west area, that only about one per cent of this area has highly protected marine sanctuaries. The east coast of Australia, obviously with the Great Barrier Reef and down around Tasmania, has many more protected marine sanctuaries. Whilst it is not the Minister for Mines and Resources' job to look after these, I am sure he would agree that this is a very special region and more needs to be protected with marine sanctuaries. At the same time, it complements the safety legislation that we have before the chamber tonight. This bill amends the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act to enable the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority to better respond to significant offshore petroleum incidents. It empowers the authority to direct a petroleum titleholder to take action in relation to the escape or possible escape of petroleum. These actions include steps to prevent, to mitigate, to manage or to clean up the effects of a petroleum spill. The current powers available to the authority only concern power to direct actions within the titleholder's title area. Obviously, currents being what they are, if there was an incident again, the pollution would not be confined to the title area. This amendment will ensure that titleholders will be held responsible for cleaning up damage beyond the title area-all of the damage. This bill makes certain that if a significant event occurs, such as the uncontrolled leak of oil into the ocean, the offshore petroleum regulator, the independent referee, has a clear and unambiguous power to direct petroleum titleholders to clean up and remedy the impacts of a petroleum leak. These new powers also come with tough enforcement muscle. Failure of a petroleum titleholder to comply with a direction will be an offence under the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act. However, I would suggest to the minister that the penalties should be higher on top of the actual making good. The measures in this bill give the community greater confidence in the safety of the offshore petroleum industry and they will ensure greater protections for the marine environment and complement the work of environment minister Tony Burke in terms of making sure the marine areas surrounding Australia are as pristine as possible. I commend the bill to the House. that I spoke on in the House only yesterday, when I presented the advisory report on the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment (Significant Incident Directions) Bill 2011 to the House after the Standing Committee on Climate Change, Environment and the Arts had in fact inquired into this bill because it had been referred to the committee for inquiry. So most of what I need to say I said when I was presenting that report. But I just want to highlight a couple of matters in relation to it. Firstly, this bill arises as a result of both the Productivity Commission report and the commission of inquiry into the MAIN COMMITTEE",304,Nopsema As The Regulator For The Offshore Petroleum Industry To Issue A Direction To A

Both those reports recommended the establishment of a single national regulator to regulate offshore mining operations in this country. Both the member for Groom and the member for Moreton, I believe, have quite adequately talked about the importance of this mining sector to our nation, and there is no question that it is important and that it is growing. But both of them also, quite rightly, highlighted that not only are there huge opportunities in respect of offshore mining but there are also huge risks attached to those opportunities. Again, they referred to both the Montara incident and the incident in the Gulf of Mexico only a couple of years ago. Both of them highlighted not only the risks that are there but also the damage that can be caused as a result of those incidents not being properly managed at the time. The damage was indeed extensive in both cases and more so in the Gulf of Mexico incident where the livelihoods of the local fishermen were affected for a long time after those events and perhaps are still being affected as a result of damage to the fish breeding in the area. This bill is one of five bills which are associated with amending the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006. It responds to those matters and responds to them in a way which I believe in the future will ensure that, when an incident does occur, it will indeed be much better managed and much clearer directions will be issued in the shortest possible time. The shortest possible time is of significance because sometimes, when these incidents occur, time is of the essence and each day of delay causes additional damage. As we saw with Montara, each day of delay in plugging the well was adding to the damage being caused. I want to finish by talking about one matter that was brought to the attention of the committee in the course of its inquiry and that is the submission from the Western Australian Department of Mines and Petroleum. The Western Australian government believed that having a statutory authority managing the process was not necessarily the best way to do it and that perhaps it should have been a Commonwealth minister or that there should have been a joint arrangement between the Commonwealth and the state ministries. The committee wrote to the Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism in respect to that very matter. I want to read into the Hansard the response that is relevant to this particular matter because it was, in my view, the only issue of any significance that was brought to the committee's attention in the course of the inquiry. The department, quite rightly and I think quite properly, pointed out as follows: The Commonwealth considers NOPSEMA, as the regulator for the offshore petroleum industry, the most appropriate body to determine whether a significant offshore petroleum incident has occurred and whether a direction is required. As the day-to-day regulator for the safety and environmental matters, and also for structural integrity of facilities and wells, NOPSEMA will have expertise in understanding potential risks to environment and human health and safety that may result from an incident, and actions that may be required to prevent, as far as possible, significant impacts from such an incident. I would also note that there are provisions in the OPGGS Act that establish accountability of It goes on to talk about how the responsible Commonwealth minister can in fact issue directions if the need arises. Having responded to that submission from the Western Australian government, I support the bill in its current form. On behalf of the committee that inquired into it, I feel comfortable in saying that the bill should be supported by the parliament. MAIN COMMITTEE for Tourism) (18:29): I welcome the opportunity to say a few comments on behalf of the government in response to the contributions to this brief but all-important debate on the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment (Significant Incident Directions) Bill 2011. I extend my appreciation to the members for Groom, Moreton and Makin for their valuable contributions and their thorough understanding of the importance of this bill. The bill delivers on the Australian government's commitment to improving the protection of human health and safety and the protection of the marine environment to ensure that Australia's offshore petroleum industry is the best and safest in the world and is able to contribute to Australia's ongoing energy security and economic prosperity. Following the uncontrolled release of the hydrocarbons from the Montara Wellhead Platform in August 2009, which has been referred to by all those who have contributed to the debate, it became evident to the Commonwealth that a clear and specific power is required in the event of a significant offshore petroleum incident resulting in the escape or possible escape of petroleum to enable the regulator to give directions to a petroleum titleholder to deal with the escape of petroleum and the effects of that escape. In particular, a direction would require action to be taken either within or outside the title area. This bill will therefore amend the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006 to specifically enable the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Administrator to issue directions of this nature. This will provide a clear legal basis on which to issue directions following a significant offshore petroleum incident that extends to requiring action outside the title area. With those few words, can I not only commend the bill to the House but also clearly indicate that great progress has been made with respect to the establishment of a single national regulator, side by side with the formation of NOPTA, the National Offshore Petroleum Titles Authority, in Perth, with effect from 1 January 2012. I extend my appreciation to my department, to NOPSA and to the industry for their valuable support, enabling us to make great progress over a very short period following the Montara incident. I am very mindful of the need for a strong regulatory environment and therefore I am confident that, from 1 January 2012, NOPSEMA, the new agency in place with extended responsibilities, together with an additional person appointed to the advisory board with special skills with respect to environmental management, we will potentially be better placed than we have previously been to handle similar incidents to Montara. Obviously, our objective is to avoid another incident similar to Montara, but I think we have a strong regulatory environment in place to ensure that we achieve that objective. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that this bill be reported to the House without amendment. MAIN COMMITTEE",305,Nopsema As The Regulator For The Offshore Petroleum Industry To Issue A Direction To A
289,Mr Martin Ferguson (Batman,"Minister for Resources and Energy and MinisterAfghanistan Debate resumed on the motion: That the House take note of the document. the debate was interrupted yesterday: there is a lot more to do, particularly in the area of countering the threats posed by IEDs, improvised explosive devices, or homemade bombs that the Taliban dig into dirt roads and plant on pathways. In September this year the Minister for Defence and I announced an agreement with the Canadian government to loan three new IED clearance systems. These systems include two Husky vehicles. They are protected mobility vehicles, fitted with ground-penetrating radars that drive at the front of convoys to detect IEDs that are buried in the road. The systems also include one Buffalo mine resistant ambush protected vehicle, which is fitted with an interrogation arm and a Girocam camera to help our combat engineers defuse IEDs more safely. These vehicles are on loan, and they will be on loan for about 12 months from the beginning of 2012. Work is also underway to assess the possible acquisition of a permanent system for Defence. We are also rolling out a new, unmanned aerial vehicle system in Afghanistan called Shadow 200 and Diggerworks, during the course of next year, will also roll out more equipment to assist and protect our troops. War is never popular, and we should not expect it to be. It is understandable that when an Australian soldier is killed or injured we will question why we are there. This debate is an important opportunity to remind the Australian community why we are there, what we are doing and the progress we are making. We are there to make a dangerous place safer, both for the people who live there and for those who do not. As I said in this debate last year, we cannot pretend that what happens in Afghanistan does not affect us here in Australia. It does, and because it does it is right that we are there. The work our troops are doing in Afghanistan makes us all safer. That is something we should all keep in mind this Christmas as the sun shines over us and the snow falls over the men and women who do this work in our name. Australian forces in Afghanistan. Such actions focus on defeating the threat of terrorism at its source. I have in the past stated in this place that I support the role of our troops in Afghanistan. As an Australian I am grateful for their commitment and service to our country. With Christmas now only five weeks away it is important for all of us to spare a thought for our troops currently serving overseas, particularly those who will not be home with their families this festive season. Many military wives and partners have expressed to me the importance of showing support for our troops. This is seen as a means by which we honour and pay tribute to our soldiers. Our support to those families must be equally unconditional and we must provide to them as much support as they require. Sadly, we must also remember the families and friends of the 32 brave Australian soldiers who have paid the ultimate sacrifice since our troops commenced service in Afghanistan in 2001. These families celebrate the festive season with heavy hearts, but in some small way I hope the recognition generated from this House offers a degree of support and recognition for them at this time of the year. Additionally, it would be remiss of me not to mention the 213 brave members of our armed services who have been wounded as a result of action in MAIN COMMITTEE",307,Nopsema To The Responsible Commonwealth Minister

291,Mrs Griggs (Solomon) (18:36,"The coalition supports the continuing deployment ofAfghanistan and the families who struggle daily to deal with the ongoing impacts as a result of this war on terrorism. My electorate has a significant military presence and I take great pride in representing these fine service personnel. I take every opportunity to visit and talk with our service men and women. I listen to their views and concerns, particularly in terms of our ongoing presence in Afghanistan. The consensus, at least in my electorate, is that our role within the Afghan theatre is of vital importance. Our troops tell me about the pride they feel and the value they see in maintaining our presence until the time is right to withdraw. We as a nation train our troops to take on the roles of warrior and reformer in places outside our own borders. Afghanistan is one such place. Not willing to walk away when the going gets tough, our troops tell me of the importance they feel in applying the training and skills they have gained to overseas deployments. I cannot tell you how many times I have heard the footy analogy on this particular issue: you are part of a footy team, you train hard, you develop skills, you learn to work as a team and you learn the game plan but you do not get the chance to play or you remain on the bench. That is why they say to me that it is really important that they go to Afghanistan. This is the same feeling many soldiers have about not being able to put their training to use in overseas deployments. Australian troops reflect the values of our great nation. The work they undertake is demanding and is conducted in dangerous circumstances. The countryside is harsh and inhospitable; the weather is much the same. The rules of engagement are limiting and the enemy resilient. I believe our defence forces are the most highly trained, highly skilled and highly committed and are highly dedicated to the task confronting them. We-and I include New Zealand-have the only defence forces who demonstrate the tenacity and spirit that we citizens outside of the military recognise and relate to: what we call the qualities of the digger and the ANZAC. Afghanistan has long been a training ground for terrorism through the presence of terrorist training camps and providing a safe haven for terrorist leaders. Australian citizens have not escaped the reach of terrorism. Close to 100 Australians have been killed as a direct result of terrorist activities around the world directed from terrorist safe havens in the mountains of Afghanistan. Some of these attacks have been close to our shores, particularly my electorate of Solomon, including Bali in October 2002, the Australian Embassy in Jakarta in September 2004, Jimbaran Bay and Kuta in Bali in October 2005, and the Marriott and Ritz-Carlton hotel bombings in Jakarta in 2009. September 11 this year marked the 10th anniversary of the attacks in America which killed 2,977 people from 90 different nations. Eleven Australians lost their lives on that day. The anniversary was and continues to be a sober reminder of why our troops must remain in Afghanistan and why we must remain vigilant about international terrorism. The coalition support strategies whereby, firstly, the joint forces stop Afghanistan from being a training ground and base for operations for al-Qaeda and other terrorist organisations. Secondly, we support strategies to stabilise the Afghan state whereby Afghans can achieve self-determination. Achieving this goal will be through a combination of civil, police and military training for local Afghans. Purely in terms of numbers, Australia's commitment to Afghanistan is modest at 1,550 troops in comparison to other countries. With responsibility for security in a province that has long been the heartland of the Taliban, our troops demonstrate the values of this great nation MAIN COMMITTEE and have gained the respect of troops from other nations serving alongside them. Operating within Oruzgan province, mentoring the 4th Afghan brigade has been challenging and without incident. Sadly, though, several of our soldiers have paid with their lives the price of training local Afghans to take up responsibility for their own security and self-determination. Our troops willingly take on the task of helping to define a place where safety and security are paramount to its people, a place where reprisals and retaliation, and control by the Taliban and other criminal elements will become a thing of the past. In September 2010, General Petraeus, the top NATO commander in Afghanistan at the time, described the fight as: … very difficult and sometimes-seeming to be as slow as, again, watching grass grow or paint dry. But nonetheless-progress. I believe these words address the very essence of our troop deployment and their retention in Afghanistan. Australia undertook the role of providing troops in this conflict for the long term, with the goal of ensuring that when we pulled out we left things far better than they were when we went in. Our troops see this as the defining path of our deployment: the job is not complete until that goal is met. To take any other path would be to walk away. Australians-and in particular our Aussie diggers-do not walk away without completing the job. History repeats the story over and over and over again. In short, our troops remain committed to their role. Our mission is yet to be fulfilled, but progress is being made. The way ahead is not clear in terms of a definable time line for our deployment to Afghanistan, but we do move slowly towards this goal. I support the retention of our troops in this conflict until such time as we reach and fulfil our goal-at which time we can withdraw and bring our troops home. I reiterate the importance of recognising our troops and showing them that the people back home are well aware of the work they are doing and appreciate their efforts and commitment. As a small gesture of recognition in my own electorate I have been arranging through my office to send Christmas care packages to our troops currently serving overseas. The appreciation felt by those recipients last year was overwhelming. Many returning troops and families spoke about their gratitude for the small expression of thanks, often from complete strangers. Also, the small gifts-a touch of home-really hit a nerve and in some instances brought great joy to the local Afghan kids. I wish all the troops currently serving overseas a very safe Christmas and pray that the new year brings a speedy resolution to this ongoing deployment so that they may fulfil their obligations and return home safely. confusion, but I am here nonetheless, to speak on something that is very important and to follow the Prime Minister in her very serious report to the parliament on Afghanistan and in keeping the pledge to the Australian people that we would continue to do that. Julia Gillard said yesterday that we will complete our mission of training and transition. She is right to reaffirm Australia's role in rebuilding Afghanistan and outline the fact that our role in training the Afghan 4th Brigade is going well. I am not sure whether people picked up the significance of her forecast that the training of the Afghan 4th Kandak, or Brigade, may be completed before 2014. She made reference to the despicable and cowardly attacks on the Australian trainers by rogue elements of the Afghan National Army. We had the very peculiar reference by the local Brigadier General Mohammed Zafar Khan, saying that he would be happy for the Australian troops to leave MAIN COMMITTEE",308,Ministerial Statements
292,Mr Danby (Melbourne Ports) (18:46,"I arrive at this place after a great deal ofimmediately. It is something that I believe the Afghan government has cleared up, but I believe it is more related to a desire to have access to all the equipment that the Australians would leave, allegedly, to him if they were to depart immediately. The purpose of this effort, as the Prime Minister outlined, is to see that Afghanistan is not re-established as a base for terrorists and to give evidence of our close alliance with the United States. Our recent VC recipient, Corporal Roberts-Smith, memorably described a counterterrorist mission on AM some weeks ago. He said: I believe that wethat is, the soldiers fighting in Afghanistan on Australia's behalfare making a difference in stemming the flow of terrorism into Australia, and I want my children to be able to live as everyone does now without fear of getting onto a bus and having it blow up. That is a corporal in the Australian Army speaking on national radio with such a clear understanding of the mission. Our role in counterinsurgency in training the Afghan 4th Kandak is obviously dangerous. We lost those three young fellows who were machine-gunned while they were at the end of a parade. They were helping the Afghan security services. The training is going well, as the Prime Minister suggested-and the Australian Army does too. We have been able to hand over 11 patrol and forward bases to the Afghan army. The Prime Minister said there should be no safe haven for terrorists in Afghanistan. The operations undertaken in Oruzgan and the southern province of Kandahar are enormously important for the battle against the Taliban. Earlier this year Australian and Afghan troops removed vast quantities of explosives-a topic I will return to in a minute-including an insurgents' cache of over 400 kilograms of explosives and 22 ready-to-use IEDs that were discovered. The Australian people do not want to continue sacrificing our blood and treasure in Afghanistan forever, but it is due to the sustained heroism of our soldiers that we have been able to fulfil this important political task. As the Prime Minister said, we will probably continue to have counterinsurgency special forces there even after the, hopefully, early withdrawal when the 4th Kandak can be stood up and left alone to control Oruzgan province. Our work in Afghanistan is not the only role we are playing in the region. The Prime Minister mentioned we cooperate with Pakistan in counterterrorism, but Pakistan must do more to counter and fight terrorism within itself, on its border with Afghanistan and in Afghanistan. Every serious person concerned with national security would have been flabbergasted at the famous denunciation of Pakistan by Admiral Mike Mullen, the retiring head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who said that the Haqqani network, which is one of the terrorist networks, acts as 'a veritable arm of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence agency'. Worse is the evidence I have seen, which can only have come from the highest sources and which I urge every serious member of this parliament to read, in the December issue of Atlantic Monthly which outlines the rationale behind Admiral Mullen's remarks. The article said: The September 13 raid on the American Embassy and NATO headquarters in Kabul-in which Haqqani insurgents besieged the compound with guns and rocket-propelled grenades, killing at least 16 people-had shocked the Joint Chiefs. … the American Ambassador in Afghanistan, ""had to spend 18 hours in a bunker to keep himself alive,"" this source said. ""Imagine what would have happened if he had been killed."" MAIN COMMITTEE This is by a terrorist group run by Pakistan, and I say that with full seriousness. This is an ally of the United States and Australia, a country which gets $2 billion of American taxpayers' money and $119 million of ours. The leaders of Lashkar-e-Taiba live openly in Pakistan. It is outrageous that Pakistan allows explosive factories in Lahore to be the major source of the explosives in improvised explosive devices. Let me repeat that: Pakistan, a country which receives $119 million of Australian foreign aid, provides explosives from its factories to kill Australians and Americans. As the Prime Minister said yesterday, it is in the interests of Afghanistan, Australia and our coalition partners to have Pakistan counter terrorists in the region. That is very much the case because, as the article in the Atlantic Monthly says: Most of the world … is very anxious about the security of Pakistan's nuclear weapons, and for good reason: Pakistan is an unstable and violent country located at the epicenter of global jihadism and it has been the foremost supplier of nuclear technology to such rogue states such as Iran and North Korea. It is perfectly sensible to believe that Pakistan may not be the safest place on Earththat is a nice bit of understatementto warehouse 100 or more nuclear weapons. These weapons are stored on bases and in facilities spread across the country (possibly including one within several miles of Abbottabad, a city that, in addition to having hosted Osama bin Laden, is the home to many partisans of the jihadist group Harakat-ulMujahideen.) Western leaders have stated that a paramount goal of their counterterrorism efforts to keep nuclear weapons out of the hands of jihadists. If there is any place on earth where we have that as a primary concern it is in Pakistan. Since Admiral Mullen made his very judicious, strong and, I would say, very important statement, something strange has happened in Pakistan according to this extremely well-informed Atlantic Monthly article: … instead of moving nuclear material in armored, well-defended convoysThe Pakistani military nuclear organisationprefers to move material by subterfugeTo confuse the Americansin civilian-style vehicles without noticeable defenses, in the regular flow of traffic. According to both Pakistani and American sources, vans with a modest security profile are sometimes the preferred conveyance. And according to a senior US. intelligence official, the Pakistanis have begun using this low-security method to transfer not merely the “de-mated” component nuclear partsThat is, the different parts that you need to put together before you can assemble them as a nuclear weaponbut “mated” nuclear weapons. …… … What this means, in essence, is this: In a country that is home to the harshest variants of Muslim fundamentalism, and to the headquarters of the organizations that espouse these extremist ideologies, including al-Qaeda, the Haqqani network, and Lashkar-e-Taiba (which conducted the devastating terror attacks on Mumbai three years ago that killed nearly 200 civilians)Including two Australian civiliansnuclear bombs capable of destroying entire cities are transported in delivery vans on congested and dangerous roads … In other words, the Pakistani government is willing to make nuclear weapons more vulnerable to theft by jihadists simply to hide them from the United States… MAIN COMMITTEE Because of the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. No wonder the Prime Minister said what she did about Pakistan yesterday in the parliament. I understand that she attracted some criticism because of that from Pakistani authorities. I tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, if the rest of the parliament had read this article 'The Ally from Hell', people on both sides of the parliament would have been cheering behind her. I know the opposition is just as responsible as we are. This is a terrible indictment of the government of Pakistan. It is very worrying for any person seriously involved in national security and it is intolerable for Australia to have a group called Lashkar-e-Taiba, which has been repeatedly involved in terrorist missions into Australia. I would suggest that, if you look at the five sets of people who have been arrested, charged and convicted in Australia of terrorist crimes, you would find that all of them have a Lashkar-eTaiba training connection. Worse than that were the two Australians who were among the 200 people tragically killed in that disgusting terrorist attack on the beautiful Indian city of Mumbai, the symbol of India's progress and commerce and modernity-something that these people who prefer to live in the sixth century obviously detest. We as Australians warmly welcome India's movement into the modern world and good relations with our country. I conclude by saying that a withdrawal from Oruzgan province, despite the local politically rogue Afghan brigadier, would leave a security vacuum at this moment. That is not in our national interest or in the interests of our coalition partners. To the families of those who have lost loved ones in Afghanistan I say this: your sacrifices have not been for nothing. We honour them by making the ultimate sacrifice in defending democracy, human rights and the rule of law. At the tragic death of one of the boys killed in Afghanistan, Greg Sher, then defence minister Joel Fitzgibbon asked me to be in contact with his family. I have been in constant contact with his parents, Felix and Yvonne, since his passing. Having to attend the ramp ceremony with all of his mates when his body was brought off the Hercules is the worse experience I have had as a member of parliament. Some of his mates were still in their camouflage uniforms and had grown beards so that they would be less observable in situ in Afghanistan. Australia would not be a democracy today if it were not for the service men and women who fought and continue to fight in our uniform. We pay tribute to all of those who have served and still do serve in our armed services and we pay tribute to our allies who have served with us. We thank them for their sacrifice and know that we live in a free and democratic society because of them. As chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and TradeI will not let up on the Pakistanis until we get to the bottom of the fact that it seems they are training people who are not only murdering Australian servicemen but are trying to penetrate Australia and become involved in terrorist activities. Their government knows where explosives factories are that have produced explosives used in IEDs that have killed Australian servicemen. I congratulate the Prime Minister on her judicious words yesterday. Yes, we will continue the mission in Afghanistan until we can get the Afghan 4th Brigade up and standing, and then leave as soon as possible. We must also be conscious-(Time expired) Melbourne Ports.

293,Mr Mccormack (Riverina) (19:01,"I endorse the remarks of the member foris a long campaign and it has been a tough mission. It is a difficult time and it will continue to be so. Nothing worth doing is ever easy. Australia has paid a high price for its involvement. We lost 11 diggers in 2011, our deadliest year since 1970, when we lost 40 of our finest in the Vietnam War. Since Australia joined Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan in October 2001, in response to the September 11 terrorist attacks, we have lost 32 diggers: Sergeant Andrew Russell, age 33; Trooper David Pearce, 41; Sergeant Matthew Locke, 33; Private Luke Worsley, 26; Lance Corporal Jason Marks, 27; Signaller Sean McCarthy, 25; Lieutenant Michael Fussell, 25; Private Gregory Sher, 30; Corporal Mathew Hopkins, 21; Sergeant Brett Till, 31; Private Benjamin Ranaudo, 22; Sapper Jacob Moerland, 21; Sapper Darren Smith, 25; Private Scott Palmer, 27; Private Timothy Aplin, 38; Private Benjamin Chuck, 27; Private Nathan Bewes, 23; Trooper Jason Brown, 29; Private Thomas Dale, 21; Private Grant Kirby, 35; Lance Corporal Jared MacKinney, 28; Corporal Richard Atkinson, 22; Sapper Jamie Larcombe, 21; Sergeant Brett Wood, 32; Lance Corporal Andrew Jones, 25; Lieutenant Marcus Case, 27; Sapper Rowan Robinson, 23; Sergeant Todd Langley, 35; Private Matthew Lambert, 26; Captain Bryce Duffy, 26; Corporal Ashley Birt, 22; and Lance Corporal Luke Gavin, 27-an honour roll of heroes. Young lives taken from their family and friends, taken from their colleagues, who have been left to carry on the courageous work. The 32 killed in action or by rogue Afghans, the very people they were serving to protect and to mentor, were the best of the best, the bravest of the brave. We can ill afford to lose any soldiers. They are not mere numbers for making up a battalion. They are flesh and blood, just like us. They have hopes and dreams, aspirations to start a family or return safely home to their loving partners and children. The 32 who came home, sadly, to be laid to rest fully knew the dangers of their work when they embarked upon their gallant tours of duty. They were made aware of the deadly nature of their occupation when they enlisted. Military training is hard, thorough, disciplined. The officers at Army Recruit Training Centre at Kapooka near Wagga Wagga do a splendid job with raw, would be privates. They turn them into real soldiers-fighters, combat ready, regimented, as good as any in the world. These are the men and women who will serve on the front line to take the ultimate risk if and when asked by their country. These are the men and women who go willingly and unflinchingly to places and operations of obvious danger. They do so for their country, their comrades and the pursuit of peace. They do so very much with the ANZAC spirit burning in their hearts, for they know what is at stake: the fact that they place their own lives on the line but also the fact that a greater good can be achieved. As the opposition leader grimly reminded us yesterday, we have lost 108 Australian citizens in terrorist attacks in New York, Bali and elsewhere-murderous, unlawful acts which can be linked to the indoctrination, resourcing and training at terrorist bases within Afghanistan. We must stay the course in Afghanistan as a mark of respect for those 108 Australian civilians and to prevent further lives being unnecessarily taken, to be true to the sacrifice made by our fallen soldiers and also by the 213 Australian troops wounded in the decade we have been there. To walk away now would be simply to signal to the Taliban that its perseverance has paid off. As the opposition leader told parliament yesterday in response to the Prime Minister's statement on Afghanistan: The best exit strategy is to win. MAIN COMMITTEE The Leader of the Opposition visited the Australian headquarters at Tarin Kowt just last week to reassure our hardy troops that their work is supported, that the progress they have made is appreciated and that their valour is honoured always. The opposition leader said: … I am naturally disposed to want to see the Australian armed forces usefully deployed in places where they can make a difference. Certainly we are making a difference with our 1,550 representatives as part of the 120,000strong coalition force on the ground. He told our soldiers: … the important thing is that we do not put you in harm’s way without a good purpose and a reasonable chance of success. Now, obviously, deploying our military to difficult parts of the world in concert with our major allies is a form of being effective of itself. If we are standing shoulder-to-shoulder with those who matter in the world that is in and of itself a good thing. But we don’t want to be here just because our allies are here. We want to be here because we are doing good work on the ground: that the Afghan soldiers that we are mentoring are becoming more effective, that the Afghan police that we are mentoring are becoming fair-minded and conscious of the ordinary rules of a civil society. We want all of that to be happening because if that’s not happening we’re exposing you to deadly peril without necessarily getting the return that we would like. The Liberal-National coalition cares deeply about Afghanistan, just as I know the government, too, has a heavy heart about having Australians far from home fighting in a war which is like no other, which has already lasted a decade and for which we have already paid a heavy price. But, as the Prime Minister said yesterday, there can be no safe haven for terrorists, no opportunity for al-Qaeda to establish training camps from which to generate jihadist atrocities against innocent people, and her words were supported by the opposition leader. Mercifully, thankfully, much progress has been made since 2001. We can be proud that we as a nation, and our military personnel, have contributed mightily to that progress. According to AusAID, Australia's development assistance program at the national level has achieved the following: support, through the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund, for the delivery of major national health, educational and rural development programs which have increased school enrolments from around 1 million children in 2001 to more than 7 million today, including 2½ million girls; increased access to basic healthcare services from less than 10 per cent of the population under the Taliban to around 85 per cent today; support of the delivery of more than 45,000 community infrastructure projects in more than 25,000 communities; rehabilitation of more than 10,000 kilometres of rural roads, supporting the employment of hundreds of thousands of local workers; the building of the capacity of four key ministrieshealth, education, agriculture, and rural rehabilitation and development-through an integrated program of scholarships, targeted training and technical assistance; the training of 60 Afghan master teachers in Malaysia, who in turn have so far trained 168 teacher trainers in Afghanistan; the contribution to improved rural livelihoods through research in wheat and maize productivity, resulting in up to a 50 per cent increase in yields amongst targeted farmers; improvements in rural water supply and sanitation, irrigation, rural infrastructure and access to microfinance; and support for the provision of emergency food supplies and humanitarian assistance for vulnerable and displaced populations in Afghanistan. Australia has also supported the safe return and protection of refugees and mine action programs. In Oruzgan, Australia has supported basic health and hygiene education programs provided to MAIN COMMITTEE 1,780 primary school students, of whom 34 per cent are girls. Australia has trained 38 interns in areas including public financial management, computing, law and general administration to boost the capacity of the provincial government. It has provided equipment for the trade training school at Tarin Kowt and for the Tarin Kowt Hospital. National programs which AusAID supports have also delivered outcomes in Oruzgan. The achievements of these national multi donor funded programs include the Education Quality Improvement Program, which has built 30 schools, with a further 36 under construction. The basic package of health services has supported a provincial hospital, six community health centres, six basic health centres, a health subcentre and 192 health posts. The Microfinance Investment Support Facility has enabled more than 2,000 members in Oruzgan to access loans. Significantly, the mastermind of so much terror, Osama bin Laden, was killed in a coalition strike on 2 May this year. Justice will catch up with those who perpetrate evil against free people. It has happened across the world in recent times. Australia, as should be the case, will with bipartisan support be an integral part of continued efforts in Afghanistan and elsewhere to make the world a better place-more peaceful and hopefully free of random terrorist acts which have robbed so many of so much. the Prime Minister's statement on Afghanistan by acknowledging the recent visit made by the President of the United States to Australia and the importance of the ongoing alliance between our two countries. I also acknowledge those on the ground serving their country right now, those who have served over the past decade and those who have been wounded or killed over the life of this operation. I would also like to reaffirm my view on the war in Afghanistan, which is that an explicit and specific exit strategy needs to be articulated as soon as possible and that a process of withdrawal begin between 2012 and 2014. I was pleased by the statement of the Prime Minister. The current publicly stated date for this is 2014 but there was also reference in her speech, as there was in the speech made recently by the Minister for Defence, that the 2014 date may be the outside date required and there may be movement prior to that. I certainly welcome those statements and developments if they can be upheld. Our commitment comes at a significant emotional and financial cost to all Australians. In financial terms, our strategy in Afghanistan is costing anywhere between $3 billion and $6 billion-and this is at a time when financial austerity measures matter more than they have at most other times. Our 10-year contribution to this war and our open-ended commitment needs to be looked at as to whether it is a cost benefit to our economy not just as a cost benefit to our US alliance or the geopolitical interests of Australia. In October last year, I rose in this place to acknowledge that after nine years in Afghanistan the lives of 21 Australian troops had been lost, more than 150 soldiers had been injured and at least $6.1 billion of taxpayers' money had been spent. Twelve months later, or 10 years into our commitment, 32 lives have been lost, over 200 soldiers have been injured and there is a trajected spend of $2.3 billion over the next financial year, which is on top of the net additional cost of $4.7 billion over the past decade. The emotional and financial cost of our commitment is escalating exponentially. The issue of Australia's sovereign interest has not diminished and is still at the core of this debate. I assert once again that the time to commence our exit should begin as soon as possible. The MAIN COMMITTEE",313,Ministerial Statements
294,Mr Oakeshott (Lyne) (19:11,"I begin my contribution on the motion to take note ofdeaths of Australian troops will continue, the financial cost to the taxpayer will continue and the inevitable void and civil unrest that will be left behind will only continue to wait. I again emphasise that we will have to, at some point, accept a lesser democracy than ours and we will have to, at some time, recalibrate to focus on our international obligations to the AsiaPacific Region, on the many challenges that regional religious extremism and regional terrorism pose, and on what we can and should be doing towards peace and development in our own Asia-Pacific Region. In June this year, the White House announced that an initial 10,000 troops would be withdrawn from Afghanistan by the end of 2011 and that the full 33,000 troops associated with the surge would be out of Afghanistan by next summer. Further reductions beyond these timings were flagged with the goal of transitioning to Afghan led security by 2014. The 2014 deadline originated from the International Conference on Afghanistan held in Kabul in July 2010, at which the Afghan government determined that ANSF should lead and conduct military operations in all provinces by the end of 2014. I acknowledge that the Australian defence forces involved in Afghanistan are doing good work in training and mentoring the Afghan National Army 4th Brigade in Oruzgan province to allow their transition to having lead security responsibility for the province; building the capacity of the Afghan National Police to assist with civil policing functions in Oruzgan; helping improve the Afghan government's capacity to deliver core services and generate economic opportunities for its people; and undertaking activities to disrupt insurgent operations and supply routes utilising the Special Operations Task Group. I also acknowledge the statement of Chief of the Defence Force, General David Hurley, to the Senate estimates hearing in October this year that ADF activities continue to disrupt insurgent operations in Afghanistan. However, I make the same point as I did earlier in this speech: at what cost? I again emphasise that I think the time has come for us not to cut and run but to start doing what most of the coalition countries are now doing and work on a strategy for draw-downs of Australian troops for both financial and moral reasons. I do not accept the argument that Australia would be cutting and running on our own. If you look at what the various coalition countries are doing, you can see that there are activities going on right now that put Australia at the back end of any commitments to withdraw troops. At the moment, our draw-down-depending on whether you listen to the Minister for Defence or the Prime Minister-is for between 2012 and 2014. Looking at other countries, Belgium have now committed to draw down, commencing at the end of this year, with the intention of withdrawing half their personnel by early 2012. Canada withdrew from combat operations in 2011 and are now taking part in the NATO training mission in Afghanistan until the end of 2014. Denmark-and we all celebrated Denmark today-is still on a 2014 deadline, with the government recently stating its determination to hand over to the ANA in 2014. Finland is withdrawing between 2013 and 2016, conditional on Afghan forces' ability to take over, with the government assessing this month whether to change that. In France, President Sarkozy announced in June this year that there would be a phased withdrawal plan, with French personnel being gradually withdrawn, with possible completion by the end of 2013. He withdrew 200 personnel during October and will withdraw that many again by the end of 2011. Germany has the intention to commence a draw-down from the end of 2011 but is equivocal about how many and how fast. Hungary has said it expects only small changes to MAIN COMMITTEE mid-2013 and will work with ISAF on withdrawal. Italy, similar to us, is working towards a 2014 withdrawal. Latvia is also working to a 2014 time line. I think the argument that is pervading the debate in Australia-that openly discussing a draw-down and a withdrawal and exit strategy is somehow cutting and running or letting down the coalition forces or the mission in Afghanistan-is wrong. I think it is time for us to have an open and sensible debate, not only about military strategy but also about the direction in which we as a country want to take our involvement in Afghanistan, as per other countries who are openly discussing the issue or actively undertaking draw-downs and withdrawals right now. SoI certainly stand by those that are on the ground and those families that have suffered over a 10-year period. AndI certainly understand why we went there in the first place. However, after a decade, I do think there comes a time where we need to openly reassess and debate, as a parliament, military strategy. I think we need to now think of the economic cost, as well as of the geopolitical and other reasons for being involved. I do, once again, urge the executive to consider beginning a withdrawal earlier than the current date of 2014, in line with what is happening in most other countries engaged in the war in Afghanistan. collapse when aircraft crashed into it. Ansett collapsed soon after, and people stopped flying for a time. It was train-wreck television, seeing the World Trade Centre go down; I was glued to the television set for 24 hours. I had gone to bed the night before about three minutes before Sandra Sully broke the news on Channel 10. I woke up in the morning, went out to the front yard and picked up the Townsville Bulletin. On the front of it were pictures of the Twin Towers on fire and I said, 'Oh, what movie is this?' SoI went inside and turned the TV on and that was it. Lavarack Barracks and Garbutt air base went straight into red alert. Their plans for potential impact of terrorist attack were instigated seamlessly. That is what they do; they get on with it. Osama bin Laden claimed credit for the deaths. There was joy in the Middle East. It struck me as very strange and incredibly sad that such a tragedy could achieve such absolute joy in places. It shows just what a cosseted life we lead in Australia, that someone could actually have joy in watching that. I do not blame them for what they did, but I thought the reaction was unbelievable. It is against this background that our position on Afghanistan must be viewed. There were people in Australia who wanted to, and did, sue Americans for the loss of a loved one in the Twin Towers. Grief is what it is, and actions which may seem excessive to some who are standing at a safe distance seem perfectly reasonable and justifiable to others. We then saw the tragedy that was Bali. We saw London and Madrid. All these link back to Afghanistan. Australia was one of the first countries to act in support of the USA in attacking the Taliban and bin Laden. Over time our role has changed. We are now there in a mentoring capacity. Sadly, this has not made it any safer. So, when people say we should not be there, it must be taken in full view of the knowledge of the 24-hour news cycle, the distance of time and the proximity of tragedy. I do take the member of Lyne at his word. An exit strategy should be part of any military operation. We do not go into these things aimlessly, and 10 years is an awfully long time to be engaged. But every time we go back to this, we have to go back to why we are there, and Bali MAIN COMMITTEE",316,Ministerial Statements
295,Mr Ewen Jones (Herbert) (19:21,"The year 2001 saw the World Trade Centrewas just too close for me. Bali was where Australians went to surf and relax; it was a place for the end of season trips and for cheap holidays. To have seen the victims of that attack on Australia is to forever know that we will never be completely safe until other countries take control of their own lives. Bali was too close. Australian troops went to the front when they were called, and they did so willingly. Australian troops defended the people of Afghanistan and attacked the killers of people. They did so with determination and discipline. Australian troops are rebuilding the nation. We are assisting with the training of defence and police forces. We are building schools and hospitals. We are building roads. We are doing all this with trust and hope in our hearts and minds. Australian troops have died. Some have died on the battlefield. Some have been shot in the back inside their own compounds. I never spoke to a good mate of mine when he left my football club for another. Here we have a situation where you are mates with an Afghan. You have gone out of your way to include him. You have gone out of your way to help him. You have shared with him. You have protected him. And he has betrayed you. He has killed you and your mates. That is the greatest betrayal of all. Australian troops are disciplined. There is no revenge. There is a systematic approach to tending the wounded and securing the perimeter. The killer will be caught and will face justice. That is our way. We grieve. It is felt in every city and town in Australia when we lose a member of our ADF. But it is felt more in cities such as Townsville where there is not only a large population of serving members but an even larger contingent of ex-service personnel. I attended the funeral of Lance Corporal Gavin last week. His family were there. He has three children, with the youngest girl still in a pram. His middle child, his daughter, twirled in her beautiful dress, and his son, Joshua, looked every inch the man of the house in his shirt and tie. Brigadier Smith, the immediate past brigade commander, spoke. The Prime Minister was represented by the Minister for Defence, and the Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs and Shadow Minister for Trade represented the Leader of the Opposition. Lieutenant General David Morrison was there as the Chief of Army. Townsville's mayor, Les Tyrell, was there. We all filed out after the coffin at the end of the service. It was then that they chose to play the wedding song at the exit, so we had this extremely important and sombre procession walking out of the chapel at Lavarack Barracks as Kiss sang, 'I was made for lovin' you, baby.' We have lost 32 now. I was at the War Memorial last week with my nine-year-old son. Even though he was ready to run, he was respectful, by the very nature of the place, and was quiet all the way around on the tour. There is a place of honour there for our fallen. The current veterans know what it means to them. We must concern ourselves with the mission at hand. We must concern ourselves with the conditions being faced by the men and women still there. I heard the member for Wentworth speak earlier, and he spoke of this very matter. We here, in this place, cannot know what pressure is. We cannot know what it is like not to be able to relax. We cannot know what it is like to be living with the constant threat of being injured, or worse, by the very people who we are trying to help. To be killed or injured on the battlefield is one thing-a trained service man or woman can compartmentalise this and rationalise what has happened. What we as a society must MAIN COMMITTEE acknowledge is that some of the people returning will have problems. That is why we must ensure that the Department of Veterans' Affairs must remain ever vigilant as to the needs of their clients. Management there must never let the service of our returning and retiring service men and women become merely a job. A counselling service must be held separately from areas where they can be viewed as 'having a problem'. I know that the DVA in Townsville has some very tough cases in front of them; I know that DVA staff in Townsville are doing the very best that they can. We must ensure that the very people who have always been so strong and proud are welcomed and nurtured in their time of need. They must be told that this need is not a weakness-it is being human. The RSL must ensure that a welcoming hand is extended at every function. They must include. They must ensure that advocacy they provide is professional and respectful at all times. The city of Townsville must rally around our Defence families. We must ensure that we respect the space they require, but we can still be good neighbours and friends without intruding. Our schools where Defence mums or liaison are present must be on their toes and look for signs of families under stress, and offer a cup of coffee or a word of encouragement to all. Legacy will become even more important as we go on in time. To see those three children last week lose their father was hard enough. To be a family a long, long way from home and struggle with school fees and transport is another thing entirely. I know the people at Legacy in Townsville; a better group of people you will never find. But they must also renew. Their role has never been more challenging in a very busy world. So every time. I hear someone tell me we should come home, I think of those people who died in the World Trade Centre and in Bali, London and Madrid. I try not to think about how they would feel if we did pull out and their brother, sister, son, daughter, mother, father or loved one were killed as a direct result of us not completing the job we set out to do. We must respect those who lost their lives and make sure we complete the work. We owe everyone that much. Lest we forget. Dr MIKE KELLY (Eden-Monaro-Parliamentary Secretary for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (19:29): I will say from the outset that I very much appreciate the spirit of bipartisanship that has characterised our approach to this issue in Afghanistan and the support for our men and women in uniform. The fact that there is that bipartisan support is very important to them. They understand that they have that support, and it makes a difference to them. I know that both members of the coalition and members of the government share the experience of having to attend the funerals of those who have been lost and of meeting their families, so we are not hidden from the experience of the loss. Obviously we both appreciate that loss deeply. We salute, of course, the families who have continued to support the surviving members of units whose members have been lost and who remain committed in large part to this mission. They are an inspiration in that respect. It is a significant factor that the men and women in uniform, and their families, very much appreciate that progress is being made and would wish this mission to continue to fulfilment. But it is right and appropriate that we have this discussion-that we continue to revisit our deployment and continue to analyse it. Notwithstanding that there is bipartisanship support, we are of course hearing alternative views, such as we have heard from the member for Lyne. And we have the member for Melbourne in the chamber as well. So we are having an open discussion on the continuing involvement in Afghanistan. I think it is worthwhile reminding MAIN COMMITTEE ourselves why we are there-not just in the sense of what happened on 9/11, as dramatic and horrendous as those events were, but putting it further in context of what was going on in Afghanistan at the time. The key thing here is that Afghanistan offered an opportunity for al-Qaeda and its like minded organisations and affiliates to have the apparatus-the complete environment of a state-at its disposal. This is an entirely different order of magnitude from al-Qaeda being squeezed to the margins of other states where there may be ungoverned spaces or loose regulations so they can develop cells or operate to a degree. Having the resources of a state at their disposal enabled them to reach much higher planes of assaults on their enemies in the West. We know that in Afghanistan they were so closely tied in in a symbiotic relationship with the Taliban that enabled them to operate a complete conventional formation-the 055 Brigade. Through that brigade they were able to train and organise thousands of terrorists from around the world-process them and then incubate them out into other terrorist organisations within our own region. This is not a question of operating outside of the scope of our own interests. The central Asian country of Afghanistan was incubating significant terrorist threats throughout our region in relation to Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jemaah Islamiah and many other groups that we know have caused Australian casualties. We know from comments being made at the time in Afghanistan that Australia was well and truly on the target lists of these organisations. Largely that was why targets such as were chosen in Bali were singled out-because of the opportunity to target Australians. It was not just the regular formation of the 055 Brigade. There was an extensive network of training camps. The apparatus of the state enabled al-Qaeda and like minded organisations to operate at a much higher level in financial terms, using the opportunities that a state gave it to organise financial support. They were also using that opportunity in Afghanistan to run a series of experimentation sites for chemical and biological welfare and weapons of mass destruction, through which they would obviously seek to cause even greater loss of life and destruction than what we were forced to witness in relation to the destruction of the World Trade Centre on 9/11. That opportunity was there for them, completely unconstrained. There was a whole range of things they were able to do in that ungoverned space of the territory of Afghanistan that was available to them, with the assistance of the Taliban. The Taliban themselves, of course, were one of the most reprehensible and evil regimes the world has ever seen, taking Islamist extremism to an entirely new plane. The cultural warfare they waged on the history and culture of their own country was horrendous. There was not just the destruction of those highly significant Buddhas at Bamiyan, which achieved great notoriety around the world. So many other cultural artefacts were destroyed by that organisation. Those were inanimate objects, but certainly thousands throughout the nation of Afghanistan suffered horrendously. There were organised massacres. There was sexual slavery. There was repression of women to a degree not witnessed even in the most repressive of Islamist extremist societies that existed at the time, and of course many still suffer from loss of rights in some countries of that nature, but certainly they were a horrendous regime and worthy of dispatch for that reason. It was these associated national interest issues that particularly engaged us in the need to deploy our own armed forces in the international effort to neutralise that country as a safe haven. MAIN COMMITTEE I heard reference from the member for Lyne and others to us having been engaged in Afghanistan now for 10 years. That is not quite accurate. We obviously had a significant effort in Afghanistan in 2001, but there were a number of years when we only had effectively one officer present in Afghanistan working with the United Nations organisation there. So our commitment has not remained on the scale that it is now through the entire 10-year period. In fact it was not until 2005 that the effort started to ramp up again, and that signals how the international community dropped the ball in Afghanistan strategically. There is no question but that our engagement in Iraq did distract us from the effort in Afghanistan. If just part of the blood and treasure that was expended in Iraq had been directed to Afghanistan in those early days we would not be having this discussion now-but we are where we are. It was one of the reasons I entered politics, to try and address our strategic approach to dealing with counterinsurgency and stabilisation operations. This is something that had consumed my entire military career and on which I have written a great deal. It informed many views about how this nation should approach this issue, in particular that we needed to do a much better job of forging cohesive, coherent, whole-of-government campaign planning approaches to these environments. A counterinsurgency situation is classically the formula of probably 20 per cent security but 80 per cent social, economic and political. We were not really pursuing a cohesive whole-of-government strategy in Afghanistan in that context, so I was grateful for the opportunity to come on board with the Rudd government and create the Asia Pacific Civil-Military Centre of Excellence that we now have based in Queanbeyan, where it can work in conjunction Headquarters JOC; with the AFP's IDG group at Madura; with ACFID, the NGO peak organisation; and with the various agencies of government. That centre has made a difference to the strategies that we are employed on the ground. I was very fortunate to be with my colleagues the member for Kooyong, the member for Forrest and Senator Kroger at the end of April this year in Afghanistan and spend a week on the ground with our men and women in both Tarin Kowt and Kandahar. It was really heartwarming to see the change in the strategic approach so that the Provincial Reconstruction Team was no longer some neglected bolt-on to the operation but at the centre of the commander's concept of operations. The rest of the military effort was strapped around the Provincial Reconstruction Team to facilitate its work. We have heard talk about exit strategies here, but that exit strategy is in place. It is built on a concept of separating the population from the insurgency, from the insurgents themselves, connecting the population with its government and developing their nation-building capacity, particularly, from the military point of view, building the security sector reform that we need to transition to their responsibility for security affairs. That was achieving great progress when we were there. Those gains that have been made over the period of the previous 12 months have been consolidated and secured through this so-called fighting season. So we have made very significant progress. The security footprint through the Dhast, through the areas of civilian population in Oruzgan province, have been greatly increased. The security sector responsibility of Afghanis in filling that previous security void has been successful. The 4th Brigade is achieving great strides. There is still much work to do in relation to the Afghan Police Force; there is no question about that. But I visited the police training centre where our AFP are hard at work and they are making progress there. In terms of these other nationMAIN COMMITTEE building efforts to create loyalty in the civilian population to its government, we saw great progress there not only in the completion of the boys school at Tarin Kowt but also in the finalisation that was taking place of the girls school at Tarin Kowt, a school that will cater for 750 girls. This is a huge, quantum leap forward in a province that was the most backward of the backward. Literacy rates were incredibly low: we are talking about a 93-odd per cent illiteracy rate in Oruzgan province. So the boost that we are giving to education is the single most important thing. We have heard statistics about Afghanistan in general, but education is going to be the key to the future of that nation. So our efforts there have been tremendous and very rewarding engagements for our troops. The opening of the Sorkh Morghab mosque is building a relationship between our forces and the community because we have shown our respect for their culture, for which they have shown their gratitude; there is also the muliplier effect that has created in the build-up of communal activities around the mosque. We have also been involved in improving the delivery of health services at the Tarin Kowt hospital. These things are complementary strategies in relation to the broader mission of the security sector peace that we are delivering in Oruzgan province. Obviously, in the past Australia has been in the situation where we have had responsibility for provinces, and national efforts have let us down. We had that experience in the Phu Toc province in Vietnam. We had it, in my own experience, in the Bay province in Somalia. We went on to Al Muthanna in Iraq, where there was a happier ending, and now here we are in Oruzgan province. It is a legitimate question to ask where the national situation in Afghanistan is going from the point of view of the rule of law and good governance, and there is much more effort that has to be put into that. Ultimately, this will be something for the Afghans themselves to deliver, but we must remain engaged-and that will be decades of engagement-to facilitate, mentor, improve and build that capacity. However, from the point of view of our military involvement, there is an exit strategy that will be delivered within a time line we have set. But we should make it clear that we are not focused on an end date; we are focused on an end state. If we achieve that end state, that is when we will transition our security posture there. If it is sooner, then that is well and good, and the Prime Minister has flagged that. Certainly, we send a very clear message to Islamist extremists that it will not be the end of our involvement. There will be support for an Afghan government that continues to pursue, and deny a safe haven to, these extremists. It is a very complex picture there. Reconciliation is part of the process, and that is being pursued. There are diverse elements that are associated with this, and we have heard talk about the Pakistan element here, which is a very serious concern. I understand the historical basis of their support for Taliban elements, but they need to understand that that nearly brought their own nation down in 2009, when the Taliban were only 100 kilometres from Islamabad. For example, what was the first thing they did when they achieved control of the Swat valley? It was to blow up 100 schools, because these Islamist extremists see education as their enemy. They replaced the schools with radical madrasahs. This is our battle: to defeat Islamist extremism and promote the voices of moderate Islam in this world and in our own country. We are fully engaged in that and determined to see that mission through. MAIN COMMITTEE I know there is concern about these rogue soldier incidents that have occurred. We do not fully understand exactly what has happened there, but these incidents have not been unknown in previous conflicts. In fact, in Vietnam we suffered some Australian-on-Australian incidents, known as fragging. These are things that can happen when people are suffering severe mental breakdown or stress-or, in a situation like Afghanistan, where it might be family or tribal retribution, or indeed associated with the Taliban insurgents. But this is not deflecting us from our mission. Our troops remain committed to it. When I was there, I pulled aside some who were close friends of mine and said, 'Give me the no-BS answer here: is this working? Should we stay?' They all gave me the same answer: 'Yes, we believe we will achieve success. We are making progress. Please stick with us. We will achieve this mission.' Thank you. September 11 terrorist attacks and, subsequently, coalition troops fighting in Afghanistan. On this occasion it is important for us to take hold and remember why we first went into Afghanistan, to remember what we have fought to achieve and just how far we have come. At this time we must not lose our courage, our resolve and our commitment to the ideals which our service men and women have sacrificed and fought for. Earlier this year I visited Afghanistan and was witness to the many significant gains we are making-greater gains than ever before and gains at a greater rate than ever before. Australia is making a difference and there are tangible results to be seen. There have been significant improvements in security, and the ability of the Taliban to engage in armed conflict and recruit supporters has been severely impeded. Australians are taking an active role in preparing Afghanistan to secure its future. Troops such as those I spent significant time with in Mentoring Task Force3 are having a genuinely positive impact by skilling the Afghan National Army to take the lead on security. Australian troops are providing the essential element of any civilised society-that is, security. An enduring sense of security will be a strong incentive to the Afghan people not to pick up a weapon, to do things differently to how they have been done before, to voice concerns peacefully and to live without the violence that has defined the Afghan nation for so long. This progress is positive in more than one way. We are seeing communities develop from often the simplest of tasks. Successes in what we might see as the most simple of tasks, such as building a road or a school or a market, are creating power, prestige and legitimacy for the elected government, resulting in greater trust and better communities. These are positive impacts that will outlast our presence in Afghanistan. This represents tangible and real progression towards a more free and secure Afghanistan. These gains repudiate the often misguided public perception that what we are doing in Afghanistan is like putting our hand in a bucket of water only to pull it out and see the progress washed away. This progress is being made in such a way that the Afghan people will be able to continue to sustain and develop its governing capacity after the coalition forces withdraw. Dedicating the time and resources required to reach a point where the country is self-sustainable is of critical importance. The timing of our withdrawal must be determined by the realities on the ground. To withdraw too soon would undermine the achievements of our troops thus far, negating the many positive advances we have seen in Afghanistan. MAIN COMMITTEE As politicians it is in part our responsibility to communicate the positive gains we have made in Afghanistan. The greatest frustration I found from our service men and women on the ground was how the war is reported back home, particularly the failure to report the positive achievements our troops are making. As the Prime Minister said in this place, the ramp ceremonies and funerals that Australians see on TV are part of the story, undeniably an important part of the story, but they are not the whole story. The Afghanistan that we are working towards, that our highly professional and committed soldiers are fighting for, is an Afghanistan where its people are free to choose their own way of life and determine their own future, one which is governed by an elected government that has the legitimacy and security it requires for effective governance. With this in mind, it is imperative that as politicians we begin to turn our attention to our future strategic partnership with Afghanistan, a partnership beyond military ties and which will add value to both our nations. We are well within reach of the goal of the ANA taking the lead on security by 2014, as the Prime Minister has already stated in this place. I had the privilege of meeting with many DFAT and AusAID officials who are undertaking the all-too-often undervalued work of engagement and assistance to the Afghan and provincial government. They are supporting the democratic process and institutions that encourage economic growth and a prosperous civil society. It is the vital work that these departments and agencies do now that will help determine the enduring success of our mission in Afghanistan long after we leave. It is their work that will help the Afghan and provincial governments ensure greater effectiveness and self-sufficiency of their governance. It is in this light that it is evident that the success in Afghanistan will be a process as much as an outcome. We also need to be engaging with nations across the region such as Pakistan to ensure that they are not granting sanctuary to terrorism, as was underlined this year by the successful mission by the United States against the head of al-Qaeda, Osama Bin Laden, in Pakistan. Finally, we need to continue to support the good work that our troops are doing. Our men and women serving in Afghanistan need to be assured that they have our support and that we are proud of the work they are doing to ensure a safer Afghanistan, a nation that will never again harbour terrorism or extremism. Speaking with our troops in Afghanistan, I was immensely proud and encouraged to see that among our troops morale is high. They believe in what they are doing and bring a sense of purpose to their duties. They believe in what they are achieving and are optimistic about their progress. Too many of our finest Australians have paid the ultimate price to ensure that a stable Afghanistan is a better place for the Afghans and less conducive for those who promote terror and violence. The perception of our troops is that there is little justice given to the gains being made and little support for their hard work on the ground. We have an opportunity to get this right and to stop Afghanistan continuing to harbour those who would threaten our way of life. We have an opportunity to cement the gains we are making. But, in order to do so, in order to protect our way of life, we need to stay the distance to see our mission through. The cost of prematurely withdrawing our troops from Afghanistan is too great. The stability of Afghanistan and the region rests in an exit strategy that is founded on the progress and realities on the ground. The best way for us to honour the sacrifices of our servicemen and servicewomen, to honour those lives lost in this battle, is to see it through to the end. MAIN COMMITTEE Let me conclude by saying that I was deeply humbled and awed by the professionalism, dedication and commitment I witnessed in our servicemen and servicewomen on the ground. Regardless of our individuals views on Afghanistan, all Australians should be immensely proud of those in uniform, those who every day embody the ANZAC spirit. struggle for the future not just of a country but potentially of an entire region. Of course this is not the first time that Afghanistan has been the site of an apparently insurmountable conflict. Not for nothing is it known as the graveyard of empires. For some, this recollection of failures past is reason enough to dismiss our current mission in Afghanistan as an exercise in futility, but the parliament of Australia unreservedly supports military intervention in Afghanistan till the job is done. To some extent this is understandable. Afghanistan has always posed challenges for those intrepid enough-some would say foolhardy enough-to involve themselves in its affairs. Many years ago our former colleague Senator Russell Trood, senator for Queensland, published a book entitled The Indian Ocean: Perspectives on a Strategic Arena. In it, he quoted the future US Ambassador to Afghanistan, Dr Zalmay Khalilzad: Several factors will play critical roles in determining whether the Soviet Union succeeds in … neutralising the Afghans. These include the policies adopted by Pakistan towards the insurgents, the extent of external support … ability to establish a government in Kabul that commands a large armed force and has a wide base of support … Substitute 'International Security Assistance Force' for 'Soviet Union' and you have a reasonable description of the state of play in Afghanistan today. Dr Khalilzad's comments serve as a salient reminder that, although the participants may change, the rules of the game in Afghanistan remain largely unchanged. Another recurring truth about Afghanistan is that the struggles it has hosted have never been solely about Afghanistan. Rather, they have always been part of a broader geopolitical conflict. That is why it is folly for us to assume that the challenges we face in Afghanistan can exist in isolation from the affairs of its often volatile neighbours. No part of that neighbourhood is more interconnected with Afghanistan than its eastern neighbour, Pakistan. Democratic institutions in Pakistan are already at risk from a violent internal insurgency which includes al-Qaeda backed extremists. To that toxic brew, we can add the destabilising influence of Pakistan's rogue Directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence, or ISI, who, if not openly in cahoots with the Afghani Taliban, are at the very least proving to be extremely adept at turning a blind eye to their activities. The mutually parasitic relationship between the ISI, the Taliban and al-Qaeda was most brutally revealed earlier this year when it was discovered that the world's most wanted man, Osama bin Laden, was being harboured in a Pakistani garrison town, just a stone's throw from a military training facility. This towering betrayal strikes a particularly resonant chord with me, because within my electorate of Wright is our own military training facility in the town of Canungra. I know full well just how abhorrent the members of our own defence community would find the concept of an ally harbouring one of our greatest enemies. Of course the West is assisting Pakistan to confront the severe challenges it faces; however, Pakistan is a sovereign nation and is deeply suspicious, if not openly resentful, of outsiders' offers of MAIN COMMITTEE",318,Ministerial Statements
296,Mr Buchholz (Wright) (19:51,"In Afghanistan, we are confronted with a desperateassistance. In Afghanistan, we have much greater scope and much greater opportunities to bring a semblance of peace and stability to a broken and divided country. Last week, we had President Obama in the House, reaffirming his nation's commitment to the ANZUS alliance. It therefore seems an opportune moment to reflect upon the role that the alliance plays in our continued commitment in Afghanistan. This reflection is all the more appropriate because a great many critics of the war in Afghanistan seem to have forgotten the circumstances in which the conflict began. The events of 2001 were not an example of American unilateralism. On the contrary, the engagement in Afghanistan was a case of Washington acting in consort with the international community. The mission was undertaken with a mandate from the United Nations-a mandate that has been renewed year after year. It is also worth remembering who it is we are fighting in Afghanistan. The Taliban has never been a movement with widespread legitimacy. Now more than ever it is a highly factionalised entity, supported in some parts of the country, begrudgingly tolerated in others and openly despised elsewhere. During the years it wielded power, the Taliban succeeded in reducing the entire country to one big concentration camp, enslaving the female population and embarking on an ambitious campaign to exterminate the Hazara minority. Let us not forget that, during this time, the Taliban also played host to the world's pre-eminent terrorist organisation as it plotted the mass murder of thousands of civilians on September 11, or that for the past decade it has been fighting an undeclared war against an international force that is upholding a United Nations mandate. These are not freedom fighters. As a matter of fact, the last thing in the world they want is 'freedom'. They want the complete opposite, and they are ruthless in their determination to get it. In these circumstances it is to be expected that the fight in Afghanistan will continue to be a tough one. Increasing casualties amongst ISAF troops, more violence against civilians, not to mention the recent betrayal of Australian soldiers by members of the Afghan National Army they are there to support, are all logical explanations for some degree of pessimism. However, there are also reasons to look forward with some confidence. There have been encouraging signs of progress in things like school attendance, as well as the construction of transport, health and telecommunications infrastructure. What is more, economic dependence on poppy cultivation as a source of income is declining. Either way, the reality is that we do not need a perfect Afghanistan to secure our strategic objectives. Our aim need not be for anything other than a country which is stable, which affords its citizens sufficient freedom to decide their own political, economic and social future, without fear of recrimination from the Taliban, and which has the institutions in place to ensure Islamic extremism does not regain a foothold. The challenge for coalition forces is to create the conditions for these objectives to be achieved. Australian forces continue to play a vital role. Our contingent may not be the largest in the ISAF stable but, being based largely in the southern province of Oruzgan, our people are in one of the most violent and unstable parts of the country. Our soldiers have paid a high price in Oruzgan, with 32 killed and 214 wounded. However progress is being made and will continue to be made. On that point I wish to express both my gratitude and my enormous respect for the professionalism and dedication of the men and women not just of the ADF but also of the AFP, AusAID and DFAT-all of whom risk so much in the service of our nation. My heart goes out to the families who grieve for their lost ones and loved ones-those MAIN COMMITTEE mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters and friends of family members who carried personal burdens of their loved ones, who paid the greatest sacrifice to our nation. Following through our commitment to Afghanistan is an immensely important enterprise. With public support for the war declining, I believe it is incumbent on us in this place to redouble our efforts to urge the case, to go beyond the platitudes and the motherhood statements and to clearly spell out the strategic rationale for staying the course. Our brave men and women in the field deserve no less. Lest we forget. Ms JULIE BISHOP (Curtin-Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (20:00): Last week I represented the Leader of the Opposition and the coalition at the funeral at Lavarack Barracks in Townsville of Lance Corporal Luke Gavin of the 2nd Battalion Royal Australian Regiment. Lance Corporal Gavin, together with Captain Bryce Duffy and Corporal Ashley Birt, was killed in recent weeks in Afghanistan, in devastating circumstances. It was a moving service, with tributes from friends and colleagues. The presence of his young wife and his three beautiful young children reminded us all of the huge loss they will bear. It was enough to break your heart. This is the human cost of the war in Afghanistan. It is appropriate that we in this parliament reflect on our role, for this year is the 10th anniversary of Australia's involvement in the Afghanistan conflict. We must never forget that our involvement in this conflict began in response to the terrorist attack on New York and on Washington on September 11, 2001. Eleven Australians were among the thousands who were killed on that fateful day. They were innocent victims in the atrocities caused by al-Qaeda, and this was the origin of our commitment to ensure that Afghanistan never again becomes a safe haven for international terrorism. The country has come a long way since 2001. After years of combat, our main mission now is to train the soldiers of the Afghan National Army 4th Brigade. We in the coalition believe that this continues to be a worthwhile task, as it gives the hope that there can be a long-term, sustainable future that involves a better life for the people of Afghanistan. We particularly hope that it will help secure a better life for Afghan women, who were innocent victims of the unbridled chauvinism of the former Taliban regime. In our recent private meeting with President Obama here in Canberra, the Leader of the Opposition and I were able to reassure the President of our ongoing support for the mission in Afghanistan and our support for the government's commitment, as well as the importance to both countries and to other countries involved of seeing a sensible withdrawal, at the appropriate time, from Afghanistan. In recent times we have seen the dramatic strike by the United States forces at al-Qaeda, with the death of Osama bin Laden, which represents a huge blow to the operational effectiveness of that terrorist network. We commend the United States administration for the daring and resourcefulness of this successful mission. As the Leader of the Opposition noted in his contribution to this debate, there are United States reports that half of the key leadership of this criminal enterprise has now been killed or captured. In that sense we are making progress. It is hard won. President Obama announced recently that some 33,000 United States troops will be withdrawn from Afghanistan over the course of 2012. Great Britain has recently withdrawn 500 troops. In keeping with Afghan President Karzai's statement that the Afghan military should assume full responsibility for security by the end of 2014, the United States, the MAIN COMMITTEE United Kingdom and other countries have agreed to this timetable. Australia also agrees. We must respect the desire of the Afghan government to assume responsibility for the security of the country and to determine its own future. However, that does not mean that Australia or other countries will simply abandon Afghanistan. In her statement on this motion the Prime Minister committed to maintaining a presence in Afghanistan past 2014. She also made it clear that this could even involved the stationing of combat troops, like the SAS. We must secure the gains that have been made. Australia will also have a major foreign aid role to help the Afghan people. Afghanistan is currently the recipient of significant amounts of aid from this country. In the current financial year, 2011-12, the budget estimates state that just over $165 million will be spent. Of this sum the bulk of the money, just over $124 million, will go in direct country-to-country assistance via AusAID. The remainder will be distributed through international aid agencies and through other Commonwealth departments, like the Department of Defence. Afghanistan is a country that certainly needs assistance. The Human Development Index of the United Nations gives an idea of the relative disadvantage of Afghanistan. In the latest index, released only two weeks ago, Australia came in second, to Norway, out of 187 countries. In contrast Afghanistan came 172nd. Although not the worse, it rated lower than countries like Bangladesh, Rwanda, and Sudan. Gross national income per capita in Afghanistan is only $457. According to AusAID average life expectancy is 44 years and the infant death rate is exceptionally high, with 20 per cent dying in the first five years. Appallingly, in Oruzgan province, where Australia's efforts are based, the infant toll is 37 per cent. Australia's aid effort is focussed on a number of areas. In the area of education and health Australia is helping to train teachers and medical staff. With respect to teachers there is a focus on training female teachers. It is hoped that this will lead to a domino effect in broadening the education of women throughout the country. In cooperation with Malaysia and Afghanistan Australia is also running a course for master teacher trainers. This has resulted in 60 graduates since 2009. The target is to train an additional 120 by mid next year. This is crucial in a country where the literacy rate is, according to AusAID, a very low 28 per cent, and only 12.6 per cent for women. In relation to economic growth Australia is providing rural infrastructure assistance and farmer training. In terms of governance Australia has contributed to the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund, which funds public service reform. There is also a focus on training interns for the Oruzgan provincial government. In terms of humanitarian, emergency and refugee aid Australia is focussed on a $20 million landmine clearing program. These aid programs have made a material difference to Afghans. Together with our coalition partners we have overseen school enrolments increase from one million to six million in the last 10 years, of which two million are girls. When the coalition troops are pulled out of Afghanistan, whatever that date may be, the overseas development aid effort must continue. WhatI have just detailed of our aid effort will need to remain. We cannot make the mistake of the Soviets when they left Afghanistan in the 1980s and completely abandoned the country. Australia will have a significant role-a moral obligation, no less-to assist where we can to help the Afghan people for decades yet. We MAIN COMMITTEE support the need to keep training the Afghan troops in the hope that as soon as possible the job will be done and our brave soldiers may return to the arms of their families. When that time comes we hope that we leave behind a more secure and safe Afghanistan. But not completely secure and safe. There will still be violence and poverty. To solve those problems will take generations, but the Afghan state will be stronger-not fully developed but stronger and more resilient. And it will certainly be more secure and safe than was the case under the brutal Taliban. The ultimate prize will be the chance for young boys and more particularly, young girls, to have a genuine opportunity to live full lives, free of totalitarian ideology. In the latest update on Australia's involvement in Afghanistan the Prime Minister set out the conditions upon which our country is engaged in that country and the timetable for the drawdown of Australian troops. On this conflict there is essentially a bipartisan policy between the two major parties. However the government's position is compromised by the position of its formal alliance partner, the Greens. The Greens oppose Australia's involvement in Afghanistan. Senator Bob Brown, the Leader of the Greens, speaks from ignorance on the subject, never having taken up the opportunity of visiting the country. Members of the government, the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and I have visited Afghanistan, and many others have had an opportunity to speak to the troops on the ground. In fact, both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition were there only recently and were able to report on their trips to this House when they spoke on the motion. In contrast, the Greens, who oppose our alliance with the United States, the ANZUS alliance, would rather we cut and run from Afghanistan and risk further tragic deaths of innocent civilians if the transition to Afghan security is not done in a measured and sensible way. Finally, I pay tribute to the brave Australian soldiers who have made the ultimate sacrifice for their country in Afghanistan. We have to face the fact that our troops face formidable challenges every single day they are in Afghanistan. We pay tribute to those 32 who have been killed. We will never forget them. We must never neglect the 231 soldiers wounded in the line of duty. They carry the physical and emotional scars. We salute them. We thank them. In closing, I note again the bipartisan commitment to this cause. We will help Afghanistan on its road to governing and securing the country and its borders-what the Afghan defence minister has called its 'journey of self-reliance'. We must make sure that Afghanistan is resilient enough to protect its own national security and, through that process, our own. Debate adjourned. That the Main Committee do now adjourn. Aged Care issue not given priority by this government. Australia has an ageing population, and so with it grows the burden of supporting Australians in aged-care facilities. Without the government allocating a significant proportion of its budget to aged care and disability services, this burden is shifted from the government to the shoulders of families and friends of members of our ageing and disabled population.

298,Mrs Markus (Macquarie) (20:11,"I am honoured to rise tonight to bring to light anI would like to take this opportunity to honour a family from my electorate affected by the tragic events that occurred at the Quakers Hill nursing home last Friday. Caesar and Valentina Galea migrated to Australia from Italy to start a new life, fraught with challenges but filled with hope and reward. The Galeas worked hard to contribute to Australia as well as their local community, working hard to build a life and a future not just for themselves but for their children and their grandchildren. I was humbled to celebrate their 60th anniversary with them in recent years. Their love for and commitment to one another inspired their children, their grandchildren and many others who have known them to seek happiness and love not just for their families but also for their communities. Following the fire, sadly, Caesar passed away last night in Hawkesbury Hospital. I would like to particularly thank all those who looked after and cared for him in recent days, but on behalf of the HouseI wish to extend my deepest sympathies to Caesar's family. The struggle Caesar's family have experienced in recent months is not uncommon to many Australian families. Due to the endless waiting lists, Caesar and Valentina did not live in the same nursing home, despite efforts by their children and broader family. When I spoke with the family today what they raised with me was the battle that they experienced to have their mother and father together. They expressed frustration and heartbreak for a family so close, for a couple married for more than 60 years. In recent weeks I have had many more families visit my electorate office to share their own challenges with aged and disabled care. Many have spoken to me about the long waiting lists and how it seems to be an impossibility to have their parents, grandparents or, in some cases, children gain access to aged-care facilities. Just last week, I spoke with the mother of a 47year-old woman, a wife and a mother who suffered a brain aneurysm. She is now very disabled and has been assessed as needing high-care facilities and unsuitable for rehabilitation. This woman, at 47 years young, needs to be placed into a nursing home. Clearly, not only are we faced with a lack of facilities for the aged population but also a lack of facilities for young people with disabilities. It is not just families who are frustrated. It is nurses, carers and administrators in nursing homes who experience the torment daily of having to place citizens on waiting lists and watch families struggle to battle through a sea of red tape just to have their family members be able to access the proper care and attention they need in their older age. Our aged-care system needs urgent attention. Not only does more money need to be allocated to this sector, but that money needs to be actually delivered to this sector and not reallocated to other areas. The government commissioned a Productivity Commission inquiry and released its report, Caring for older Australians, on 8 August 2011. Since that date, the Prime Minister and the Minister for Health and Ageing have embarked on a 'national conversation' about aged-care services. There were 58 recommendations made in the report. So far neither the Prime Minister nor the Minister for Health and Ageing have responded to the report, which begs the question: who is actually having this conversation? The Gillard government cannot afford to be complacent on this issue. With the recommendations of the report hanging in the wake of the budget blowout, it is anticipated that the Prime Minister and the minister for health will not be conversing on this topic again until next year's budget is released. For many Australians, this is not soon enough. Families are doing it tough. MAIN COMMITTEE The family that I spoke to today, the Galeas, understand that what happened to their father, grandfather, husband, happened as a result of behaviour by one individual; that it is not the responsibility of the aged-care sector that this happened. But what they have experienced over recent months has brought to their attention what many other Australians are battling with on a daily basis. What they wanted me to do tonight was to say that they want to see this government respond to the real needs of ageing Australians and their families and provide the funding so that they can have access to care close to their families, close to those they love, and that, wherever possible, where couples have been married for a long period of time they are cared for together. Vietnam: Human Rights publicly condemn blatant violations of essential human rights. I have taken the opportunity to speak on many occasions and particularly in parliament about my stance on human rights in Vietnam. Although we may call Vietnam a South-East Asian neighbour and a valued trading partner, I, for one, am appalled that there are more than 400 people currently incarcerated in Vietnam for exercising their fundamental human rights. This evening I want to refer specifically to recent arrests of 15 youth activists belonging to the Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer. Some of these activists are members of the John Paul II pro-life group and are from the north-central region, from Thanh Hoa and Nghe An provinces, of Vietnam. I have been advised that the wave of arrests began 30 July 2011 when police arrested three Catholic activists at Tan Son Nhat Airport in Ho Chi Minh City as they returned from abroad. During the next seven weeks the authorities arrested 12 other religious activists. So far, 10 have been charged with violating penal code article 79, subversion of the administration, which carries a fiveto 10-year sentence for an 'accomplice' and 12 years to life, or even the death penalty, for those designated as 'organisers' of those whose actions have been deemed to be of serious consequence. I refer specifically to the following individuals, who I stress are just a few of the many human rights activists who are currently detained by the Vietnamese government. Paulus Le Son, a journalist and blogger, is from Thanh Hoa Province. He was arrested on 3 August and I am advised his whereabouts are currently unknown. Peter Ho Duc Hoa, from Yen Hoa parish, is an accountant working for the Tran Dinh stock trading company in Vinh Province. He is a member of the Catholic Professional Business Society. Francis Dang Xuan Dieu is a former Catholic student from Xuan My parish. He too is a member of the Catholic Professional Business Society and also a member of the John Paul II Life Protection Group in the Vinh diocese. John the Baptist Nguyen Van Oai, from Yen Hoa parish, works for a company in Di An, Binh Duong Province. He was arrested at the airport and taken back to his home for a house search. Peter Tran Huu Duc, an information technology student from Van Loc parish, was arrested on 2 August. Anton Dau Van Duong, a tourism student from Van Loc parish, was arrested on the same day. Francis Dang Xuan Tong, a tourism graduate, younger brother of Dang Xuan Dieu, was arrested at midday on 3 August. In my electorate I have the opportunity to represent a large number of Vietnamese people. Since the fall of Saigon some 36 years ago, Australia has received more than 200,000 Vietnamese refugees. For the Australian Vietnamese people, these happenings in Vietnam MAIN COMMITTEE",330,Adjournment
299,Mr Hayes (Fowler) (20:16,"As a member of this place I have made a commitment torepresent real and continuing examples of ongoing human rights abuses. Clearly it remains a major concern for many Vietnamese associations and certainly many of my constituents. Whilst we should be proud of the fact that we have taken a leading role in developing trade in countries such as Vietnam, I strongly believe that this leading role should extend to demanding that such countries honour their commitments under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Vietnam is a signatory. A valued trading partner needs to pay more than lip service to its international legal obligations if it is to be truly respected. As a signatory to various international conventions, Vietnam has willingly agreed to grant its citizens certain rights, including the rights to freedom and, in particular, freedom of association. I urge all my parliamentary colleagues to join with me in working towards a genuine respect for the rights and freedoms of citizens in Vietnam. Human rights abuses, wherever they occur, should be a matter for all of us. To ignore is tantamount to excusing, which in turn leads to acceptance. (Time expired) Gilmore Electorate: Meals on Wheels of Meals on Wheels and was most impressed by the representation from across Australia. Madam Deputy Speaker, I am quite sure you will agree with me that this is across party politics. The volunteers of Meals on Wheels-and there are thousands of them-perform a remarkable job, providing hot nutrition and meals to our aged and infirm, including a number of young people. Almost 80,000 volunteers deliver over 15 million meals a year to about 53,000 recipients. As our population ages, the demand on Meals on Wheels is certain to grow. I am sure the members of this House would share my admiration for people who freely and selflessly give of their time to help others. Not only do they deliver healthy meals; their visit is often the only social interaction many of their clients experience. It is a commendable Australian tradition, echoing the principles of mateship that we are all so proud of. Despite the evident generosity of the volunteers, there is still a huge cost to keep even this volunteer organisation running. I was surprised to learn that the Australian government subsidises their operation by just $27 million annually. While that might seem a lot, when you distribute that over the area of need it is trifling and needs to be reviewed with some urgency. Each meal costs about $10. That is $150 million in real costs, of which the government's contribution represents just 18 per cent. Where does the other 82 per cent come from? You can then begin to realise the enormity of the challenge to meet their obligations. Last year I was privileged to help out the Kiama branch. I confess that I had to work hard to keep up with my mentor volunteer, who was actually almost 20 years older than me. Participating directly like this gave me an invaluable insight into the quality and value of this service and into the real people that make it work. They are cheerful, hard working and totally dedicated, and you only have to look at the face of a client to realise why these volunteers gladly do what they do. It is a reward that money cannot buy. I would like to pay homage to all the Meals on Wheels branches in Gilmore by reading them into the record of this House. They are Lake Conjola, Milton Ulladulla and Sussex Inlet, which just celebrated its first anniversary-happy birthday to Sussex Inlet. We then have Berry, Culburra Beach, Greenwell Point, Huskisson and Vincentia, Jervis Bay, Nowra and MAIN COMMITTEE",332,Adjournment

Kiama comes next, taking in the whole of the Kiama local government area. Travelling further north into the Shellharbour area, we have Blackbutt, Flinders, Shellharbour, Shell Cove and finally Dunmore. Each of these branches is unique, stamped by the personalities that drive them, but overarching all is the common bond of service to your fellow man. I am extremely proud of each and every individual in these groups and I would love to name them-but of course time will not allow it-because they are very worthy of recognition. We cannot expect that this remarkable operation will continue forever and a day. We need to recognise the true worth of Meals on Wheels to our community and to the government and lend more substantial support. Meals on Wheels cannot and should not be taken be granted, ever. I tip my hat to this dedicated bunch of good Samaritans and applaud them in their work that brings a little joy to so many lives. We in Gilmore are indeed fortunate to have them living amongst us. Parramatta Electorate: Gillard Government Ms OWENS (Parramatta) (20:25): TodayI rise to speak about the government's record of delivery, particularly in my electorate of Parramatta. The Labor government has worked hard to ensure that our economy remains strong, in spite of global turmoil. While most of the world has shed jobs, we have created 750,000 since 2007 and are on track to create 500,000 more by 2013. We are meeting the challenges of a patchwork economy; keeping inflation and interest rates much lower than those we inherited from those opposite. We have also worked hard to ensure a sustainable environment with our clean energy plan, a plan that will cut pollution by making the big polluters pay and drive investment in clean energy. We made a historic investment into the modernisation of Australian schools. As at the end of September this year $16.2 billion was invested in over 23½ thousand projects in nearly 9,500 schools across Australia. In my electorate of Parramatta schools have benefited from over $100 million in investment, with 139 projects across 58 schools, including 17 multipurpose halls and 16 libraries. These have included: $850,000 to Westmead Christian Grammar School for construction of library, administration, amenities and storage facilities; $1.7 million to Wentworthville Public School for construction of new administration facilities; $3.1 million to Toongabbie Public School for a multi-purpose hall; $2.5 million to The King's School for construction of a primary library; $2.5 million to Tara Anglican School for Girls for construction of a junior school library and associated refurbishment of the previous library to science classroom; $3,000,000 to St Patrick's Primary School for construction of multi-purpose hall; $800,000 to St Oliver's Primary School for refurbishment of classrooms; and $1.8 million to Parramatta West Public School for construction of new classroom facilities. This government has also been committed to the continued improvement in the delivery of health services around the country. In Parramatta and wider Western Sydney this has included $36.2 million investment through national health reforms over the next four years, with Westmead Hospital in my electorate receiving the lion's share. We have introduced Medicare Locals to drive improvements in primary care. We also recognise the need to tackle mental health in a much more direct way, and to this end we have delivered a $2.2 billion comprehensive package focussing on early intervention and coordinated care. This is the MAIN COMMITTEE largest investment in mental health in Australia's history. I am proud to say that part of the funding will be used to for a new headspace mental health service for young people in my electorate. This service will provide local young people aged between 12 and 25 support for depression, substance abuse and other mental health issues. Labor has always had at its core the interests of working families. The nation's first ever Paid Parental Leave scheme is evidence of this, as is the Parental Leave Scheme, which will give dads two weeks to spend time with their new babies from 1 January 2013. We have also increased the childcare rebate to 50 per cent in support of working families. For pensioners we have introduced historic pension reforms which have delivered extra payments worth around $148 per fortnight for singles and $146 per fortnight for couples combined, plus a new work bonus that allows pensioners to work more before it impacts on their pension. We have delivered income tax cuts for the lower paid that mean a person earning $50,000 a year is now paying $1,750 less in tax and someone earning $80,000 a year is now paying $1,550 less in tax than they were in 2007. We will also triple the tax-free threshold from $6,000 to $18,200, which will deliver tax cuts of at least $300 to around 60 per cent of taxpayers. We have more than doubled the federal roads budget and increased average annual rail spending by a factor of four. And then of course there is the NBN, being rolled out around the country and connecting communities all around this great nation of ours. There is the National Disability Insurance Scheme, well on schedule-in fact, it is ahead of schedule-a great Labor reform that will provide dignity and security for many people that need it most. Five minutes is not really long enough to talk about all the government has achieved since gaining government in 2007. With the MRRT, which is still being debated in the House, we are of course committed to raising super from nine per cent to 12 per cent, and to providing instant tax write-offs for small business and a lowering of the company tax rate. Again, these are great reforms that will be well and truly welcomed in my community. We will continue to work hard to build a fair society, a society that provides every Australian the opportunity to prosper and succeed in life.

I have had big shoes to fill, as the previous representative, the member for Fairfax, served in this position for 14 years. Despite leadership changes in 2011, with both a new chairman and our previous director-general, Ross Gibbs, now taking on the position of state director in the Melbourne office, the acting director-general, Dr Stephen Ellis, and his team have overseen a very active and successful year. The highlight of course was the announcement that the National Archives had been awarded the very prestigious 2011 heritage documents. The award recognises the National Archives' innovation in this area, their willingness to share research results and their professional leadership. The award also recognises the National Archives for its investigation into the conservation issues surrounding parchment documents written in iron gall ink, which are vulnerable to iron gall corrosion.

301,Mrs Prentice (Ryan) (20:30,"It is now ten months since I was honoured by the Houserarely investigated. Some of the most important records the National Archives holds are on parchment. As I have commented before in this place, the National Archives has long been recognised internationally for its leading role in digitising records and in information management. Another impact on the operation of the National Archives was the amendments to the Archives Act 1983, approved by parliament in May 2010, which reduced the closed period for most Commonwealth records from 30 to 20 years, and for cabinet notebooks from 50 to 30 years. The examination of records was prioritised to support the accelerated release of cabinet records required by these amendments. One item of discussion and debate which will no doubt be of interest to my colleagues is the definition of a Commonwealth record and, given the multiple roles played by a minister, whether some records they receive or create will be official records or personal papers. We have also seen public discussion about the release of defence records, which has caused considerable privacy concerns among ex-servicemen and ex-servicewomen and their families. There has been an ongoing program of co-locating state and territory offices since the policy was announced in February. The co-located Adelaide office commenced operation in April, Hobart commenced in October and Darwin has signed an MOU. In addition to the normal demands on their time, the National Archives were delighted to receive a call from Yarralumla requesting an historic composite of the Queen's previous visits to Australia, which I understand was most appreciated and proved very popular. The National Archives Advisory Council is well served by experienced and talented members who make a genuine contribution. There are many challenges confronting the National Archives in the years ahead, not the least of which is the huge increase in the volume of digital records being produced by Commonwealth agencies. The most recent surveys, conducted in 2008 and 2009, revealed over 1,000 kilometres of physical records still in agencies. I particularly enjoyed my first visit to Darwin in July with the advisory council, which coincided with Constitution Day activities and the launch of the National Archives' publication Commonwealth Government Records about the Northern Territory. Whilst the previous year has been incredibly active and no doubt challenging for the dedicated National Archives staff, 2012 is looking even more exciting. In August 2012, due in no small part to the leading role played by the National Archives, Australia will be hosting the International Council on Archives conference. I know that Aladin Rahemtula is looking forward to welcoming everyone to Brisbane for this major event. Madam Deputy Speaker, I sometimes think the National Archives is one of our best kept secrets. Located in the original Canberra Post Office, it is a genuine treasure-trove and should be on the must-do list for anyone visiting Canberra. I strongly encourage any members who have not been there to make it a priority in the new year.

302,Mr Danby (Melbourne Ports) (20:34,"Sacred Heart Mission in my electorate in Greyother day-opened his door and shared a meal with a man who was homeless. It was a part of the world, that section of St Kilda, which, to use a biblical expression, the dispossessed of the earth inhabited. A small group of staff and parishioners from Ernie Smith's church helped prepare meals, and within a year they had 70 people arriving each day for lunch. This was the beginning of the Sacred Heart Mission's dining hall coming to life. It now provides breakfast and lunch every day to people in need. It is known right across Melbourne. It represents the very best of our community. Indeed, the day after Christmas DayI think between 600 and 700 people get a nutritious lunch. It is a remarkable combination of people-people from the local Catholic community, people who are on correctional orders, people from the Victorian government, and often, in the past at least, young teenage women from Presentation College. Last Friday, I attended the farewell of Sacred Heart Mission's CEO, Michael Perusco, at the Sacred Heart Mission in St Kilda. Michael had been the CEO of Sacred Heart since 2003 when he gave up a corporate salary to tackle the issues of homelessness and social justice. I want to thank him for his service to the community and his dedication to the cause, and I wish him well in his future endeavours, which include working here in Canberra in the Prime Minister's department on the issue of social inclusion. With his street experience, there could not be a better person to do that. Homelessness is an increasing problem, and the Gillard government, as we all know, has invested in providing a home for those without one, investing $45 million in the City of Port Phillip to deliver 224 new homes, repairs and maintenance for 581 existing homes, and a $5.1 million social housing development in St Kilda providing at least 34 people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness with a roof over their heads. I must say that working with the Sacred Heart Mission has been one of the abiding pleasures of being the member for Melbourne Ports, including giving them some assistance with a former conservative government and the then minister, Bronwyn Bishop. She was surprised when I approached her when she was sitting on the front bench-her colleagues were even more surprised-about one of the institutions of the Sacred Heart Mission which was opening up two months early. It was an institution caring for indigent men who had alcohol problems. Opening two months early meant they did not have their budget, and I am very pleased to say that Mrs Bishop provided some hundreds of thousands of dollars to see that, for those two months, the mission was able to provide that care. Sacred Heart Mission has played a significant role for those without a home, not only providing a roof over their heads but assisting them by letting them know that they are not alone-that someone cares and is willing to help get them back on their feet. A facility that has helped do this is one the people have generated themselves: their op shops. I started getting some very nice ties from my wife; she had bought them at a Sacred Heart op shop. ThenI discovered that she was buying them all around the whole of Melbourne Ports, because the Sacred Heart Mission had opened six op shops. The op shops started off generating $300,000 but now generate over $3 million. I pay tribute to Martin Healey, the man who provides so much wherewithal for people like Michael Perusco and all of the worthwhile people at the Sacred Heart Mission. They do exceptional work in raising funds and supporting people in need. Without the op shops and the dedicated volunteers who assist each day in the dining hall, those in need would not feel like they belong. Sacred Heart Mission gives these people not only a roof, clothing and food, but hope-hope that the day after tomorrow will be MAIN COMMITTEE better than today. These acts of kindness cannot be measured. As Robert Kennedy once said, 'Each time a man stands up for an ideal, or acts to improve the lot of others, or strikes out against injustice, he sends forth a ripple of hope.' (Time expired) White Ribbon Day speak tonight about White Ribbon Day, which we will mark this Friday, 25 November. White Ribbon Day is the UN International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women. It is sobering to think that we need such a day at all, but sadly violence against women and children is prevalent in our society and, indeed, around the world and we need to do something about it. The essence of the campaign is to make it clear that violence against women and children is an issue for men-not the women and children themselves. One in three women will experience physical violence and one in five will experience sexual violence during their lifetime. These are horrendous statistics, and they make awareness campaigns like White Ribbon Day all the more important. Research shows that about 300,000 domestic and family violence events occur in Queensland alone every year, while a nationwide study conducted by the National Council to Reduce Violence Against Women and their Children found that nationwide the cost of domestic violence is estimated to be around $13.6 billion a year. This is an extraordinary figure. According to Dr Rachelle Braaf from the University of New South Wales, domestic violence is 'a huge cost to the Australian economy-not only in responding directly to domestic violence, but also to things like the impact on work and productivity, impact on the healthcare system, impact on the legal system and so on'. Domestic violence is a particular issue for regional communities, which do not necessarily have the facilities and services to support victims of violence. The agencies which operate in my own electorate do an outstanding job; but they, like all others, are under constant pressure to continue providing their services because of the prevalence of violence against women and children. Bundaberg volunteer Pat Faircloth recently told the Bundaberg NewsMail, our local paper, that the Wide Bay region had a very high rate of violence amongst its young men and that this aspect would be the focus of this year's event. The statistics paint a grim picture. Between July 2009 and June 2010, Bundaberg Magistrates Court handed out 895 domestic violence orders, amounting to about 300 more than in Gladstone and roughly the same as Hervey Bay and Maryborough combined. In the same time frame, 627 people made applications for domestic and family violence orders at Hervey Bay Magistrates Court, while in Maryborough 296 applications were made. Just what has caused the spike is unclear, but I would think that a combination of factors might be responsible, including tight family budgets, job pressures and unemployment. The good news is that the various communities in my electorate are committed to eliminating violence against women. We have a number of male ambassadors who have made a commitment to stamping out domestic violence. To date, our White Ribbon ambassadors are St Mary's Catholic School Deputy Principal David Boge; Bundaberg MP Jack Dempsey; Bundaberg Brewed Drinks Chairman, Cliff Fleming; NewsMail journalist Vince Habermann; Bundaberg Police Sergeant Ken Hendrie; teacher's aide and NewsMail columnist Jackson McGovern; Queensland Rugby League Wide Bay North Operations Manager, David Pearce; ABC Radio Regional Program Manager, Ross Peddlesden; YMcA Bundaberg CEO, Ian MAIN COMMITTEE",336,Unesco Jikji Memory Of The World Prize For Innovation In Preserving Digital Records And
303,Mr Neville (Hinkler,"The Nationals Deputy Whip) (20:39): I am very pleased toRowan; Bundaberg Hospital's Dr Harrie Swanepoel; Bundaberg High Community Education Counsellor Clint Thompson; Bundaberg Eye Clinic Operations Manager, Robbie Boyes; and Hervey Bay Magistrate Graeme Tatnell. I also commend our local LNP candidate for the seat of Burnett, Stephen Bennett, who joined the Reclaim the Night march in Bundaberg on 28 October. It is good to see candidates like him drilling down into community issues. I commend the member for Fowler for helping to raise awareness of White Ribbon Day by raising it in Private Members' Business this week. I regret that I was not able to speak during the debate itself, but I look forward to lending the cause my strongest support. Kingston Electorate: Water Infrastructure Projects Ms RISHWORTH (Kingston) (20:44): I am very pleased to rise today to talk about a number of issues around this government's strong delivery record in my seat. Over the last few weeks and months I have seen a range of different types of infrastructure in my electorate that have been delivered by this government. Whether they have been schools or health care infrastructure, I have been very pleased. In my electorate it is very clear that it is this government that is delivering to the people in the southern suburbs of Adelaide. But tonight I want to talk about one particular delivery that I am very pleased with. One of the important areas in which the federal government is delivering in my local community is water conservation. In South Australia we know only too well just how precious our water supplies are. We are a particularly dry state, relying heavily on downstream flows from the Murray River to meet both our domestic and our industrial water needs. Communities around our state have been aware of this for some time. I am very pleased that it was this government that delivered to the southern suburbs of Adelaide money for infrastructure to conserve water and re-use the water that is currently in the system. Really, it has been federal Labor that has been meeting the important community expectations that we invest in vital water infrastructure. The Australian government has invested $34.5 million in Waterproofing the South Stage1 to provide alternative water sources such as reclaimed water and stormwater to replace the use of traditional water sources, reducing the demand on our scarce freshwater supplies and ensuring that overall water use in the south is more sustainable. I was very pleased to be at one of the launches of this project with the Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and Urban Water, Senator Don Farrell, along with the local council and the state government, to turn on one of these projects. All levels of government are working very closely together to ensure that we conserve our water supply. Recycled stormwater is now available for local reserves and sporting fields in the southern suburbs. Recently the $15 million upgrade at Christie Creek-the final component of Waterproofing the South Stage 1-was completed. This local project alone has the capacity to supply up to 850 megalitres of stormwater for re-use in the Christies Beach and Morphett Vale areas. Stormwater harvesting projects like this are critical, because they enable communities to plan for the future by using water supplies as efficiently as possible. The benefits of this particular project are many. This upgrade will not only help to reduce our reliance on the River Murray in the southern Adelaide region but also improve the quality of stormwater discharged into the Gulf to ensure the health of our local ocean ecosystems into MAIN COMMITTEE the future. Furthermore, the project has had a positive outcome for local residents and community groups, who are already talking about what they plan to use in the attractive new wetland areas that are being constructed throughout this project, providing open space and wonderful aesthetic areas in their local communities. I know that one local group even has its eye on the wetlands as a potential launch site for its miniature sailboats. This project is, once again, about keeping our parks and reserves green in a sustainable way. During the drought, for many people it was their local parks that had to be sacrificed because of lack of water to keep the trees alive. With this project, over 40 school ovals, sporting fields and council reserves are now set to benefit from this recycled water and stormwater to ensure that these areas do stay green and that our water is once again used very sustainably. Another project that has been funded through this project is the Southern Urban Reuse Project, which has allowed 500 residential properties in Seaford Meadows to reconnected to recycled water for non-potable things such as watering their gardens and flushing their toilets so that they can once again preserve their fresh water supplies. And this is just the start. SoI am very pleased that, building on this success, the federal government has provided funding of $14.97 million for Waterproofing the South Stage 2, which once again seeks to reuse stormwater. South Australians know about conservation of our precious water supplies. They are pleased, in communities right across my electorate, that we are investing in infrastructure that will help them use water sensibly into the future. McMillan Electorate: St Joseph's Primary School Greg Synan, the principal of St Joseph's Primary School in Korumburra, when I was there for the opening of part of their new school. The school is in Korumburra, which is a magnificent small town in my electorate. He spoke of the investment in our children as they are the future of our great country, Australia. He went on to quote some of his colleagues: They always try to meet and know the parents well, because it helps them to forgive the children. He then said: Well, that is not the case here at St. Joe's, because at St Joe's they have a wonderful parent body who are committed to giving their children the best possible start. I was so impressed with his speech. Mr Synan spoke of some telltale signs at the school: Hugs and kisses at drop off time in the morning. I see a lot of those. Check the lunch boxes. Are students' basic needs being met at St Joe's? Absolutely! Is the school uniform clean and showing pride? A big tick here at St Joe's. Are parents hearing their children read at home and helping with homework? Yes! Do the parents support and help the school? Absolutely! And of course there was just one more thing Mr Synan mentioned: Are the children smiling? Well, you can be assured that the students at St Joe's are always smiling. The principal pointed out that you always know if your dog is healthy when he has a wet nose! Well, there were a lot of wet noses at St Joe's the day I was there. One little secret they shared with me was that the parents of St Josephs are the best cooks. I can vouch for that MAIN COMMITTEE",338,Unesco Jikji Memory Of The World Prize For Innovation In Preserving Digital Records And
304,Mr Broadbent (Mcmillan) (20:49,"This address is taken from a speech given bybecause I saw the morning tea and had a taste of one of those very special fruit cakes. Thank you to the person who made it. The second component to this investment portfolio is the staff at St Joe's. Greg went on to say: Russell, I need you to go back and let the people on Capital Hill know that the teachers at St Joe's are among the best you will find. Good teaching is more about who you are than what you teach. Good teachers teach from the heart more than from the head. Good teachers explain complexity, but gifted teachers, like the ones we have here at St Joe's, not only explain complexity they reveal simplicity. We know that when a student fails so too have we! Russell, please go back to Canberra and let your colleagues know that the teachers at St Joe's are lovers of life and lovers of learning, but most importantly they know and love each and every individual student here at St Joseph's. We have high expectations for who they are and who they will be. These 'buds', these beautiful little people, are the reason we love teaching, specifically teaching here at St Josephs at Korumburra! Lastly he said: Russell, I would like to discuss the greatest yielding component of this investment the government of the day is putting into our school-the real gold-and it is sitting here before us: the children of St Joseph's at Korumburra, the children of Australia and the future of Australia. I have been to hundreds of school openings. I have been to many school events. I have never in my life heard a principal speak with such compassion and passion about his school, his students, his parent bodies, his teachers and the school itself. For all the money that has been poured into primary education, I wish this nation were wealthy enough that we could do the same for secondary education. I will get into trouble because they will say, 'He is praising the BER. We will use that tomorrow in question time.' Actually, I do not care. WhatI care about is this: the Catholic schools, through the system in Victoria, have done amazing things in their schools with the money they have been given. When I first went to McMillan in 1996 and then left in 1998 and then came back in, we had not spent as a nation any money in those Catholic schools for 25 years. And now we have. We are praising those students. I am praising this principal. I am praising what the schools have done and the contribution they have also made-the extra money, the extra effort, they have made the money go further. I would like to take you to St Joe's at Korumburra so that you could stand there in the classroom and look out of the sheet of glass over their oval and then to the broader countryside in Korumburra. No wonder Mr Synan was able to speak with such compassion and passion and professionalism. He obviously put a lot of work into the speech he gave that day. La Trobe Electorate: Gillard Government Ms SMYTH (La Trobe) (20:54): I have to say I am very pleased to be following the previous member, a new neighbour of mine, and I am perhaps going to continue some of the themes around investment in education. I am pleased to be able to participate in the same debate this evening. This is what will probably be my final adjournment debate for 2011, and I would like to reflect on some of the things that this year and this government have delivered to Australia as a whole and to my electorate in particular, and to update members on some of the things that have been happening in my electorate in recent weeks. MAIN COMMITTEE The year has gone incredibly quickly, in large part, I say, because this has been one of the most productive parliaments and one of the most determined governments that our nation has seen. As a government we have had a keen commitment to supporting jobs growth. Certainly the Treasurer reflected on that very much today, and rightly so. The jobs focus has been very much on display in my electorate, beginning with the economic stimulus, which ensured that hundreds of thousands of Australian workers right across the country were protected in their jobs at a time when the economy was facing volatile activity worldwide and pressures upon it. Australian workers remain employed because of the actions of this government, and I reflect on that each time. I pass the social housing development which has been newly constructed to the north of my electorate and which supported several workers locally and many more who were employed from various parts of the state. It is one of the things brought home to me when I visit the many schools in my electorate which benefited from the stimulus package because those initiatives, and so many other initiatives of this government since, have supported jobs and jobs growth so that we now see jobs growth and jobs created to the tune of 750,000 during the term of this government. In the last few weeks I have had great delight in speaking to children, parents and teachers at one of the recipients of BER funding in my electorate, TimbarraP to 9 school, where I opened impressive new classroom and library facilities funded under that program. I was particularly pleased to speak to the school leadership team, who are very much dedicated to further training and employment of their students. Our focus on education as a government has not wavered since coming to office. We have made unprecedented capital investments. We have begun implementation of a national curriculum. We are delivering an extra $200 million for students with disabilities. In the time available to me, these things are only a snapshot of the great endeavours that have been taken on by this government this year and during its term. I had the pleasure last week of visiting Harkaway Primary School, where I opened another significant new facility for a school that has stretched through a 135-year history. I know that the enthusiasm and the dedication of the staff certainly have not waned across all those years and all those generations. I was also extremely pleased to visit Gembrook Primary School to open their new BER building, and I know that that school has a very clear interest in and commitment to environmental sustainability. Indeed, it is very often that I hear from school students about action on sustainability and climate change. I was asked questions about these issues when I visited Mater Christi College in Belgrave with the education minister in recent weeks. I was asked the same thing at Belgrave South Primary School in recent weeks. I know that our future generation is very keenly aware that these are the issues that are going to impact most on them. So, in this year of action, this year of delivery, this government, and I as a member of it, has acted on the significant issue of climate change by putting a price on carbon pollution. In addition to this, I was very pleased to meet a different group of people concerned with climate change, representatives of the very many Uniting, Anglican and Catholic church congregations in my electorate, who came together about an important issue of social justice-namely, the effect of climate change upon some of the world's poorest countries. They brought that issue to me and raised it as something that local people involved in church activities are keenly aware of and are trying to raise the profile of in our community. MAIN COMMITTEE We have seen a commitment to education and training, we have seen a commitment by this government nationally and locally to jobs and initiatives that support jobs and we have seen a commitment to action on a variety of things which support future prosperity-a clean energy future and the distribution of the significant wealth of our country amongst a variety of groups within our society. In the short time available to me I am very pleased to be able to mention the National Disability Insurance Scheme, something that is being campaigned on and is alive and well in spirit in my electorate, as is significant interest in aged care and ageing. Forums on each of these issues were held in my electorate over recent weeks, and clearly the issues that are being focused on by us as a government nationally are very much reflected at a local level. Forums on each of these issues were held in my electorate over recent weeks, and clearly the issues that are being focussed on nationally by us as a government are very much reflected at a local level. Information Technology provide an update on the campaign to get Australians fairer prices on the IT hardware and software they purchase. When we are paying up to 80 per cent more for software compared to US or UK customers, despite a strengthened purchasing power that flows from a historically high Aussie dollar, you know something does not add up. As I have said before, I am especially concerned about the impact that has on small businesses here. They are being asked to shoulder an utterly unfair burden. According to a recent economic note issued by Treasurer Swan, it appears that there has been a slight easing of the burden-good news . Analysis of the most recent CPI data indicates that Australian prices for computing-related equipment actually contracted in the previous quarter. As I said, that is great, but we have still got a way to go in seeing some fairer pricing. I certainly welcome the Treasurer’s economic note, with the reference in there to the fact that the federal government has asked the Productivity Commission to review the extent of IT price discrimination in Australia. That was an important step, and it came about as a result of the tremendous assistance of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, David Bradbury. Since late September, the commission welcomed further submissions from the public on the impact of IT price differentials. I want to congratulate those members of the public that made submissions to ensure their thoughts were considered. Submissions ranged from organizations such as the Association of Professional Engineers, Scientists and Managers Australia-APESMA-to average consumers, some who did not actually hold back in their comments. One consumer commented: I believe that these enforced price differentials, especially for online downloads, are baseless and exploitative of the average Australian consumer, who will not complain about the price for the sake of convenience and minimal hassle. They certainly did not miss there with that comment, letting people know exactly what they think. Again, I want to thank people who made submissions and also the other members of the public who have been contacting me, supportive of this overall campaign. MAIN COMMITTEE",340,Unesco Jikji Memory Of The World Prize For Innovation In Preserving Digital Records And
305,Mr Husic (Chifley,"Government Whip) (20:59): I wanted to take the opportunity toI understand from inquiries I made today that the Productivity Commission has submitted its overall review into the economic structure and performance of the Australian retail industry, of which this issue-IT pricing differentials-will form a part. This report is being considered by the government now, and I am led to believe will be released next month. When I scanned the submissions listed on the Productivity Commission website, something else became glaringly obvious: not a single one of the major vendors took the opportunity to make a submission to the commission. It is staggering that with all the interest in this matter, the vendors and companies like Adobe, Apple, Lenovo or Microsoft did not take the chance to comment or to try to better educate the public on their side of the story about why prices differ so markedly. I suspect these companies believe they can ride out the sustained public focus on this matter. This view was borne out to me by a comment passed on by a journalist, who put this issue to a senior IT exec who said that they 'didn’t really care what government thought about this issue, we’ll charge what we want.' I know that one comment by one senior executive does not represent the views of the entire sector, but their overall failure to respond meaningfully to this matter over months speaks volumes. If there are some people who take the view that they do not need to respond to this, or that they can ride it out, I would urge them to consider the following points. Firstly, there is over $2 billion worth of IT procurement made by the federal government. On top of this it is worth noting that under a coordinated procurement contracting framework that was signed between the Australian government and Microsoft in 2010-11, the Australian government spent over $95 million on licenses and software assurance through this volume source arrangement. Government spends a great deal on IT software and hardware. Certainly, I intend to follow up within government about what measures are in place to ensure that we are getting value for money and that we are not seeing inflated prices that are affecting the Australian government and therefore the taxpayer because the major vendor companies think that they can charge whatever they want, as quoted in that offhand remark. Frankly, I think that we need to ensure that there is value for money for government, for consumers and for small business. If they think they can ride this out, I would beg to differ and urge them actually to be a lot more transparent in the way that they approach this issue. Preston, Mr Neil, OAM Ms BIRD (Cunningham) (21:04): I acknowledge a very important local leader in our community who is retiring. Unfortunately, I will not be able to make his retirement function, but I have taken the opportunity to put a message through to him for that event. His name is Neil Preston. Neil is the manager of the Greenacres Disability Services in the Wollongong area and is very, very well known to many in our community and indeed to many in this place as a fierce and constant advocate for those with a disability. Only the other week, I and the member for Throsby hosted Senator Jan McLucas, as the parliamentary secretary for disabilities, into the area on a surprise visit to Neil at work to present him with a certificate of appreciation for his years of public service and advocacy in the disability sector. Senator McLucas acknowledged in that presentation and on the certificate that was given to Neil that he was an agitator and an advocate of the first order. It is certainly something that many in our community are going to miss, in terms of the tremendous work Neil has done, not only in running a very important disability service in our MAIN COMMITTEE community but for his determination to make work in the disability sector a valued, remunerated and important component of the lives of the people with a disability that he was working with. Whilst Neil talks about retirement, I am sure that that retirement will involve ongoing advocacy and engagement on an issue that has been very dear to his heart for 16 years and to which he has been such a tremendous asset. As an engineer for the heavy manufacturing sector, Neil did sometimes wonder how he ended up in the disability sector. I am a believer that sometimes in life things work out that we end up where we are most meant to contribute to the broader community that we are a part of. That is certainly the case with Neil. While I have no doubt that he had a sterling, outstanding career as an engineer in the heavy manufacturing sector, I am also sure that the many, many lives that he touched in his role in the disability sector are a legacy that any one of us in this place would be proud to leave behind. Indeed, the former Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Children's Services, Mr Bill Shorten, has reflected that any great progress in the disability sector will certainly have the traceable fingerprints of Neil Preston on them, as he has been such a great advocate. I conclude my remarks on Neil's contribution by reflecting on a very, very significant achievement this year by this government-one of many, I acknowledge, but one that I think is very much appreciated. Whilst there is a lot of work to be done, it is good for it to be underway. It is the National Disability Insurance Scheme. It certainly has been long overdue, and I think it will make a profound difference to the lives of not only those born with a disability, in particular, or those who acquire disabilities through circumstances where they do not have insurance to cover that situation but their families and carers as well. It is a very important initiative that I know Neil very much welcomed. I certainly acknowledge the Every Australian Counts campaign, which I know many people in this place across all party divides have supported. You only have to go on their website and you will see all the members of parliament who are very keenly supporting the campaign that they are running, because we all know through our own constituencies that it is well overdue and will be a very important change to the sector. Neil goes in some ways at the beginning of what I hope is a very exciting time for the sector as we progress the National Disability Insurance Scheme, but he certainly goes knowing that he has been a great part of getting us to the point where we are now. I have no doubt, knowing Neil, that, despite his plans for spending some time travelling and doing some things that he has put on his bucket list for too long, he will still be sending emails and advocating from wherever he may be, whatever he may be doing. In the Illawarra we all look forward to that, and I am sure that, even in this House, ministers and parliamentary secretaries also look forward to receiving Neil's emails. Question agreed to. Main Committee adjourned at 21:10. MAIN COMMITTEE Computers in Schools (Question No. 581) Mr Christensen asked the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth, in writing, on 12 September 2011: In respect of the Computers in Schools program, in the electorates of Dawson and Capricornia, what (a) total number of computers have been delivered, and (b) is the computer to student ratio (broken down by school). Mr Garrett: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) The total number of computers that had been installed at schools in the electorate of Dawson as at 30 June 2011 was 2,971. The total number of computers that had been installed at schools in the electorate of Capricornia as at 30 June 2011 was 4,029. (b) Based on a 2008 Preliminary Survey conducted by the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations, and progress reports received to date from government and non-government education authorities, all eligible schools in Australia are now at a computer to student ratio of 1:2 or better. This includes schools with students in Years9 to 12 in the electorates of Dawson and Capricornia. As outlined in the most recent progress report on 15 July 2011, government and non-government education authorities have advised that schools are on track to move from a ratio of 1:2 to a ratio of 1:1 by the end of 2011. Australian Sports Commission and Australian Institute of Sport: Staffing (Question No. 617) Mr Hartsuyker asked the Minister representing the Minister for Sport, in writing, on 21 September 2011: 1 How many staff are employed by the Australian Sports Commission (ASC), including employees of the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS). 2. Of the total number of staff employed by the ASC and AIS, how many are employed in (a) administrative roles, (b) coaching roles, (c) executive roles, (d) full-time positions, (e) permanent part-time positions, and (f) casual positions. 3. How many ASC and AIS staff are located in (a) each Australian State and Territory, and (b) overseas. 4. How many staff are employed by the ASC in relation to the Active After School Communities program. 5. Do the ASC and AIS engage contractors to provide services in addition to services provided by employees of the ASC and AIS; if so, how many contractors were engaged by the ASC and AIS in 2010-11, and for what total sum. Ms Kate Ellis: The Minister for Sport has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 1. At 31 August 2011 the ASC had 754.2 full time equivalent (FTE) positions (excluding casual employment). 2. The workforce comprised: (a) Administrative roles 705.6 FTE (b) Coaching roles 43.6 FTE (c) Executive roles 5.0 FTE (d) Full-time positions 735.4 FTE (e) Permanent part-time positions 15.2 permanent (f) Casual positions 34.4 year to date An additional 3.6 fixed term part time staff are included in the total FTE count at question 1. 3. (a) ACT 510 FTE positions NT 8 FTE positions NSW 61 FTE positions QLD 49 FTE positions SA 31 FTE positions TAS 6 FTE positions VIC 54 FTE positions WA 28 FTE positions (b) Overseas7 FTE positions 4. 197.5 FTE positions. 5. 16 contractors. The total sum expended in relation to these during 2010-11 was $1,324,534. Australian Institute of Sport: Athlete Scholarships (Question No. 618) Mr Hartsuyker asked the Minister representing the Minister for Sport, in writing, on 21 September 2011: On what basis does the Australian Institute of Sport determine how many athlete scholarships will be awarded in each particular sport in a given year?
