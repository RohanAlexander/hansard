I am now able to in for m him that it is understood that the Commonwealth O i l Refineries does not at present produce an aviation spirit conforming to specifications required for use in the A i r Force machines, though they could do so at a moment's notice in case of emergency. The present demand for aviation spirit is not sufficient to j u s t if y their allotting special storage facilities for such a highly volatile spirit. Some tests with the ordinary Commonwealth O i l Refineries No. 1 grade motor spirit have been made by the Civil Aviation Branch, and, though the machines were successfully flown, the trials to date have not been comprehensive enough to enable a reliable report to be made in regard to its suitability for aviation purposes.

EAR LE PAGE Tliat the first item in tbe Estimates under DivisionI -The Parliament-namely , ""The President, £1,300 "" be agreed to. -On Friday last I was pointing out that during the four years in which the sinking f u n d has been in operation, the amounts paid into it have counterbalanced new borrowings, so that the National Debt has been kept practically stationary. The net debt on the 30th June, 1922, was £339,200,105, and on the 30th June, 1926, it was £338,841,476, showing an actual reduction of almost £160,000, notwithstanding that during the four years the population had increased by 481,000. In other words, the national debt was reduced by £ 4 19s. 6d. per head. That is very pleasing reading to honourable members, and more so to the general public. Charges of extravagance and excessive taxation are made against the Commonwealth Ministry, but the taxpayers must be gratified to know that there is one parliament in Australia that is reducing the load of public debt. An other gratifying feature of the Budget papers is the evidence of reduction in the working costs of government departments In 1921-22 the cost of administration was £2,952,000, and for the year ended 30lh June, 1926, working expenses had actually been reduced to £2,874,000, and it is anticipated that during the current year the amount will be still further decreased. Those figures are an eyeopener to me as they must be to the outside public, especially having regard to",17,Department Retirement Of Mr Harrison

25,Mr Perkins (Eden,"Monaro) [3.26],the increase in population and the progressive Courts. Actually the cost of maintaining the civil service has been reduced from 10s. 9d. to 9s. 2d. per head of population. In spite of the charges of 'extravagance this reduction of administration costs is a feather in the Government's cap, and w ill be warmly approved by the taxpayers. The activities of the Commonwealth Bank also call for favorable comment. In 1924, we were threatened with a nnancial crisis. Men in commerce hardly knew what the morrow would bring for t h . The position of the primary producers was very precarious. W it h in a few months Australia had to export £140,000,000 worth of wheat, wool, and other primary produce. For each £ 1 0 0 worth of goods we exported we received only £90. It was a severe trial for the banking institutions of this country, and the Commonwealth, through the instrumentality of the Commonwealth Bank, came to the rescue of the private banks by offering to advance £15,000,000 worth of notes. That action enabled our exports to be sent oversea, and gave us a quid pro quo, the amount of exchange being reduced to only a few shillings per cent. Although £15,000,000 was made available, the gross amount taken by tbe banks on any one date, and refunded by them w it h in £2,800,000. then carried Australia through one of the worse financial crises it has experienced, and for that action, if for nothing else, it deserves the thanks of this Parliament. The Government has been criticized for a large expenditure on defence. its housing scheme, which, it is alleged, Inspector-General of our -military forces will trespass on State preserves. That( Sir Harry Chauvel) has just drawn may or may not be so, but if we cast our attention to the inadequate provision minds back to the last election we find made for defence, and has urged that that the housing plank in the platform of more money should be spent in that directhe Nationalist party was received by tbe tion. electors with hearty approval. policy speech the Prime Minister said that much more money than appears on the the Government was prepared to finance Defence Estimates is spent on defence. a housing scheme to the extent of The cost of making and maintaining £20,000,000.

In tbe minds of decent homes, this would become a conthe public there are three outstanding tented democracy. A few months ago awards of the Arbitration there was evidence of a disturbing bolshevik element in this country, and even to-day some of the proposals of the Labour party are too bolshevistic for honourable members on this side to accept; but such views would largely disappear if the workers were provided with better houses. When I was in Adelaide a few weeks ago some of the 1,000 homes that are being erected by the Government on the outskirts of the city were pointed out to me, and I was told that many of the occupants of them, although they were Labour supporters before they acquired their own homes, had ceased to vote Labour. In that locality tbe Nationalist candidate polled as many votes at the recent election as did the Labour candidate. The Commonwealth Government would be well advised to proceed with its housing scheme as soon as possible. I assure tbe Prime Minister that tbere is a burning anxiety in many parts of the Commonwealth to know when the scheme will be launched. The workers realize that it offers them the only chance tbey are likely to have of obtaining homes of their own. The State Governments are doing all they can, and are eagerly awaiting the promised assistance of the Federal Government. I cannot see that the launching of such a scheme would a short period was only encroach on the rights of the States, or The Commonwealth Bank would be objectionable as a measure of socialism. On Friday last I mentioned tlie expenditure of the Defence Department, and I said that because it was small it would probably be pleasing to honourable members of the Opposition, who do not favour TheI do not pose as a military In his expert, but I venture the opinion that I realize that this debate is leading up things that are now receiving the attention of this Government. The first is the per cayita proposal, the second is the referendum, and the third is the petrol tax. I have heard the question discussed, '' Is Pratten's petrol proposal protective 1"" That question must be answered by this House. I understand that the Prime Minister does not regard the tax as protective; but it appears to me that it .is both protective and revenue producing. Some of the Customs duties agreed to by this Parliament recently were rather high; but even if we regard the petrol tax as purely a protective duty, it is not a high one. If any industry should be' protected, it is that which supplies liquid fuel. While there is peace between the nations, Australia can obtain her requirements of liquid fuel from overseas; but there may come a time when those happy conditions will cease. The tax provides a measure of protection to the shale oil industry. condition of Australia if supplies of liquid fuel from overseas were withheld ? Australia can supply only about one-tenth of the petrol needed for industrial purposes in this country. In view ""of the many attacks made on the Government in connection with this matter, I was gratified to read in the Sydney Daily Telegraph, last this tax. It will be useful to open up shale' deposits, even if they are not immediately developed. It has already been ascertained that certain scientific work has to be undertaken before oil shale deposits can be expected to produce on a commercial basis. In view of the need for meeting to some extent our requirements of liquid fuel, the proposed action of the Government appears necessary. Wheni t was stated during the election campaign that the Government, if returned, would spend £10,000,000 to £15,000,000 during the next ten years on road construction, the announcement was rapturously received by country audiences. whether candidates suggested that the money it was proposed to spend would be obtained from revenue, or whether additional taxation would be imposed in order to meet the cost of the Government's road policy, but any candidate who did not mention the probability of extra taxation did not act honestly. that extra taxation would be imposed for the purpose ? Ifr. Perkins. date at the general election, but in supporting others who were eventually elected, I admitted that such a course would probably be necessary. portant than veracity ? success and veracity went together. Every candidate I supported was returned to this Parliament. imposing extra taxation. not suggest that additional taxation for the specific purpose of main road construction and maintenance would be imposed misled the electors, as it must have been apparent that insufficient money would be available, unless additional revenue were raised. An extra duty upon petrol to provide money for road conWhat would be the struction is the most equitable form of taxation. When taxation matters were under consideration in the New South Wales Parliament two years ago, I was, with others, responsible for holding up, for at least three months, a measure authorizing the collection of taxes based on the weight of motor cars. The Treasurer at that time believed in week, an article supporting a tax on petrol being imposed, but said that the imposition of such a tax was a Pederal and not a State matter. It will be seen that if a State tax were imposed on, say, petrol or tires in New South Wales, the purchasers of those commodities would obtain tbeir supplies in another Statei n order to escape the tax. Taxation based upon the weight of a car would be inequitable, as a person who used his car for, perhaps, a short run on a Sunday afternoon would have to pay the same tax as the owner of a car plying for hire, which might perhaps clover hundreds of miles a week. If a petrol tax is I do not know imposed, the users of cars will be taxed, in proportion to the extent to which they use the roads. monwealth Oil Refineries spirit would not pay anything. owners are using the Commonwealth Oil Refineries product-, and I believe the candidate said only complaint concerning that spirit is that the supply is unequal to the demand.",18,Budget 1926 27

33,Mr Perkins,"A number of motorproduct, do damage to the roads, like other motorists. the question w i th which I intend to deal later. Although the Pederal Government intend to impose a tax on petrol, I do not see why there should be an outcry from motor users generally. There are certain persons whom it is hard to convince that the action proposed to be taken is not in their interests. Although more money is now being spent on road construction and maintenance, it is generally admitted that many of our roads are in a worse condition now than they were in 20 years ago, owing largely to the heavy increase in traffic. In the early days, perhaps, only one sulky would pass a given point on a country road every hour, but, to-day, a motor car passes the same place, perhaps, every few minutes. A sulky, travelling about 7 or' S miles an hour, would have little or no effect upon the road, but motors travelling at 20 or 30 miles an hour do considerable damage. The important work of main road construction and maintenance has grown to such dimensions that the State authorities are unable to cope with it , and, consequently, the Federal Government is proposing the imposition of higher petrol duties in order to raise sufficient money to meet the cost. The proposal of tbe Government, in this connection, has met w it h a good deal of opposition, and is unpopular with the press. No Government can afford to be unpopular w it h the press. instrumental in influencing and moulding roads has been raised by means of munipublic opinion. Although the present Gocipal or shire taxation. vernment was returned with a larger maj o r it y than any other Federal Government, its action, in certain directions immeNew South Wales is now used for road diately caused friction, and, consequently, maintenance. heat; but a government would be unworthy of further support if it surrendered to opposition.

I should be willin g to consider any other proposal whereby the important work of road construction could be carried out without raising the necessary money in the manner proposed. I cannot, however, understand the attitude of honourable members from Western Australia. Three-fifths of the £15,000,000 to be made available to the States will be distributed on a population basis, and the balance on a territorial basis. If the whole of the amount were divided on a population basis, Western Australia would receive less than £1,000,000, but on the proposed basis of distribution it will get about £2,500,000. The sum of £1,500,000, raised in the eastern States, will be provided for the development of Western Australian roads, and yet opposition to the proposal comes from the western State. the incidence of the taxation. Australia complain, since it is to receive £2,500,000, whereas on a population basis it would be entitled to less than £1,000,000? with the point. the case.

During the last quarter of a century there has been a great war, and the nnancial position of Australia has undergone a tremendous change. Twentyfive years ago motor cars were practically unknown. Factories have since increased to an enormous extent, and the population, which was then less than 3,000,000, has more than doubled. I do not go so far as to sav that I am a unificationist; but whether or not unification is our goal, we are all marching in that direction, and must inevitably continue to do so. Commonwealth Government is now accused of encroaching upon State rights. Although the cry that State rights should be preserved commanded a good deal of attention in New South Wales ten or twelve years ago, I am inclined to think that a person who took up that theme today would have a small following. disagree with Sir Alexander Peacock, because I consider that the federal spirit has increased. The boundaries between the various States are now generally regarded as being merely artificial. interests of the eastern half of Australia are recognized as being similar to those of the western portion, and any Government along present Ministry would receive -short shrift. petrol tax, because I supported it on the hustings, and regard it as essential. Nobody likes direct taxation; but I feel sure that after this tax has been in operation for a while its benefit will be realized by all sections. In the TJnited States of America, which is noted for its good roads, motor tires are guaranteed to give four times the mileage obtained in Australia. parison: highways of that country; and if the roads of Australia could be improved to such Duran extent that the mileage of tires was doubled, motorists would have no need to complain of the petrol tax. The mileage varies in different parts of the State in accordance with the quality of the roads. No doubt, a similar I deplore the necessity for a tax on tires, and I hope that the tire manufacturers Consequently the Constiin Australia w ill not look upon it as a protective d u t y ; they are already suffiAlthoughi t may have been ciently protected under the tariff. The Government might well provide in its proposal that the manufacturers shall not use this tax as a means of obtaining additional protection. cise duty ? that, so far as tires are concerned. The petrol tax, however, should be protective to a slight extent to assist local industry. There is no reason why the price of petrol should be raised to any considerable degree; b u t if the distributors of imported petrol had to pay the extra 2d. a gallon, Thei t would be unfair to them. The present Government has done much in the interests of the primary producers. Some persons even say that the Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page)' is "" r u n n in g "" the Ministry, and that its legislation is all in favour of the primary producer. They now object to the petrol tax as injuriously I affecting the primary producer; but tbey cannot have it both ways.

The wool industry was in practically the same situation. H ad the wool-growers not received assistance, they would have been in a serious position. In wheat-growing alone we appear to be making progress. Today, wheat is reaped in places where, twenty years ago, it was not thought possible that it would grow.

I am wondering if , when he was talking about the power of the press, the honorkins) had in mind the attitude of the press during the last general election, or whether he was thinking of the report he is likely to get in the newspapers tomorrow morning. He says that we cannot afford to offend the press. Labour party has always had to fight that section of the press which represents the interests of its wealthy advertisers and supporters, and in spite of this opposition it has been in power in every State and in the Commonwealth, and before long will again be in control of the Commonwealth. Possibly the honourable member remembers the smoke screen of misrepresentation which was thrown out by the press during the last election. History has shown that in nine times out of ten tbe press represents the views, not of the great masses of the people, but of the wealthier sections of the community. The honourable member said also that he supported financing of the Government's road policy by a petrol tax. We heard nothing about that policy at the election. self. not tell the farmers that in order to carry out its roads policy the Government intended to tax the petrol used in farm machinery. Judging by tbe speech delivered by the Treasurer his policy is "" a surplus at any price."" National development and more liberal treatment for old age pensioners, as well as the removal of the anomalies in connection with the payment of invalid pensions, mean nothing to him. Dr. has given more concessions to old-age pensioners than any other government in the history of tbe Commonwealth. has done nothing. When the Treasurer was Leader of the Country party he criticised the then Treasurer, whom he ^charged with having manufactured a surplus. On that occasion he was taken severely to task by the then Prime Minister, the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes). I now in vite the Treasurer to read what the press has to say about his budget. I quote first of all the Sydney Morning Herald, of the 9th July. That newspaper statesDr. Page's handling of some important features of Treasury business on this occasion is not to be commended. . . . And the accounts have been presented in so confused a manner that it is only by complicated calculations that the real position can be ascertained. . . . The effect of the -manipulation must be to make those who take some pains to study the conditions for themselves more and more suspicious of the bona fides of the Commonwealth's The scheme for readjusting Commonwealth' and State financial relationships. The Sydney Morning Herald represents the party which supports the present Government, but we may be sure that, notwithstanding what it may say to-day, it w ill support the Ministry at the next election. Tbe Daily Telegraph of the same date offers this criticism. It is no use continually reminding us that we have a big war debt, the interest of which has to be paid wholly out of taxes. Por if tlie taxpayer had only that burden to carry he would not need to grumble. But, seeing that, since five years ago, the reduction in department running expenses amounts to only £158,000 a year, it is easy to see how the money goes. In 1921 the departments were still inflated by the result of war staffing, which required vast numbers of officials to be engaged at any price for emergency work. Deflation is a very slow process when the departI dealt w it h it myments are costing only such a trifle less than in the peak years. The Treasurer did The Sun of the same date statesDr. Page, however, hides a surplus of over £2,500,000 with the same care-and successthat an ostrich displays in its traditional ruse to escape from the hunter. He is a little shy about surpluses. If one has too big a surplus the pestilent fellows who pay the taxes ask, ""Why not reduce taxation?"" and, as all who have studied politics know, to reduce taxation is ultimate torture to all good Treasurers. Reducing Treasurers became extinct with George Turner. The Sydney News, the business man's newspaper, has this to say about the The people usually have the Parliament and the Government that they deserve. Because the electors have submitted without much T h is Government complaint to the heavy taxation imposed upon them, the burden is now to be increased. Because they can easily be fobbed off with specious statements, Dr. Page waters down his big surplus, and expects the. trick to succeed. And succeed it will, while the people are too indifferent to bother about the nation's finances. Heavier and heavier will grow the burden of taxation while the electors, tolerate a Treasurer who trifles with figures and the distress of the people.",23,Budget 1926 27

55,Mr Lazzarini,"D r . EARL E PAGE -I thought the honourable member took no notice of newspaper criticisms. ting on record the views of the newspapers referred to. statesCommonwealth Budgets from Dr. Page are financial lunacy. Though existing arrangements made Australia pay ber war debt to Britain twice as fast as Britain pays her war debt to America, Dr. Page must needs fling another £1,000,000 of extorted tax into tliat bag. The £2,7SC,000 which he has squeezed from Australian pockets by his Blunder Budget has robbed the workers of that amount of industrial expansion unci of increased active employment. It is now about three years since the Commonwealth Government made arrangements with the British Government for the funding of the Australian floating war debt of about £90,000,000, representing payments made by Great Britain on account of the Commonwealth. Shortly afterwards Britain concluded negotitions with the United States of America for the funding of her war debt at 3£ per cent., and since America furnished Great Britain with a considerable portion of the money with which she financed Australia's war expenditure, it is obvious that as we have to pay Britain5 per cent, on our debt of £90,000,000, the British Government is making a profit of l j per cent, on the transaction. The right honourable the Prime Minister( Mr Bruce) undertook, when last he was in England, to approach the British Government with a view to obtaining concessions, but up to the present nothing has been done. It u r n now to the roads policy of the Government, and I invite honourable members opposite to say what they are going to do about it . should have been furnished ih the budget. It is nearly twelve months since the last Federal elections, and Parliament will go into recess again in a week or two. The budget and the Estimates for the next twelve months will be passed, and we shall then go into recess unti l the Parliament is removed to Canberra. There is some talk of a meeting in January for a month or. two, probably to enable the Government to obtain temporary Supply to carry it over the winter, so that it wiil be unnecessary to sit at Canberra during the cold months. The Government has proposed an expenditure of £20,000,000 [167] on the building of houses. What is it going to do about that? Where is its scheme for the building of houses? It is I am merely puttwelve months since all these promises were put before the electors, but we have The Guardian no practical schemes submitted to give effect to them. I can sympathize with the references of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro to the necessity for good roads, because his electorate is' probably worse served in this regard than any other electorate in Australia. I am able to say so, because I travelled over the electorate during the last by-election campaign there. There is a road in the district called the Prince's Highwaj', but if the Prince is not better as a king than the Prince's Highway is as a road, there will be trouble for the Empirei n the future. A tax is to be imposed on petrol to get in some money for the purpose of road construction. In the Eden-Monaro district there are mountains of granite alongside roads over which at present it is dangerous to travel, and there is no reason why the Government should not find employment for many of the thousands who are now unemployed in Australia in the building of good roads in that district. Its scheme for road construction would appear to depend on the use of imported petrol and the amount of revenue which can be derived from the tax proposed upon it . If motorists prefer to use Commonwealth Oil Refineries petrol, there w ill be no revenue derived from the tax, and no roads will be made by the Commonwealth Government. Three years ago the Prime Minister told the people of England that everything was all right in Australia, and they would do well to come out here. He told them that a commission was appointed to submit a scheme for unemployment in surance. Where is that scheme? TheM o r e information commission is still sitting, and tens of thousands of pounds of the taxpayers' money have been wasted without result. We shall probably receive no report from the commission unti l the dying hours of this Parliament, and then the Government and its supporters will go to the electors promising that an unemployment insurance scheme will be brought forward.

The various schemes for national insurance, health insurance, unemployment insurance, road construction, and housing will be scrapped by the Government. The Treasurer led a political party here a few years ago, and I should like to know what has become of the Country party's policy. Apparently it has been scrapped, also. Honourable members will recall the mighty boast about decentralization, and the intention to establish the factory alongside the primary product. about that? hold upon State finances, and so has prevented the State. Governments from, carrying out work to bring about decentralization, which, but for his action, they might have undertaken. The honourable gentleman went about the country with his thirteen points, one of which was decentralization. He delivered a lecture in my electorate on the question, and some of my people were concerned about it. They thought there was some prospect that something would be done to bring about decentralization. It was thought that rural credits would bo established through the Commonwealth Bank, and money would be made to available to bring the secondary industry and the factory into the district in which the primary product was produced. It was believed that in that way rural centres would be developed; but we have found the financial arrangements of the Commonwealth conducted in the interests of the Country party's policy of free trade. Reference is made in the budget to the policy of the Loan Council. Clause5 of the agreement with the States readsThe Commonwealth shall not raise new money in Australia, but shall satisfy its requirements by overseas borrowing. I should like to know what the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Pratten) has to say to that. He repeatedly told this House that borrowing abroad must stop, because it is detrimental to the development of Australia. The honourable gentleman asserted that Australia must finance herself, but he is now a member of a government that proposes to satisfy State Ministers its requirements by overseas borrowing. No one can challenge the statement that we can borrow overseas only by importI see-the Mining goods from the countries in which our loans are floated. If we float a loan for .£1,000,000 . or £10,000,000, whether in Britain or in America, we can do so only by importing the products of the secondary industries of the country, from which the money is borrowed. Every penny borrowed abroad is so much taken from Australian industries, and, as a result of our borrowing abroad, Australian industries are languishing. That is the policy of the Government, and is in accord with tbe free trade policy of tbe Country party. The Treasurer bas said that he is acting upon the advice of private finanWhat has the Treasurer done cial experts. I do not know who they are, He has put a stranglebut I know that private financial experts advised Mr Fisher, when he was Prime Minister during the war period, that it was impossible to raise a loan of £4,000,000 in Australia. They advised that the financial fabric of the Commonwealth would be destroyed if the attempt were made to float a loan of £4,000,000 or £6,000,000 in Australia, for destructive purposes in'time of war. It was admitted that we might raise money within Australia in times of peace, for its permanent development and welfare, but the present Government apparently believes that it is necessary to go abroad for money, even for this purpose. Borrowing abroad stifles the policy. of protection. Let no man claim to be a good protectionist if he stands behind a policy of borrowing abroad. The two policies are contradictorv. ber noticed that the Queensland Lf^our Government has adopted the practice? master-General( Mr Gibson) telling us what the Queensland Government is doing; some other honourable member will remind us of what the South Australian Government is doing, and still another will talk of Mr Lang and the Workmen's Compensation Act passed by the New South Wales Government.

Wbeni n 1920 publicity was given through the press to the intention of the then Premier of New South Wales( Mr Story) to introduce a Rural BankB ill , the Commonwealth Treasurer ( Sir Joseph Cook) introduced an amendment of the Commonwealth Bank Act, proposing the transfer of the note issue to the bank, and containing a clause the object of which was to give the associated banks and nnancial institutions of tbe country the legal right to refuse circulation of credit instruments of the State rural banks. passed, the chairman of directors of tbe Bank of New South Wales said that the rural banks would only be feeders to the private banks, because the Commonwealth Government had made them so. said that borrowing abroad stultifies the policy of protection, because it can only be done by permitting the admission of the products of the secondary industries of the countries from which the money is borrowed. The Government that pursues such a policy is a revenue tariff government, and not one prepared to give adequate protection to the industries of this country. By its proposal for the abolition of the -per capita payments to the States, the Government proposes to give up all fields of direct taxatiou. Commonwealth direct taxation had to be imposed to meet war expenditure.

The Government proposes to depend upon indirect taxation, which the taxpayer pays without realizing that he is paying it , and to leave all direct and unpopular taxation to It is another instance of the Country party giving effect to its policy, not It has absolute power over the only of free trade, but also of surrendering all fields of direct taxation to the States. I am not speaking from the It is in a position, through tbe State rights point of view; but I think the future outlook of the Commonwealth will be serious indeed if it evacuates enNo State Government possesses tirely the field of direct taxation and depends for the whole of its revenue c n excise and Customs duties. Speaking of the Commonwealth Bank, the Treasurer showed that although for a certain period the bank's profits had declined, they were picking up again. He implied that this was a normal state of affairs; but, to my mind, the profits of the bank should never have declined. If the institution had not been hamstrung, its profits would have increased. If it had been allowed to When that legislation was compete openly with the associated banks, and to deal direct w it h the farmers, by the establishment of branches in r u r a l areas, giving overdrafts at lower rates of I have interest than those charged by the associated banks, not only would our r u r a l industries have been better developed, but the bank itself would have made a much larger profit, to the detriment of the private banks. I want to show what profits were made by these private banks during the period following the war, when, according to the Treasurer, the Commonwealth Bank's profits'necessarily showed a shrinkage. The CommonAvealth Bank having all the resources of Australia behind it , is in a position to take risks which other banks dare not take in the peaceful development of the Our nation. D u r in g the war, no doubt, it The did its work well; but it was not established by the Labour party to serve the purposes of war. It s founders had in mind the peaceful development of AusThis proves that it is"" tralia in t i e interests of the general masses of the people, and not in the in terests of a few individuals. It has not been doing the work for which it was founded. It s operations have been so limited by the present administration A revenue that it snowed a loss during a period when private banks made an enormous profit. In 1919 the associated banks had a paid-up capital of £35,696,940, their reserves amounted to £23,543,496, and their annual dividends totalled £2,492,637. Five -years later, in 1924, their paid-up the States. . capital amounted to £55,496,264, their reserves had increased to £40,384,224, and their annual dividends totalled £5,046,559. years, the associated hanks watered their capital to the extent of £20,000,000, and increased their reserves by £17,000,000, while their dividends in one year had increased by £2,500,000. In this period of five years, taking tbeir reserves, watered stock and increased dividends, they actually made £6,000,000 more than the whole of their total capital in 1919, much of which was also watered. These figures make interesting reading. These profits were made at a period when we were called upon to stretch the financial resources of the country to the uttermost in order to keep development going and to keep people employed. Yet the Commonwealth Bank retired from open competition with the private banks, leaving those engaged in secondary and primary industries to contribute heavily to the profits of those institutions. I venture to say that two-thirds of those profits have been drawn from the primary producers, and that to-day tbere are tens of thousands of those producers in the hands of the banks. A t least seven-tenths of the men on the land who are h it by a drought are obliged to approach the p r i vate banks for assistance.

He gets a fictitious currency created by means of a cheque notes issued to the associated banks book, and for that he has to pay interest at the rate of 8 per cent. The conclusion of the story of this farmer's difficulty is Thus, in a period of five seen in the figures I have given showing the enormous profits made by the associated banks. These institutions are the biggest parasites in the community. When they give overdrafts they give nothing but figures in books. the borrowers. use the money. .1.924, when the associated banks had not more than £20,000,000 of legal currency, they expanded credit to the extent of £197,000,000.

In his budget speech, dealing with this subject, the Treasurer saidThe action of the banlc in the crisis of 1924 has sometimes been criticized by those who have not realized the gravity or the complexity of the situation. They appear to think that the Commonwealth Bank itself could have dealt directly with the producers, instead of promising assistance to the other banks. Such a course was impracticable. To give one reason only, it may be pointed out that, to prevent inflation which might have been permanent, with the consequent lessening of tlie purchasing power of money, it was necessary that the advances be repaid within a definite short period. This repayment could not have been depended upon in the case of individual advances to producers, but the banks could be so depended upon. The Treasurer's statement is humbug, and would not convince a school boy. If the Commonwealth Bank issued credit to the associated banks on which they operated to finance the producers, it is obvious that the banks could not meet their obligations as borrowers unti l the producers had met their obligations to them. The Commonwealth Bank could have financed the producers directly, had it not been prevented from doing so by the strangulation policy pursued by the present Government, as a result of which the bank has not as many branches throughout Australia as it should have. In a further statement the Treasurer spilled tbe whole can of beans, and for his naive admissions be should be sacked from the Treasury. He saidTbe banks did not avail themselves of their full rights under the arrangement. Actually they borrowed sums which at no time exceeded £2,800,000. They paid interest to the Commonwealth Bank at the Bank of England rate of the day, and they repaid all the advances within a few months. Although the associated banks never drew more than £2,800,000 from the Commonwealth Bank they extended their credits on that basis to £15,000,000. In effect, the Commonwealth Bank was functioning in the interests of the associated banks, and against the interests of the nation, particularly the primary producers. They paid interest only from day to day, but from the unfortunate individuals to whom they gave credit they exacted interest for three, six, or twelve months, or for any other arbitrary' terms they chose to fix. Instead of the Commonwealth Bank being utilized by a Countiy party Treasurer to finance the producers, it gave to private banks the £15,000,000 against water-logged securities in London, and to pay interest from day to day on a maximum of £2,800,000. The Treasurer knew that that would be the result of the arrangement he made. In moving the second reading of the Commonwealth BankB ill in 1924, he said, referring to the Commonwealth Notes BoardThe board was convinced that the banks had built credits on the right to get notes just as freely as they would have done if the notes actually had been in their possession. Even at that early period, when he was forcing the Commonwealth Bank to do something which the Notes Board was disinclined to do, he knew that the private banks would expand their credit upon a very small basis of actual borrowing. A little later in the same speech, dealing with the issue of £10,000,000 in notes to the associated banks against securities in London, he saidThe result would be, not merely that £10,000,000 had been added to the local currency, but cheque money manufactured by the banks would further add to the means of payment in Australia. . . . We shall be taking only a moderate view of the possibilities if we suppose that the means of payment in Australia were added to by £20,000,000 or £25,000,000. In those words the Treasurer admitted that cheque pounds are currency. Ten million pounds would grow to £30,000,000 or £40,000,000, but interest would be paid on only such portion of the £10^000,000 as might be required to meet any emergency rush on currency. P r i marily the object of this financial arrangement was to finance the primary producers, and facilitatethe marketing of their products overseas, but the primary producers paid heavily for tbe service they received. If the Commonwealth Bank had been functioning in the interests of the nation, to tide it over a difficult period, and had charged, as it should have done, only bare costs for its services, at least £10,000,000 would have been saved to the primary producers. I come now to the most serious aspect of this business. Here is the evidence of the underground engineering by the associated banks and private financiers. In each of his four budgets, the Treasurer has referred to deflation and the need for reverting to the gold standard. Deflation is as old as banking and the British national debt itself, for it started in 1694, when the Bank of right tq draw England was founded concurrently w i th the establishment of the British national debt. These things always go togetherforeign wars, a national debt, and private banks, and tbey have enslaved most of the nations of tbe world. The proposal to revert to a gold standard is used as the -spieler uses a thimble to cover the pea; it is, at best, mere cant and humbug. The -gold standard is based on the free circulation of gold, and the old law that payment of amounts exceeding £2 may be demanded in gold, amounts under £2 in silver, and amounts under Is. in copper. Notes are issued against a reserve of gold, and the holder of the notes is supposed to be able to demand gold for them. Upon that basis, the Banking Act was erected, and every banking crisis has been due to the failure of the gold standard. It is impossible to bave a gold standard together with a paper currency which is legal tender; the two things are incompatible. If paper currency is legal tender, the holder of the notes cannot demand gold for them. A lot of publicity was given recently to the proposal to re-establish the gold standard by importing gold from America. .The absurdity of that talk is proved by the following extract from the Argus of the 8th July last: A GLUT IN GOLD. f3,000,000 SHIPPED TO 'Fiasco. left for San Francisco"" to-day with £1,000,000. in gold, being tbe third shipment of Australian gold to be sent to America recently. The steamer Mahura lifted £1,000,000 worth on 22nd May, and a similar amount was shipped by the steamer Ventura on 16th June. The shipments 'have been made through the Commonwealth! Bank. accumulating in tlie Commonwealth Bank for some time, and last year the private banks imported gold to the amount of £10,000,000. They fwve since found that a large portion of the metal was not actually needed for reserve purposes, and have deposited it with the Comno one can say bow much currency is monwealth Bank. That institution, acting on. the needed per head of the population. To state principle that large holdings of gold were unit in another way, no one can say when a economic, has exported £3,000,000, and has also transferred over £4,000,000 from the banking department to the note issue department. We were told that, in order to restore the gold standard, gold must be imported from America, but as soon as we had obtained £10,000,000 worth from that source, there was a glut of it, and we are now shipping it back to America. If we return to a gold standard, the position, according to the figures published Afr. Lazzarini. in the Year-Book for 1925, would beSavings Bank deposits, £176,871,477; Commonwealth notes,. £56,890,225; bank deposits at call, £106,378,836; fixed deposits at six or twelve months, £133,273,020; making a total of £463,413,558. Against that total there is in Australia £43,914,733 in gold, or barely ten sovereigns for every £100 claim against gold. This expedient of returning to the gold standard was used after the Napoleonic wars, after the civil war in America, and after every war in every country, to double the national debt and increase the power of the private banks and financiers. value of war bonds. By deflation and the reversion to the gold standard, the value of bonds is increased. If a bond of a face value of £100 would keep a man for six months in 1918, and the same bond would keep him for twelve months in 1924, its value had doubled. That is the process that occurred after the Napoleonic wars and after the civil war of America, when the United States of America repudiated its greenbacks. At one time £100 on paper was worth only £60 in gold. Tbis policy of deflation and reverting to tbe gold standard is a danger to the country. We hear much talk of restoring the free export of gold, but the mere lifting of the ban on exports does not mean the restoration of the currency to a gold basis. Gold is not exported as currency, but as bullion; it is exported like any other metal or commodity. I challenge the Gold has been Treasurer, or any person Avho regards himself as a financial expert, to say where, in national finance, safety ends and inflation begins. With finance and currency controlled as they are at present, countiy has ceased to be financially safe and when it is suffering from inflation of currency. It may be said that the fluctuation of prices is an indication. Admittedly it is; but it is impossible to draw a clear line of demarcation between safe finance and inflation.

78,Mr Lazzarini,"That is the point;per .cent, of the currency is represented by cheque pounds, .which, when judged by all known currency laws, are spurious and base. But there has been no inflation in the issue of Commonwealth notes. Let me now come back to more orthodox tests, for, up to the present, I have been enunciating doctrines that some bonorable members may regard as unorthodox. We have been told that huge inflation has taken place. We may judge whether that is so by the only law by which it can be judged, namely, the substance at the back of the note issue in comparison with the prices of commodities. If we take 100 as the index figure of the cost of living in 1914, we find that the figure for 1920, which was the peak year after the war, was 295. In 1914, the Commonwealth notes were backed by 42.90 per cent., and in 1920 by 41.54 per cent., of gold, a difference of only 1.36 per cent. Can the Treasurer contend that a difference of 1.36 per cent, in the gold backing of Australian notes, between the years 1914 and 1920, accounted for the increase in prices indicated by the figures 100 and 295? But, when we consider the inflation of manufactured cheque pounds, we see where the cause lies. In 1914, the associated banks held legal currency to the amount of £21,341,026, and they manufactured cheque pounds to the face value of £115,507,210. In 1920, they held £20,704,097 of legal currency, and they manufactured cheque pounds to the face value of £160,693,541. Obviously, the Commonwealth note was not responsible for the inflation in the year when inflation and high prices were most marked; but the associated banks, with £750,000 less of legal currency increased credit expansion by £45,186,331. Inflation to-day, as in the past, is brought about by the manipulation of manufactured cheque pounds by the associated banks, which receive a l l . the profits. The clearing bouse returns also provide an indication of bow the associated banks have inflated the currency. In .1914, the clearing house returns, for the capital cities, were £807,695,000, when the legal currency was-£21,000,000; but, in 1920, the clearing house returns were £1,896,860,000, an increase of £1,089,165.000 over the year 1914. Those are the figures that indicate the enormous increase in the paper instruments of credit created by the associated banks-credit s which are exchanged for the commodities of life, and enter into the transactions of trade and commerce. There was an enormous increase of £45,000.000 in the cheque pounds, ancl an increase of £1,089,000,000 in the clearing-house exchanges of the nation; but, behind the banks, tliere was only £20,000,000 of legal currency. In the days of despots, the issuing ""of legal currency was the prerogative of the Crown, but as the despot has been dethroned, and democracy has taken his place, that prerogative has passed to the government; We know what happened when monarchs held the prerogative. We know what happened under the Bourbons of France, and Henry VIII . and James II . of England. There were business failures, unemployment, starvation, and suicide; and all those things are threatened by the wholesale usurpation by private banking institutions of the instruments of credit. The figures I have quoted show a species of jugglery that should make the world's greatest fakir turn green with envy. I do not wish to approach the subject of the rural bank in a party spirit; but I regret, with other honourable members on this side, that the Government has not done more to make that bank something of which this Parliament can feel proud. Australia cannot indefinitely develop its primary industries and neglect its secondary industries;, both must be developed concurrently. The bank should have been used, as the Treasurer said it would be used, to assist both secondary and primary industries. A ll countries that have elected to rely mainly on rural and pastoral development have remained as serf nations to the more highly developed industrial nations. It is possible to go too far in promoting rural development. We can produce too many primary products for our markets 12,000 miles away. Side by side with the development of primary production we should distribute the population more widely over the country by establishing secondary industries in country centres. We should also develop our mineral deposits, particularly coal aud iron. Very few country towns in Australia can boast of a factory. To bring 10,000 more migrants to develop the rural industries of this country will overload those industries. A country must develop in two ways-it must rest on a basis of scientific primary production, and it must possess large secondary industries engaged in mass production. The Rural Bank of New South Wales, hamstrung as it is by the amending Commonwealth BankA c t , introduced by Sir Joseph.Cooki n 1920, is doing more than the so'-called Rural Bank of the Commonwealth for the primary producers. The Treasurer has told us that rural credits would bring about decentralization; the factory would be taken to the primary producer, and rural centres would become hives of industry by the waving of his fairy wand. alas! bank, because tbe food on which it should thrive is eaten by the private banks. Althoughi t was said that, in establishing the Commonwealth Bank, tbe Labour party was embarking upon a policy' of frenzied finance, and that the issue of Fisher's "" flimsies"" would bring about financial chaos and ruin , the bank to-day is an institution of which the Labour party is proud. It w ill , however, never be the success its -founders intended whilst it is used only as a hireling of the associated banks, in whose interests it is now functioning instead of operating on behalf of the nation. We shall always be confronted with pressing problems and nnancial stringency while we have to submit to budgets such as this and we have a government which, depends upon Customs and excise revenue to enable it to carry out its policy. There is nothing in the budget worthy of commendation, and the successful development of our primary and secondary industries and the financial stability of tbe Commonwealth cannot be assured u n t i l the Labour party is in control of the Treasury. Mrj : FRANCIS (Moreton) [ 5 . 2 2 ] should like to add my meed of praise to the Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page) for having introduced the budget in record time, and to congratulate the Government upon the extent to which our war and national debts have been, reduced. I should like to deal at length with the proposed abolition of the per capita paymentsto the States, the referendum proposals and the imposition of additional Customs duties in order to provide sufficient funds for the construction and maintenance of main roads;, but as we shall have an opportunity to consider those subjects later, I shall occupy the limited time at my disposal in referring to the Government's proposals in connection with the payment of a bounty on seed cotton. It w ill be seen, from the Treasurer's budget speech, that the Government propose to pay a bounty of l $ d . per lb. on raw seed cotton, although, after an exhaustive examination, tbe Tariff Board recommended a bounty of 2d. per lb. For the information of honourable members, I propose to submit some particulars concerning the development and possibilities of the cotton in But, dustry, which has recently been deA l l we see is this puny rural veloped in Queensland, and to a which is left to starve, limited extent in New South Wales. Following upon the shortage of cotton during the war, and realizing the urgent need for the Empire to be self-supporting in this and other essential commodities, a search was made by the cotton spinning interests of GreatB r it a in to ascertain the most suitable country within the. Empire in which superior, long-stapled cotton could be produced. A f t e r an exhaustive investigation,, the sub-tropical areas and forest lands of Queensland were considered to be the most suitable for the establishment of the long-stapled cotton industry, and in that State the industry has been developed. The British-Australian Cotton Association which was then formed has spent a considerable sum of money in erecting ginneries and in developing the industry in Queensland and in the northern part of New South Wales. For some years the Commonwealth and the governments of the cotton-producing States entered into an arrangement under which the price of seed cotton was guaranteed, based on a system of grading, under which the industry has been established, particularly in QueensI land, where about 95 per cent, of Australian-grown cotton is produced. In order to give honourable members some .idea of the extent to which the seed cotton production in Australia has increased I quote the following figures :-fear. Production. Guaranteed lbs. Price. 1921 ... 950,000 :.. 5^0. 1922 ... 3,900,000 ... 5*d1923 ... 11,500,000 ... 5id1924 ... 15,000,000 ... 5d."" 1925 ... 18,000,000 ... 5d. 1926 ... 11,500,000 ... 4id. It is estimated that this season .there will be between 7,000 and 8,000 growers enr gaged in supplying ginneries w i th cotton, whilst the area cultivated will be approximately 40,000 acres. Seed cotton production is of particular importance to Australia, because it provides for further development in sub-tropical areas which are as yet very sparsely populated. The cotton plant has great drought-resisting capacity once the seed has germinated and the young plants have become established. Many mixed'farmers whose maize and other crops have been ruined by drought have been saved from financial disaster by the small returns derived from their cotton area, which has withstood the drought. farmers also supplement tbeir incomes by growing small areas of cotton. Tbere w ill be no danger for many years of over-production of seed cotton of the superior staple and grade now grown in Australia, which is in marked contrast to the position in relation to crops of certain hard and soft fruits. Cotton probably enters more largely into articles required for human needs than any other commodity. Over £13,000,000 worth of cotton goods are imported annually, and if the seed cotton, cotton yarn, and cotton textile manufacture industries could be effectively established in Australia, a very large proportion of the £13,000,000 worth of goods imported could be made in Australia, thus giving employment to approximately 20,000 workmen, representing sustenance for, say, 80,000 persons. The significance of this industry may be gauged from the following facts. the matter of defence, cotton is necessary for the manufacture of cordite, without which no rifle can be fired or big gun discharged. It enters into tbe manufacture of motor tyres to a greater extent even than rubber, and for either peace or war motor transport it is indispensable. Cotton covers the widest field in the textile industry, as it is used in the manufacture of the coarsest cotton canvas and of the finest muslin. It forms the basis of the artificial-silk industry. is the raw material of the knitted 'underwear and hosiery industry. It is used in the woollen manufactories. It s by-products are used by the margarine and soap makers. It provides the dairyman and poulterer with a valuable stock food. To the papermaker it w ill supply a high-class pulp. Bedding manufacturers, tbe upholsterers, and motor-car body builders use the waddings made from cotton waste and the lower grades. There is scarcely an industry, and certainly not a home"" into which cotton in some form or other is not used. FromChemistry and Industry, of the TJnited States of America, I quote the following statement to illustrate the importance of this new industry :. IfI were asked ""What won the war""? I would unhesitatingly answer, "" The cotton plant."" Let us consider for a moment some of the things the eotton plant contributed. The four outstanding things required by a soldier in any war are food, clothing, housing and ammunition. Second only in importance to the nitrogenous foods for soldiers are the fats Poultry and pig that they must have. Most of the lard consumed by our armies, was compound lord, made from cotton-seed oil.' Much of the butter they ate was oleomargarine, of whioh cotton-seed oil was the principal component. The dairy products and meat which they consumed came from cattle largely fed with cotton-seed meal and hulls. Much of the clothing of our soldiers was made of eotton. Their hats were made of felt, a product of cotton linters. The buttons on their uniforms, when not metal, were celluloid, also a product of cotton linters. The artificial leather used in their equipment was made from cotton linters, and the real leather came from cattle which were fed on cotton seed meal and bulls. The tents which covered our soldiers were made of eotton, the mattresses upon which they slept were stuffed with cotton, and their bedclothes were either made from cotton or from wool of sheep whioh were fed to a large extent on cotton-seed meal. The basis of ammunition, or explosives, was cellulose and glycerides, one coming from cotton linters and the other from cotton oil. This was such an important factor during the World War that the War Department took over all the cotton-seed oil mills and operated thenv In under licence. Can you find one single source that contributed so much to the welfare of our soldiers as the cotton plant ? It may not have won the war, but we certainly could not have won without it. The cotton seed produces four main products: the linters, meal, hulls, and. oil. A risumi of the history of the cotton seed products industry will show that within a space of half a century the chemist has developed from this little insignificant seed sixteen principal commercial products and hundreds of minor ones. To-day there' are hundreds of millions of dollars invested in plants using the cotton It seed as a raw material, and this is the second largest manufacturing industry in the southernStates. It is not, however, confined to the southern States, for most of the large refineries producing the finished products are located in the big cities of the east and middle west. Hundreds of chemists have made this little cotton seed their life study, and it is entirely through the science of chemistry that the industry has been developed. . W it h your permission, Mr Chairman, I propose to hand in for inclusion in Hansard a list of the principal products made from cotton seed. If the honorahle member wishes the list included in Hansardi t must be read.

I am at a loss to know _ why a similar measure of assistance is not being given to the cotton industry. If an adequate bounty is provided for the first three years this industry will prosper; but if it is forced to attempt to subsist on the present bounty there is no prospect of its success. It seems to me that, if the bounty is to be less than 2d. a lb. during the first few years, the inevitable result will be that less cotton will be produced and the industry will gradually pass out of existence. will mean that the expenditure of, possibly, over £500,000 by way of bounty will be wasted, and those engaged in the industry ruined.

Obviously the Ministry is satisfied that the industry is important enough to deserve encouragement; but it is necessary; if it is to be successful, to promote increased production in both the primary and secondary cotton industries. The Government is wise in combining two aspects of cotton production by giving a bounty on seed cotton and cotton yarn; but a further step is necessary, namely, a scientific scale of duties will even be required on all imported cotton apparel and fabrics, if the industry is to be permanently established, and Australia's Mr J. Francis. interests properly conserved. To-day The Governthe ginneries are working only at 25 per cent, of their f u ll capacity. If and as the rethe production were substantially inof generous tariff assistance, creased, the overhead charges would be proportionately reduced. If it granted an adequate bounty in the initial stages, the Government could possibly reduce it after three or four years without crippling the industry. procedure in other industries, so far as the Customs tariff is concerned. the cotton industry to be bolstered up indefinitely by a bounty.

It should be remembered that the last five years of the cotton industry have been almost entirely experimental and devoted to testing Australian conditions and the best types of cotton. It may be said The Tariff Board based its that the industry is only now in a posion the fact that tion to really proceed on well-defined time lines.

It has also to be remembered that an entirely new primary industry has to adjust itself to strange conditions of climate and soil, and that a much longer period is necessary to achieve sound results in such a primary industry than would be necessary in any secondary industry. There can be no doubt as the quality of the cotton produced in Australia. According to a press cable from London last week, Colonel Evans, late Director of Cotton Culture in Queensland, has borne testimony to that fact, which is also supported by the",35,Sydney Wednesday Th E Steamer Sierra

I believe that when the local industry is firmly established, it may be able to supply 75 per cent, of the requirements for yarn by means of a lint of the right staple grade and textile strength. I urge, therefore, that the provisions of the measure be made sufficiently elastic to allow of that alteration. I notice that the Minister stated, in effect, that the desired bounty of 2d. a lb. on seed cotton was equal cost He suggested that that was, therefore, excessive. But what do we find is the position in regard to other primary industries ? The Australian production cost of jam is 6£d. per lb., and the tariff 3d. per lb., equal to 46 per cent.

W h y should the same percentage of protection be excessive in the case of cotton f growers made strong representations for a bounty of 2d. per l b . ? MT . J. Queensland member has been nearly snowed under with communications from anxious growers on this question. There is no prospect of the industry succeeding unless a bounty of at least 2d. per lb. is granted. I am firmly of dustry is encouraged in its early stages, it will, in time, do for Australia what wool has done in the past. Government is not prepared to grant greater assistance now, it will not develop. In September last, Parliament agreed to the duty on sewing cottons and threads being 25 per cent. British, and 35 per cent, general. Thread Mills Limited, of Leicester, England, has floated a company in Australia, Regarding the and is now asking for an additional capital of £150,000 to enable it to manufacture in the Commonwealth the whole of Australia's cotton and cotton thread requirements, valued at £750,000 per annum. If similar duties were imposed on other classes of cotton goods, additional factories would be established in Australia, with the result that the Australian seed cotton industry would be so assisted as to make it possible for the bounty of 2d. per lb. to be reduced, or even discontinued. Seeing that the Tariff Board based its recommendation on a world's to 50 per cent. of the parity of lOd. per l b . , and that the price of production in Australia, of seed cotton to-day is only 8d. per l b . , I cannot understand the Minister's unwillingness to grant a bounty of 2d. per lb. If , for a period of three years a bounty of 2d. per l b. on seed cotton were granted, this new industry would be permanently established in Australia. The position could then be reviewed.

The Commonwealth and State Governments represent tbe same citizens, and as the future prosperity iind progress of the States is closely linked with those of the Commonwealth, the Government would do well to review or postpone the operation of its proposal for the abolition of the per capita payments to tbe States. The Government can find no excuse for tbe proposed exercise of a supreme power j n this matter other than the contention that it is unreasonable that any authority should enjoy the expenditure of funds which it does not itself I think that' the Preraise. That is the one ground upon which the Treasurer might attempt to justify his action. Buti f the honourable gentleman puts that forward as his chief reason for a re-adjustment of the financial relations between the Commonwealth and the States, his insincerity . requires no further proof than the statement of the fact that at the present E x a c t l y . It would be moment the Government proposes by the imposition of special taxation to raise moneys which it intends to band over to the State Governments for road construction, which is essentially a duty, 'not of the Commonwealth, but of the State Governments. A more substantial reason than any which have so far been advanced is necessary to justify a proposal which has caused serious concern to the 'State Governments as to the sources from which revenue tq carry out their undertakings is to be derived. The State authorities should be left to work out the destinies of their respective Statesi n their own way. They should not be expected to come as mendicants to tbe Pederal authority for financial assistance. The Government's proposal must have the effect oflowering the financial standing of the States abroad, and in this respect it must be regarded as invidious and unfair. cial Times says that what the Government proposes w ill improve the credit of all governments in Australia. proved, and the weight of facts and argument does not support that contention.

130,Mr Makin,"In South' Australia wein which its agencies are operating. The policy of the South Australian Government has been seriously interfered with because a Commonwealth agency has declined to pay to the South Australian treasury revenue collected by it , but rightly due to the State. The Commonwealth has no more right than bas a private individual to collect taxation under the law of a State and not pay it over to tlie State Treasury. Government could obtain redress against a private individual in a court of law. but the Commonwealth Government is apparently immune in that regard. It has no right to take advantage of its position to deprive a State of revenue which is justly due to it . It ing to honourable members to note that for the current year the Treasurer revenue wil l amount to £40,500,000, an increase of £1,301,117.

One can only conclude that Australian industries nusl. be sufferiug while wei are borrowing so much abroad and having our markets flooded with imported goods. Another ing tion vernment to get out of certain fields of direct taxation which were entered w i th the idea of helping to pay for our war obligations. Until we have f u l l y met our obligations in regard to the war I do not think we are justified in doing so. The State Legislative Councils are' not likely to impose those forms of direct taxation which were designed by the Commonwealth to fal l mainly on the wealthy classes of the community. The effect will be that instead of the wealthy paying their just due to help to meet our war obligations, the greater portion of the burden will"" fall on the shoulders of tbe poor. during the war that the Commonwealth's direct taxation should take a certain form, and I certainly resent a proposal which can only have the effect of relieving the wealthy of their r i g h t f u l obligation to take a fair share of the burden of the cost of the war, and transfer it by means of Customs taxation to the shoulders of those who can least afford to pay it. The honourable member for Eden Monaro( Mr Perkins) has reiterated the statement-whic h I am afraid from the The State number of times it has been said here is likely to become the accepted truth that honourable members of the Labour party bad little or no hand in the introduction of invalid and old-age pensions. As a matter of fact, as I shall show, it was really responsible for, or at least the compelling force must be somewhat disturbbehind, the introduction of those pensions. The honourable member has succeeded Sir Austin Chapman, who at all estimates that the Customs times posed as the great friend of the in valid and old-age pensioners, and is endeavouring to make others believe that the mantle of his predecessor, as. champion of the cause of the pensioners, has fallen upon his shoulders. To disprove the honorable member's statement, I wish was the effect to place on record a few facts. On the 19th March, 1908, Mr Andrew Fisher, W h e t h e r it was the who was then Leader of the Labour party which was really responsible for keeping in power the Government of the day, moved the following motion in the House:That all the words after the word "" That"" be left out with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words "" whereas the electors have thrice returned a large majority of members matter which is causof the Commonwealth Parliament pledged to some anxiety is the' intenprovide a Pederal system of old-age pensions, of the Commonwealth Goand whereas the State Parliaments of Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania have made no provision for the payment of old-age pensions, this House is of opinion that tlie passing of a measure to give effect to tlie expressed will of the people is an urgent public duty."" On the 10th June, 1908, less than three months afterwards, the Governor General assented to the Invalid and Old-age PensionsB ill . From Henry Gyles Turner's The First Decade of the Commonviealth of Australia, page 164, I quote the following:In the other House, the Labour members chafed under tlie prolonged delays of the We laid it down definitely Ministry in dealing with a matter which in Governors' speeches and on public platforms they had declared' to be of prime importance.

132,Mr Makin,"doubtless foreseeing that success in dealing Until the meeting, to which I referred, with it would be a ""trump card in their next took place, there was no idea that this bill electoral programme. 1908, Mr Fisher, who had succeeded to the leadership of the .Labour party, moved a resoHaving regard to that frank declaration, lution to the effect that, the electors having ] hope that ministerial supporters will thrice returned a large majority of members not, in future, endeavour to rob the pledged to provide a Federal system of oldLabour party of the kudos that rightly age pensions, the House was of opinion thai the passing of a measure to give effect to the belongs to it for the introduction of this expressed will of the people was an urgent humanitarian legislation, and its subsepublic duty. The speech in which he supquent liberalization. ported his motion was temperate and telling, albeit he said some severe things about the attitude of the States towards the subject. some heat in this committee last week, and When he was called upon by interjections to was responsible for a display of bitterness say how the money was to be provided, he wisely replied that if he formulated a scheme on the part of the Treasurer and the he wouia be accused of dictating to the GoAttorney-General. The ebullition of temvernment. His contention was that such a per, when endeavouring to protect the measure had been demanded by the people on Government against the very effective"" grounds of common humanity, had been promised by the Ministry, and should not be attack made by the honourable member for neglected another day. The Prime Minister Yarra( Mr Scullin) in regard to the was suave and approving. He fully recognized the purpose of the motion. Further, in reference to the bill itself, I find on page 168 of the same bookIn both chambers it received the solid support of the Labour party, as might have been expected from Mr Fisher's frank declaration, "" as far as the Labour party is concerned the first bite out of the Surplus Revenue Bill will be the fund to provide old-age pensions."" Under the original bill of 1908, the invalid pensions were not to come into operation until a date to be proclaimed; but the Labour party compelled the Government to proclaim those provisions immediately and finance them from the Surplus Revenue Act. Even those who supported the government of the day were prepared to give to the Labour party due credit for what it had done to establish old-age and invalid pensions. Senator Mulcahy was, in most respects, a bitter opponent of the Labour party and the reforms it advocated, but he had sufficient sense of fairness to say on the 3rd June, 1908After party Referring, of course, to the caucus meeting it was made known that the Government would be allowed to remain in office for the time being provided that what was required of them was done. I am prepared to give the Labour party every credit in the matter, and I assert that, i"" a scheme for the establishment of old-age pensions is approved this session, the whole credit for it will be due to the Labour party, and not to the Government. Mr Makin. On the 19th March, would become law this session. I turn now to a matter that caused non-collection of land tax on Crown leaseholds, reflected little credit upon them. The Treasurer said that he thought the matter was dead and buried; no. doubt the wish was father to the thought. He said an old ghost had been resurrected; but I warn him that, so long as he remains in public life, his maladministration of the Land Tax Act will continue to be a skeleton in his political cupboard. He will not be allowed to forget his action in allowing certain wealthy pastoralists to escape their obligations to the Commonwealth. The allegations made by the honourable member for Yarra have not been answered by Ministers; indeed, the Government cannot answer them. It referred the matter to a royal commission, and the Prime Minister declared that the terms of reference were as wide as possible. I shall prove to the committee that that statement was not correct, and that the terms of reference upon which Judge Edwards conducted his inquiry did not fairly represent the charges made by the honourable member for Yarra. His a certain meeting of a certain speech was wilfully distorted, certain portions of it were torn from their conLabour text, and it was impossible for the royal commissioner to give judgment upon the charges actually made by the honourable member against the Government. Those charges were1. Failing to collect arrears of land tax due on Crown leases. 2. Omitting to furnish annual reports to Parliament in compliance with the Land Tax Act. 3. Failing to submit to Parliament annual statements showing the amount of land tax remitted under section 66 of the act. 4. Permitting Sir Sidney Kidman to defy the department for seven years by not lodging land tax returns whilst other land taxpayers were prosecuted for similar offences. 5. Refusing to inform Parliament as to tlie arrears of land tax due by certain large leaseholders and pastoral companies whilst publishing broadcast the names of other landholders whose taxes were in arrears. Those were not the charges into which the royal commissioner was asked to in quire. It is unique for a government accused of wrong-doing to draw up the charge against itself and select the judge to preside over the t r i a l . If the same privilege were afforded to every accused person there would be no convictions for any wrong-doing, no matter bow glaring it might be. unctuously flaunts the report of the royal commissioner as a complete exoneration of Ministers and the departmental officers of the charge of neglect of public duty. honourable members opposite to claim that no departmental officers were accused, and that the charge was against the Government only. ber for Y a r r a made definite charges against the Treasurer. name of the commissioner of taxation was introduced; but the charge was against the ministeria l head of the department, who must always be held responsible for the doings of his subordinates. Judge Edwards ruled that, under the terms of'the agreement, he could not inquire into the reasons why land taxes owing on Crown leases had not been collected, although they represented 75 per cent, of the total land taxes shown in the budget as outstanding. The amount of land tax outstanding was £2,114,914, of which 75 per cent, was due in respect of Crown leases. The honourable member for Y a r r a charged the Government w it h having failed to collect those arrears, and he demanded to know the reason for the omission; but the commissioner declared himself so limited by tbe terms of reference that be could not investigate that most important phase of the subject. H a d he been given a free hand the Government would not have come out of the inquiry w it h a clean record. It would have been been convicted of an improper patronage of certain wealthy interests. He also held that he could not inquire into the statements in the speech other than those contained in the passages selected for him by the Government. The judge was asked to give a decision on a number of extracts from the speech, and that is all he did. Extract No. 4 submitted to the judge readsFor several years the administration of the taxation office has .been unsatisfactory to the people. It has been carried on in defiance of the law under which the taxes are raised; in fact, the Commissioner and his officers and the Treasurer, who is the ministerial head of the department, are annually breaking the law of the country. The following words, which are important Tbe Government now if the charge is to be preserved in its proper setting, were omitted from the extract submitted to the commissioner: Section9 of the Land Tax Act provides that an annual report shall 'be made by the Commissioner of Taxation. Parliament realized that, in handing over to a department the I have always understood right to collect taxation, it was delegating a great power, and it deliberately enacted that the Commissioner should annually let Parliament know what he was doing, and how he was doing it. But there has been no report from the Taxation Department for the last three years, and there was only one report in the preceding three years; in other words, one report has been submitted to Parliament in Inevitably, the six years. That was the charge made by the honourable member for Yarra, whose speech was ruthlessly emasculated. Words were torn fro m their context so that an unf a it h f u l representation of the case was placed before the commissioner, and the same procedure was followed in making the other extracts. The judge evidently knew his duties well; he was well schooled, for he appeared to be quite anxious not to trespass where the Government did not desire him to trespass. member is free to abuse the Government, he has no ground for abusing the royal commissioner. and verse for all I say. suggestions are most improper. 1924, the judge said, "" I suppose that my function is to do what I am to l d .

I want you to put before the commission the history and the documents' which brought about the postponement of the Dunumbrel case, ancl the cessation of the collection of the tax on Crown leaseholds. Mr Cussen was proceeding to examine Mr Ewing on extracts from the report to the Treasury which showed that he ( Mr Ewing) was strongly in favour of going on with the test case (Dunumbrel), and also showed the present Government's actions regarding the holding up of leasehold taxation, but, intervening, the judge askedThe JUDGE --To which question that I have to answer is this relevant? The judge was distinctly under the im-pression that, in the reference to him concerning the charges made by the honourable member for Yarra, there was nothing about the non-collection of leasehold taxes.

According to the Hansard report, the Treasurer said, ""You are quite right-it has not been done, and I am sorry; but we have no explanation to give."" The honourable the Treasurer the other night twitted the Labour party with neglecting, when it was in office, to submit the reports in due time to this House. When the right honourable member for Balaclava ( MrW a t t ) was speaking, the Treasurer said, "" But did you not have to'submit reports for certain Labour Governments ? "" Every report on this subject received by a Labour Government was submitted by that Government to this House in accordance with the terms of the act. Dr. 1914-15 was presented in August, 1917. to give some more convincing proof of that than his own word of mouth. When a Labour Government administered the affairs of the country these reports were presented every year. tabled in 1912, 1913, 1914, and 1915. There was no report in 1916, which was the year in which the split occurred in the Labour party; but reports were fur nished in 1917 and 1918, and then no report was submitted until 1921.

For six years Browne failed to lodge his land-tax returns, and was fined each year. His fines aggregated £134, in addition to penalties imposed for the payment.

Defiance by Sir SidneyK i d m a n ! Notwithstanding that, the Commissioner of Taxation stated in a report that he had interviewed Sir Sidney Kidman, and had the distinct impression that that gentleman bad no desire to defy the department. Time will not permit me to place all the facts on record, but on the 22nd August, 1924, three days after the charges had been made by the honourable member for Yarra, final action was taken against Sir Sidney Kidman, who was then prosecuted. It is clear that the charges made by the honourable member have been proved up to the h i l t . It is also clear that by manipulating tlie terms . of reference to the judge, whose only desire was to do what was right, the Government prevented him from reviewing the whole of the charges. The Government is now using the Commissioner's report in an endeavour to clear its record, which is as black as the ace of spades. In an impartial court the action of the Government would not bear investigation. The Ministry stands condemned on the charges levelled against it by the honourable member for Yarra, when they are considered in conjunction with the matters contained in the supporting documents that were made available to h i m, but were not included in the terms of reference. I leave the public to judge between the honourable member and the Treasurer. Every fair-minded citizen will recognize that the honourable member has rendered a great public service in revealing the misdeeds of the Government in trying to protect wealthy land-owners from taxation and ruthlessly prosecuting small taxpayers. some diffidence in speaking on such an important subject as the budget; but since we have had many illuminating criticisms upon it by honourable members opposite, I venture to offer a few comments. apparent that should the political m i llennium arrive, and honourable members opposite come into power, there w ill be no lack of aspirants for the office of Treasurer, since quite a number of them claim to be capable df dealing with public finance. member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Makin) spoilt his speech by hinting that the learned judge who presided over the in quiry into the charges made by the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) was to a certain extent biased in his decisions because of the terms of reference to the royal commissioner. We bad some heavy salvoes from the honourable member for Werriwa (Mir. Lazzarini), and between the volleys I was able to gather from him the interesting information that a bank overdraft is simply a number of figures in a book, and the overdraft does not materialize! I regret to say that that has not been my experience. borrows money from a bank by way of an overdraft granted on approved securities, and after, for instance, buying a number of sheep, makes payment by cheque, one finds that the person to whom the cheque is paid is able to cash it , and so t u r n the overdraft into concrete figures. In common with the honourable member for Eden Monaro( Mr Perkins), I pay tribute to the honourable member for Yarra for his excellent speech. as that honourable member did, and say to him, "" Come over here;"" but if in the whirligig of politics the honourable member should come into office, he will certainly discharge his duties as a Minister with ability, dignity, and moderation. There has been a great deal of "" blowing off of steam "" in this so-called budget debate. been devoted to it , not one-third of that time has been spent in actual criticism of the budget itself. have wandered far and wide, and the Opposition apparently, not finding much in the budget to criticize, bave resurrected the ghost of the so-called land tax scandal. When the last election campaign was in progress, I was considerably concerned to find that Gunnedah, a town in my electorate, had been placarded w it h I feel notices stating that the honourable member for Yarra( MrJ . H . Scullin) would address the electors on the land tax "" scandal,"" and concluding with the invitation, ""Come and hear Australia's It is finest speaker show up the corrupt mismanagement of the Bruce-Page Government."" there. the honourable member is a brilliant I regret that the honourable speaker; but the fact remains that the result of the speech he delivered did not avert the defeat of the then sitting member for Gwydir at tbe poll. The honourable member for Yarra and the honourable member for Hume( Mr Parker Moloney) both got away very rapidly from the subject of the budget and dealt with a matter that gave greater scope for their histrionic talentthe land tax-bu t the replies by the Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page) and the Attorney General( Mr Latham) effectively and finally disposed of their arguments. Honourable members opposite levelled a good deal of criticism at the budget If one proposals; but I sometimes think that much of it is prompted by newspaper criticism, which, we have to remember, is generally destructive. I cannot quite j o in with the honourable member for Eden-Monaroi n his respect for the press, and perhaps I may be applauded by honourable members opposite for making that statement. It seems to me that we are liable to over-estimate the importance I shall not go so far of press criticism. T i m i d persons, and those who do not think for themselves, are often influenced by opinions expressed by newspapers; but, after all, a newspaper is merely a number of sheets of paper on which is printed news, advertisements, and opinions. Most of tbe ODirions are paid for, and they often reflect the opinion of only one person.

159,Mr Abbott,"I certainly agree thattime; but having read the Melbourne press for the last few weeks, during which the Government has made considerable progress with its programme of legislation, I realize how well Victoria and the Oommonwealth generally would . be managed by a triumvirate of the editors of the Argus, the Age, and the Melbourne Herald. Tbe conservative leanings of tbe metropolitan dailies of this State is well evidenced by their failure to take off tbe extra halfpenny charged for newspapers shortly after the outbreak of war, although the proprietors of the Sydney dailies removed it years ago. If one looks at the leading article page of yesterday's Age-to which I suppose every politician turns with interest-on e will find three leaders. In the first it is said that the Prime Minister is not much good; . in the second that the Pederal and State Governments also are not much good; and in the third that the city and municipal councils are of no account. I cannot help thinking that when the Age got up that morning and set out for its office it could not say, with BrowningGod's in his heavenAll's right witli the world! I imagine rather that it exclaimed, with HamletThe time is out of jointO cursed spite! That ever I was born to set it right! If the present Government is unsatisfactory, what is the alternative? It is so long since a Labour Government has been in power in the Commonwealth Parliament tliat it seems to be almost a legend from Grimm's fairy tales. do, therefore, if we confine ourselves to the Federal arena, is to judge Labour Governments by what they did many -years ago. ber is afraid to do that! best judge them, however, by their recent actions in New South Wales and Queensland, where Labour legislation furnishes a succession of instances of extravagance and class legislation. It seems to me that the principal criticism of the budget offered so far is that the Treasurer has dared to have a surplus. I admit that, taking the present regime of State Labour Governments, surpluses are old-fashioned; but, in my , opinion, they are not to be despised. In my private business I ardently look forward to having one every year, and I commend the Treasurer who is able to place his Government in that happy position. There is a good deal in tbe budget that calls for commendation. . Despite the charges of extravagance, the expenditure over a period of years shows that there has been very little increase in the actual cost of departments. Considering the fact that population has increased by nearly 500,000, the figures in that respect are creditable. The surplus is principally confined to the Customs revenue. It is impossible, of course, to forecast this revenue twelve months ahead, because one does not .know what may happen in that time. how much will be borrowed by tbe State Governments. in that State which is not associated with the Loan Council, and which borrows right and left whenever it gets a chance. It is hard to say, therefore, what the imports will be. I take it that if the Treasurer erred on the conservative side, and did not show a surplus, there would be just as loud a howl as there is over the present surplus. Country people realize that the present Government may be trusted to protect their interests, and tbey are heartily behind it in its proposals. It is said that, owing to the surplus, taxation should be reduced; but one asks where the reduction is to be begun. The Customs revenue All we can is absorbed in reducing the war debt, in old-age pensions, defence, repatriation, and in other directions. I cannot place my finger on tbe spot where reduction should be commenced. Another criticism is that the Government is paying off the war debt too quickly. This is a new point of view, particularly regarding war liabilities. When one examines the figures, and notes what is to be done with the surplus, one realizes that the budget calls for commendation. There is £1,000,000 for naval construction, £250,000 for the air service, a similar sum for the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, and £1,000,000 for war debt reduction. There are further payments of £100,000 for assistance to prospectors, and £186,944",47,Earle Page Th E Report For Less Than £5 000

163,Mr Abbott,"Exactly; particularlyfor invalid and old-nge pensions and national insurance. While I oppose a high tariff, I am quite prepared to waive my fiscal views so far as expenditure on defence and development is concerned. There is a cry for reduced taxation; but were certain fields of taxation to be vacainstance in which a Labour government ted would immediately be entered by the State Governments. It is much better that this money should be applied by the Commonwealth Government to some good purpose than tliat it should be frittered away by State Governments in extravagant socialistic enterprises. The honourable member for Hume( Mr Parker Moloney) referred to the speech which I made tbe ingenuity which he possesses, so twisted my remarks as to make it appear that I had attacked the present Government. While I admit that a high tariff is harmful to the primary producers, the main responsibility 'in connection with land settlement devolves upon the States. That the kind of government in power in the States affects the primary producers is shown by the fact that, so far as Victoria, New. South Wales and Queensland are concerned, the only State to go ahead with closer settlement is VicThat the primary producers of New toria, which has an anti-Labour government. Tbe solution of this problem is in tbe hands of the party to which the honourable member for Hume belongs. It will be solved by the workers doing a fair day's work, thus decreasing production costs, and making high tariffs unnecesit. sary. workers. not be misled by specious promises which, if given effect to, bring sorrow and disillusionment, and cause great expense. When we see class legislation introduced such as the Workmen's Compensation Act recently passed by the New South Wales Government, ostensibly in the interests of the worker, but which has resulted in hundreds of workers being thrown out of employment, we naturally ask where that class of legislation is to end. That primary production in. Australia has not developed to a greater exsidered. It is. common knowledge that tent is not the fault of the Commonwealth Government. It is due to unsympathetic administration by the State Governments, whose duty it is to pass sound and helpful legislation, and thus to develop the country and increase the prosperity of its people. I know of no by the Commonwealth, tbey has treated land-owners sympathetically, or has referred to them as other than parasites and land-grabbers, a section of the people from' whom taxation may be squeezed. land? bad enough to say about Queensland. exercise of that wonderful was returned with a considerable majority at the last election*. it gets its majority bas not yet been ascertained. It certainly does not obtain it by the will of the majority of the people of that; State. The honourable member for Hume, in quoting from a minority report of a section of the Victorian Farmers' Union, stated that they spoke in condemnation of the present composite Government. South Wales are whole-heartedly behind the Government tbe honourable member may yet find out to his cost. The primary producers of Australia believe that this Government is interested in their welfare, and they will continue to support In my opinion, the Government's proposals in relation to the per capita payments are sound. It is only fair that each government should raise the money which it spends. By that means a check is imposed on extravagance. Whilei t would be impertinent of me, as a young member of this House to criticise the excellent speech delivered the other night by the right honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Watt), I consider that his arguments against the abolition of the per capita payments were not so convincing as those of the Attorney-General to the opposite effect.

169,Mr Abbott,"The means by whichLang, intends to contest a Federal constituency at the next election, and that one honourable member now occupying a seat in this House has been marked for slaughter. Should Mr Lang be elected to this House, and a change of Government occur; and, moreover, should he by reason of his dynamic force become Prime Minister of the Commonwealth, he would have no concern for the moral rights of the States in relation to per cavila payments. The Government is to be commended for its attempt to put the Federal and State finances on a sound basis. I concern for the primary which the oil companies of Melbourne and Sydney evinced in connection with the increased duties on petrol and motor tires. I hope that their interest is the dawn of a better day for the primary producers. Let us consider the effect of the increased duty on petrol in the case of a man owning a motor car which will travel twenty miles to a gallon of petrol. The extra cost for petrol, because of the increased duties, would be £4 for 10,000 miles. Would it not be worthwhile to pay that additional amount in order to ensure good roads? The increased duty on motor tires does not affect me because, I do not use other than locally-made tires. Reference has been made to the petrol used in connection with tractors, but I point out that kerosene is the fuel usually used in those machines. The case of the primary producer using stationary engines has also been referred to. I have a stationary petrol engine which, in the shearing season, consumes two gallons of petrol a day. For a period of twenty days, that represents 40 gallons of petrol, the extra cost of which, in consequence of the increased duty, would be 6s. Sd. That was the fee which we . paid to lawyers in the good old days, before they raised it to 10s. 6d. . The additional cost of petrol under these new duties cannot be compared with the advantage which good roads would confer upon motor users. Good roads mean a lessening of freight charges, and a reduction of wear and tear; the blessings would outweigh the extra cost. The various shires of New South Wales find it exceedingly difficult to maintain their roads in anything like a Mr Abbott. decent state of repair. It takes all their funds to keep the main roads fit for traffic. In the district represented by the honourable member for New England( Mr Thompson), there is a stretch of road between Uralla and Armidale. At one time it Was practically a speedway. The Gostwyck shire to-day spends about five times as much on that road as previously; but, nevertheless, it is only a succession of ruts. During the last election campaign the honourable member for New England, when travelling along it to address the electors, was thrown against the hood of the motor car in which he am pleased at the sudden was travelling, and received. a mark producers which he carries to this day. Landowners in New South Wales pay 2-Jd. have recently in the £1 on the unimproved value of their land. Should they want anything done to their roads they are called upon to make further contributions, because the shires have no money for the purpose. will get nothing under this scheme. proposals will mean, not only better main roads, but also better subsidiary roads. I take strong exception to an advertisement that appeared in some of our newspapers recently under the auspices of the Town and Country Union. In it electors were advised to telegraph to their Federal members, and to watch how they voted in connection with these duties. That is political blackmail. If honourable members cannot be trusted to vote as they think right, but have to be watched, as that advertisement suggests, the sooner we do away with Parliaments the better. Once members yield to coercion their usefulness has gone. Town and Country Union? Government has been castigated on the score that it has been going too fast. Generally the cry is that governments do not proceed quickly enough. No Government which unswervingly carries out its policy will ever be universally popular, because, by so doing, some section of the community will be affected. I say, however, to the present Government, ""Go on as you are going. The people of Australia are behind you and the weaklings and sluggards who",49,Earle Page Th E Report For Less Than £5 000

173,Mr Abbottj,"I do not know. Thenow attack you, will yet join in the general chorus of acclamation."" remarks will be confined chiefly to tbe nnancial proposals of the Government as outlinedi n the States Grants Bill. I agree with previous speakers that, because of the Government's proposal to alter substantially tbe financial relations man understood what I said. In any between the Commonwealth and' the States, this budget is one of the most important that has been brought down since the inauguration of federation. I regret that the proposed financial grants to Tasmania and Western Australia are included in the proposal of the Treasurer to discontinue the per capita payments, and are related to the Government's intention to relinquish certain fields, of direct taxation. I would have preferred to see those proposals dealt with separately, so that no honourable member would run the risk of being misunderstood if he opposed tbe States Grants Bill. I am perfectly sure, nevertheless, that the Treasurer has combined them in order to clarify the position, and make clear the real effect upon the States of the withdrawal of the per capita payments.. The Treasurer has definitely stated that the proposals to assist Tasmania and Western Australia by.special grants have really nothing to do with the withdrawal of per capita payments, so that, even if the States Grants Bill is defeated, there is no reason to suppose that the scheme to assist the two States mentioned, by special grants, will not be proceeded with. At the outset, I should like to commend the Treasurer and the Government. The Minister's sympathetic treatment of Tasmania is in marked contrast with the treatment extended to it by former Treasurers. The proposal to assist Tasmania by a special grant of £375,000 meets with the approval of the people of that State. Possibly it is not as much as we thought we were entitled to, and not as much as the State Premier expected, but I know that he has expressed his satisfaction with the proposal. could be brought under cultivation. This While on this subject, I should like to stout-hearted pioneers. The same hardallude to a remark made the other night ships had to be surmounted in the deveby the right honourable member for Balalopment of the mining industry on the clava ( Mr Watt). It will be remembered west coast. Contrast the difficulties enby honourable members who were present countered by our pioneers with the work that the right honourable gentleman said of developing the agricultural areas in that, if the States had the power, they would not impose land taxation that would be comparable with the Pederal land tax which the Commonwealth is proposing to surrender. To that remark I interjected, "" They certainly would not."" I notice in the Hansard report that the word "" not "" is.omitted, and I am not sure if the right honourable gentlecase, I submit that there was no justification whatever for his retort, "" The voice of the sluggard State speaks truly for that State."" I said, ""Why sluggard?"" and the right honourable gentleman, continuing, said, "" If ever a statue is built to Tasmania, it will have its hand extended for a tip.'' The right honourable gentleman must have known that the remark would be offensive to every representative of Tasmania. I am sure, also, that such a gratuitous insult to one of the States of the Commonwealth is resented by every other honourable member. tion of only about 200,000 people. Apart altogether from the fact that it is a small State, there was no justification for such an insult being levelled at Tasmania, suggesting that it is not standing up to its responsibilities. able gentleman was speaking in a jocular vein when he replied to the honourable member's interjection. comes the representative of one of the two States that have benefited most from federation to speak slightingly of a small State like Tasmania, which, for a longtime, has been bearing a heavier burden of taxation per head than any other State of the Commonwealth. Development in Tasmania is more difficult than in the other States. Nearly the whole of the agricultural areas of Tasmania at one time carried dense forests which had to be cut down and cleared before the land work was done, not by sluggards, but by",50,Earle Page Th E Report For Less Than £5 000

It has been possible to utilize up-to-date machinery and bring the land into production much more easily than in Tasmania. The development of our agricultural and mining industries has not been the work of sluggards, as the right honourable member for Balaclava suggested. member is taking him too seriously. cause we all know that his speeches are well considered and widely read. Probably no other public man in Australia enjoys a better reputation as an orator than the right honourable member for Balaclava. We have done a great work in the development of our mining and agricultural resources in Tasmania. And we have done a great work also in the establishment of the electrolytic zinc industry. Sir Nicholas Lockyer, who was appointed by the Commonwealth Government to inquire into the disabilities suffered by Tasmania as the result of federation, made special reference to the establishment of the electrolytic zinc works. He added that, because of the national character of the industry, the State was justified in contracting to sell to the company electric power at less than the cost of production. It may also be of interest to honourable members to know that we have spent nearly £6,000,000 on roads in Tasmania. With our heavy rainfall is is essential that we should have macadamized or metalled roads. Necessarily this expenditure has proved a great burden upon our taxpayers, but it had to be faced, to ensure the development of our natural resources. No less than £3,300,000 has been expended on the great hydro-electric scheme of Tasmania, which could never have been carried out if the people of the State were sluggards. Referring again to the right honourable gentleman's remark that, if a statue were erected to represent Tasmania, the figure would need to be holding out a hand for a tip, I suggest that, if in the matter of tips, other Treasurers of the Commonwealth were to follow the example set by the right honourable member for Balaclava, when he was Treasurer, Tasmania would not be encouraged to keep the palm of her hand uppermost for very long. It ill becomes a representative, of one of the metropolitan electorates of Victoria to speak disparagingly of the little State of Tasmania. Victoria has derived more benefit from federation than has any other State of the Commonwealth. The bulk of the trade of the north of Tasmania is enjoyed by Melbourne. I should have thought that that would lead the people of Melbourne to sympathize with the people of Tasmania. I am certain that such a sympathy exists, and that the views expressed by tbe right honourable member are not approved by the overwhelming majority of the people of this very fine city. The reason that Tasmania has for a considerable time found it necessary to claim special assistance from the Commonwealth is that she has not benefited to any degree from the expenditure of Commonwealth money. I have always based her claim to special consideration on that ground. I invite honourable members to consider the expenditure of Commonwealth money on the River Murray water scheme, the unification of railway gauges, the east and west railway and Canberra, and the expenditure of Commonwealth funds in Melbourne as the Seat of Government; and it will be admitted that all the States, with the exception of Tasmania, have largely benefited from Commonwealth expenditure. Victoria and New South Wales have been specially fortunate in this regard. In confirmation of my statement that very little Commonwealth money has been spent in Tasmania, I have only to direct attention to the fact that the Public Works Committee, whose duty it is to inquire into every proposal involving the expenditure of' Commonwealth money in excess of £25,000, visited Tasmania for the first time about two months ago, and then only to inquire into tbe proposed erection of an automatic telephone exchange at Hobart. It should be borne in mind in this connection, also, that the taxpayers of Tasmania have to find their share of all moneys paid into the Commonwealth Treasury. They have been overburdened with taxation in recent years.

180,Mr Bell,"I do not think I am, beto say a word of commendation, also, of Sir Nicholas Lockyer, who, as a royal commissioner, recently inquired into Tasmania's special disabilities. evident, from his report, not only that he carefully considered the question submitted to h i m and the evidence placed before him, but that he is a man of f a r seeing vision. The recommendations in his report compel one to realize that he understands the peculiar position of Tasmania very much better than it has been understood by any other person who has reported upon it . I do not blame the Government for f a i l i ng to adopt Sir Nicholas Lockyer's report. The Premier and Treasurer of Tasmania has said that he does not consider the report satisfactory, because of certain conditions to the nnancial assistance recommended, which he considers could not be accepted by the State. Nevertheless, Sir Nicholas Lockyer's report might well have formed the basis of negotiations with the Commonwealth Treasurer. Many of his recommendations might bave been embraced in proposals to assist Tasmania, and they would be distinctly beneficial to the people of that State. W it h regard to the proposal to withdraw the per capita payments from the States, I claim that to give effect to it would, to a certain extent, n u l l if y the benefit conferred upon Tasmania by the special grant which is to be made. That is contended by the Treasurer of Tasmania, and to a great extent I concur in the views that gentleman bas expressed. Under this proposal it will not be possible for the Tasmanian Government to reduce State taxation to the extent to which it might have been reduced if the special grant were made and the per capita payment was continued. know there is a difference of opinion as to the advisability of the proposed withdrawal of the per capita payments. am not going to say that tbe proposal has no merits, but one of my difficulties, as a representative of Tasmania, is that I am unable to estimate what really -will be the effect of the proposal upon the finances of Tasmania, because there is a great discrepancy between the figures given by the Commonwealth Treasurer and those submitted by the Treasurer of the State, and there appears to be no means of ascertaining which set of figures is correct. were given. We asked the State taxation authorities to discuss the matter with It is us, and they would not do so. figures were given, but I refer him to the speech he made in introducing the States GrantsB ill . In that speech he supplied some columns of figures, explaining the fields of taxation to be relinquished by the Commonwealth, giving the amounts to be collected by the States from those fields of taxation, and the amount of the per capita payment which. will be withdrawn from each State. The figures given for Tasmania as the amounts which the State authorities w ill, under the Treasurer's proposal, be able to collect, are: Land tax, £ 4 6 , 2 7 9 ; estate duties tax, £ 2 6 , 0 2 2 ; entertainments tax, £ 6 , 0 0 0 ; 40 per cent, of income tax on individuals, £ 8 0 , 6 2 9 ; 40 per cent, of income tax on companies, £ 2 8 , 0 7 8 ; total taxation surrendered, £187,008. It will be seen that the Treasurer proposes that the Commonwealth shall still exploit the field of income tax to the extent of 60 per cent. I do not quite know what the Treasurer meant when he said that no figures have been given. wealth figures. I said that the State Treasurers had not given us any figures. We asked them to confer w i th our taxation officers, and they refused to do so. after the Treasurer had given his figures to the House. It may be that what the honourable, gentleman says is correct in that the States have not supplied h i m w it h their figures; but they certainly have been given to members representative of the respective States. But whilst the honourable gentleman estimates at I £80,629 the amount to be collected by Tasmaniai n the exploitation of 40 per I cent, of the field of income tax on in dividuals, to be l e ft to the State, the Treasurer of the State says that the amount which w ill be collected from that source w ill not be more that half that sum. My difficulty is to know whose figures are correct. I cannot absolutely trust either set of figures. I am not going to say that the figures suggested by the State Treasurer of Tasmania are correct, but I am perfectly certain that those supplied by the Commonwealth Treasurer are incorrect.

184,Mr Bell,"T h a t , I understand, wastake into consideration the collection of income tax by tbe central office on tbe system of the aggregation of incomes, it is evident that the Commonwealth Treasurer's figures cannot be right, because they are based upon a population basis. No one will contend that it is possible to divide the figure representing the amount estimated to be collected by the number of taxpayers in the States, and so arrive at an exact estimate of the revenue to be obtained from tbe portion of this field of taxation from which it is proposed tbe Commonwealth shall withdraw. But it is clear that the discrepancy between the figures of the Commonwealth and State Treasurers should not amount to nearly 50 per cent. surers claim that they w ill be short, but the Commonwealth which collects the total amount ought to be in a better position to make an estimate. mania estimates the revenue from this field of taxation at from £38,000 to £40,000, and the Commonwealth Treasurer estimates it at £80,000. There are also discrepancies in the of revenue from the other fields of taxation referred to in the Treasurer's proposal. It is evident to me that there must be a discrepancy arising from the system of collection at the central office on the aggregation of incomes for the purpose of the tax. I have read very carefully the debates of the conference between the Commonwealth and State Premiers, and I find that the PrimeM in ister ( Mr Bruce) said that the States could collect income taxation on tbe same basis as that upon which the Commonwealth has collected the tax in the past. W it h all due deference to the right honourable gentleman, and whilst I do not pose as a constitutional lawyer, or claim to question the constitutionality of what is proposed, I do not thin k it is possible for a State Treasurer to collect income tax upon an income earned in another State.

The Commonwealth has made no attempt to collect income tax from individuals who reside in other portions of the Empire, but I should say that if it were practicable for the States to aggregate the income of individuals derived from various States, it would be just as easy for the Commonwealth to aggregate the income of individuals earned in different portions of the Empire. The State Premiers must be considered to be quite honest j n their statements that they have no power to aggregate incomes earned in various States, and that they PAGE -That is not sugdoubt the accuracy of the figures supplied by the Commonwealth Treasurer.

But that one instance in which tbe Commonwealth interfered successfully is not a sufficient excuse for its entering upon a policy of road construction and unification of railway gauges, scheme. These departures from the legitimate course of Commonwealth activities have been responsible for a great increase in taxation. The Customs and excise revenue soars higher every year. In 1914 who could have anticipated that the collections through the Customs Department in the year 1926-27 would reach £40,000,000? The people have been looking forward to the time when tbe Commonwealth would abandon the field of direct taxation, and had not the Commonwealth exceeded its constitutional rights, and created big spending departments, often duplicating the work of the States, there would have been no necessity for Federal direct taxation .today. Had proper economy been exercised For instance, the Commonwealth, with a revenue of £40,000,000 from indirect taxation, would have been able to evacuate the field of direct taxation, and u n t i l the Commonwealth does permanently quit that field I am not prepared to support the Government proposal to withdraw the per capita payments.

It will be very much easier for a parliament to reimpose direct taxation than to suddenly discontinue the per capita payments to the States. The honourable member for Yarra said, and other honourable members of his party endorsed the statement, that if the Labour party were returned to office in this Parliament it would immediately reimpose the land tax. I draw the attention of the Prime Minister to that statement, which indicates that the evacuation of that field of taxation as part of the compensation to the",55,Earle Page Th E Report For Less Than £5 000

201,Mr Bell,"I admit that the RiverStates for the loss of the per capita payments may prove to be no compensation at all. There is no guarantee that the field of direct taxation will not be reentered at any time when the Commonwealth Government requires more money -in fact, almost everything produced in I am satisfied that the withdrawal of the per capita payments will have the effect of increasing taxation in the State of which I share the representation, and the increased taxation will fall on many of those who are least able to bear it. AlthoughX bad occasion to take tbe right honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr General Sir Harry Chauvel, has said reWatt) to task, I agree with some of so intimated by interjection when he said that the . States could not impose taxation to the same extent as the Commonwealth. AlthoughI have not heard the views of the Premier of Tas-' mania on this subject, I know that he has no chance of passing through both Houses of the Tasmanian Parliament a bill to impose land taxation of the same weight as that imposed by the Commonwealth. It is, therefore, obvious that, to obtain the way gauges would be beneficial to us if same amout of revenue, the State Parliament will bave to impose taxation that will bear disproportionately on the poorer sections of the community. The Treasurer may say that that is the business of the States, and has nothing to do with 'him; but surely the State Treasurers are entitled to take these questions into consideration. They know the effect it will have upon their revenue, but, unfortunately, the Commonwealth Treasurer has not that the fore the HouseI shall probably have more to say on this subject, and if there is any chance of its being withdrawn or defeated, I shall advance every argument possible to that end. AlthoughI take second place to no man in upholding the Commonwealth as distinct from the State point of view, as a representative of a small State like Tasmania, I am justified in emphasizing the effect of the proposal on that State. It has been claimed that the Commonwealth is doing everything necessary to provide for defence; at any rate, the Treasurer said that we are doing all we oan afford to do. Possibly that is right, but the right honourable the Prime Minister( Mr Bruce), and others On this side [168] of the House, claim that when we are considering defence expenditure we should include amounts spent on roads and railways. I am surprised at that contention. Iron, steel, cotton, and many other things this country-woul d be essential to our existence if the Commonwealth was engaged in war and isolated from the rest of the world. The expenditure on roads has nothing to do with the amount of money that the Commonwealth is spending on defence or with what the Inspectorgarding the need for more money. He the views he expressed and is dealing with defence as administered by him and members of his staff, and when he says that the amount provided is inadequate to give Australia a chance of training and equipping her forces, it cannot be supposed that he has taken into consideration such questions as the NorthSouth railway and good roads. I suggest to some of the strategists of this House that there may be a difference of opinion as to whether good roads and unified railwe were defending this country against an invader. Strategists preparing plans for the invasion of Australia would be seriously concerned at the breaks of railway gauge, and, in so far as those breaks of gauge would be adverse to an invading army, they would be beneficial to those on the defensive. I doubt whether good roads are of benefit to a people defending themselves. The invader is always ready -h e strikes his blow when he is prepared knowledge. When -bu t those on the defensive have no States Grants Bill is bewarning. Certainly Australia would need time to complete the organization, mobilization, and equipment of her forces. If the Commonwealth was invaded from the north, and the North-South railway had' been completed, the first thing we would do would be to destroy that line. Honor-, able members, when searching for arguments to support schemes for building railways, unifying railway gauges, qr constructing roads, are always ready to say, "" This is absolutely necessary from a defence point of view."" They think that such argument has special weight with honourable members, and so it would' have if honourable members generally agreed with their point of view that railways and good roads would assist Australia in time of invasion. I entirely disagree, and I suggest that there is room for difference of opinion among military strategists that the unification of the railway gauges would assist Australia to 'defend herself. It is the duty of every Government to make adequate preparation for the protection of the territory under' its control, and, although I do not suggest that sufficient care has not been exercised hy this Government, I emphasize the point that it cannot altogether disregard the opinions expressed by its expert advisers. The budget, which haa been favourably commented upon by honourable members on this side of the Chamber, is, I think, on the whole, one of the best submitted to Parliament. It is gratifying to know that during recent years our national debt has been reduced, -which is the first purpose to which surplus revenue should be put. I cannot, however,' see any particular virtue in placing a portion of our surplus revenue to a redemption fund, if , at the same time, we are placing new loans on the market. Progress reported.
