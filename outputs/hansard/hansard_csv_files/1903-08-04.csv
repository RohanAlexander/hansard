29,Sir Philip Fysh,"The answers toClause 26(1) There shall be a Legislative Council for the Territory, (2) The Legislative Council shall consist of. the Lieutenant-Governor and of the members of the Executive Council, together with such other persons, not more than three in number, as the Governor General appoints under the Great Seal of the Commonwealth, or as the Lieutenant Governor, in pursuance of instructions from the Goveruor-General, appoints under the Public Seal of the Territory. (3) Every person so appointed may be removed at any time by the Governor General, and shall vacate his seat at the end of six years from the date of his appointment, but may be re-appointed. clause the Legislative Council of Papua is to consist of certain Government officials, and not more than three other persons, who, I take it , will represent the unofficial interests of the Territory. No provision, however, is made for increased representation in proportion to the increase of population, though, if settlement increases in the Territory, the white population there will, no doubt, require a greater "" say"" in the administration under which they live. Unless some provision is made for an increase in the number of non-official representatives, friction such as arose in Australia in the early days will occur in the Territory. I move That the words "" not more than three in number "" be omitted. It is my intention to propose a new subclause, to provide for the appointment of additional representatives up to the number of twenty, in proportion to the increase of population. Sir EDMUNDBART ON (Hunter, Minister for External Affairs) -There is some force in what the honourable member has said. While the clause as it stands may meet all the present requirements of the case, occasion may arise for a slight extension when the population has increased, but not to such an extent, perhaps, as to justify us in adopting a system of direct representation. I do not anticipate that it will be necessary to provide for more than three appointments at first; but as I think the amendment might obviate difficulty in the future, I am prepared to accept it . to me that some provision might be made for the direct representation of the white residents in the Territory upon the Legislative Council. inconsistent with the spirit of our political institutions, because it provides for a system of Government entirely by officials. So long as the Commonwealth contributes £20,000 per annum towards the expenses of the administration, it is perhaps only right that we should exercise a considerable influence over the Government of the Territory. But, under the provisions of the Bill,, the Government will be entirely under the control of officials. ments must be made by the Governor General, under the advice of the Government of the Commonwealth. tive Council of the Territory will be composed ,entirely of officials, and these will, no doubt, exercise great influence in connection with any appointments that may be made. The expenditure in connection with the administration of affairs in British New Guinea has been entirely under the control of officials, and I find that although the annual expenditure has amounted to between £38,000 and £39,000, only about £2,000 has been spent on public works, nearly all the rest having been absorbed by the payment of salaries. Some effort should be made to give the 500 or 600 white residents in the Territory a voice in the management of the affairs of the Possession. They contribute almost half of the revenue, and surely they are entitled to some consideration. They consist principally of three classes-traders , miners, and missionaries-and they are all doing good work in opening up the country. The Prime Minister has explained that there are considerable difficulties in the way of conducting an election, but surely the votes of the residents could be recorded if the postal facilities were brought into requisition. Amendment agreed to. Sir EDMUNDBARTON I should be very glad if it were practicable to adopt the suggestion of the honourable ""member. As soon as it becomes possible I shall strongly support the adoption of a system of direct representation, and if I happen to be in office, I shall take steps to bring it about. now 1 reasons which I have already stated. There are onty about 500 or 600 white people scattered over an area of 97,500 square The system now proposed is. I miles, and to reach these is a matter of",14,Papua British New Guinea

35,Sir Edmund Barton,"For theextremedifficulty, becauseatpresentthere are no postal services between the various places, and there are, in many cases, no roads by which communication by land can be carried on. The ordinary method of travelling from one settlement to another is by water, and the Government of the Territory and the Chief Justice have to proceed by steamer. There is not one settlement comprising 100 white people in the Territory, and it can scarcely be said that there is local community of interest in . any one direction. tion for the present will necessarily be small, and the proposal in the Bill is hedged round with the provision that if nominations are found unsuitable in the interests of the Territory they may be revoked. Taking the whole of the circumstances into consideration, the difficulty of providing for any representation which would be anything more than a name or which would not, in its consideration for some, inflict injustice upon others, seems almost insuperable. I hope the honourable member will accept my assurance that as soon as there happens to be any considerable access of population, I shall have inquiries made with a, view to ascertaining what means of communication exist or can be established, so that the present difficulties in the way of representation may be the sooner -overcome. The means at the disposal of the community at present are not such as to permit of that communication which is essential to any system of representation. I do not know how a roll could be collected in New Guinea. If it were practicable, I should be only too glad to take the necessary steps in that direction. The whole settlement is so much in embryo that I would ask the honourable member to hold his hand until something can be done to provide for representation that is likely to prove useful. I shall cordially support any such movement as soon as it becomes practicable. sympathy with the honourable member for Kalgoorlie in his desire to establish a proper system of representation, but I agree with the Prime Minister that at presei.it, and possibly for some considerable time, it will scarcely be practicable to bring into existence any workable system of popular representation. With the scattered and isolated settlements, many of which are made up of miners who are moving about from place to place in their search for gold, it will be impossible to provide -for any really effective system of voting or representation. I think that for the present the proposal which I have indicated will serve the purpose. I move That the following sub-clause be inserted after sub-clauso (2):-""(2A ) The non-official members shall be three in number uutil the resident white British population totals One thousand, and one additional representative shall be added for each additional One thousand of such population. Provided that the total number of such non-official In addition to that, the legislacouncillors shall not exceed twenty."" I believe that long before the maximum number is reached tlie conditions of the Possession will be such as to enable the nominee system to be superseded by an elective system, such as has been suggested. Sir EDMUNDBARTON I think that until we can provide for a representative body in New Guinea-and I shall be glad when that time arrives-ther e will be some difficulty in securing the attendance of an eligible Council of twenty members. If the honourable member will substitute "" twelve"" for "" twenty"" I shall accept his amendment. By the time there are 3,000 or 4,000 people in New Guinea we may be able to give them representation under an elective system. Minister's suggestion. Amendment amended accordingly, and agreed to.

This is the clause in which an amendment was suggested by the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn; but it seems to me that, having regard to the amendment of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie which was carried last week, it will not now be necessary. Perhaps, however, it will be as well to adopt the amendment which has been suggested by the honourable and learned member in the next clause.",15,Papua British New Guinea

GROOM (Darling Downs) I should like to ask the Prime Minister whether the Immigration Restriction Act extends to the Territory ? Sir EDMUNDBARTON considered the question, but I am inclined to think that it does not. The Territory is under the exclusive legislative power of the Commonwealth, and we could legislate in that direction, but the alternative course which I have suggested is, to my mind, the simpler one. The new sub-clause which I have just proposed would enable us to have supervision over any ordinance providing for the introduction of the persons indicated. they could be introduced without an ordinance relating to the subject. It practically takes Sir EDMUNDBARTON I am not quite sure, but perhaps they could. So far as that is concerned, it will not be difficult to make a suggestion which I think would be carried out. But some such provision as this, if made at the present stage, should be quite sufficient. Amendment agreed to. In reply to the honourable member for Herbert, I should like to state that I had no desire that we should interfere in any degree with the administration of the laws relating to the leasing or disposal of land. The point is that this clause deals only with the reservation of Papuan legislation for the assent of the Governor, General. It does not relate to an act of administration on the part of the local authorities, but solely to their legislative ' powers. An ordinance passed by the local Legislature cannot become operative until it has received the Governor General's assent. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 39 agreed to. Clause 401.

In accordance with a view which I expressed during the debate on the second reading of this Bill, I suggest that a litigant should be given the option of going to the Supreme Court of Queensland. That Court, at present, entertains all appeals from the Courts of British New Guinea; it is convenient to the Possession, and it has hitherto done the I have not work very well. I fail to see why, without in the least interfering with the rights of parties to a suit to appeal direct to the High Court, an opportunity should not be given to them to go to the Supreme Court of Queensland, which sits more frequently, and is more readily available than the High Court will be.

73,Mr Higgins (Northern Melbourne),"-with petty appeals oE this kind, and I consider that, as a mere matter of machinery, the option I have named should be given to a litigant. If my proposal be adopted, the final words of sub-clause-(1) will have to be altered so far as regards the Supreme Court of Queensland. We could hardly apply the wordsThe judgment of the High Court in all such cases shall be final and conclusive, to that Court. Sir EDMUND there would still be an appeal from the Queensland Supreme Court to the High Court? Council. I could understand an objection of that kind being raised, but the cases brought before the Court would be very small. I presume that the Prime Minister would like to leave the position as it stands with regard to appeals from the Supreme Court of Queensland 1 I am not asking for anything that is new. There are five or six Judges of the Supreme Court of Queensland, as compared with three for the whole Commonwealth. Townsville ? Towers, Maryborough, or any other place at which they might choose to sit. The proposal I have made would be far more convenient than the course indicated in the clause, for the High Court might be sitting at Kalgoorlie when a litigant desired to appeal to it from the Territorial Court. I see no constitutional objection to my proposal, and if it were adopted it would be very easy to remodel the clause by providing that the High Court, or the Supreme Court of Queensland, shall have jurisdiction, and then thatThe judgment of the High Court in all such cases shall be final and conclusive. Sir be the final Court? regard to this Bill and others that we have passed, is that it is unconstitutional to make the court final and conclusive, unless the Constitution itself does so. A t the same time, I do not ask the Ministry to go back on the position which they have taken up. I understand that the honourable member for Wannon has some suggestion to make before I move the amendment which I have indicated. seems to me that this clause provides that the regulations of the High Court are to be subject to an ordinance of tlie Possession. It would be strange, indeed, if the High Court were placed in that position. Of course, the words in question may refer to a particular procedure in regard to appeals, but it seems to me that the position is a curious one. Sir EDMUNDBARTON I think that the provision is satisfactory. The Possession is-one that is given some degree of self-government, which hasits judicial tribunals, and in which the administration of justice, considering all the conditions, has been carried on fairly satisfactorily. It seems to me that the local judicial authorities, who, no doubt, would be consulted by the Lieutenant-Governor on. such a subject, would have a far better knowledge, under the conditions of the Territory, as to what should be the regulations relating to appeals than we or even the High Court, sitting here, could have. Whilei t is advisable to allow appeals to be taken to the High Court, it is only right that those on the spot, who know the circumstances of the country, should be able by ordinance to lay down the conditions. We have to remember, aslhave so often impressed on the Committee, that. the Government, who is responsible to this House, has a sufficient control over any ordinances that may be made. I think it would be better to leave the clause as it stands. As the Attorney-General reminds me, it refers only to appeal cases, and tlie jurisdiction is very limited in range and area. As to the suggestion made by the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, that as this provision applies also to criminal matters, a person might wish to carry his appeal to the High Court, I rather agree with him that it would be better not to make any law which would prevent a principle of the Constitution from going ultimately to the High Court. I would, therefore, aucept an amendment providing that the High Court, or, at the option of the appellant, the Supreme Court of Queensland, should have jurisdiction.

I have another .authority here in the person of Sir William McGregor, Lieutenant-Governor of New Guinea, who, in his report of the 23rd August, 1899, to the Victorian Government, saysIu my experience people that are total abstainers in the colony enjoy better health, and have a lower mortality, than those that are not total abstainers. There is a widespread popular belief that some stimulant is required in the tropics, especiulry by people that have in a cooler ought to take ful l responsibility for dealingclimate been accustomed to it. This will not stand the test of experience. It is a matter that any one not a total abstainer can prove for himself in a month that as a class are total abstainers are the healthier, and stand exposure better than others. The man that is a total abstainer bears very much better the onset of fever than the man that is not; and he is also less liable to other diseases. These them. stimulants are valuable in conditions of debility when they are ad ministered in small quantities. They should be eschewed by healthj' persons that wish toremainhealthy in the climate of British New Guinea. allowed drink only medicinally. supposed to be allowed in North Queensland, but the Prime Minister ought to be aware of the notorious fact that in that part of Australia, and also on Thursday Island, the natives are served with drink, notwithstanding the prohibition laws. What is the history of the aborigines in Victoria and everywhere else ? The law makes it penal to serve them with liquor, but it is notorious that the native races become extinct through the drinking habits introduced by the white population. Who will lose by prohibition in New Guinea1 Traffickers in land are to be curbed, and I do not see why restraint should not be placed on traffickers in drink. Drink is not required in New Guinea for reasons of health, or for the preservation of commercial stability ; and we have a great and important duty in this respect to discharge in that Territory. The ""honourable member for Maranoa has pointed out that the native races have their own vices, which are bad enough i and I am assured that a native Papuan, under the influence of drink, is neither more nor. less than a madmanthat he is more dangerous then than at any other time. I am extremely sorry that the Prime Minister appears to assume an attitude of opposition. nothing in my attitude to indicate opposition. the Prime Minister would lead one to suppose that he is opposed to my amendment, though I hope I have placed a wrong construction on his attitude. I hope the Government will see their way clear to accept my proposal, or, at any rate, some modification of it . If we cannot altogether prohibit the sale of drink, the Government with the traffic. member for Melbourne Ports do with the present licences ? honourable member do with the liquor. it would be be better for the people in every respect if that step were taken tomorrow.

I do not wish to introduce the question of total abstinence per se, but merely as it affects the natives of New Guinea; and I hope the Committee will deal with the liquor traffic in the same way as they have dealt with the land traffic. Land, liquor, and labour appear to furnish the three problems which will have to be solved in connection with the natives of New Guinea. We have already dealt with the land question in a way which, to my judgment, is the right one; and we shall take a right step if we deal similarly with the liquor traffic. A t any rate, if the Government allow liquor to be dispensed, it ought to be absolutely on cheir responsibility. I hope, however, that my amendment will be accepted.

It is not a fact that the missionaries are all agreed that there is a traffic in liquor with the natives, or that the drink evil is spreading amongst the latter. Only a day or two ago, if not to-day, Mr King, the representative of the London Missionary Society, of the operations of which in New Guinea honourable members are aware, was in my office, and his testimony is that the present law and ordinances are working well, and that he has no complaint to make.

We are entitled to advance our own opinions, notwithstanding anything that may be said by Mr King. As I say, I am only stating a matter of fact in support of my view that there has not been a case made out for the alteration of the law in New Guinea. view 1 Sir EDMUNDBARTON I have no information beyond what MrK i ng stated. Whatever his view of the law may be, is not material, but his statement of a matter of fact is interesting in an argument of this nature. Some reference has been made to the number of petitions which have been presented on this question. No doubt there have been a great number of petitions, but there also have been a great number in regard to the erection of a post-office at Kadina. Then there was a petition presented to this House, not long ago, signed by 30,000 peoplea petition which, no doubt, 100,000 people could have been got to sign ; but it is another question whether the views presented by the petitioners were either sound or tolerant. ter not think that the Kadina post-office should be erected ? When I Sir EDMUNDBARTON W h e n I know more about the matter I shall be able to give a reply. The fact that these petitions come from a similar source should be given due weight, but no more than due weight. Whatever Territory, State, or place may be placed under the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth, we shall probably have petitions of the character from precisely the same quarter ; and they are interesting as evidence of the strength of viewsof thepetitionersand of their bona fides, but they do not carry us much further. I do not believe that there is-any proof whatever of an improper sale of liquor to the natives of New Guinea, or of any insufficiency of thelaw. If there is any insufficiency, it can be met, not by the Government undertaking the sale of each bottle of liquor, but by reducing, if necessary, the number of I do not licensed houses, and preventing any undue increase of the traffic. I am not not be a monopoly any more than is the restricted trade created by a local option poll. monopoly. Sir EDMUNDBARTON If that is the opinion of the honourable and learned member, it is not mine; and on that point we are at issue. If the honourable member for Melbourne Ports thinks that the revenue What is. Mr King's derived from the sale of liquor in New Guinea is an argument in favour of his amendment, I shall supply him with that argument. In New Guinea the revenue from liquor at the high duties prevailing is £3,200 per annum-that is; from liquor supplied, not to the blacks, but to the whites. a pretty good drinking crowd. £3,200, the sum of £2,800 is derived from spirits, which, I suppose, furnish the chief ground of complaint on the part of honourable members who support the amendment. The duty on whisky is over 100 per cent.; on brandy, about 66 per cent.; on gin, about 200 per cent.; on rum more than 200 per cent.; and on schnapps, 150 per cent. The value of bhe whisky imported into New Guinea is £1,381, and the duty £1,624. tell us what is the duty per gallon ?",24,Langdon Bonython Woul D That Matter Which Involved A High And Important

The value of the brandy consumed in New Guinea is £726, and the duty £ 5 0 0 ; the value of the gin consumed is £ 9 2 , and the duty £ 1 9 8 ; of rum, the value is £179, and the duty £396 ; and of schnapps, the value is £67, and the duty £99. Duties on beer and wine amount to something under £400, but in relation to them. I need not enter tediously into detail. The fact is that seven-eighths of the revenue from intoxicating liquor is collected on spirits, and the whole' of the revenue collected in this way amounts to £3,263. I give the figures up to the 30th June of iast year, because those for the year ending on the 30th June last have not yet come to hand. able gentleman considered the question of nationalizing the drink traffic in New Guinea? Sir EDMUNDBARTON sidered it , and it may or may not be a desirable policy to adopt. not so fully considered , the question as to be able to give a definite expression oi opinion upon it at present, although I have read something upon the subject. New Guinea may possibly be a f it place in which to make an experiment of that character. I will not pledge myself to it, but in connection with New Guineai t suggests very interesting considerations. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports may consider that the fact that there is a considerable revenue from spirits is evidence of their general consumption, and is therefore a powerful argument in favour ot his contention; but, strongly as I am in favour of preventing and prohibiting the sale of liquor to the natives, I do not think that we are warranted in preventing white men who go to New Guinea from obtaining under proper restrictions the liquor they desire. Of course, if ' I saw that this traffic was being extended to the natives, independently of anything that might be contained in this Bill, I should devote my best attention and energy to so coping with the traffic as to prevent the natives being injured by it . gentleman may learn from experience. Sir EDMUNDBARTON I can learn by experience and by inquiry; but I shall not learn anything from such statements as have been made by the honourable member, because they are too vague; they are not to the point, and they afford no proof. Any one coming here to legislate as is now proposed should be able to show some state of facts to justify his proposition. My honourable friend says that he can bring before, us nothing but what he has beard, to which I oppose something that I have heard, and neither of us is on very strong ground. There should be some affirmative basis for legislation of the kind proposed, and it rests with, my honourable friend to furnish it. I do not think he has furnished it. Whether we consider that the revenue derived from the importation of liquor is too much or too little, the matter is one which can be dealt with in various ways by duties, by prohibition, by reduction of the licensed houses, or by an alteration of the licensing law. Buti t would not be a condition of affairs favorable to its development that New Guinea should be a place in I have conwhich a man would not only be unable to get a foot of land, but in which he would I have also be unable to obtain any liquor. I do not believe we can have any very great prospect of advancing New Guinea by means of a population of teetotalers. Not that I have any objection to teetotalers, but I think that among the classes of men who usually develop territories, we shall seldom find men who are teetotalers. able gentleman call a man who cannot get a drink a teetotaler ? have to be a teetotaler whether he wills it or not, but if we take away his liquor, we shall secure a manufactured teetotaler, about whom we cannot brag very much. I have to deal with the conditions of New Guinea as I find them, and I find no state of facts which justifies the fears I have heard honourable members express. The law of 1888 may have been in force in New Guinea when Dr. MacGregor, now Sir William MacGregor, was Administrator of. the Possession, and I think it was ; but the law of 1901, which is now in force, was non-existent at that time. Under the liquor ordinance of 1901 all the licences are granted for a year only, but may be renewed at the option of the licensing authorities. The ordinary licence granted empowers the",25,Langdon Bonython Woul D That Matter Which Involved A High And Important

148,Sir Edmund Barton,"He maylicensee to sell on the premises for consumption off the premises, and not to sell liquor for consumption on the premises except to bond fide residents on the licensed premises, in a quantity not less than can be contained in the kind of bottle generally known as a quart bottle. There is an exemption in the case of liquor sold to a person residing on the licensed premises, and of liquor which is bond fide given by the licensee to a person on the licensed premises. The only other kind of licence issued is a ship licence, and whilst under the ordinary licence no less quantity than a bottle is to be dealt with, and' that must not be drunk on the licensed premises, in a case of a ship licence, the authority given is to this effect: It empowers the licensee to sell on a licensed ship, while within colonial waters, liquor on which, all customs dues that can be claimed have been paid, but only in quantities of not less than 2 gallons of one kind of liquor. It will be obvious to honourable members that a native of New Guineai n the present condition of the Possession would require, as natives go, to be possessed of considerable wealth to buy even one bottle of liquor at a licensed house, and he would have no chance of paying for and obtaining from a ship a dozen bottles of liquor on which duty had been paid. The provision for safeguarding the natives is to be found in the ordinance of 1888, and I do not think any legislation has' since been passed which detracts from the severity of that oidinance. force 1 Sir EDMUNDBARTON in force for fifteen years. It applies to firealso to be imprisoned for a term up to two arms, ammunition, and explosives, as well as to liquor and opium, and under it no person, save with the exceptions afterwards contained in the ordinance, ' may supply a native by sale or gift, or in any other way either directly or indirectly, with any firearm, ammunition, explosive, intoxicating liquor, or opium. A person offending against the provision is liable to a fine of not less than £ 2 0 , and not exceedmember for Melbourne Ports upon this ing £200, and to imprisonment-no t ""or""for any term not less than one month, and not exceeding two years. That is a pretty severe provision, and probably much more severe than my honourable friends expected when they heard the £50 fine referred to just now. Then, under ordinance, natives are forbidden to have firearms, explosives, or intoxicants in their possession. If they have they may be brought before any judicial officer, who may summarily direct the articles to be confiscated and destroyed, or otherwise disposed of, according to his discretion. There are certain cases in which the Administrator may supply arms to natives, but the conditions provide that this may be done only in cases in which safety is assured. It must be clear that the native is in urgent need of firearms and'ammunition for self defence, and any firearm or ammunition given to him may be retained until withdrawn by the order of the Administrator. Then there is this provision with regard to intoxicating liquor : that, notwithstanding these provisions, any person may give a native in urgent cause or necessity, but without recompense or remuneration, any intoxicating liquor, when it is given solely and purely for medicinal purposes, and it rests with the person giving such liquor toprove to the satisfaction of the court the existence of the urgent necessity. Failing such proof "" in a clear and conclusive manner,"" to quote the words of the ordinance, the person is liable to the penalty provided in the section to which I have already referred. allowed to ""shout'"" for a native. this case liquor is to be given solely and purely for medicinal purposes, and it rests with the person giving it to prove the urgent necessity clearly and conclusively.

I respect very much the views of the honourable subject. . I am entirely with him in thinking that we ought not to do anything which will carry ruin and destruction amongst these natives, and that in all respects we should provide for their welfare and protect them. But I do not think that there is anything to show that the legislation to which I have referred has proved ineffective, or that there is anything which",26,Langdon Bonython Woul D That Matter Which Involved A High And Important

151,Sir Edmund Barton,"No. I nshows that, for the purpose of protecting the black population, it is incumbent upon us so to legislate that the white population shall not have any liquor at all. It is in the interests of the black population that my honourable friend has submitted his proposal, and from the very best motives I am sure. But he appears to think that he cannot carry hisproposal into effect without prohibiting not only the black natives, but also the white people from obtaining drink. is that the traffic is well safeguarded at present, and that if necessary it can be even more carefully safeguarded than the ordinances I have read provide for. If this is so, it is not necessary to go to the extreme length of the prohibition which the honourable member proposes in his amendment. I must assume that the honourable member desires to legislate only for the'safety and the moral and physical welfare of the black population. I contend that that is done now, or, if not, that it can be done with very little alteration of the existing ordinances. If the honourable member does not desireand he does not plainly say that it is his desire-to enforce the prohibition of the sale of any liquor whatever to the white inhabitants of New Guinea, he should submit some proposal which will safeguard the interests of the natives without at the same time taking away any reasonable liberty of this kind from the white people. be very glad to be able to support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, but I think there is a great deal of reason in the arguments adduced by the Prime Minister. There does seem to me to be a certain amount of harshness in"" imposing the rigidity ©f prohibition upon the white population of New Guineaa population that we are endeavouring, under this Bill, to increase and provide for, and whose industries it is our desire to stimulate. Certainly, if intoxicants are desirable or permissible anywhere, they would appear to be permissible in such strenuous circumstances as may be supposed to surround white settlers in such -countries as New Guinea. No doubt it is very easy to abstain from intoxicating liquors under circumstances which call for no undue exertion or effort, but whether it is as. easy or as wise to abstain under circumstances such as meet the settler in countries like New Guinea, where he is subjected to climatic changes to which he is unaccustomed, and which are hurtful to the ; New Guinea) Bill. 2995 constitution, I leave it to others who are better able than myself to do so to determine. There can be no difference of opinion as to the wisdom of keeping intoxicants from the native population of the Territory; but there is a very wide gulf between the effect of intoxicants upon black races and their effect upon ourselves, whose ancestors have been hard drinkers for, perhaps, the last 2,000 years. It is a My view physiological fact that one could kill a whole tribe of black people with the quantity of whisky that might be poured into some white men almost without appreciable effect. In my opinion, we should cast upon bhe Government of New Guinea the responsibility for the sale of liquor, and control of the traffic there. If by control it is understood that the Government of the Territory will have the right to license persons to sell intoxicants and opium, I agree that that does not go far enough. The importation and sale should be left wholly to the State, and managed by its agents. This should insure purity in the liquor sold, and should prevent abuse, because no incentives to drink would be offered other than those created by the liquor itself. Therefore, if the honourable member for Melbourne Ports will withdraw his amendment, I shall move the addition of the following provisoNotwithstanding anything contained in any ordinance, there shall be no sale or dealing in intoxicating liquor or opium in the Territory except by bhe agenbs of the Lieutenant-Governor, and the receipts therefrom shall go into the Treasury of the Territory. Under such a provision the whole responsibility would be cast upon the Government, who, having the welfare of the Territory at heart, would, I think, see that the traffic was regulated in a manner conducive to the best interests of the settlers there. If the amendment before the Committee is agreed to, I think it will be impossible to prevent the illicit importation and sale of liquor. The coast line of New Guinea is a very extensive one; therefore it will be impossible to prevent either the smuggling of intoxicants, or the sale of liquor either imported or locally distilled. In the prohibition States of America, where there are much greater opportunities for actively watching and controlling the importation and sale of intoxicants, they are almost openly sold. Liquor, as' is well known, can always be obtained there if prescribed by duly qualified medical men, and there are",27,Langdon Bonython Woul D That Matter Which Involved A High And Important
152,Mr Hughes (West Sydney),"! shoulddays when, so to speak, every one is ill . People get prescriptions, andgo to the chemist's for as much whisky as they want. I do not think it would be possible to prevent still greater abuses in New Guinea. In Queensland, the publicans are prohibited from serving liquor to coloured people; but it is notorious that such people can always get drink when they want it. Similarly, although the Victorian law prohibits the sale of intoxicating liquors on Sunday, no one is so foolish as to think that it is observed in Melbourne, for instance. constituency of Melbourne Ports than in any other in Australia. great deal of liquor is sold in that electorate. In the same way the New South Wales liquor laws are not observed, and I remember the incredulity of the New South Wales Parliament at the statement of a member, not thab he had been to 33 publichouses on one Sunday morning and 'had obtained a drink at each, but that he had succeeded in walking home afterwards. If these laws cannot be enforced in Melbourne and in Sydney, the total prohibition of liquor cannot be enforced in New Guinea. there ? necessary to import one in order to obtain the proper prescription, the people there would soon arrange for tlie importation. It would be a very good thing if all persons, like the honourable member for Melbourne Ports and myself, were abstainers; but in the meantime we must allow them to drink a little occasionally. As people drink so much on Sundays, when public houses are supposed to be shut, I do not know what they would do if the sale of liquor were prohibited altogether. I hope that the honourable member will withdraw his amendment, to allow me to move that which I have suggested. the Committee have hitherto set their faces against proceeding to extremes in any matter, and I shall be surprised if they do otherwise on this occasion. Those who have given careful consideration to the liquor question in England, and in other parts of the world, have come to the conclusion that the most hopeful solution of the difficulty is in making the traffic a State or a municipal concern. We have now an opportunity of putting that suggestion into practice, and to exercise that wise discretion which differI f that can happen in America, entiates the fanatic from the statesman. It is bordering on fanaticism to compel the white population of New Guinea to abstain entirely from intoxicating liquors, in order to prevent the possibility of the abuse of intoxicants by the black population of the Territory. I hope that my amendment will be accepted. If the honourable member will not withdraw his amendment, I intend to move mine if his should be defeated. I hope that the. honourable member for Melbourne Ports will push his amendment to a division. I shall vote first for that amendment, but, if is not carried, I shall, as a It is notorious that a second choice, support that suggested by the honourable member for West Sydney. Our chief concern should be the native population of New Guinea. We are not so much concerned about the, development of that Territory by white people, because the number of whites there now is very .few, nor should we desire to augment its re venue by' allowing the importation and sale of liquor there. The Prime Minister has used as an argument against the amendment the fact that about £3;000 of the revenue of New Guinea is obtained from the imI s there a medical practitioner portation and sale of intoxicants; but I think that the people of Australia If not, and it were would be willing to make up that amount themselves rather than permit the drink traffic and the consequent deterioration of the native population to continue. The honourable and learned member for West Sydney pointed out that it would be very easy to evade a general prohibition ; but he must admit that that argument applies with just as much force to the prohibition of the sale of Uquor to the natives. If the sale of liquor to the white residents is permitted, it will be very difficult to prevent its sale to the natives. The honourable and learned member also pointed out that, although Sunday trading was proThe members of hibited in Melbourne, the sale of liquor was carried on quite openly; and it is also well known that, despite the law to the contrary, aboriginals are supplied with liquor in some parts of Australia. There is much more police supervision in Australia than can possibly be provided for in the Territory, and therefore it will be almost impossible to prevent the sale of liquor to the natives.

157,Mr Batchelor (South Australia),"would be in favour of reducing the number of licences. It seems extraordinary that fourteen licences should be required to supply the requirements of 500 white people. licences, the rest being gallon licences. view, gallon licences are quite as objectionable as hotel licences. I believe that a great deal of harm results from the facilities offered in Australia for the sal.e of liquor by storekeepers. I have had considerable experience as a member of a Licensing Bench, and I have come to the conclusion that storekeepers' licences are more harmful than are those granted to hotel keepers. In view of the fact that natives, such as those with whom we have to deai, are specially susceptible to the evil influences of liquor, and that it will be almost impossible to prevent them from securing drink if we permit its importation into the Possession, I think we should absolutely prohibit its sale there. Under ordinary circumstances I am not a supporter of prohibition, but I think that we should do everything within our power to protect the interests of the natives. Experience has shown that wherever white men come into contact with natives and supply them with liquor, the latter inevitably go down. due to. the liquor. I have read with regard to the experience gained in the South Sea Islands, in almost every case in which liquor has been supplied to the natives their numbers have been greatly reduced, and all kinds of vice and crime have abounded. Under these circumstances, I intend to support the amendment of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. port the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. The history of all attempts made to civilize inferior races shows that liquor has been one of the principal causes of their degradation. We are taking upon ourselves a grave responsibility in regard to this Territory, and it will be well worth our while to endeavour to avoid the mistakes made in connection with other attempts to colonize new countries, and to civilize inferior races. I believe that prohibition will offer us the only means of safety. It has been urged that we should inflict a great hardship upon the white residents of the Territory if we absolutely deprived them of the means of obtaining liquor, but is it right to for one moment weigh the convenience of a handful of white people against the welfare of half-a-million of God's creatures? The Prime Minister said that he would interfere when circumstances warranted, but that would probably be too late. That would be equivalent to asking a man to sign the pledge when he had delirium, tremens/, or vaccinating a man with the small-pox. We have an opportunity of establishing a new order of things in the Territory, and we should be lacking in our duty if we failed to take advantage of it . I do not see that the sale of liquor in wholesale quantities is attended with any less evil results than those consequent upon the retail traffic. Some time ago, when a contract was let in the Waranga Basin, in Victoria, the removal of an hotel was necessitated, and the licence was cancelled; but the brewer who had been interested in the hotel immediately set up a tent, ancl sold beer in quantities of not less than two gallons, the result being that the condition of affairs in that locality was even worse than when the public-house licence was in force. The attempt to make the people of Mildura a community of abstainers has absolutely failed. I am told that there are m'ore broken and empty bottles to be found there than in any other place in Victoria with ten times the population. That result has been brdugbfc about because the sale of liquor in the settlement was not absolutely prohibited. No hotel licences are issued, but clubs are carried on at which all those who desire it may obtain liquor. If we fail to prohibit the introduction of liquor into New Guinea, and the ruin of the natives results, the responsibility will lie at our door. honourable members have expressed sympathy with the amendment of tlie honourable member for Melbourne Ports, but find themselves unable to support it . The Prime Minister has stated that he is averse to applying prohibition to the white residents. sufficient evidence to show that the native population will suffer. go so far as that.

165,Mr Wilks,"I do not think we needsupporting fourteen licensed sellers of intoxicating liquors, and that they have consumed all the liquor that has been imported into the Territory, it is about time that we interfered, in their interests, apart from any consideration for the natives. We know that the natives on many of the South Sea Islands have been killed off in great numbers owing to the evils which have resulted from the sale of liquor, and we should do everything in our power to prevent a similar state of aifairs being brought about in tbe Territory. The application of the principle of nonalienation of land will prevent agrarian troubles with the natives in the future, and the prohibition of the sale of drink will also tend to the maintenance of peace and good order among the Papuans and to friendly relations between them and tlie white residents. All the evidence we have before us tends to show that the most rigid ordinances can be evaded, and I do not believe that State control of the liquor traffic would have that restrictive effect at which w.e should all aim. Let us do everything we can to preserve the native race. Those who advocate prohibition may be looked upon as fanatics, but in this instance, at any rate, I hold that their fanaticism has taken the right form. to prove that a man had not imported or sold liquor for medicinal purposes ? able and learned members to consider. My whole concern is with the principle, and not with the means of applying it . The Prime Minister declares that the adoption of the amendment of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports will result in a serious loss of revenue. I would point out to him that if he continues to allow so much liquor to be absorbed in New Guinea the whole of that revenue wiir be required to provide for additional police protection, and for the erection of gaols. the Committee wiil reject this ameudment. To my mind to attempt to regulate the liquor traffic in a new country in the way that is proposed is impracticable and absurd. We are all aware that in new lands the conditions which obtain are entirely different from those which prevail in settled commvmities. For example, it is very probable that large mining settlements will be established in New Guinea, the tropical climate of -which is very prone to engender fevers of various descriptions. That being so, the use of intoxicants becomes absolutely necessary. Everybody is familiar with the value of whisky or brandy in illnesses of that kind. MrM AHON -Yes, in connection with malarial fevers. To my thinking it is a piece of presumption for any honourable member, living under the conditions which obtain in Melbourne, to propose an amendment regulating the practice which shall prevail in a new country that is being opened up under the very greatest difficulties. Let us suppose that the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, or some other person of his extreme type, had succeeded in incorporating in the Western Australian law a similar provision to that which he has submitted for our consideration, at the time the Coolgardie gold-fields were being opened up. Had any such attempt been made, I venture to say that a riot would have oc'curred. There, men found it absolutely essential for the preservation of their health to use intoxicating liquors. They will find their use equally necessary in New Guinea, and they will obtain liquor, irrespective of any restrictions that we may impose. I repeat that the amendment is absolutely impracticable. Communication between the various parts of New Guinea is carried on chiefly by vessels, ahd how can I leave that for honorthe Government have officers stationed at every landing place to prohibit the sale of liquor by the crews. we prevent it from being brought in from German New Guinea? ber for Melbourne pertinently asks, how can we prevent it from being imported from German New Guinea?

Being doubtful whether the science of collective action is sufficiently advanced to make State control successful, 1 do not yet altogether favour that system.

Although the institution is still on its trial, there are reasons which may bring about its failure. For example, most public-houses offer attractions to men altogether apart from drink, whereas State institutions provide' no such attractions. However, I am rather anticipating the debate upon the amendment of the honourable member for West Sydney, and, thereI am not an expert in fore, I shall not add anything upon that aspect of the matter. I urge the Committee to carefully consider the effect of the proposal of tlie honourable member for Melbourne Ports before agreeing to its adoption, and to ask themselves whether it is not an idle provision to incorporate in a Bill which we hope to be of some service to the white population as well as to the natives of New Guinea1 the honourable member lor Coolgardie seemed to me to partake largely of the old advice But I desire to go to opposing counsel-whe n they have nocase, to abuse the plaintiff's attorney.

All these accusations may be well founded, but they do nob affect the propriety of the amendment under consideration.

184,Mr Mccay,"The honourable member forfor Coolgardie, because I intend to support the amendment-despit e his warnings to the contrary-in the interests of the natives of NewG uinea. The Prime Minister has declared that the adoption of the amendment would involve the sacrifice of the revenue which has hitherto been derived from the importation of intoxicating liquor, and which last year amounted to over£3,00Q, despite the fact that there are only 500 white residents in the Territory. Assuming -as we are bound to do-that at the present time the natives cannot be supplied with intoxicants, that amount of revenue represents an average consumption of liquor to the extent of £ 6 10s. per head of its white population. In New Guinea the duty upon spirits is identical with that which is charged in the Commonwealth, namely, 14s. per gallon. Treasurer estimates that within the Commonwealth for the current year the revenue from Customs and excise upon all classes of stimulants will be £2,800,000, or 15s. per head of our population. Therefore, if we allow that half our population is of the age at which it consumes only milk and water, the quantity of intoxicating liquor absorbed in the Commonwealth will represent 30s. per head of our adult population, as against £ 6 10s. per head of the white population, of New Guinea. That is a sufficient commentary upon the alleged drinking habits of the white residents of the Territory. They consume four times as much liquor as do the adult population of Australia. The Prime Minister also said that we should wait t ill the necessity arose before enacting legislation of the nature that is proposed. That is what has always happened where white people have come into contact with coloured races. They have waited until it was too late to attempt to regulate the liquor traffic. There is no example in the history of colonization in which liquorhas not played a large part in the destruction and degradation of the coloured races with whom white people have come in contact. There is no instance upon record where liquor has been introduced in which the natives have not suffered.

But, if the tender susceptibilities of the honourable member are offended by it, I will content myself with saying that I should be worse than criminal if I refrained from voting for the amendment. Honourable members have also urged that that amendment is impracticable, because the liquor could still be imported by the white population and supplied to the natives. It is The quite certain that by allowing the importation of liquor into New Guinea we cannot prevent the natives from drinking any more than we can by legislating to keep it out Such an argument is destructive of itself. would be openly sold at certain places, and in the other it would not. natives 1 MrM c CAY I am speaking of the natives.

MrM c CAY I think that the adoption of the amendment would act as a very great deterrent. I am not going to refrain from applying a remedy merely because it will not be complete in its operation. Half a loaf is better than no bread. If the amendment submitted by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports is defeated, I shall support the proposal of the honourable member for West Sydney. In my judgment, the argument that we cannot prevent liquor from being imported from German New Guinea counts for very little. In that case we could not prevent its introduction then, because it would be necessary, practically, to catch the man in the act of selling the liquor to a native in order to be able to punish him. In the other case, we should have much greater opportunities of preventing the use of strong drink bynatives.",32,Langdon Bonython Woul D That Matter Which Involved A High And Important

191,Mr Hughes,"Does the honourable and I feel very strongly the duty which is cast upon me in regard to this matter, and I do not propose to shirk it. If I have hurt the feelings of the honourable member for Coolgardie, I regret it exceedingly. would be very unfortunate if we allowed the liquor traffic to obtain in British New Guinea, practically without control, as is the case under tlie licensing systems in most of the States. We are assured by those conversant with the characteristics of the population, that the natives, where they come in contact with the whites, are frequently liable to indulge in alcoholic liquors, and that the habit has rather a bad effect upon them. We know that in nearly every instance in which so-called civilization has come in contact with coloured races those races have suffered from the introduction of. the rum bottle. I feel, therefore, that we have a right to take some special step to protect these people against themselves, and from the evils which would result from unrestricted traffic in strong drink. A t the same time, I do not know that the best course to pursue would be to adopt the policy of total prohibition. It seems to me that it is almost certain that, if the white people on the island were unable to obtain a local supply of. intoxicating liquor for their own use, some of their number would be encouraged to smuggle it . Queensland's nominal boundary line includes certain islands contiguous to New Guinea, on which the licensing laws of that State prevail, and I believe that it would be possible for a great many natives of the Possession, living in the immediate vicinity, to obtain supplies from these islands without experiencing much difficulty. It would, therefore, be better to make an effort at State regulation on the lines proposed by the honourable and -learned member for West Sydney. Even in the larger affairs of Australia, it would be well to have State control of the liquor traffic, and we have now a very good opportunity of trying the experiment. In dealing with British New Guinea we are free from many of the difficulties which confront the making of the experiment in relation to Australia or similar places, and I think that something requires to be done in this direction. I understand that, although the white population totals only 500, there are some fourteen different establishments licensed to sell liquor in British New Guinea. It is evident, therefore, that either the whites are phenomenal consumers of alcoholic drink, or that a considerable proportion of the natives obtain liquor. cludes stores which might not sell a gallon a week. The facts which are available make it palpable that the natives must be indulging in strong drink. The total customs revenue of the Possession is about £13,000 per annum. The natives do not wear much -that is subject to duty. They do not consume many articles of food which are liable to customs duty; they smoke a trade tobacco on which a large tax is not imposed, and we know that 500 white men, consisting for the most part of the working classes,.could not contribute £13,000 a year in this way. The inference, therefore, is that the natives largely consume intoxicating liquor, and in that way make up a proportion of the revenue of the Possession. In view of these facts I think it is necessary that some step should be taken to minimize the probable evil effects of the habit. That can best be done by limiting the sale of liquor by State regulation. Although we have to-day in New South Wales a law prohibiting publicans from supplying intoxicating liquors to aboriginals^ many of the blacks succeed in obtaining it, and, in some cases, they secure it direct from the hotel-keepers. For that reason I do not think it would be sufficient to allow ordinary licensed premises to exist in British New Guinea. Eveni f the licences were issued subject to a prohibition against the sale of spirits to natives, that prohibition would be broken. Buti f we had a State officer in charge of the sale of intoxicating drinks, the result would be different. Such an officer would have nothing to gain by supplying intoxicating liquors to natives, and it seems to me that it would be preferable to have State control as against the present system. Actual prohibition would, I think, lead to a large amount of smuggling, and it would be better to have the traffic subject to State regulation. I fear that prohibition would not be absolutely effective so far as the native races are concerned, and I arn not specially anxious that the white population should be compelled to .exist wholly without intoxicating liquors.

I would prefer to see the amendment indicated by the honourable and learned member for West Sydney put first, because I wish to vote first of all for the State regulation of the traffic. If that proposal were defeated, I should then vote for the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. I have a preference for the system of State regulation of the traffic, and, therefore, I intend to vote for the amendment foreshadowed by the honourable and learned member for West Sydney. am afraid that on this occasion I must vote with the enthusiast-the honourable member for Melbourne Ports-and against the practical politicians. I have come to that conclusion after listening to the speeches delivered by two practical politicians, who we discover are unable to agree. One of them considers that the State regulation of the traffic, as applied to the natives of New Guinea, would be an excellent system to adopt. The other tells us that in his opinion it would be of no avail; that in Western Australia-the only case in which he has a personal knowledge of the working of the system-it has not proved to be the success which its advocates anticipated. he called a failure. the honourable member described the experiment in that way. I have no reason to believe that he was endeavouring to impose on my credulity. I accept his assurance that tlie experiment in Western Australia has, so far, been a failure. The honourable member urged that rum, whisky, and brandy were necessary in connection with the opening up of a country such as British New Guinea. are opening it up. does not appeal to me, inasmuch as I do not wish to see the country opened up. I do not wish to see parties of prospectors scouring the Possession, pegging out claims for themselves, and making an effort to settle the country. My desire is that we should keep our population here for a time. ducement for white men to smuggle strong; When we have prospected Australia to a greater extent; when we have peopled the remote parts of the Commonwealth and turned our abundance of fertile soil to good use, it will be quite soon enough to prospect British New Guinea-to take the lands from the natives, and to give the pioneers some kind of stimulant whilst they are working in a malarial climate. For my part I shall always support the use of hot milk and water, as reported to have been recommended by the Prime Minister, in preference to any kind of stimulant. I should support its use for all ordinary purposes, even in a climate such as that of British New Guinea, as against stimulants. Toomuch milk and water may be a bad thing,, but taken in moderation it is an excellent draught, and can always be commended. I wish to see the natives left undisturbed for many a year to come. The more weleave them to their own enterprises-to their own forms of industry-and develop and police the country for them, and them alone, the more we shall seek the line of least resistance as well as the point of greatest safety. The adoption of that course will fulfil our mission for the next 50 years to come with regard to that new country. We have the melancholy experience that, whenever our people have endeavoured to civilize savage races and hav& taken the rum bottle with them, they have generally done them much harm.

The honourable member for Bland said that he objected to that system because it was impossible to absolutely prohibit the sale of ^strong drink.

There is no doubt about that. it . That, I think, is the obvious course -for us to take. If we do so, and the natives subsequently obtain intoxicating liquor, the responsibility will not rest with us. We shall have discharged our conscience in that we shall have done everything within our means to keep the liquor beyond their reach. I fear that the melancholy fact is that we shall not be able to keep it out altogether. When we have done our very best, some of it will get in. But that does not discharge us from the obligation to do our best to keep intoxicating drink from the natives, believing that the best thing we can do for them is to keepthem out of touch with it . Eor these reasons, I support the clause proposed by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. listened with deep interest to the discussion which has taken place upon this very important subject. I do not think that a British House of Parliament ever appears to greater advantage than when it is displaying, as we are doing now, a most keen -anxiety for the moral and spiritual welfare of those black races whom we so readily assimilate when our interests require us to do so. From all that ""we have heard, one would think that it would have been infinitely better to allow the natives of New Guinea to remain as they were, without any colonization under die British flag. If my honourable friend, the member for Melbourne Ports, or the honourable member for Echuca, or the honourable and learned member for Corinella, had any intention of going to reside in New Guineai t would be I do not suggest that proa very great inducement to us to pass the clause as submitted. But the last thing they propose to do is to go and face the hardships of colonizing life in New Guinea. It is so easy for men to legislate for the prohibition of things which disagree with themselves, or which are too strong for their own consumption. What would be the result of the clause ? It would simply make the medical profession a sort of vehicle for the sale and consumption of intoxicating America when similar attempts have been made ? My honourable friend, the member for Melbourne Ports, may look gravely at that if he has read the history of the attempts which have been made he will find that they have all failed in their They have all a philanthropical and benevolent basis, but even in the history of attempts amongst white people to prevent the consumption of intoxicating drinks, the result has been that the enactment has been so openly defied and broken as to loosen altogether the basis upon which rests the sanctity of the law. There will have to be a different sort of men from those whom we know of at the present day if prohibitive laws of this description are not to be broken.

But, so far as they are concerned, I believe that the amendment of my honourable and learned friend, the member for West Sydney, is infinitely better, and will do more to. promote the good object which my honourable frieud, the member for Melbourne Ports, has in view. The more the liquor trade is under the supervision and control of the Government the better, and the less the trade is an object of gain in New Guinea the better. to make it an object of gain ; the importation of liquor would not pay. ditional object of gain, because there would be also the temptation to the members of the medical profession to earn a fee by prescribing alcohol.. There are some medical men, as we all know, who have very wide ideas as to when alcohol should be prescribed as a medicine. He would be a latitudinarian of the profession who would go to New Guinea under any circumstances, probably ; and consequently this method of making the medical profession the custodian of tlie morals of the Papuans might end disastrously. W i th the element of gain eliminated, we shall have made effectual efforts to prevent the evils which we are all anxious to suppress. I understand that there is at present a law in force which prohibits the sale of drink to natives. The amendment proposed by the honourable member for West Sydney will tend in the same direction, and will, I think, be far more effectual than the clause of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. It will insure, so far as we can the labour which would be available there. insure in such a case, that all intoxicating liquor that goes there shall go through a Government channel and under Government control. It is simply impossible altogether to prevent the introduction of liquor. It is an impossibility arising from the circumstances under which that place has been colonized. But, while I thoroughly agree with the objects in view, I have always had a very strong idea that these attempts at total prohibition simply whiten the sepulchre, and cause far more irregularity and far more vice and crime than are caused under a system which is open to the light of day. I shall vote for the amendment. port the proposal of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. My only regret is that it does not go far enough. In my opinion no discretion ought to be allowed to the medical profession or even to the legal profession. As the honourable member for Parramatta has said, our duty is not so much with regard to the small white population of British New Guinea as with regard to the aboriginal inhabitants. Speaking as an Australian, I desire, if .possible, to see a total absence from the Territory which has come under Commonwealth control of the horrors which followed the advent of the white man, accompanied by intoxicating liquors, into Australia. In my opinion the only way in which this can be done is by absolute prohibition. The idea of allowing a certificate or prescription of a medical man to enable people to obtain liquor will, I consider, lead to nothing but a wholesale evasion of tlie law. It is proposed that Government stores shall be the sole purveyors of liquor. To hope, in the face of either of these means of obtaining drink, that we shall keep from the natives this destroying agent is, I think, absolutely absurd. I cannot imagine the condition of mind of those who are prepared to say that either of these two methods will be effectual to preserve the New Guinea race from what is undoubtedly their greatest menace. Some honourable members seem to think that this is an argument for abandoning the Territory'. I regard our retention of tlie Territory as absolutely necessary to Australia. I do not refer to the mineral wealth which it undoubtedly contains, nor do I mean on account of the production which might result from the employment of I mean on account of its proximity to Australia, and also on account of the fact that the part of the island which is not under our control is governed by two foreign powers which might at any time become enemies of the Empire. It is a great pity that we ever allowed any part of the island of New Guinea to go out of British control. We must maintain that portion of it which is already part of the Empire.

For many years I have been very much in favour of what is known as the Gothenburg system, which has worked exceedingly well in Norway and Sweden. Under that system, as I understand it, the liquor traffic is conducted by the municipalities, and the profits spent in the making of roads. It has been said that the Norwegian people drank themselves into good roads; but it is admitted that the consumption of drink is considerably less under the Gothenburg system than under the old plan of free-trade. I do not know the exact method now followed out in Norway and Sweden, but I believe it is more a State than a municipal matter, and, so far as my reading goes, much good has resulted. As to New Guinea, I should feel disposed to support any plan which would give the regulation of the liquor traffic into the hands of the Government, in preference to the present system of free-trade. becoming quite a socialist. life I have been a socialist in regard to things of this kind; and, in my opinion, the method suggested by the honourable and learned member for West Sydney would meet the difficulty very well.

W it h proper regulations as to the hours of opening and closing the saloons, the State officials having regular salaries would have no inducement to push the traffic amongst the natives.

I shall certainly vote for the amendment of the honourable and learned member for West Sydney. the aborigines of New Guinea are very similar to those of Australia, and that not much time would be needed to give them a liking for strong drink. The Australian aboriginal took to drink as if it were mother's milk, and the old pioneer settlers, when labour was scarce, found that the best means of securing it was to give the blackfellow a supply of liquor. In those old pioneering days, the labour of the natives was paid for by supplies of strong drink at stated intervals, and the arrival of the drays with stores from centres of civilization every six months, or it might be twelve months, meant no more work from the black men for a time. All the station proprietor required was that the blackfellow should take his drink with him some considerable distance into the scrub, so that the white people should not see what took place, and very often the result was a great burial amongst the natives. The drink had the most demoralizing effect on the natives. The Australian black, in his native condition, has many admirable traits, and despite what has been said about his low position in the scale of humanity, he presents great possiI do not know that under bilities of development.

In my own part of Australia, some 35 years ago, I have seen 300 blacks muster for their annual corroborees, whereas to-day one may travel hundreds of miles and find only two or three remnants of what were once powerful tribes. Similar results will follow in New Guineai f the drink traffic be permitted; and returns show that the traffic is already an influence. There are about fourteen different places licensed to supply the apparent requirements of about 500 white people. We can readily understand that, with the present primitive means of communication, it is fairly costly to import liquor into New Guinea; and if the licensed victuallers were limited to the white population for their custom there would not be nearly so many engaged in the business. The reasonable inference is that a taste for strong drink is fairly prevalent amongst the natives. I have no doubt .that drink is used by white people in New Guinea as a means to secure the services of the natives-service s that would not be rendered for any other payment. Jf our control of New Guinea is to be even in a small degree a blessing, and not a curse to the natives, we must keep strong drink away from them, and the only safe course is rigid prohibition. But we have to consider that there is a growing white population in New Guinea; and I very much question whether, so far as they are concerned, we can make prohibition complete. There would be no difficulty in dealing only with the natives ; but it is a very different matter when we have to consider a mixed population. The probabilities are that with a rigid system of prohibition-unles s there be behind a power to effectively administer the law in a community so scattered-ther e will be a great deal of illicit traffic which will extend from the white population to the native population. jurious effects of strong drink under a nominal system of prohibition ; and that is a phase of the question which, I think, will give rise to much difficulty. The only way in which we can minimize the evil in relation to the white population is by a system of State control. been brought to the conclusion that the true direction of reform in connection with the terrible drink curse, so far as the white population is concerned, is, not to endeavour to bring about immediately a system of prohibition, which will in every probability be inoperative, but to take away from the traffic the incentive of private profit, and place the whole business under the control of the State. WhatI feel strongly is, that at the outset we should do our best to take every means to prevent the demoralization and degradation of the natives of New Guinea, and I might ultimately go to the length proposed by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports of endeavouring to inaugurate and carry out an effective system of prohibition. But I believe that, in dealing with a mixed population, the next best thing is to adopt the system of State regulation. I cannot support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. In my opinion, it goes beyond the range of our parliamentary duties. We are at present taking over this Territory with a mixed population. I have no doubt that the honourable member, and those who agree with him, desire that the number of white people there should be increased, but he now asks us to introduce a measure of prohibition against both blacks and whites. We should not, at the present time in Australia, be able to successfully introduce such a measure, and the honourable member has failed to give us any reason why any difference in this respect should be made between the white population iu New Guinea and that in Australia. Both will be under the control, to a certain extent, of the Federal Parliament, and no laws should'be made applicable to one which are not also applicable to the other. I have also a still stronger objection to the proposal, and that is the difficulty of carrying out such a measure as the honourable member proposes. It is true that we can prevent the introduction of good liquor, but we cannot prevent the introduction of bad liquor. The conThere will be all the inversion of any of the starches into spirit is a very easy matter.

I think that very few words are necessary to recommend those provisions to the acceptance of the Committee. When I first gave notice of the proposed new clause, honourable members had not come to the decision that no land in New Guinea should be sold, ahd, therefore, I provided that five per cent, of the proceeds of sales should be applied to the purposes named ; but in view of the fact that, in future, land in the Territory is to be subject only to lease, I now propose that the amount to be set aside shall be ten per cent. The proceeds from the sale and lease of Crown lands in New Guinea amounted to £645 18s. I d . for the year 1898-9 ; to £371 4s. for the year 18991900; and to £637 18s. 7d. for the year 1900-1 ; so that the actual sura appropriated would be very small indeed. Possiblyi n time the amount available under this clause will be much greater than it is now. the appropriation is not of so much consequence. What really is important"" is that we should recognise our duty to the aboriginal races. We have taken their lands from them, and the obligation is clear and unescapable of making provision out of the revenue from such lands for those members of the race who, through our action or otherwise, are in destitution. It is hardly necessary to adduce proof that occasionally there is great distress among the natives of New Guinea, because more -than once in the annual reports which have been presented to the House the resident magistrates have referred to the scarcity of food and the consequent hardship suffered by the natives there. For instance, at page .39 of the report for the year 1900-1, a resident magistrate saysDuring the early part of this year, and well on towards the end of it, the natives were very short of food, partly owing to the dry weather in tlie beginning of the year. Then, in the annual report for the year 1899-1900, a resident magistrate writesThe food supply all over the district has been very scanty for the greater part of the last twelve months, and, until April, 1800, no yams or native food was obtainable. The D'Entrecasteaux group seems to have suffered, most from this scarcity ; in fact, in some parts of these islands the natives were mere skeletons. A fair case can be made out for this appropriation from these reports. We are practically taking away their land from the native population, and as we have been so careful about their moral well-being, in refusing to allow them to have intoxicating liquor, we ought bo take steps to provide for their material welfare. My proposal is a very moderate one indeed. It is by no means an innovation, because in the State of Western Australia similar provision was made in the Constitution Act. removed. only on the distinct understanding given by the Legislature of Western Australia to the Imperial Parliament that a certain sum would be appropriated each year for the benefit of the aboriginal inhabitants of the State. not less than £5,000 per annum. But the sinallness or magnitude of was provided for in a local Act. appropriated each year for the benefit of the aboriginals of the State. I think that the principle is a very proper one. It is to the interest of Australia to show the .world that we are prepared to deal gently, equitably, and even generously, with these disappearing races. I do not wish to detain the Committee; but I hope that there will be no difficulty in the way of the Prime Minister accepting the clause. Sir EDMUNDBARTON I have no objection to the end aimed at by this clause, though it may be necessary, either here or during the consideration of the measure elsewhere, in order to better carry its intentions into effect, to make some modification of its terms. I think it a wise provision to make. The amount appropriated will be very small. The total land revenue of New Guinea during the last financial year was less than £640, so that under this provision the sum appropriated would have been less than £64. It remains to be seen, however, whether the land revenue will be maintained, and whether the alterations which we have made in the conditions of land tenure will open the door to settlement or operate in a contrary direction.

Proposed new clause agreed to. Schedule and preamble agreed to. Bil l reported with amendments; report adopted. Sir EDMUNDBART ON ( H u n t e r Minister for External Affairs) I move That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill was introduced in the other Chamber, and has there been the subject of amendments upon which I shall speak at this stage. I am not proposing the second reading now with a view to asking honourable members to give further attention to the measure to-night; I do so to enable them to understand in what way it has been dealt with elsewhere, and so that they may be in a position to form an opinion upon its essential provisions. This can be in no sense a party measure, and during its consideration I must depend upon the friendly co-operation of honourable members on both sides of the Chamber for its improvementI do not mean improvement by tlie insertion of fanciful provisions, ments directed towards rendering it effective for the carrying out of the purposes in view. I shall indicate the direction in which the measure has been amended elsewhere without making any unnecessary reference to the debates of the other Chamber. As the Bill was originally introduced, men and unmarried women could apply for naturalization if they had been resident in the Commonwealth for five years, had been naturalized in the United Kingdom or in a State, or had been naturalized during infancy by the naturalization of parents. W it h regard to married women, it was provided that an alien woman who married a BritishI am content to accept the proposed subject became thereby a British subject herself, and remained so until after the death of her husband, or her divorce from him, she married an alien ; while a naturalized woman who married an alien lost her necessary to provide for the case of naturalborn women who married aliens. The provisions of the measure, so far as they applied to married women, followed to some extent the rule laid down in the English Naturalization Act of 1870-that a married woman's nationality is to be assumed to be that of her husband. As I shall show, that principle has sinee been departed from. As to infants, the Bil l originally provided that an infant whose father and mother had become naturalized, and who had at any time resided in Australia with its parents, BILL. should be naturalized during infancy, but on attaining the age of 21 years, must apply in the ordinary way to be naturalized as an adult. Now, as to the alterations which have been made by the Senate. In the first place, all persons who have been naturalized under the State laws are now to be deemed naturalized throughout the Commonwealth. TheB ill originally provided that persons naturalized under the State laws must apply in the ordinary form, if they wished an extension of their citizenship to the whole Commonwealth to be granted. The original provision was framed because it was thought that some discretion should be used in making certain classes of naturalized persons citizens of the Commonwealth, though, of course, as regards the great bulk of naturalized citizens of States there was no objection. However, in view of the large number of white persons who had been naturalized in but by amendsome of the States, and in view of the cogent argument that in a Bill of this kind all existing circumstances should be met, so that a Commonwealth citizenship could be at once established under its provisions, it seems reasonable to provide that all persons who at the passing of the measure have become naturalized in a State shall be deemed to have become naturalized throughout the Commonwealth. Of course, we are dealing only with naturalization within the Commonwealth, because that is all we can do. As to men and unmarried women, the provisions as to whom I recounted just now, the Bill, as amended, provides that all aboriginal natives of Asia, Africa, or the Pacific Islands, except New",42,Pairs
252,Mr Reid (East Sydney),"On e of theZealand, shall be precluded from making application for naturalization. I am now -speaking, of course, of future naturalization. As to the term of residence, the original proposal for five years has been reduced to two years. Upon this point I have -considerable doubt. It is true that under our Franchise Act we have provided, eo nomine, against this class of persons having the franchise. include British subjects in India1 plies only to aliens. It may be argued that in, defining our own citizenship within the Commonwealth we should not incur the same risk of introducing, complications into our relations with the Empire, and into the relations of the Empire with foreign nations, as if we were dealing with immigrants. Upon that subject, however, I must admit that I have some unsolved doubts. I can quite see that the urgency of avoiding any direct provision which might introduce complications is not quite so great in. a B ill of this kind as it would be in an Immigration Act, dealing with our external affairs, but, at the same time, I have grave doubts as to whether it would be wise to allow this provision to remain in the Bill, and whether it would hot be better to deal with such matters by way of the discretion of the Governor General in Council, which can be exercised so rigidly and with such scrutiny as to operate very largely to the same'end. . made by the Senate exclude British subjects in India? can exclude a natural-born British subject.

It may not be so serious as if it were in a Bill of another character, but I think that, in order to avoid trouble or complication, it will be advisable to . put the matter in another shape. Married women, as to whose status in the original B ill I gave some information just now, are by the amendment of the Senate placed upon the same footing as men and unmarried women. Under the Bill as it stands a married woman can apply for naturalization quite independently of her husband. As a result, the only difference in fact between women and men under the Bill appears to be this: that there are two ways in which a woman may be naturalized-firs t by application, and secondly by marrying a British subject. the other way 1 Bill as originally introduced an alien woman who married a British subject would become a British subject, and remain so until after the death of her husband, or her divorce from him.

265,Sir Edmund Barton,"Not in that an alien she loses her nationality ? appear to have been so under the British law of 1870. There are two ways in which an alien woman may be naturalized, one method being by applicationa right which she has in common with men-and the other being by marriage with a British subject. It would appear that the amendment made in this respect has put aside the principle of law laid down in the English Naturalization Act of 1870, that a British woman who marries an alien becomes an alien, because the Bill now provides that if a woman who is a British subject marries an alien, she shall retain her nationality. Therefore, a marriage with an alien will make no difference in the status of a woman who is a British subject. stand that, speaking generally, women are treated in exactly the same way as men ? tically so. I think that in this matter .we may adopt the Senate's amendment, because the trend of modern legislation is such as to give colour to the claim that as women have been placed upon an equality in regard to the franchise, and have been qualified to hold property, they are entitled to an inde. pendent status to a certain extent. women who marry aliens in other parts of the world ? Sir EDMUNDBARTON can speak of the operation of the Bill only within our own jurisdiction, but my honourable friend will find by reference to the Bill how far that extends. Although the provision iu the Bill may be in terms unqualified, the question as to how it should be read is another matter. W it h regard to children, I have already pointed out that, as originally introduced, the Bill provided that an infant whose father or mother had become naturalized British subjects should, during infancy, become naturalized subjects also, but that that qualification should cease upon their attaining the age of 21, when they would have the right to apply for naturalization in the ordinary way. TheB ill has been alteredI do not know whether it can be said to enlarge the right of the infant or not to obviate the necessity for any application, because it provides that an infant becoming naturalized by the status of either parent cannot lose that naturalization except upon application to be denaturalized. The other alterations made in the B ill are of a minor character. Mi-. REID I do not think there is any provision in the Bill for denaturalization. Bill as it now stands, but in clause 10, as originally produced, it was provided that the children of naturalized British subjects should retain their naturalization only during infancy, and that on reaching the age of 21 they should cease to be naturalized and should be required to make a de= novo application. provide any special facilities for denaturalization ? not think so. women should be placed upon an equal footing with men in every respect, why should not the marriage of a British-born woman with an alien have the effect of naturalizing the husband in the same way that the marriage of an alien woman with a British subject has the effect of naturalizing the wife ?1 Sir EDMUNDBARTON That is rather a conundrum. would be rather difficult to carry the equality I think we to that extent. The Senate have abolished the fee of £ 1 which it was intended to charge applicants for naturalization. I do not propose to object to that, because I think the money is neither here nor there. Then again, the B ill originally provided that applicants for naturalization should' furnish a certificate signed by a justice of the peace stating that the applicant was known to him, and was, to the best of his knowledge, a person of good repute. Under the Bill as it stands it is provided that an applicant shall obtain such a certificatesigned by a justice of the peace, or by three electors. I have some doubt as to whether that is not too great an extension of the original provision, because we know that there are a very few places in which an intending applicant cannot, without much trouble, find a justice of the peace, and I think it is desirable to have the certificate of a responsible person.

I have now explained the main provisions of the Bill as originally introduced, and in its present form. I have no need to add anything beyond saying that while the provisions with regard to the franchise, particularly in Australia, have made the bare grant of naturalization in itself not so important as it . used to be, there is in regard to citizenship of this -Commonwealth so much of importance, and so much that calls for the exercise of care, that I hope I shall have the co-operation of honourable members in so moulding the measure that it shall prove generally acceptable.

It declares that "" active service"" means "" service in or with a force, which is engaged in operations against the enemy, and includes any military or naval service in' time of war."" To my mind, all the words after the word "" enemy"" could with advantage be ebininated. The phrase ""active service"" appears in several clauses, and amongst others I may instance clauses 43 and 44. Honourable members will see that under the provisions of clause 43, the Governor General may in time of war call out the citizen forces for active service. Now, the term "" citizen forces"" includes the members of rifle clubs, militia, and volunteers, also men who have served their time, and who, under ordinary circumstances, would no longer be liable to be called upon. Thus, if these two clauses are read together, it will be seen that the Governor-Generali n time of war may call out the members of the rifle clubs for any military or naval service.

280,. Mr Higgins,"It may not be thetinctly limit the whole operation of these matters 1 enter into any technical argument upon this question. A t the same time, I think that in dealing with our citizen forces we ought not to employ any language which is not apt. What is the use of enacting a definition which is far too wide, and which may lead to misunderstandings ? provides that the permanent forces shall be liable to serve anywhere. in my judgment, we ought not to compel any man to engage in active service outside the Commonwealth. The Minister for Defence seems to have obtained his definition of ""active service"" from the English Army Act, which is utterly inappropriate to our particular conditions. I therefore move That the words ""and includes any military or naval service'in time of war,"" lines 5 and 6, be discipline. If they were not there, a memomitted. I am afraid that the definition extends further than the preliminary words would appear to indicate. I would ask the Committee to look at clause 46, where the words "" active service"" are also employed, although in that case they are not so important. Then, in clause 51, it is provided that the permanent military forces, and also all persons permanently employed in the active military forces, shall at all times, and all members of the citizen military forces shall while on ""active service,"" be subject to the Army Act. I am anxious to see that this definition is not too wide. Clause 52 provides that the naval forces while on ""active service"" shall be subject to the Naval Discipline Act. Clause 53 ' deals with the case of a man who is killed "" on active service,"" but there the provision, so far as it goes, . is for the benefit of the individual. In clause 58 we find that cadets are not to be liable for ""active service,"" while clause 74 provides thatAny member of the citizen forces who, when liable to be employed on active service, absents himself without leave from his corps for a longer period than seven days, shall be deemed a deserter, and may be punished accordingly. That is a very stiff provision. It means that even if a man is so ill as to be unable to go on active service amendment, so as to make it clear that if a not clause 45 disman is ill and unfit for service he shall not. be punished for absenting himself from his corps. the Minister should explain what is meant by the words "" and includes any military or naval service,"" in addition to* what appears in the earlier part of the definition. MrM c C AY (Corinella) I must confess that I do not share the apprehensions of the honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne with regard to this definition. A fte r all, it will have force only so far as. I frankly avow that, the words ""active service"" are found in the various clauses of the Bill, and the various clauses relating to "" active service "" must, it seems to me, be controlled by this definition.

MrM c CAY "" A force which is enengaged in operations against the enemy "" is a phrase which I understand when it occurs in military text-books, even if I do not understand its use in an Act of Parliament. It has a distinct meaning. It is one thing to be going to engage in operations against an enemy, and quite another thing to be actually engaged. force to an engagement would, of course, be in operation against the enemy. MrM c CAY If the honourable and learned member were engaged in moving only towards the theatre of war, he would not regard himself as being engaged in operations; he would consider that he wastravelling to a place where he would be so an engaged.

So far as I am concerned, I decline to accede to the position that a Ministry may choose to keep the people in arms for months and months, long after the actual danger of invasion has ceased.

It says, first, the time during which the invasion or attack exists threatened attack-and also the time that succeeds a proclamation by the Governor General that the invasion or threatened invasion exists. That is to say, tlie Governor General may proclaim that an invasion exists. I do not think that the honourable and learned member will quarrel with that. The Governor General would hardly proclaim that it existed if it did not exist. B ut the honourable and learned member may say that the Governor General may proclaim that a threatened invasion exists, and the forces may be called upon to serve.

If we cannot trust the Governor General-the Crown's representative-actin g on the advice of Ministers, to call out the forces for active service when there is a necessity for -them, I cannot conceive of any circumstances under which we can trust the Executive at all. Such a time as is contemplated under this definition is, it seems to me, a time when we . must trust the Executive. If there is no Executive to act, there is nothing. Parliament cannot control the operations of an array, though it may bring to book the people who have control of them. But when war is threatened we must have some one to act. power in Canada? MrM c CAY have not such a power in Canada, because I was not there when tlie Act was passed. I am not prepared to answer for their sins of omission or of commission. It seems to me that iu the case of Australia this is a wise and proper provision. It cannot be said that I am led to this conclusion by any ultra jingoistic sentiments, because I have expressed myself over and over again about the limitation of the service of the Australian forces to Australian defence, except as volunteers. I have always held that we can get plenty of volunteers for service of any kind. This is a proclamation which the Executive issues as the agent of Parliament and' the people; and unless it has to pass unquestioned it will give rise to doubts, difficulties, and ""bush "" lawyers. I admit that a power is given to the Executive, but it is a wise and very necessary power, and we must risk having a foobsh Executive on occasions. In Australia we ought to be able to mobilize troops at the scattered spots around the continent in good time. If England were engaged in a big war with one or more of the great powers, we should not know-becaus e the enemy would not tell us-of any threatened attack on the Commonwealth ; yet the chances would be that if the enemy found us unprepared they would* to use an every-day phrase, be glad to "" catch us on the hop."" In the absence of any sign; it would be easily open for people to say there was no threatened or apprehended invasion -that there was a mere apprehension of danger cording to the definition of wara threatened invasion will do. MrM c CAY W it h all respect, I do not think that ""threatened invasion "" means as much as ""apprehended invasion""; one means an overt act, and the other means a feeling that invasion may come. I have given notice I speak of actual or apprehended invasion. fight on English soil since the battle of Sedgemoor, more than 200 years ago. When Britain declares war the regular army is moved to the scene of operations, though they are not regarded as being in the field when embarked. The troops which sailed from Southampton to South Africa were not regarded as being in operation I do not know why they against the enemy whilst they were sailing to South Africa. The Crown declares war, and the troops sail for the theatre of war, and there they are on active service, and subject to anything that may happen in time of war. In the peculiar geographical circumstances of England, men go from England to the war, whereas war w ill come to us ; and that makes it all the more necessary for us to fix a time, without waiting for the enemy to come to us. It is impossible to argue that this definition of war cover's anything except actual or threatened invasion or attack, and the Executive are the only people who can possibly be left to say when an actual or threatened attack has assumed dimensions so portentous as to justify the calling out of the forces. And to fix a time is better for the men. Here is a time before which the men are free, and after which they come within the operation of the Act so far as active service is concerned, and, therefore, I trust the Government will adhere to this proper definition. I agree with every word of the honourable and learned member for Corinella so far as regards the need of the Ministry acting and taking the responsibility.

I am bound to say that I cannot see any logic in his suggestions. The honourable and learned member seems to be entirely disturbed by a fact that has no bearing on this question. He appears to think that Canada is a prototpye which we are bound to follow on every possible occasion. The honourable and learned member finds some precedent in Canada for -certain action he has taken in this House, but I do not see why we should be guided -entirely by Canada in a mattes upon which we profess to be able to think for ourselves. 'The Minister for Defence has shown a complete parallel between the condition of the law in England and the condition of the law -sought to be enacted here. If honourable members will consider the amendment -of which the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne has given notice, they will find that "" time of war,"" -as he defines it, would mean any time during which a state of war actually exists. There are a number of clauses in this Bill under which the Executive are given power in time of war to call out certain of the forces, and the effect of the amendment would be that the Executive of this country would not have power to exercise their functions under these clauses in calling out certain of the forces until war actually existed with the -Commonwealth. ""Who ever heard of such a thing as that ? The General Officer Commanding, who is the permanent head of the War Department, whose representative in Parliament is the Minister for Defence, would have no power under our Defence Act -war was actually at our door. Then the. honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne leads himself into this -contradiction that while under his first -amendment ""time of war"" would require war actually to exist, the word "" war"" itself would include existing war or the apprehension of war. If we speak of time of war, and take "" war "" to be as defined by the last interpretation proposed, we should refer to -a time during which war actually existed, Or was apprehended. But if we take the expression "" time of war "" as defined in the Other mterpretation proposed by the honorable and learned member, we should refer to a time in which war actually existed, and not to a time when it was apprehended. The Minister has completely answered the honourable and learned member's statement that there is no parallel to this proposal in England. This Bill provides that as soon as war exists, or is apprehended, the permanent head of our Defence Forces, through the Minister, shall have the power of determining that certain troops shall be called out, and the interpretation clause shows clearly that it is contemplated that a proclamation shall be issued, because it is provided that"" Time of war "" means any time during which a state of war actually exists, and includes the time between the issue of a proclamation of the existence of war or danger thereof and the issue of a proclamation, declaring that the war or danger thereof declared in the prior proclamation nolonger exists. That is to say, it includes the period between one proclamation and another. The logic of this is that' the Minister for Defence will have to issue a proclamation declaring that war existed or was threatened, and he would have to issue another proclamation, at a time when the danger had passed, saying that it was at an end. The honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne seems to be under some misapprehension that the Executive may, as he says, for reasons of? their own, keep back the issue of the second proclamation. Let us look for a moment at the parallel in England. The Minister for Defence shows us that in England the Executive can declare war, and that when the period of danger is over the troops are "" released."" That releasing of the troops is no doubt done by proclamation; but, whether it be done by proclamation or not, it could be kept back just as easily as the issue of the second proclamation here. If the Executive of Great Britain to call out the troops until were anxious to keep back the release of troops their action would have exactly the same effect of checking or nullifying any rights that might arise, as the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne apprehends would follow the same action of the Executive here, if they had any object of their own to serve. We have no desire to mix up the Executive with the legislative functions of the country in this House. It would be an absurd proposal to suggest that this House should be consulted as to the time when it is necessary to call out the troops. I should be sorry to see the day when the question whether war is threatened, in the sense in which military men would understand it , would come up for discussion amongst us.' The effect of the clause therefore is that, if the General Officer Commanding considers thab war is threatened, it is open to the Executive to take action equivalent to a. declaration of war in England, and when the time of danger is over it will be open to them to declare that the time has passed during which the danger threatened, and then all the rights which may have arisen would be at an end, and the Government would be protected against any claims such as those suggested by the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne. I hope the Minister for Defence will adhere to these clauses as they stand, because the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne has not suggested any improvement, nor has he shown any fault in the drafting of this part of the measure. strike honourable members that the honourable and learned member who has directed attention to this clause has taken it for granted that the Executive body in the Parliament of Australia will be composed of idiots or something worse. We may conjure up evils or troubles in connection with any clause in any Bill or Constitution. As the Minister for Defence has already pointed out, it is in the power of the Prime Minister of this country to choose his Ministers from undesirable people in the street. The right honourable gentleman has pointed out that it is in the power of the Prime Minister or of the Executive, if they see fit, to liberate all criminals, but they do not do these things, because it is understood that government will be carried on in accordance with common sense. If we do not assume common sense in the interpretation of these clauses, or of the Constitution, the whole system of representative government falls to the ground. ber's reasoning we had better abolish all Acts of Parliament and give Ministers absolute discretion to do everything. and learned member I may say that there are two considerations, which prevent an Executive from doing anything that is wrong. The first is that they are afraid of losing their position. them. which a Parliament can inflict on an Executive is that of destroying it . Men are not members of a Ministry for the purpose of drawing their salaries, but for the purpose of doing good, and I have no doubt that the honourable.and learned member for Northern Melbourne would consideritanextremepenalty to be deprived of the opportunity of doing good. The honourable and learned member is endeavouring to do good in this instance according to his lights. We may, I think, assume first that we will have an Executive which can be punished, and that the members of the Executive have a senseof responsibility, and a fear of Parliament. It is right that the Executive should fearto do what Parliament does not desire, or what would be adverse to public opinion, knowing that if it does these things it will be punished for them. What the clausemeans is that the Executive must accept the responsibility of saying when a certain state of things exists, and that responsibility must be accepted^ no matter how the clause h& worded! That being so, it is remarkable that an honourable member who believes in the supremacy of the people under a system whereby the Executive is controlled by a majority in Parliament should be frightened by the possibility of evil being done by an Executive which is virtually under thedomination of the people. I have now in my possession the English Volunteer Act, 26 and 27 V i c , cap. 65, section 17 of which provides thatIn case of actual or apprehended Invasion of any Part of the United Kingdom (the Occasion, being first communicated to both Houses of Parliament if Parliament is sitting, or declared in Council aud notified by Proclamation if Parliament is not sitting), Her Majesty may direct the Lieutenants of Counties throughout G veat Britain, or such of them as Her Majesty may judge necessary, to call out the Volunteer Corps of their respective Counties, or any of them, for actual Military Service. In England, therefore, there must be first an actual or an apprehended invasion. Then there must be the declaration to ParI n reply to the honourable liament, or proclamation-tw o safeguards ; while under the clause only one is provided for. I am not in the least affected in my view by the speeches which I have heard upon this point, because I think they have been delivered under a misapprehension. To reduce to an absurdity the argument of the good-natured, humorous, and eloquent member for Richmond, we should abolish Acts and Constitutions, and say that the Ministry of the day shall have f u l l power to do anything they think fit, since",53,Defenc Ebill

If it is desirable to fix a time limit, the amendment should be made in clause 14. that. . preferable to leave the matter to be dealt with by regulation, because it may not be an easy matter to fix a hard and fast time limit which would not apply with harshness in certain cases. MrM c C AY (Corinella) -It has been the practice in Victoria te attach men to the forces as candidates for commissions, and afterwards to call upon them to pass a preliminaryexamination. Sometimes this has taken place some months after the candidates have been attached, because it has not been convenient, or practicable, to hold the examinations earlier. After candidates had passed the preliminary examination, they were appointed as lieutenants on probation, and our regulations provided that after occupying that position for six months officers must undergo an examination prior to the confirmation of their commissions. Having passed this examination, they were appointed lieutenants. It was always considered fair that officers on probation should have a second chance of -qualifying if they failed at the first examination, the consequence being that in some cases a period of two years elapsed before the final examination was passed. practice. MrM c CAY It must be remembered that in England there are possibly a score of candidates for every commission, whereas in Australia, and particularly in the country districts, it is sometimes difficult to find men who have the time and money necessary to enable them to act as officers in the Defence Forces. I think that a fairly long time limit should be provided for. It would be preferable, to my mind, to have the term fixed by regulation, but if honourable members think it necessary to specify it in the Bill, I would suggest a period of eighteen months. We shall have to depend upon the regulations to some extent, because the military authorities will have to fix a time for the examinations. So far as promotions to positions beyond the rank of lieutenant are concerned, there are generally more candidates than vacancies. Occasionally it happens that an officer is called upon to take a command beyond his rank, and provisional rank is conferred upon him ; but the regulation will apply more particularly to officers who are first appointed to the do forces. I think it would be think the Minister has missed the point of the honourable member for Grampians. The honourable member did not refer to first appointments, but to officers, who, after having served for some time, had proved that they were inefficient. He pointed out that the Home authorities were moving in the direction of insisting upon efficiency. <I think that some means ought to be devised by which an officer who has proved himself efficient should be able to pass an examination having reference to the particular duties which he is to be called upon to discharge, so that the inefficient men might be weeded out of the service. How that object is to be accomplished I cannot say. It is possible that something in that direction may be achieved by regulation, but I fear that in the end the military authorities will have to decide whether a man is efficient or otherwise. tion. shall have failures in the future as we have had them in the past. A t the same time, it is evident that the Home authorities are moving in this direction. I trust that the Minister will take a note of the remarks of the honourable member for Grampians, with a view to drawing the Military Commandant's attention to this matter. Clause agreed to.

The law should therefore be made as elastic as possible. I quite recognise that our aim should be to secure the ablest officers available to exercise control over men's lives.

Upon one occasion Napoleon said that no man could stand ten years of campaigning, and any person who has awaited a verdict -eve n a political verdict in which he was personally interested-know s what a severe strain is imposed upon him by apprehension and uneasiness.

I take it that the object of honourable members is to weed out the duffers from the provisional officers appointed. They hold that if an officer cannot pass an examination within eighteen months he should forfeit his commission. ber keep a station manager for eighteen months in order to determine whether he was efficient 1 that he was not worth keeping, I should not retain him for eighteen minutes. I am merely asking that the law should be made as elastic as possible, and that we should depend upon our military administration. We have an able English officer in control of these matters. He virtually selects every one of his officers. If Major-General Hutton fails in his duty, everything fails. not run away with that idea. vinced that in military matters, those in authority have very much to do with the appointment and advancement of their I think that eighteen officers.

They have only a certain number of days to put in, and they receive a certain pay. They are not permanently employed. I dare say I shall be misrepresented in regard to this matter. I do not deny that we must have some permanent men for special services like the naval service, the instructional, artillery, aud engineering services. But that to which I , in common with a number of people, object is that we should have a permanent armya system of permanent corps of men.

516,Mr Wilks,"My experience in Newwith the position taken up by the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, so far as I understand it . I underber employed down to the absolute ministand that the honourable and learned member desires to reduce as far as practicable the number of permanent men to be employed in connection with our Defence Eorce. It has always seemed to me to be highly undesirable in a community such as this, or indeed in any community, to withdraw from productive enterprises any greater number of men' than is absolutely essential. We require their services primarily in developing used in the Bill and that suggested by the the resources of the country. I can.therefore quite sympathize with a desire to keep the number of permanent men as low as possible. But I do not quite see how we can lay down in the Defence Bill a maximum number of permanent men to be employed. The number can only be decided from year to year according to circumstances. It is true that we'who in this House voted for a reduction in the Defence Estimates for last year and the previous year were not as successful as we could have wished in the manner in which the reduction was applied, but there was no other course open to us. We could not pretend to that intimate acquaintance with the peculiarities and conditions generally of the service, which would enable us to say exactly in what manner the reduction should be effected. We were compelled, therefore, to rely upon the Minister and his advisers, to adopt the course in making the required reduction which would least effect the efficiency of the forces. Admitting all that, I do not see how we can decide beforehand what would be an adequate number of permanent men to employ. arise now. quired will depend to some extent upon the nature of the defence we decide to adopt. If we go in for a large number of fixed defences, forts, floating batteries, submarine of a certain class, as, for instance, garboats, and torpedoes, involving complicated machinery, and a great deal of mechanical knowledge on the part of the men employed, as well as familiarity with the weapons to be used, we shall require a much larger number of permanent men than we should require if we set aside those means of defence, and depended almost entirely upon our field artillery and rifle corps. It seems Citizen Forces,"" be omitted, with a view to insert to me that the number of permanent men required will always be varying ; though I admit that there should be a desire on the part of Parliament to keep the nummum. I understood the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne' to say just now that the question of the number would not arise under the present clause, and I am not quite clear as to what the honourable and learned member desires to effect. I should like to have demonstrated any differencewhich can be shown between the phraseology honourable and learned member. A difference may be patent to a mind accustomed totechnical expressions, but I do not see that any great object is to be gained by alteringthe phraseology in the way proposed. To bring matters to a test, what I proposewould be that the clause should stand in this wayThe Defence Force shall consist of the military and naval forces of the Commonwealthand thenT would alter the succeeding words, and in their stead use the words and, except as hereinafter provided, shall be a citizen force. The effect of that would be to make thecitizen force the rule and the permanent force the exception. As the clause at present stands, we have the permanent force as. one branch, and the citizen force as another; standing upon a level, and the GovernorGenerali n Council may appoint any permanent force he thinks fit. If what I propose is adopted, when the Minister has had the advice of the permanent head of the Department, he can speak as to the per-manent force required, and we can strictly limit its character. I hope it will beunderstood that I do not think it essential to limit the number of men unnecessarily. I desire to fix the character of the permanent force, to suggest that the only permanent' men employed shall be men rison artillery, naval men, and perhaps, field artillery. After consultation with the General Officer Commanding, the Minister will be able to tell us what classes of permanent men he will require to create.

I am unable to see the broad distinction which lie seeks to make manifest to the Committee. He admits that it is on .absolute necessity of tlie military situation -that there must be a permanent force, that we must have permanent artillery, and a .permanent instructional force, constantly employed and paid. Hew can we have these unless we provide for a permanent -force? The honourable and learned member seeks if possible to minimize almost to the vanishing point the idea of a permanent force, and to bring into greater prominence the idea of a citizen force. I do not see that the terminology of the Bill as it stands prevents that being done. The .actual and effective control of these forces will be ours at the time of passing the Estimates.

For instance, the last military estimates provided for a new force entirely. posed to establish a garrison of 25,000 men in South Africa.' They are re-arranging the whole disposition of their defences .at home and abroad, and I have not heard that they have introduced a new B ill to take power to do that. The more -elastic we make the terms of the Bill the more effective will be our control of the forces in the parliamentary arena. -It is when the Estimates are being dealt with that we shall really control the force. A f t e r all, we cannot do very much in the .actual working out of our military schemes in dealing with a Bill of this description. In this Bill, wo take power to do certain things, but it is in the actual disposition of the forces that our active control over them will be -found to exist. Therefore, with the greatest possible deference to the honourable and learned member, whose great gif t of exposition I always admire, I am bound to say that I do not think his g if t has been displayed this evening as lucidly as it ordinarily is. I submit that the. honourable and learned member is chasing adifficulty which has no substantial existence. We do not surrender our control of the forces ; we may manipulate them as we like in dealing with the Estimates ; we may make the permanent -force as may reduce it to one man by the simple exercise of our power when the Estimates are before us. We can in the same way multiply the citizen forces to any extent we wish. I cannot bring myself to see that the matter is of the extreme and pressing importance which the earnestness of the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne would seem to indicate. mittee is unanimous in agreeing with the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, that a community depends upon the martial spirit of its people, and not upon military caste; but it is not possible to eliminate the word "" permanent"" from this Bill. that. the honourable and learned member by providing that the Defence Force shall be divided "" into a citizen force and into a a permanent force."" By adopting this form we shall put first the mainstay of the force, and allow the permanent force to be referred to subsequently. I do not think it The Imperial authorities prois possible for us to do more than that. If the honourable and learned member is prepared to accept an amendment in that form, I shall vote for it . that this .is a flank movement on the part of the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, and we must consider it in connection with some proposals which he makes' with reference to laterclauses. I ask the honourable and learned member whether what he now proposes might not be met by the limitation of numbers which he proposes in clause 30 ? I am with the suggestion to limit the number of the permanent force. Having officers and experts to train men, we do not require any very large permanent force ; but if there should be only 1,000 men in the permanent force, as the honourable and learned member proposes, we should still require some term by which to refer to them. Sir JOH N FORREST There are 1,400 now. term, as it is defined in the clause, is a necessary one. It is proposed to strike out clause 28 altogether, and later on to limit the number to 1,000 ; but I think it will be better to leave this clause as it stands, small as we desire, . and whatever limitation we make later on.",67,Smith Th E Honourable And What Either Force Shall Consist That Is Dealt

526,Mr Spence,"It seems to me that theThere is also another proposal of great importance to be considered in connection with the clause, so that, perhaps, it .might be better for us to postpone it . There has been so much discussion upon the provisions of the clause, that it is difficult for honourable members to grasp the situation. AlthoughI have listened very attentively to the debate, I have had some trouble in arriving at an opinion as to the real meaning"" of the amendment. The honourable member for Dalley has raised another point. He says that he belongs to .a force for which no provision at all is. made in the Bill. I intend to support the clause as it stands. When the proposal of the honourable member for West Sydney is brought before us, it will enable us to deal with military matters in a much more satisfactory way than has been possible in the past.
