Colonial Ammunition Company-Leas e and Copy of Further Agreement with the Victorian Government. In Committee (consideration resumed from 27th June, vide page 1778): Clause 53If an officer is allowed to use for the purpose of residence the whole or part of a building belonging to or occupied by the Commonwealth, the Governor General may direct that a fair and reasonable sum as rent there for be deducted from such officer's salary, and the amount of such sum shall be fixed by the commissioner or by officers specially or generally appointed for the purpose by the commissioner. In calculating for any purpose the rate of salary of such officer the amount so deducted as rent shall be deemed and taken to be part of his salary. the Minister for Home Affairs to consider' whether he can see his way to allow country postal officials to have their quarters free. In many cases the officials-no t only postmasters, but also postmistresses are actually taking care of Government property, and I think in fixing the rent attaching to the buildings that circumstance should be taken into consideration. I have an amendment which I do not wish to press'; but, at the same time, I would like to know whether the honourable gentleman feels disposed to consider the question, or to entertain an amendment allowing free rent to these officers in certain coses. I wanted to raise the same question. In some of *fche States practically all the postmasters, from the Deputy Postmaster downwards, are allowed free residence.

In South Australia the officers have had this right for .many years, and, .unless"" that right is continued,' there will be a distinct drop in their salaries. I believe the principle of the clause .is quite right-that where the use of buildings is allowed free for residential purposes, a fair rent should be allowed for them, in order to place all the officers on the same .footing. MrA . McLEAN is added to the -value of the salary. toria then there will be no difficulty, but-in the case of some other States tlie rent is not added to the salary : . it is entirely apart from the salary.

I .would .like to know how this clause will read in with clause 51. MrO ' MALLEY (Tasmania) I wish to ask the-Minister for Home Affairs if .there could not be a minimum salary provided or some, arrangement made so that women in small towns would not .be .charged-rent where the salary was below a certain amount. to support the suggestion. made by the honourable member for Cowper. In .the past a great deal of hardship .hasoccurred to numbers of public servants who are compelled by regulation .to reside in quarters which have .been provided for them. In many instances the quarters have been totally unsuitable to the requirements of their families, which havohod toAe divided, the. men being compel led to remain on the premises in order to protect Government property. Sometimes they have had to add, at their own expense, to .the. accommodation provided in .order .that their families might remain. It would be. a good thing if the Government were to follow the practice adopted by .banking companies and so regulate .transfers and removals.as to accord with the accommodation at the disposal of the State. The Government could, on the other hand, do away altogether with charging for rent. If a .man. is compelled by reason of tbe Government's necessityas in the case of a postmaster, whohas to protect valuable property-to reside on the premises, lie should not be penalised in any In Victoria the rent .shape or' form, but should rather receive more consideration seeing that, in addition In the case of Victo his ordinary duties, he acts as custodian of Government property. I .quite agree with the .latter part of the clause, which provides that in calculating for any purpose the rate of salary, the amount deducted as rent shall be taken into account. We have had cases in Victoria-and I think the honourable member for Gippsland will bear me out-wher e claims have been made for pensions based on the rate of salary paid in addition to the amount deducted for r e n t; although these claims have been resisted by the State. As I said, I.agree with .the latter part of the .clause,but I would lik e to see every consideration given to those employees of the State who, for purely departmental-reasons, I do.not.know the are compelled to reside in.quarters provided for them in .buildings used by the State. agree with the principle of the clause, but I would like to draw the attention of the Minister to a state of affairs that has arisen iu New South Wales, under a somewhat similar position, and to ask him to endeavour to provide against that under the Commonwealth. In New Soutii Wales the rent charged .for the building is liable to fluctuation according to. the salary a man .gets, without any alteration in the accommodation provided. In some cases-sa y for instance, the case of a school teacher-the.salar y has been increased because of .the large attendance at the school, and the Government have promptly mulcted the officer in an extra amount for rent. Tho proper -way would be to fix a fair rent, and a fair rent only, for the accommodation provided for the officer. .T would . like the Minister to say whether it would not be possible to definitely provide that .the commissioner, who under the clause .has the fixing of the rent, should be guided by .the .fair rental value of the building, and that .there should be no consideration of the salary.

In computing the salaries of officers the commissioner, the permanent head, and the Governor General can take into consideration the residences occupied in Government buildings. Isuggest that the clause be altered in the direction I have just indicated. I think that will meet the case, and then the provision will remain sufficiently elastic to permit of light-house keepers not being charged. Buti t has to be remembered that in computing pensions some trouble has arisen in the past in considering the question whether the rental ought to be included. We want to get rid of that trouble. We wish to have no doiibt about it in the future. That seems to be the only reason for the insertion of this clause. I move That tlie words ""is allowed to use,"" line 1, be omitted with the view to insert the word "" occupies "" in lieu thereof. Amendment agreed to. that this clause should stand, but I venture to suggest that a slight addition should be made to the hist sentence of it . The clause readsIn calculating for any purpose the rate of salary for any officer the amount so deducted, as rent shall be deemed and taken to be part of his salary. As has been very properly pointed out by ihe Minister for Home Affairs, that provision affects the question of gratuities, compensations, or pensions. I therefore intend presently to move That the following words be inserted after the word ""rent,"" in line 11, ""together with any amount deducted for rations or fuel."" I desire the insertion of these words because quite a number of persons in the permanent force, and light-house keepers and others, is thought desirable to charge something, a would in tlse natural course of events have sum proportionate to the circumstances will a certain sum deducted for rations supplied. be charged 1 In calculating their salaries, they would be placed at a disadvantage compared with too. others who were not under like conditions.

My object is to make it clear that the rental the honourable member for Bland that he fixed shall not fluctuate according to the should insert the words* "" not exceeding."" salary which a man happens to receive, but Otherwise, though the Government might be shall be calculated rather upon the rental disposed to charge a less sum, they would be value of the building or portion of a building prevented from so doing. which he occupies. In New South Wales an extremely unsatisfactory state of affairs exists, owing to the fluctuations which occur from time to time through the amount that is charged against the officer's salary for the rental of a building. My proposal seems to me to be a reasonable one. It seems to be a reasonable thing to calculate the sum upon the rental value of the building. I m o v e That after the word "" fixed,"" line 7, the words ""on the basis of the rental value"" be inserted. . to the honourable member that he should provide for calculating the amount to be charged against any officer's salary on the basis of the local rental value. Otherwise we might have one rental value applied to the whole of the Commonwealth. If the word "" local"" were inserted, it would make the meaning perfectly clear. word "" local"" seems to me would be mere redundancy. I thought it would be taken for granted that my amendment referred to the local rental value. have a clear understanding in regard to this matter. I gathered, from what the Minister for Home Affairs said, that the clause is now to be framed in such a way that it.may be made use of in any proper case, but that the. Government will take into consideration the circumstances of each particular case, and will not apply a cast-iron rule. I understand that if it is not fair in any praticular case to charge any rental at all, no rental will be charged.

32,Sir William Lyne,"-MajI suggest tocept the suggestion of the Minister and to insert the words ""not exceeding."" that this amendment is unnecessary and may operate in an embarrassing way in the administration of the Act. If it is considered desirable, then I think that the words "" a fair and reasonable sum as rent thevefor,"" in lines 4 and 5, should be omitted. What more elastic power could be given to the Minister than is already conferred by the clause ? If a public servant is occupying a building for residential purposes, and if in the opinion of the Minister he should pay rent there for, then the Minister has ample opportunity to fix a reasonable sum. sum shall be fixed by the commissioner. missioner, I presume, the Minister stands. I think the words I have indicated give the commissioner or the Minister ample latitude to do justice in every case that may come before them. mission of the committee I should like to withdraw the amendment with a view to insert after the word "" there for,"" in line -5, the words ""not exceeding the fair rental value."" It is precisely because the power of fixing the amount to be charged as rental is in the hands of the commissioners in New South Wales that objection has arisen. There has been too great a fluctuation and not enough of system, so that civil servants very properly complain that they do not know where they stand in regard to these rents. We ought to have something definite, it seems to me, so that the Minister or the commissioner should not have an entirely free discretion in regard to this matter. .that these words would create further difficulties instead of easing the situation, because there fire some premises built on a palatial scale in which an officer is expected to reside, and the insertion of the words proposed by the honourable member for Bland really mean that a fair rental value is to be the basis of the valuation. The words "" not exceeding "" must be read with the other words in the clause, and must be taken to mean something beyond what the other words by themselves would convey. We have it provided that the rental must be a fair and reasonable sum, and it is now proposed that the terms fair and reasonable should be governed by some other consideration. Therefore, we shall be making the lot of the civil servants heavier than before, because many of them are compelled to live in buildings erected in a princely style, and if they are valued upon their rental value, the servants residing in them will be mulcted in an extremely high rental. under the New South Wales Act owing to the fixing of the rental value so that it fluctuates with the salary received. feature which need not be imitated in the Commonwealth. We cannot frame an Act of Parliament that will overtake all such vagaries.

I am speaking now of the officers taken over from the States. be used in calculating the salaries too. Mr A. M c LEAN (Gippsland) I presume the Minister in charge of the Bill has looked into the meaning of the clause if amended as proposed. In Victoria there has been a great deal of difficulty arising over the question of charging rent for quarters. Before tbe present practice was put into force, the officers' salaries were based on a lesser amount than would have been the case if they had not been charged rent, and it was found that their pension rights were computed on the amount, of the salary alone, without any consideration being given to the amount charged for rent. When the Public Service Board were appointed, in order to cure this anomaly they added the value of the rent to the salary in most cases I am told it was not done universallyin order that both might be taken into consideration in computing an officer's pension",17,Public Service Bil L

They brought actions against the Government, and some of the judges upheld their view, and I believe there is an: appeal pending now. It is, therefore, necessary in dealing with this matter to see that justice is done all round. number of cases arose in Victoriai n which the Government were prepared, in calculating the pensions, to take into consideration the amount charged for rent, but -would make no allowance at all for the sum deducted for rations or fuel. Of course, both these items, fuel and rations, and rent, were deducted from the salary, but if the officer had not been living on the Government premises there would have been no deduction on account of rent; and if he had not received the rations that the Government insisted upon his taking, no deduction would have been made from his salary for rations. Bill to make deductions for rations and fuel? Under ordinary circumstances, what applied to the service prior to the transfer will apply still, and lest that may be so I think that it ought to be made clear that civil servants are to have an allowance made for any rations or fuel that they may be charged for. defence forces and employed at light-houses and so on are now being charged so .much for fuel and food in just the same way as before the transfer .took place,'and if that is so, they ought to be protected by tlie amendment I now suggest. If it is not so, there is no necessity for the amendment. The Ministeri n charge of the Bill did not i-eply to the question I raised as to the existing rights of public servants who now have free quarters, fuel, and light. My point was whether, in the event of an officer having these privileges free now, on its being intimated to him, under the provision of this clause, that he will have to pay certain rent for the premises he is occupying, the amount so charged will be added to This was clone his salary. It seems to me that in no other way can we preserve existing rights, and unless I am assured on this point I shall .have to vote against the clause. Sir WILLIAM LYNE I think the position is that the commissioner and the Governor in Council can vary any position that exists at the present time, as far as rent is concerned, after the officers have come under this Bill. I do not see how it could be otherwise, because there would be variations in value almost from day to day. Mi. A . McLEAN -.They would take into 1 consideration whether the salary had been increased by tlie amount charged for quarters, or not. of an officer who was getting £ 5 0 0 a year, and was occupying quarters valued upon a fair rental value at £100 a year. I take it that the commissioner would calculate his salary at £ 6 00 ; but if the value of the premises which the officer is now required to occupy amounts to only £ 5 0 a year the salary would be increased to .£550 will have power under the clause, with the small amendment the Minister has made, to do justice all round. I think would be the effect of the clause ; and seeing that that would be the actual practical result, no injury would be done to any public servant. Amendment negatived. It seems to me that some allowance must be made in the case of public servants who are I believe that the men in the compelled to reside upon Government those that are premises. In so far as the clause would interfere with rights in the case of officers who are now occupying quarters free, we must remember that we have undertaken in the Constitution to conserve all existing rights, and we must see that that is done, if we are to keep faith with the public servants. away by this Bill if we wanted to.

I am quite as prepared to vote for this amendment.as to prevent Ministers of State, as well as the commissioner and chief officers from appointing their relatives. But I do not believe in putting a barrier in the way of the appointment of any person, from the mere fact of his being connected by blood or marriage with any officer. If the officer is not to be trusted he should not be there. We might as reasonably go further and provide that no relative by blood or marriage of any civil servant should be appointed,.

If nepotism were limited to relatives of Members of Parliament, or of Ministers, there would be very little to complain about.

A division was taken on the amendment moved by that honourable and learned member, and it was negatived. However, members expressed their sympathy with the object sought to be attained, but disagreed with the wording of the proposed amendment, as they deemed it too inquisitorial inits nature. I have drafted a newsub-clause to deal with the subject, which could follow* after clause 1. before the honourable member moves his amendment, I may be permitted to-makea remark as to sub-clause (1). The object of' this sub-clause, I think, we are all in favourof, but' cases may arise under it which would require consideration. Of' course we associate with indictment and conviction some criminal act, but my right honourable and learned friend knows that it is possible that a man may be convicted for a thing which is not in the nature of a criminal offence. It is a difficulty which might arise, most rarely perhaps, but the matter is one which, I think, ought to be considered. There may be other cases of this class, and I confessi t is difficult to sug-^ gesta proper amendment. I shall not propose an amendment, but I simply ask-that-the Government will consider the' matter; and, if it can be so dealt with, will endeavour to draw a line between acts which are in tlieir nature criminal acts and acts which are not of that nature.

My right honourable and learned friend knows that under' the law of New South Wales, for instance, and in some of the other States, a man may be convicted of' manslaughter, while the offence will be really so trivial that the Judge w ill decline to pass sentence. In a case of that kind it would1 be absurd to talk of taking away a man's livelihood; In some of these cases the offence maj' really be an accident. Interpretation A ct was under consideration it was pointed out' that the word ""indictment"" included ""information,"" and that may go further even than the right honourable gentleman has suggested: That the following be inserted* as a new subclause to follow sub-clause 1 :-(2 ) If any officer shall be sued in any court for debt he shall report the same' to the permanent, head of the department; witha statement of tbe facts and the-result of the suit.

I submit that the amendment of the lionorable member for Echuca is out of order.

Here is ah amendment providing, for exactly'the same class of offence. I call attention to Standing Order No. 223, which states that a motion contradictory of a previous decision of the committee shall not be entertained in the same committee.'

I do put to my honourable friend the desirability of dealing with this matter on the recommittal of clause 40. I think he will then be able to secure recognition of the principle which he wishes to adopt without any inconsistency between the various parts of the Bill. Sir AVILLIAMLYNE member for Echuca will agree to that suggestion I think it will prevent debate at the present time. member must be very stubborn. I think there should be a clause something like this inserted, because we all know from practical experience that although the majority of public officers will not do anything that will be reprehensible, there will becases with which the commissioner and the permanent head should be able to deal. Perhaps this provision is a little too drastic, and if it is proceeded with now I propose to suggest the omission of certain words near the end, and simply to give power to reprimand, fine, or recommend to the Governor General for dismissal. think tlie words at the end are too indefinite. latter words. Sir WILLIAM LYNE time. I feel very strongly that there should be a governing power of some kind to check the condition of tilings that has existed to some extent. I was opposed the other night to making it compulsory to dismiss a civil servant when he got into difficulties because it would be too harsh, but I think there should be some power given to try and check as far as possible any duplicity or undue extravagance, as may exist in many cases. that this sub-clause comes quite as conveniently under clause 56 as it would under clause 40 which deals with dismissals and removals. deals with the question of debt, but it provides what shall be done in the case of a man who becomes insolvent either voluntarily or otherwise. By bringing the proposed sub-clause in before sub-clause (2) we shall deal with the matter at a stage before a man becomes insolvent, and if inserted, the provision might be the means of preventing him from becoming insolvent. observe that sub-clause (2) permits the man to go before a court of law and have the whole thing investigated t more worthy thing than set before our public servants, and, through the latter, before the people of the colony, the necessity If the honourable of paying their debts-that credit is considered undesirable, and debt a disgrace, if incurred through extravagance, recklessness, or dishonesty. In the Bill we are I will not agree to it . making provision that every man who enters the Government service shall have a living wage, which is supposed to be what a man can live comfortably on, according to his position in life. W it h a living wage there is no excuse, under ordinary circumstances, for a man getting into debt. Of course there may, in the case of every man, be exceptional circumstances, such as those of sickness, by which a man maj' be compelled to incur debt against his w ill ; but if the facts of such cases are made known to the permanent head, he will immediately do justice, and no action whatever will be taken against tlie officer.

In regard to the penalty, I propose to omit in the last line of the proposed new sub-clause the words "" in his opinion is deserved,"" and to insert in lieu thereof ""such punishment as may be prescribed."" able member for Echuca allow me to make Sub-clause (2) of clause 56 a suggestion that the following words be inserted after the word "" suit,"" line 4 :The permanent head may direct an inquiry before a board of inquiry as to whether the officer incurred such debt through recklessness, extravagance, or dishonesty,-and thereupon like proceedings shall be taken as in the case of inquiry into a charge of misconduct, as provided in section 40.",24,Public Service Bil L

As some of the offences under the clause would be of a veiy trivial character, I would suggest that there is no reason why we should use a steam hammer to crack a nut, which, after all, is what the honourable member's amendment proposes to do. I would suggest, as a way of getting over the difficulty, that the latter part of thesuch circumstances it may not be a reflection new sub-clause should run in this wayIf it should appear to the permanent head that such officer incurred such debt through being reckless, extravagant, or dishonest, the permanent of "" improper conduct"" that 'the authorities head shall report to the commissioner, who shall, with the approval of the Governor in Council, either direct an inquiry under section 40, or deal summarily with such officer, as he shall think fit. It gives tlie option with the approval of tbe Governor General in Council of either dealirfg summarily with the matter, or of directing that an inquiry shall be held as is provided for in clause 40. power is there, but we have to direct attention to it . I want to provide, instead of having to employ a board of inquiry in all cases, a simpler method for dealing with trivial cases. I wish to give the commissioner the option of saying whether he will deal summarily with a case, or whether he will direct that it should be inquired into as is provided for in clause 40. and where he deals summarily with a public, servant, it may merely mean disrating or the imposition of a fine. There is no need in such trivial cases to call a board of inquiry into existence, probably with a solicitor on either side, and to incur a great deal of expense. ment tlie permanent head is given tlie discretion to determine whether or not there should be a board of inquiry. that we a l l appreciate the object which the honourable and learned ' member for Parkes has in view. It is a veiy good one. But I would point out that the more we create special procedure for matters of this sort, the more likely are we to cast upon the authorities under this Act a number of duties and inquiries which may go very far away from the real object of a Public Service Act. It strikes me that clause 40 includes as an offence ""disgraceful or improper conduct."" No one wishes to enter into the private concerns of public servants, who are entitled to tlie ordinary privileges enjoyed by other British subjects, exceptin very gross cases. Many men, -through misfortune or through the extravagance of those for whom they are responsible, may find themselves in the very painful position of being unable to pay their debts. In upon their morality or honesty. It is not until such matters rise to the importance of an offence within the meaning of the public service should have anything to do with them. If a man in the management of his private affairs is guilty of what may be called ""improper conduct,"" then I quite admit that he may have to be brought before the authorities u nder the Act. But the machinery is already created under which he can be so brought. May I also suggest that punishment is not the best way of paying debts. We may I know that the punish a man, and yet leave his creditors in a worse position than they previously were. The real object of making use of such powers as are proposed to be given under this Bill is that the head of the department, having had an offence brought under his notice by a creditor, or creditors, of a, public servant, should use his influence with that public servant to induce him to avoid the penalties that are likely to follow We have to trust the commissioner, from his being found guilty of improper conduct. The object really is to inducehim to make some arrangement with hiscreditors. I submit to my honourable friend who is in charge of the Bil l that he has already provided, under clause 40, for "" disgraceful or improper conduct."" I think that the honourable gentleman has fully provided for the only sort of case which we ought to provide for, namely, a gross case, and one which reflects on the moral character or honesty of a public officer. All the necessaiy machinery for dealing with such an offence has been provided. But I think that jurisdiction would rarely have to be exercised, because the object of the department would be to secure a peaceful and satisfactory settlement. I quite appreciate the object of the honourable and learned member for Parkes; but I think that it is already covered by the wording of the Bill. I think we may. be doing more harm than good if we go too far in the direction that has been suggested. the objection which I raised previously.",26,Public Service Bil L

On the other hand, the honourable and learned member for Parkes might well introduce this provision in clause 40, which, as has been pointed out, provides all the machinery necessaiy for dealing with such cases. Sub-clause (2) of clause 40 provides that "" any officer charged with the commission of an offence may in the case of minor offences against discipline be reprimanded or cautioned by the chief officer or by any officer prescribed as having power to suspend officers."" Further on it is provided that in graver offences the chief officer, if he chooses, maj' direct an inquiry to be made. That is the right place for the honourable member to introduce the provision which he now proposes. matter came up under clause 40-althoug h it was pointed out that the amendment which was then, proposed related, not to dismissals, but only to such powers of reprimanding or of fining an officer as it was thought would meet the offence committed tlie committee decided that neglect on the part of a public officer to pay his debts--whic h is a weaker form of offence than that suggested to-day should not be included as an offence. Now, honourable'members are told that we should have inserted this provision in clause 40. There has been such a body of opinion outside in regard to the proposal which the committee rejected the other day, that now a stiffer form of offence is proposed. I think that this provision should have been inserted in clause 40. I shall take every opportunity if it cannot be introduced here-to secure its insertion in that clause upon its recommittal. We are dealing with a class of officers who are specialty protected by law. They have their wages specially protected because the King cannot be garnisheed and we should certainly*see that thej' paj their debts like other people. Sir WILLIAM LYNE the discussion that has taken place the honourable member will allow the matter to stand over. I shall be quite prepared to reconsider and recommit clause 40 with a view to inserting words that will harmonize better with that clause than the one now being considered. I am not quite sure that clause 40 would not almost meet the case now, but a veiy few words by way of amendment' would certainly serve the honourable member's purpose. generally considered that injobject would be better met by amending clause 40, I am quite agreeable to fall in with the suggestion of the Minister. Amendment, bj' leave, withdrawn. notice that sub-clause (2) provides that if, in the event of the estate of the deceased officer being sequestrated, it appears to the Court of Insolvencj' that the applicant has been guilty of fraud, dishonourable conduct, or extravagance, the court shall direct the clerk of the court to report the fact to the Minister or the permanent head or chief officer of the department in which the officer is employed. I should like to know whether we are in a position to pass an Act which will compel an officer of a State court to make a report. come within the control of the Commonwealth under section 51 of the Constitution. in tlie Bill is a little peremptory. I have no doubt as to our power in the matter, but at the same time it might be better if another expression were used. There is no doubt that the intention of this clause is one that will be readily fallen in with by the court. It gives them an additional opportunity i o see that, justice is meted out. The language is taken from a local Act, but I will reconsider the point raised by the honourable member. Minister should consider the desirability of using the word "" bankruptcy"" instead of "" insolvencj',"" as the latter is the term used in some of the States. Clause agreed to.

Clause 59(1) Unless otherwise directed by the Minister, the chief officer may at such times as may be convenient grant to every officer of his department leave of absence for recreation for any period or periods not exceeding in the whole eighteen days in each year, exclusive of Sundays and holidays, and the Minister in cases of illness or other pressstruck me veiy much in the same way as it ing necessity may grant such extended leave not exceeding twelve months on such terms as may be prescribed. (2) When the absence qf an officer is not occasioned by his employment by the Government on other duties or by leave of absence there shall be deducted from his salary his pay for each day of such absence. (3) The period of leave of absence for recreation which may be granted to officers of Parliament or to classes of officers stationed in places remote from large centres of settlement or whose duties cannot ordinarily be performed within usual regular hours shall not necessarily be limited to eighteen days, but shall be limited as may be prescribed. clause and the three following clauses deal with the question of leave of absence and holidays, and it will be seen that there are no less than five different ways in which leave may be granted. The annual leave may be granted by the chief officer; sick leave is to be granted by the chief officer, the permanent head and the Minister, and extended sick leave is to be granted by the Governor General. Leave without pay requires the sanction of the permanent head and the Governor, and furlough requires the permission of the commissioner ancl the Governor General. appear to be rather cumbrous, and I would suggest that the whole of the clauses should be taken into consideration or postponed with a view to some simpler method being devised for dealing with the whole matter. Let us take a case in point. An officer might obtain three weeks' leave of absence, which might be granted by the chief officer as a matter of course. A t the end of the three weeks he might find that he could not get back in time, ancl might want one day's extra leave. This would require the consent of the permanent head and the Governor General. In the meantime something might happen, such as a sudden illness or a broken leg, and the granting of an additional day's leave would require the consent of the chief officer, the permanent head, and the Minister. I do not see how these cumbrous methods are to be obviated, but I hope the Ministry will take the whole matter into consideration with a view to making some improvement. Either the chief officer or the permanent head, particularly the latter, might be out of the State, and inaccessible for tbe purpose of giving the consent required under this clause. has the honourable member, and I have discussed the matter with the draftsman. The honourable member will, however, take notice that each of these clauses is different, ancl that the importance of the provisions varies. After thinking tlie matter out and discussing it, we propose, to adhere to the methods set forth in the Bill, and I do not think any great trouble will arise. I propose to strike out the words ""permanent head,"" and substitute ""commissioner,"" because since the Bil l was drafted it has been determined to substitute the commissioner for the permanent head in a great many cases. honourable gentleman get over a difficulty such as I have suggested; could we not give the chief officer the right to grant additional leave ? Sir WILLIAM LYNE I think that in a simple thing like this it might be arranged between the commissioner and the chief officer, and that no difficulty need be anticipated. against it . These five methods sioner, if he desired it, could give the chief officer tlie necessaiy authority, and I do not think there would be any trouble. My object",28,Public Service Bil L

I move That after the word ""Minister,"" line 1, the words "" of his department"" be inserted. It is onlya consequential amendment. Amendment agreed to. That the words ""at such times as may be convenient,"" line 2, be omitted. It is obvious that the leave would not be granted at times when it was inconvenient ; but these words seem to cast a serious doubt as to whether the public servant would really be entitled to his holidays or not. instead of "" may."" those words'!

Amendment agreed to. toThat the word ""the,"" line 7, be omitted with a view to insert iu lieu thereof the word ""snob."" that without an Executive minute the Minister may grant twelve months' leave of absence ? If so, that is a new provision in Australia, I believe. The almost universal custom when leave is granted for so long a period is that it goes through the Executive Council. The clause says ""the Minister in cases of illness or other pressing necessity may grant such extended leave, not exceeding twelve months."" That is quite out of harmony with the general scope of such Bills, which places such leave within the power of the GovernorGenerali n Council. It will be more i u harmony with the other clauses to make such a provision here. I do not, however, want to raise any difficulty by compelling the Minister to put an application for a small leave of absence before the Governor General in Council. We might make the clause read "" not exceeding three months,"" instead of twelve months. That would leave the Minister an elastic power in regard to three months ; and so far as further leave was concerned the matter should go before the Executive Council. further leave after twelve months? matter might go before the Governor General in Council. I move That the word ""twelve,"" line 9, be omitted, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the word "" three.

As a result of the recent festivities, a large number of men who worked many hours overtime are being impelled to take days off-no t days that would suit them, but days that suit their departments-as an equivalent for very hard ancl good work performed overtime. I think this power very much abused. I would ask the Minister what he means by this particular clause, and how he proposes it should be applied. I quite understand that in cases where officers are stationed in remote places it might be useful; but I do not think it should be applied in the regular way as an equivalent for tlie payment of overtime. are two unnecessary words in this sub-clause. I move That the words ""classes of,"" line 18, be omitted.

We should leave it in the power of the Government at any rate to leave bis service unbroken in S''ch a case; but the clause, as it stands, leaves the Government ng discretion, and he might have to lose a year's service.

Sir WILLIAM LYNE difficult thing to refuse them. I think the case referred tomight be nietin the way I have suggested. If an officer goes away and we wish him to do anything while he is on leave we can give him a gratuity for doing the special work. I do not feel strongly on the subject, but I think the difficulty could be met in the way I suggest. Minister. I think exceptional cases might be dealt with very well by means of a gratuity. The injustice of making a general rule that time of absence shall count in the service, is evident when we recollect that other officers are standing by their governmental work and doing their duty. It sometimes happens thab a man gebs leave that he may have an opportunity of bettering his position outside, and if his place is being kept warm until he gets back, he surely cannot object to have other officers who have been serving all tlie time while he has been on leave progressing while he is standing still in the matter of service.

I think he is lobbing the civil servants of New Year's I^ywealth Day.

MrM c CAY holidays last over four days, for Sunday is always a holiday so far as abstinence from ordinary labour is concerned. It is tlie only holiday of any length which is granted. MrM c CAY sub-clause the Governor General may proclaim other holidays. I wish to ask tbe Attorney-General whether, as a matter of drafting, the first two words ""where by "" in sub-clause (3) should not be "" where under."" under "" always. MrM c CAY I suggest that it should be altered. It says that every officer may be granted on another occasion a holiday instead of the public holiday on which he was compelled to work. The words "" may be granted if practicable"" in sub-clause (5) may be interpreted in all sorts of ways by' the permanent head. It practically means that, unless it suits the department, a man will not get a holiday, and veiy often it will not suit the department that he shall. Surely the Commonwealth can arrange that an officer shall get these holidays in lieu of public holidays where the state of business compels him to work on those holidays. extra pay for extra service. If we make a man work on public holidays he ought to be paid extra. note of the very point to which the last vision in sub-clause (5) is very dangerous, and what he has pointed out is perfectly true. Weeks of leave are due to officers in this State which they will never be able to get. They have been compelled to work on special holidays and even on regular holidays, and they are not allowed extra pay, although it is in the nature of extra service, nor have they been granted substituted holidays. What an officer ought to get is extra pay for this service. It is like Sunday work. What ought to be done is to make the latter part of sub-clause (5) read in this wayEvery such officer shall be granted extra paj' for such extra service, or shall be granted a holiday on such other occasions as do not interfere with public business. I am not wedded to the second proposition, but I am particularly desirous of seeing the first carried. The only satisfactory way In this State the Easter to deal with officers is to pay extra money when extra service is required. If that be not done, it may be the means of getting a great deal of work out of the officers without pay, and what has happened in the State of Victoria may happen in the ComI know that under that monwealth, viz., that weeks of leave may be owing to civil servants who cannot get it . I clo not move an amendment, because some other better suggestion may be made. presume this clause would apply to post office officials, who form one of the largest departments taken over by the Commonwealth. In Victoria certain holidays are proclaimed, and sometimes the Minister or head of the department may require a number of the staff to remain at work. The practice in Victoria has been to despatch mails pn some of these holidays, and the people of Melbourne not only get delivery ,of their letters, but also of tlie daily newspapers. The mail, however, is sent up country, where it arrives after 10 o'clock. A certain number of the staff are required at the post-office up t ill 10 o'clock in the morning, and a certain number have also to attend on the arrivals of the mails at the post-office. The mails sorted at the local office are despatched to the different outlying districts.

The people in the larger towns have their mails sorted at tlie centres, and as soon as the bags are despatched the post-offices are locked up again, and tlie people get neither tlieir letters nor their daily papers, if the latter come through the post. The holiday to the employees of the post-office is of no use, seeing that a great munber of them have to be at the office up to 10 o'clock in the morning, and others have to attend after 6 p.m. in the evening. It is only a kind of hybrid holiday they get. They cannot leave town, and they would be much better situated if they had a certain amount of holiday added to their annual leave. I am sure the people in country districts would appreciate anything which enabled them to get their letters every day if they attended at the post-office. In the case of Good Friday, there are practically four days running when people in the country districts do not get their newspapers until they ai'e a day old, or do not get their letters unless they are called for before 10 o'clock in the morning.

People who reside in remote parts of that State, may travel 20 or 30 miles to a post-office only to find that they have to wait three or four days before it is possible to obtain a letter or get a telegram through. I admit that we ought to give public servants every possible latitude, but still the public deserve some little consideration, especially in remote parts of the States, where it may be a matter of life and death, or it may mean the loss of thousands of pounds to a man, to get a telegram through. We should provide that within certain hours on public holidays the post and telegraph offices ought to be open. It would be no hardship to keep one officer on duty, because lie could be provided with a holiday at some other time, or be paid double rate for his attendance on those days. I suggest that no more than a certain number of days in any oneyearshouldbe proclaimed public holidays. It is possible, to have too much of a good thing. In the interests of the public the Minister ought to add to the sub-clause some restriction to the number of holidays to be observed in any one year. tlie sub-clause, I take it, is to deal with special cases. I presume that in the other States the same system obtains as prevails in New South Wales. I recognise that applications come in veiy frequently for holidays, but not for holidays throughout the whole of a State; and these holidays and halfholidays would not apply to the whole of a State. They would be given in special cases, such as the holding of a show, or of a race meeting, and would not apply to the whole of the Commonwealth. We must have an elastic provision of this kind, otherwise we could not proclaim holidays or half-holidays in the different localities where it is desirable that we should proclaim them. Honourable members, I think, must leave this power to the discretion of the Ministry for tlie time being. If too many holidays are granted, there will be an outcry, and Parliament has its remedy against the Government. As regards tlie question of keeping open the telegraph-office, I think there is a great deal in the remarks of the honourable member for Coolgardie, but sub-clause (5) provides that "" tbe Minister of a department, or the permanent head or chief officer thereof, may require such department or any part thereof to be kept open in the public interest for the whole or any portion of . a holiday."" That provision will meet the honourable member's objection. In all cases I think that the telegraph-office should be open for a certain number of hours each morning or evening, for the despatch of telegrams. That is a matter, however, that is entirely within the discretion of the Minister. W it h regard to the post-office, the Postmaster General would have power to order that it should be kept open. When the department is so kept open, the officer who attends there for an hour in the morning, and an hour in the evening will be paid for that time under the provision that is suggested. I think honourable members can allow this clause to remain in its present form. Subclause (4) is taken from tlie Victorian Act, and sub-clause (5) from the Queensland Act.

But apparently it is the intention of the Government to make probeen motions first, and to notify such promotions afterwards.

"" to my objection, because at present no express permission is required from the State Ministers in some of the States, at any rate, and the arrangement works veiy well. In South Australia we go so far as to allow public servants to be members of district councils. The system works very well in the public interest. Both as members of their local governing bodies and also in the discharge of their duties as public servants the officers are able to do good work. only question is whether acceptance of outside duties interferes with the discharge of the ordinary duties for which public servants are paid. If so, the outside duties should not be accepted, but if not, there seems to be no reason why they should not be. [H8] the Minister's attention to another point. The desire of the Government is probably to study frugality and save the money of the public service. In paragraph (6) it is provided that a public servant shall not hold any office in connection with mining or any such business, and paragraph (c) says that the public servant shall not engage in any such business whether as principal or agent; but subclause (2) authorizes public servants to engage in business in connection with "" an}' incorporated company."" There is a favourite method of losing money in mining communities, namely, by taking an interest in an unregistered mining venture. It seems to me that under this clause public servants would be forbidden to lose money in that way. I .do not see any merit in losing money in a registered mining company any more than in an unregistered, one. It ' is a common thing to put money into the development of a piece of land believed to contain mineralsto keep the prospector going for a little while. It is a'very laudable object, though the keeping of the prospector going may not be the real desire of the citizen who puts in his money. Under this clause a jrablic servant will be prevented from taking his shore in a little unregistered company. Often such a concern is dignified by the name of syndicate, and the members of it pay in their own money. That is engaging in mining business, and public servants spend their money in this way, just as cheerfully as do private individuals. 1 raises a number of rather important questions. In private businesses, which, perhaps, are managed as strictly perhaps as the Government. service, no sort of obstacle is thrown in the way of employee's putting their leisure time to some useful purpose. I have no sympathy with paid employees taking paid positions in connection with outside bodies; some room should be left for other people in connection with outside work. But I see no sort of objection to a The public servant being encouraged to make use of his private time by connecting himself with useful bodies. I do not wish to speak with any authority on the point, because I know there are arguments on the other side.

The preliminary examination will be the best of methods, but I certainly fail to see any necessity for any limitation at all. Let the candidates come along, as many as. choose to turn up, ancl only those who pass-, I accept the honourable in the order of merit, and it does not matter in the least whether there are 20, 50, or 100. I. think it will be better to throw it quite open, so that there shall be no possibility of any influence being brought to bear at the very inception of a boy's career. The lot system is utterly absurd, ancl that is being struck out; but no matter what method we adopt, there will be a suspicion, of favouritism about it , and as this Bill is>specially intended to prevent anything like favouritism, we should throw open entrance to tbe service to any boys who think they can pass the examination.

We ought not to limit the opportunities of the youth of Australia, especially when they are subject to a fee to cover any trouble or expense which may be incurred. out some method which seems to commend itself to our judgment, do not let us legis^ late in the dark in this way.

How pan we carry -out that policy if , first of all, we limit the number ; and, secondly, accept this proposal of the Government which is not so good as the other one. The proposal of the Bill' was a definite one; we knew what the Government meant. But now we are asked to pass .something when the Government themselves do not know what it means, and they will tell honourable members so if they are asked. We are not legislating when we get into this position. reason for this limitation, they ought to let us know what it is for.

It will, I admit, be a serious difficulty to grapple with at first, but it will diminish as time goes on, because those who have paid, and whose names and records are on the official books, need not be allowed to ofnotice. compete again. That will be a much fairer thing than shutting out any man. We might, under that system, shut out a SirI think we cannot William Lyne, or a Mr Deakin, and allow in a man like myself-and that would never No do. I strongly agree with the honourable member for Soutii Australia, who, I believe, intends to test tlie feeling of the committee. Unfortunately, I have not had an oppor-' tunity of reading the discussion on this question, and I shall content myself with saying that it does not seem to me that we can accept this alteration, or, indeed the original proposal. A t any rate, the Government should tell us what proposal they have in view when they propose to amend the Bill. I think it is a practical suggestion Unless the Minister can point which tbe Minister might adopt. valid reason which can be given for limiting the number will be the existence of a roll of applicants who have passed the examination. That system of keeping a roll from year to year is a bad one. I am a believer in frequent examinations being held for all vacancies occurring in the State's service, in order that we may get what this Bill tells us we shall geta proper recognition of merit. We cannot get a recognition of merit if we have tlie old system of automatic preferment, because that is virtually what it will mean. Suppose we have 50 vacancies, and we allow 150 to compete at the examination ; and we register them in order of merit, reserving to ourselves the right to fill up any vacancies with tlie fifty-first and fiftysecond, and so on as they stand on the register, and so on; then we shall be debarring probably a large number of persons'outside-thos e who were not competent If the Government have a by reason of age and other disabilities to compete with the others at the original examination-fro m having an opportunity enough.

Provided that nothing herein shall be taken to permit of the employment of any married woman except upon the certificate of the commissioner in each case that such employment is desirable."" I do not know whether sub-clause (a), as it is at present -worded, technically applies to women. Since the question of the employment of females was debated in this House, we have resolved to go further than the Bill intended in the first instance. I think it would be safer to retain sub-clause (c). I admit that there is grave doubt as to its necessity, but I would not like it to be struck out and afterwards to discover that it would have been wise to retain it . attention to the fact that sub-clause («) gives power to the Ministry, not for the employment of women in departments, but "" for facilitating the employment of women in departments where it is desirable to employ them."" Does that provision imply that they are to be given preference over men in various departments ? the sub-clause. can see. If we strike out the word ""facilitating,"" it seems to the that there is no obvious reason .for retaining this subclause. It is a very grave matter of policy if it is intended that the Ministry of the day shall give preference to the employment of women. ""When the word ""facilitating"" is read in conjunction with the subsequent words "" to prescribe rates of salaries or wages,"" and when we remember that we already have power under sub-clause («) for determining those salaries generally, it looks as if the intention is to employ women wherever the Government have an opportunity for so doing, and to give them lower salaries or wages. That is a policy which the committee have determined shall not be adopted. I ask the Minister for Home .Affairs to consider whether he will allow that sub-clause to remain in the Bill at all. We have given power to the authorities to employ men or women as necessity may dictate, and why should we put a special provision in the Bill directed to "" faclitating "" the employment of women 1 I recognise that the Minister would not like sub-clause (c) to be struck out, and afterwards to find that he had some reason which did not occur to him at the moment for reinserting it. But I ask him to consider whether it is really necessary in the interests of the general community to retain a sub-clause which.points to a preference being given to the employment of women at lower rates of pay ? rather agree with the remarks of the honourable and learned member for Indi. I do not see the necessity for 'the retention of sub-clause (c). The question of the rates of payment can be decided when we reach the last schedule. rates. hear it acknowledged t h a t , £ 1 1 0 is to be the minimum salary paid to public servants who have reached the age of 21 years. There is a lot more to be said, however, upon the question as to whether there ought to be any difference made between the position of males and females. What reason is there to provide that the maximum class to which a female can rise should be the fourth class ? If the amendment, which I anticipate I shall be able to carry, is agreed to, there will be no necessity for the particular reference in the last part of this sub-clause to the clerical division. agreed toThat in paragraph (c) the words '' facilitating the employment of women in deportments or offices, wherein it may be desirable to employ them, and to prescribe "" be omitted, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words "" prescribing the."" That in paragraph (u), after the word ""division,"" the following words be inserted, ' and the terms 1 upon which the services of female officers may be dispensed with upon their marriage.

In connection with the publication of the regulations in the Government Gazette, it should be provided that they should have effect from the date of first publication, unless otherwise prescribed. I do not know, however, that we should say that they should have ' ' f u l l force and effect,"" because that might be construed to have a wider meaning than we intend. ThenI suppose'that the Minister will modify the provision in the clause that such regulations shall be laid before Parliament "" as soon as may be"" so as to bring the provision in this clause into accord with what we have done in other parts of the Bill. Further, it may be well to see that the production, of a copy of the Gazette containing a copy of the regulations shall be sufficient evidence of the regulations having been made by the Governor General. Tlie clause is so drawn that, once a regulation is published, it will have the same effect as if it were a port of the Act itself. I move That the words ""made by the Governor General and "" be omitted. Sir WILLIAM LYNE honourable member for Tasmania will not persist in his amendment. The words can do no harm. I know of no other power which can make the regulations, but in case there be any other power, it would be unwise to expunge the words from the clause when we might afterwards have to reinsert them. Amendment withdrawn. tion of this clause is certainly beyond what we ought to pass. It provides that when the regulations are made by the Governor General in Council and published in the Government Gazette, they shall have "" f u l l force and effect.""

""regulations purporting to be made pursuant to this Act."" That prevision will cure any want of legality in the regulations, although I do not think that is what is intended. words ""purporting to be"" should not be retained in the clause. The Attorney General will recollect that previous provisions have been altered so as to make it certain that the Governor-Generali n Council shall not have legislative powers outside the carrying of the measure into effect. I do not know whether the Attorney General intended to alter the very emphatic words at the end of the clause. I hope the The last paragraph should read-""regula tions made pursuant to this Act."" We do not want to create a second legislative body in connection with the regulations. As the clause stands it does create such a body. We may assume that any civil servant who complained of any regulation being ultra vvres of the Act would not go to the Privy Council, and it is not to be supposed that the Governor General would do so. We do not want a debate in Parliament as to any regulations being ultra vires.

I have had an opportunity of looking at the Bill as altered, and I say that with the original type, the italics, the ruled hues and the black letters, it will take us some time to know where we are. The Bill resembles nothing so much as a zebra. Look at this page, with all its alterations-that is the sort of thing.it has come to! After the Minister has allowed the BiU to be manipulated on every page in so remarkable a manner that it is twice its original bulk, it is too bad that the honourable and learned member for Parkes should rise and address the Minister for Home Affairs in the way he has. I sympathize with the Minister, and I think tlie amendment a mistaken one. Sir thought the right honourable and learned member was coming to that. Ministry has at last discovered its backbone, and, under these circumstances, 1 hope the honourable ancl learned member for Parkes will not subject them to any further pain. Their backbone has been stretched at the instance of the Government supporters to such an extent that we should not give the last turn to the screw. I have no doubt it is a wonderful B ill by this time. Speaking seriously, I think the Minister is right on this occasion, because in the railway service of New South Wales no man is taken to be a casual hand who is on the fixed establishment. We . do not wish to open tin's door to all the nondescripts and hangers-on of the public service of Australia. Under the circumstances, although I entirely differ from the Minister as to the suspiciousness of the situation, I still think the honourable gentleman is right, and even at the eleventh hour I will stand by him on the last line.. . "" Sir WILLIAM LYNE obliged to the right honourable and learned [119] member for East Sydney for the nice little speech he has made. He talks about the Bill having been manipulated. If he had looked carefully through it, or if he had been here while it was being dealt with, he would have seen that it has been very little manipulated. I have attempted during the passage of the B ill to meet any reasonable suggestion by any member, of the committee. alteration in the whole Bill has been to compel the permanent head to report to the commissioner; and the commissioner to report! to the Minister. The right honourable and learned member for East Sydney has been blinking asleep all the last fortnight, and does not know what has been done. Does the-Minister for Home Affairs call that a consequential amendment 1 Sir WILLIAM LYNE It is the light honourable and learned member who should look at the Bill.

I do not object to the proposal as applied to permanent hands, though paid weekly or monthly. The Railways Commissioners know perfectly well who are to be considered, upon the general service, though they may be paid weekly. Such men have a right to be considered, and so far I accepted the amendment. But I am not going to accept an amendment which will allow every I am very glad of that, and one to come in who may be casually employed by tbe Railways Commissioners for a week, a fortnight, or a month. I do not think that the latter is the intention of the committee, and I shall certainly fight against the proposal.

I pointed out at that time that the Minister, in introducing the Bill to the House, had taken occasion to draw attention to the Public Service Act of New South Wales, and had told the House how badly that Act had worked, but that he had neglected to point out how successful was the Act under which the commissioners managed the railway service of that State. I then said I desired to see the Bill put into such a shape that the whole Commonwealth Public Service would come under a commissioner instead of being left in the hands and at the mercy of the Ministry, who might at some future day wish to use it for their own purposes. My amendment would not have been suggested, but for the fact that tlie committee had really affirmed the principle of giving power to the people who had tlie opportunity of choosing the officers who should occupy these positions, that not only men in salaried honourable member for South Australia, Mr offices, but those receiving wages should be eligible for them. I want honourable members to notice that this clause does not provide. that these men shall have these positions, but simply that they shall be eligible for them, and that those who have the salaried division choice of officers for any particular position in a higher walk of the service shall be able to make a selection from them. ' The Minister for Home Affairs seems to be very warm about a very little, because my proposal is merely that all men in the railway service who are in receipt of wages, whether they be temporary or permanent hands, shall be eligible for a position in the Commonwealth service without examination. If a man upon weekly wages is eligible, there surely cannot be any objection to a temporary hand I am bound to being eligible. All that my proposal does is to give a wider choice. I do not wish to press the amendment, and if the commitdivide upon it, but shall be contented to have it decided upon tlie voices. The effect of my amendment is to widen the choice but not to widen the claims of the men who are to be chosen. Mi-. M c C AY (Corinella) -The honourable A commissioner ancl learned member for Parkes apparently forgets that in the railway service there are men working side by side, some of whom are on the permanent staff with accruing rights, I can only say I whilst others are only employed temporarily or casually. The object of this clause, as I understand it , is to declare that persons in State employment who are permanent hands, and who might, but for this provision, have been prevented from coming into the Commonwealth employment shall be eligible for such employment. But why the casual hands of the raihvay service should be given a preference over other casual hands I cannot understand. It is to the Commonwealth's advantage veiy often to take over from a State men who are familar with the duties which the Commonwealth want to have performed. draw attention to the fact that up to the present time the committee have not included in this clause the railway services of the States? All that my amendment did was to give persons in the general division of the State services the right to come into the Commonwealth service in the same way as the salaried officers may come in. We have not yet adopted the proposal of the Poynton, in regard to railway servants, and until that is done it is idle to talk about it. We have merely provided that persons in the general division of the State services shall have equal rights to those of the see how we are going to avoid including the railway servants.""

I presume that in the Post and Telegraph department we shall not be able to provide a separate Commonwealth officer to take charge of each of these stations. We shall necessarily have to employ railway officers to discharge the duties which they are dischargingat the present time. And inasmuch as they will have to discharge those duties, they will becomemembersof the Commonwealth Public Service. It would lead to no end of confusion with the various Railway departments if we insisted upon these men coming up in the ordinary way for examination. It would necessitate the shifting of a large number of men from place to place. There are both salaried men and wages men, who are considered permanent employees, not only in the Railway department, but in other departments of the State services. So far as I can see, the words which the honourable and learned member for Parkes wishes to have omitted from tlie clause are in proper order.

That clause provides that officers transferred from the service of a State to the sendee of the Commonwealth, shall preserve all their existing and accruing rights, ancl their service in the Commonwealth shall count as a continuation of any rights to a pension, which they may have had in the service of a State. Clause 29 refers only to salaried officers, but if the railway men are to be eligible for transfer they ought to be treated at least as liberally as the salaried officers. Any rights which they may have to a pension or an allowance in the railway service will I suppose be continued to them. They will, I presume, have a similar provision made in their favour to that which has been made in the case of the salaried officers under clause 51. other night. Mi-.

In most States where there are pensions, the officers have to pay a deduction from their salaries of so much per cent. A man who has been transferred from the New South Walesservice-sa y since the 1st of January last to the service of the Commonwealth-wh o has been paying 4 per cent, for fifteen years in order to get his pension in New South Wales, becomes entitled the very moment he is so transferred to receive all the advantages which he enjoyed in New South Wales, without the slightest provision being made to compel him to pay towards the benefits which he is to get. pay in the meantime. to meet that. it has been thought of.

I promised the honourable member for South Australia, MrV . L . Solomon, to obtain what information I could from the best sources as to what was likely to be tlie outcome of the proposed course of action. I have applied to the various insurance companies for information, but from the replies I have obtained up to the present time it would appear that the managers require to consult their various boards of directors before they can furnish what I .desire. I have, however, obtained from Mr Fenton, the Victorian Government Statist, who has also consulted"" the officers of his department upon the matter, certain information which I will communicate to the committee. That mformation, as far as it goes, shows that it would not be judicious at the present time to adopt the amendment of the honourable member for Bourke. It was stated the other night that in New Zealand a sj stem of State r insurance has been instituted, but I find .that New Zealand did not start her system of State insurance in the way it is proposed it should be started in the Commonwealth. A good many years ago New Zealand started a system of insurance which was general, ancl not for the public service. About eight years ago they extended it to the public service, but at the present time they only have 290 policies which have been taken out by members of the public service. 1",60,William Mcmillan Woul D That A Position In The Corresponding Division In Be

Sir WILLIAM LYNE I am putting it this way-that in order to receive a certain sum at death, or an annuity at the age of 60, the officer would require to pay £ 2 0 per annum for 35 years to enable the Government, without contributions from the Treasury, to pay him from the insurance fund £ 1 5 2 per annum.

It sets forth thatAt the end of .1899 there were 290 civil service whether he considered the companies solvent policies in force, insuring £42,655 (including bonuses), and providing deferred annuities amounting to £11,954. Twenty-six policies had been lapsed or surrendered, insuring £4,565 at death, with £1,074 deferred annuities; four policies, insuring £556, had become claims by death; and the holders of seven policies, insuring £2,513 {with £168 deferred annuities), had left the civil service, but elected to continue their policies with the insurance department. That is the information I have in reference to this particular point. ber any information as to how long this has been in operation 1 Sir years so far as civil servants is concerned. Many men will be taken over from the State services who are already provided for. We cannot expect them to go into this assurance. Only the boys will take advantage of it , and though perhaps it will not be so small in eight years' time as it is in New Zealand, because of the number of civil servants, it will be proportionately small. Mr O'MALLEY -Are you going to bring the insurance companies under supervision 1 Sir WILLIAM LYNE drafted in New South Wales, and asked my then colleague there, Mr Wise, to take charge of it dealing with this matter, as affecting New South Wales. First of all I think that the companies we allow our officers to be insured in should be inspected by a public actuary. I went even further than that, and proposed that every insurance, company in New South Wales-and I would be prepared to say now in the Australian colonies-shoul d be subject to inspection and . report by a Government actuary. I hope, if my colleagues agree, within a very short time to bring in a B ill with that view. The BillI drafted in New South Wales might be made to serve the purpose. Mr O'MALLEY -And value their securities ? Sir WILLIAM LYNE with everything connected with the societies.. It might not be possible to value the securities every year, because they would extend so far over the continent of Australia, but it would be possible to value all the principal securities, and to get a sufficient idea of their value to allow the actuary to report as to or not, within the first year from his appointment. I wish again to say that I have been discussing this matter with my colleagues to-day, and they are much inclined to bring in a measure to deal generally with assurance by the State. Several Honorable MEMBERS -When' ? Sir WILLIAM LYNE I have not really had time to deal fully with the question, and I should not like to give a promise which I should not be able to carry out in a very short time.

There are other men of equal if not greater qualifications prepared to submit a scheme which would, no doubt, come into line with what we want, and would assist in a 'very large way in a proposal for State life assurance, being brought down in the sense in which we outlined it the other night. The chief objections the Minister raises against the proposition are, first of all, the veiy limited number of civil servants affected by the proposal, from 800 to 1,500 he asserts.

The method of procedure, I -would be that they would have to give a guarantee to the Government of £5,000 in cash before they could start business at all, and they-would have no guarantee of any number of clients to begin with. would have to adopt just such business methods as they could in order to secure policy holders. ordinary company, therefore, and a Commonwealth is, that we should start with 1,500 persons, all young persons, who would be called in assurance phraseology ""good lives,"" for they would have to pass a medical examination, they would be acceptable to ordinary assurance offices.

That is what I am informed by a number whom I have consulted, and they have not been few in the last few days. they are not so particular about getting the same profits and returns as ordinary mutual companies outside could give them, as they are about the certainty of receiving what they contract to receive, under their terms of entry into the State service. So that these questions of earnings, averages, the small numbers at the beginning of a life assurance society-for amounts to-ought not really to affect the deliberations of the committee. desire, and that seems to be the desire, to institute a system of assurance for the servants of the Commonwealth, I think it is incumbent upon us to see that they are guaranteed what we say they ought to Mr Hume Cook. The answer to that is rather receive at the time their policies fall due. Apropos of this I desire to point out that the Government recognise that principle ; because in clause 49 of this Bill they understand, state that where a servant cannot get his life assured in -any good company the Government will undertake to make provision for the payment to him of some gratuity, or something of that kind, when the They time arrives for him to retire from the service.

547,Mr Hume Cook,"I thank the honortake place in connection with the Commonwealth assurance system. The funds should be invested very much along the lines prescribed by the New Zealand State Life Assurance department, where they are limited to municipal securities, State debentures, and investments of that kind. It will be found, if they are invested in stock of that kind, it will mean a shade more than 3 per cent., which is said to be the basis on which the ordinary societies now conduct their business. the major portion of them do, and I think it should be so in this case. I believe it will be found that, so far from the civil servants finding fault with the limited amount of bonuses they are likely to receive under this System, they will be delighted with the security of the proposal, and will not quarrel with the less bonuses paid to them. Then as to the question of annuities, we have beeninformed that in order to receive an annuity of £ 1 5 2 a man will require to pay for 35 years £ 2 0 a year. The sum of £152 a year is very much less than the ordinary bonus which is being paid under the State Acts. An y number of men wilL be very glad indeed to get £ 6 0, £ 7 0 , or £80 a year, and they will not require to pay anything like £ 2 0 a year to get that sum ; a very much less sum will suffice. The other point made by the honourable member for Tasmania, Sir Edward Braddon, by way of interjection, was that the. salaries of these men will go on increasing under the schedule provided in the ' B ill , ' and the amount of £ 2 0 a year to a man with a salary of £ 3 0 0 or £400 is practically nothing at all. It may be very much to a man who is receiving a salary of £ 1 1 0 or £ 1 2 0 ; but when a man is receiving a salary of £ 1 8 0 , £200, or £300, up to the larger amounts which are provided, a sum of £ 2 0 is practically of very little moment indeed. He will probably assure for an amount at death which will-cover a premium of that amount and not hurt him at all. However, in discussing the question at this stage I feel somewhat in a difficulty. We have not any actuarial calculations to go upon. We do not know for a certainty what it will take to give a man a given annuity at a certain age on the payment of a certain sum per year. We do not know either whether the Government has really made up its mind or not to institute a State Assurance department at a later stage, and in default of any express assurance on that point, I feel that I must allow the amendment to remain in the hands of honourable members, It is not altogether mine now; it has become the property of the committee, and others who are interested have as much right as I have to say whether it shall be withdrawn at this juncture or not. As briefly as possible in the time at my disposal I have endeavoured to answer, at veiy short notice and with very scant information, the objections raised by the Minister. Other honourable members have probably noticed other points, and before I consent to a withdrawal of the proposal I think it is only fair f?o all who are interested in the question that some expression of opinion shall be heard from them, that is in default of a specified assurance from tlie Government that it will at a later stage introduce a Life Assurance department for the Commonwealth. I m o v e That all the words after the word ""Act"" up to and inclusive of the word "" namely "" be omitted, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the followingwords :-""Every officer upon the confirmation of his appointment shall effect with the Government of the Commonwealth an assurance on his life providing for the following benefits."" Sir WILLIAM LYNE A question was suggested by the honourable member for Bland as to the amount which was deducted from the salaries of public servants i u New Zealand. I find that it has been reported upon, and I shall read the passage to the committeeThe New Zealand Civil Service Insurance Aet of 1893 provides that every officer under a certain age, to be fixed by regulation, appointed after the passing of the Act shall effect a policy on his or her life with the Life Insurance Commissioner, providing for the following combined benefits: First, the payment of a sum of money on the death of such officer should it occur before he attains the age of 00 years (or after that age, in consideration of his paying the necessary additional premium); second, the payment to such officer of an annuity until death should he survive the age of GO years. When an officer leaves the servico he has the option of either surrendering the policy or of retaining it in force. The premiums are paid in the form of monthly deductions from salaries, according to the following schedule :On a salary of £ 150, Ss. 4d. per month, or £5 per annum. From £150 to £200, 12s. Gd. per month, or £7 10s. per annum. From £200 to £250, 16s. 8d. per month, or £10 per annum. From £250 to £300, £1 0s. lOd. per month, or £12 10s. per annum.

Sir AVILLIAMLYNE nuities in addition. member for Bourke wishes me to state whether and when the Government will bring in a Bill to deal with general life assurance. The Cabinet is in favour of it being done, but it is quite impossible for me to say whether it can be done this session, or to fix. a date. We have so many measures to deal with that I would not be justified in saying that it .can be done this session, and there is no great hurry for it for a year or so. that it would be done next session, I think it would satisfy a good many honourable members. Sir AVILLIAMLYNE I would not make that promise at the present time. I can only assure the honourable member that personally I am in favour of it . I know that several of my colleaguesI believe a majority of the Cabinet-ar e of the same opinion, and I think there is very little doubt that, it will be done. Under these circumstances I think that the honourable member may well allow this matter to go as it is at the present time. -Some honourable member said the other evening that this measure was not one in which we should introduce provisions for a superannuation, fund. It seems to-me, however, that any civil service Bill whatever would be entirely imperfect without satisfactory provision for the superannuation of the public servants. It is our duty to see that the superannuation arrangement is arrived at in the most satisfactory way, and in tlie way likely to secure the greatest measure of advantage and security to the various servants of the Commonwealth. The principle that this forms a part of a public service enactment is found in tlie fact that we have two clauses in the Bill dealing with it-on e providing that tlie civil servant shall compulsorily assure their lives in in surance offices, and the other, as some honourable member has pointed out, providing that those lives which are not likely to be assured outside shall be assured by the Government. I say the Government should take the whole matter of superannuation into their own hands. Let the work be done by the Commonwealtli, ancl it woqld £ 4 2 , 6 5 5 . be well done if the Commonwealtli subsidized and built up a superannuation fund ° which would give security to public servants. coup itself. honourable and learned member says, it would eventually recoup itself, and the losses in the earlier years would be infinitesimal. As I suggested, by way of interjection, the payments would go on increasing at so much per cent, with tlie increases in the salaries of the civil servants. There would be very few losses in' the earlier years, and a fund would be accumulated which, subsidized by the Government, would amply meet occasions when expenditure -would be demanded. I feel so strongly on this matter that, although I am very much agaiust tlie extension of this I do not know. insurance system to outside business-to the Government becoming an insurance office for those outside its own service rather than lose the principle I would vote for a more extended system. B ut it is only because I feel that the Government ought to be the assurer of their own servants, that I would go that length. I hope, however, we will agree that it is sufficient to make the Commonwealth Government tlie assuring body, the body responsible for the building up of a superannuation fund which shall meet all the requirements of the future, and assure the comfortable retirement of its servants at tlie end of their working days. for Home Affairs would be acting wisely if he again postponed this clause in order to get the information for which he has applied from the various assurance companies.

557,Mr Mahon (Coolgardie),"TheMiniste rknow that Mr Fenton bases Ms calculations on 3 per cent., but the accumulated funds of the public service, if invested in Government securities, must necessarily, at the present market rate, earn about 3 i per cent. Sir WILLIAM McMILLAN present time, so far as my information goes, can buy Treasury Bills of the State from -which the lionorable member for Wentworth conies, which will yield nearly 3-J per cent.; and as the tendency of all the State Governments is to borrow more extensivelyin the local market, the probability is that the interest rate, instead of decreasing, will increase. I would point out to the Minister for Home Affairs that he has an opportunity of seeing how men who are experts in finance and who have similar bodies of men under their control aet in a matter of this kind. Take banking institutions r for instance, the National Bank of Australasia, which is an institution with a large number of employees all over Australia. Does that bank force its servants into private assurance companies ?Not at all. The bank management has established a provident fund for its employees. Colonial Sugar Refining Company. panies ; but the National Bank of Australasia happens to be the only one of which I have any personal knowledge. Bankers are men who understand finance and are acquainted with figures. The Commonwealth stands in almost precisely the same position as a bank of this character, because the number of new servants the Commonwealth will have for many years to come will not exceed the number employed by some of the great banking institutions of AustraUa. The Minister tells us that we cannot afford to enter on this scheme; but in clause 49 he recognises the principle of Commonwealth insurance, inasmuch, as he absolutely proposes to throw into tlie hands of private companies all the good and sound lives, while every public servant, whose state of health is not good enough to enable him to pass for private assurance, or who cannot pass without five years' loading, is to be taken under the cegis of the Commonwealth and provided with a pension. The Minister takes the derelicts of the service and rejects the sound lives. savings are taken. take all the public servants, with all their savings. If the Minister can make it profitable to pay these derelicts, as I maycall them, pensions out of the fund, surely W h i c h fund'? he can make it more profitable to arrange for pensions to men of sound health. The Minister admits the solidity of the argument which has been advanced, that if civil servants be compelled to' assure in a private company, they must be guaranteed the solvency of that company. That is unquestionably what will, happen if the Government compel civil servants to assure outside. How possibly can we,' as I asked a few nights ago, ascertain the solvency of any of the assurance companies withoutmakinga periodical valuation of their assets. The Minister speaks of actuarial valuations. An actuarial valuation is all veiy well so far as it goes, but it is no guide to a public servant or any body else who wants to assure in a company, and to be perfectly surethat it is solvent and sound. The only way to arrive at a decision about that is to have a periodical valuation of the assets of insurance companies. Mr O'MALLEY -Every year. . tralia, where values are continually fluctuating, I do not think the suggestion of the honourable member for Tasmania Mr O'Malley, is unreasonable, namely, that the valuation should be made every twelve months. If the Minister is to carry out those valuations by means of a Government department, look at the enormous expense. Wouldi t not be more economical for him. to endow a public service superannuation fund straight away with the money he is going to squander and waste in carrying out what, after all, may. be an abortive investigation into the accounts of those private societies ? Mr O'MALLEY -They will have to be investigated, anyway. the honourable member that the accounts of these private societies will have to be investigated,' anyway. There is a good old maxim that the buyer should beware, and. you cannot always keep a fool from losing his money. If people who are under no compulsion to assure, except that compulsion exercised by the persuasiveness of the eloquent member for Tasmania, Mr O'Malley, chose to assure in those societies let them see that their investment is a sound one.

564,Mr Mahon,"I do not quite agree withdebate of the superior power of these societies to earn money over a Government institution. But let us see what they have earned during tlie past twelve months. The best society-the Australian Mutual Providentearned 4 55 per cent., and going down the list of eleven others we find one-tli e Colonial Mutual-whos e earnings were as low as 3 90 per cent. Others earned less than 4 per cent. The average earnings of the whole twelve societies is 4 4 7 percent. These figures are for the year 1900, and they represent a decrease on the earnings for 1899, which were 4 58 per cent., and for 1S98 when the earnings were 4 53 per cent. NowI contend that if a State department of insurance or a superannuation fund did not have the necessaiy property and security to earn a large amount of money, the economical management would more than counterbalance that disadvantage, because in some of these societies-suc h as the Temperance ancl General-the expenditure in proportion to their total revenue represents 36'88 per cent. Upon these grounds, I think that at this late hour of the night the Minister in charge of the Bil l would do well to postpone the consideration of this clause in order that the committee may have additional information upon the subject. I would' like to put it to the Minister that under this B ill jve compel all our public servants to insure their lives with societies which are approved of by the Governfnent. In the event of one of these societies not being able to meet its obligations', public servants, whom we compel to insure. what will happen ? As a matter of fact we know quite well that the Minister would bring clown a proposal that we should pay over the amount involved to the public servants, whom we compelled to insure, in order that the engagements entered into should be fulfilled. We would not allow our public servants to suffer owing to the inability of one of these companies to meet its engagements. I am quite sure that the Minister for Home Affairs will admit that that is probably' what would be done. Thus, whether we declare in the Bill or not that we guarantee these insurance companies, as a matter of fact they will be guaranteed by this compact, and seeing that we are going* to guarantee the solvency of those societies which are approved by the Government, and in which we compel our public servants to insure, we might just as well enter upon the whole business ourselves. If we are to take no profits, and to suffer all the losses, it would be a far wiser policy for us to require public servants to insure with the Government, ancl then we should know at the outset the extent of our liabilities. pose to guarantee these Societies ? member for Corio will at once admit that, in the event of one of these societies not being able to fulfil its engagements with the public servants who haveinsured in it under our compulsion, the Treasurer would come down and put a sum of money on the Estimates, and not a word would he raised against the necessaiy amount being paid to tlie public servants. society about which there is any doubt. member is assuming that, of course. But we are dealing with annuities which are proposed to be paid 20, 30, or 40 years hence, ancl whilst any society may be perfectly sound to-day, we do not know what position it will be in half a century hence, so that tlie approval of to-day is no sort of guarantee as to its solvency at all. Seeing that the Government will have to shoulder all losses, they might just as well go in for the business themselves, even if there is some loss involved at first. It would be better for us to subsidize it straight out ancl thus put the business upon a sound footing. Let us begin this life insurance on a small scale with our own I believe it will be to the interests of life insurance generally if that is done. It may possibly lead to a general policy of State life insurance. I think that tlie Minister, for Home Affairs is asking a great deal too much when he requests the honourable member for Bourke to forego this small proposal in favour of some general scheme, which may, or may not, be introduced by the Government. If the Minister had declared that it was part of the Government policy to introduce some general scheme, then he would have had some grounds .for expecting the honourable member to withdraw his amendment. But tlie Minister is not in a position to tell us that.

569,Mr Batchelor,"The honorablethink that the committee would do well to carry this amendment to-night. to tlie debate upon Hie insurance, I am more in favour of the Commonwealth taking that matter in hand than ever. My experience in the railway service of the Queensland Government in 1889 ancl 1890, leads me to say that we are going to get into exactly the same mess as the railway when the Commissioner of Railways came out to assume charge of the railways. Mr Mathieson was going to manage the Queensland railways upon commercial lines. What he intended to clo was to make all railway employees insure in different companies, which he thought were financially sound. He did not take into consideration the fact of whether the people to be insured thought that they were in that position. The Minister in charge of this Bill has said exactly tbe same thing. guarantee the insurance of certain civil servants with those companies which the Commonwealth Government are to select. If the Government are. to guarantee the societies at all, why should not the Commonwealth itself become the guarantors'! companies the cream of the service for insurance and the Commonwealth is to take all the deadheads, there may be 50 or 60 per cent, of deadheads when they .come to be medically examined. I know that that was tlie case j n the railway service of Queensland. Because certain individuals failed to pass the medical examination there, what was the result 1 These men who were competent to do the work in which they were engaged, who had been carrying it on for years before the Railways Commissioner assumed control, were discharged and turned out to do the best they could, whilst others whom the insurance companies would take were drafted into the seavice in their stead. The same thing may be repeated here. A man may have some trivial hereditary complaint which would cause an insurance company to decline to insure him. What would then happen ? The Government would not care to take the risk. It is all very well to throw oneself upon the Government, but it will generally be found that Governments are as soulless when we come to the jDoint as syndicates. Mr O'MALLEY -That is too true. member for Tasmania, Mr O'Malley, knows it. The honourable member has thrown himself upon Governments and they have thrown him over at the last moment. I am quite satisfied that if we are going to start a scheme of life insurance at all, we cannot clo better than tackle it now. The honourable member for Bourke made a point employees of that State got into of the fact that when a new insurance company starts in Victoria all it has to clo is to place £5,000 in the hands of the Government as an evidence of its bona fides. What is to hinder the Minister for Home Affairs from putting £15,000 or £20,000 as a nucleus to the fund which it is proposed to establish, and as it pays itself, from drawing it out and paying it back 1 Nothing at all1 The sooner a start is made the better for all of us. The Minister said that it is eight years since the compulsory clauses in connection with State The Government are to life insurance were introduced in New Zealand. What has been the effect 1 There have been only 290 insurances effected. If the Commonwealtli cannot stand that number of insurances during eight years, it is certainly veiy poor indeed.

He tells us that there were only 280 public servants in New Zealand who had insured up t ill the end of 1S99. But I would point out that, at that time, life insurance had only been in existence in the colony referred to, for six years. TheA c t was passed in 1893, ancl the Minister said that the figures which he gave were for 1S99. new appointees. bability the Government of New Zealand did not appoint many extra hands to the public service.

574,Mr Ttj Dor,"Exactly, and in all proSir That is a mistake. W ill the honourable member look at clause 4:9 ? -where an officer is unable to insure his life a deduction shall . be made at prescribed intervals from his salary, and such deductions shall be invested by the commissioner for the benefit of such officer. Life insurance companies, do not pay out more than they receive. To say that the Government cannot undertake this work is to urge that private companies whioh are a part of the community, can do better work than the whole community. The matter of State life insurance was not mentioned in the Governor General's speech, and I think there is no hope of anything being done under a separate Bill in that direction, either during this session or the next If we can start such a scheme as is suggested in connection Svith this Billi t will be a step in the right direction. should have a strong sympathy with the Ministeri n his desire to postpone the consideration of this matter, so that it might be dealt with in another Bill, if I felt there was any big monetary responsibility to be added to the Government. I should hesitate to caddie the Treasury and the country with what might possibly be a big burden, even though it might be for a good purpose. But when one looks at the cost, it will be' seen that for years it will be a very small matter indeed. The provisions for insurance will only apply to new appointees. Consequently, we are taking by implication the full burden of these new insurances, and we may as well take the benefit of them too. Surelyi t is clear to thqse who understand parliamentary life and operations that if we pass a law compelling public servants to insure in certain approved companies, and any one of these companies fail, the cry will be raised that Parliament, having forced these people to insure in that company, should go to their assistance. We are, therefore, practically guaranteeing the stability of these companies, and as the Government are taking upon themselves that liability, they might as well accept the money which will be payable in premiums. The proposal in the Bill is to make the Government an agent to obtain business for certain insurance companies. W ill these companies give them 60 per cent, of tlie first premiums, or any other concession? them. Government should compel their employees to insure with certain companies and. practically stand behind these companies, and get nothing at all for doing so. I think it is time that we looked at this matter from a business stand-point. We are told that we must be commercial, and we are determined to be as brutally commercial as we can in this instance. Surely, if companies like the National Banking Company and the Colonial Sugar Refining Company compel their employees to insure in their own concerns, they must find it a good business policy. The Minister was under a mistake when he said that the New Zealand system was not compulsory. Sir WILLIAM LYNE I did not say that. the honourable member. It is compulsory, but it is compulsory only for officers entering ""under a certain age, which is fixed by the regulations. T apprehend that the small number of lives insured during the six years is chiefly owing to the limitation to which I have referred. The author of the New Zealand Official Handbooks a y s It may be said that two of the greatest benefits conferred upon the participants in this scheme are the avoidance of fluctuation in the fund through amalgamating with the large insurance institutions, and the possession of fixed and irrevocable contracts, clearly defining the benefits to be received at death or by way of pension. I would vote with the Government on this question if I felt that to carry the amendment would "" seriously affect them; but I know well that we are dealing now with young, healthy, thoroughly examined fives, the best lives in the State, and that the risks will be very small. Eveni f the Government had to make considerable payments in the first two years, they would be easily recouped later on. I do not believe in the Government engaging in slap-dash, haphazard business, but when a profitable undertaking is before them which will alleviate the burdens of the taxpayer^, and in regard to which we have the favorable experience of other States, I think they should enter into this matter in such a Way that they will secure the benefit as well as have to submit to the burdens arising from it. that the New South Wales superannuation fund can be regarded as a criterion in this matter.

579,Mr Watso N (Bland),"I do not think1S84, and, almost immediately afterwards, officers who had contributed practically nothing to it -were retired and allowed to draw pensions from it . It was never placed upon a sound basis, and it was treated unfairly by the action of the Government of tlie day in getting rid of its liabilities by charging against the fund payments which should have been made from the consolidated revenue. With regard to the New Zealand Government insurance system we have this remarkable fact-that although its business is confined to New Zealand, while other Australasian insurance offices do business all over Australia, and some of them in New Zealand as well, it stands second on the list so far as the amount of business transacted is concerned, in regard to lowness of expenses, and, I believe, in regard to the general average of interest earned, the Australian Mutual Provident Society coming first. TheB ill requires the public servants of the Commonwealth to insure with any of a number of societies, presumably Australasian, and the State must either practically guarantee the solvency of these companies, in which case it might as well take over the whole business itself, or the public servants must run tlie risk of losing all they put in through the breaking down of a company perhaps 20 years hence. No matter what system the Government adopt as to valuation, there is always that danger in commercially-managed concerns. As bearing that out, I might point to the fact that the twelve life societies doing business in Australia have a total liability of about £30,000,000. Against these liabilities, they have about £6,000,000 of liquid assets, that is, cash in hand, Government securities, municipal debentures, and other securities which could be easilyrealized, whilst the non liquid securities amount to £24,000,000, of which £14,000,000 is invested onmortgage. Then we find that. between £3,000,000 and £4,000,000 is invested in freehold and leasehold properties, a very large proportion of this item being represented by foreclosed properties. majority of these are non-interest producing, otherwise they would not have been foreclosed upon, because, if they had been worth the money advanced, the chances are that the original owners would have retained them. the societies taken together. [120] to urge is that it is utterly impossible for an outsider OJfor the Government, without such a close investigation as would involve a considerable expenditure, to arrive at any sound conclusion as to the value of the assets stated in the books. We know that 'in many cases there has been such a writingdown of these items as to cause very grave doubt indeed as to whether the reports of the actuaries should have been acted on at -all, for the reason that they have necessarily had to take the figures submitted to them by the directors of tlie various, societies, as to tlie value of the assets. They can easily arrive at the amount of the liabilities, but the worth of the assets is only ascertainable by an investigation such as tlie actuaries have no possible chance of engaging upon. So that it seems to me that we are asking our civil servants to engage with societies about the solvency of which they know nothing, and can know nothing. I have reason to believe, as a layman, that several of the societies doing business here are perfectly solvent, and, still speaking as a layman, I have my doubts about others-bu t I would not care to be put on my oath about that. affirmation ? do that. In any case it is impossible to be perfectly certain as to the solvency of some of the societies, and whilst societies which are doing an immense amount of business may be able to cany on for many years and apparently with success, there is no less certainty about the aftermath to come. It may be that just at the very time when the youths now coming into the federal service will require to fall back on their policies, there will be a special risk of some of these societies collapsing, ancl of the Government after all having to pay the piper. In connection with the New Zealand Life Insurance department, I should like to draw attention to the interest earned ancl the low expenses rate. The department The probability is that the is in open competition with the other life offices, and they have to incur all the expense of getting new business, which, in the present days of cut-throat competition between life insurance societies, is veiy heavy indeed. Still they show the good return that has been spoken of.

Another point that requires emphasizing is that any society which would propose to cater for the public service uuder this Bill would require to project a totally new table. The societies could not go to work on any existing table and meet the requirements of this clause. of the societies projecting a new table altogether, and we have no guarantee as to the premiums they would exact. It is all very well to put before us Mr Pen ton's estimate of what the civil service would have to pay on the basis of 3 per cent, interest to secure a certain annuity; but we -do not know what the various companies would ask. We could easily ascertain! what the companies would require upon their ordiinwy insurance tables, but with regard to the new kind of insurance we can form 1 no estimate at all. In consequence of that we may find Mr Fenton's figures to be of little use, for the reason that the companies may be more expensive than the figures put forward by the Minister for Home Affairs .warrant us in believing. Under all these circumstances, I hope the honourable member for Bourke will not withdraw his amendment, ancl that the committee will ask the Government to assume responsibility for of new civil servants who are to be brought under this scheme. As pointed out -by the honourable aud learned member for Northern Melbourne, most of these new members of the service will be young and healthy lads, who need not be expected to be a charge upon any fund for a considerable number of years, during which time there will be plenty of opportunity to prepare a°scheme which will give some reasonable security, and will also enable the State to insure the economical management of the business. There is one point that has not yet been anode with regard to the alternative to tlie -Commonwealth adopting some system of State assurance for its employees. That is, that the Government will necessarily have to put its imjyi'imatii/i' upon certain societies. Australia for ten years, and has worked That means that serious injury will be done to others. It will be far better for the Commonwealth Government todothebusiness itself. I hope the Government will see their way to accept the proposal. It is certainly Although for some time there a much larger thing than some people would be apt. to suppose, and I can' well understand the Government feeling a disinclination to enter upon it Buti t will be the better policy in the long run. We can include our own marine and fire insurance as well. I trust the committee will affirm the principle, ancl that we shall have a definite promise from the Government that the That means for each matter will be dealt with in a proper way. W it h that the committee will probably be satisfied. regret that this discussion has simply traversed one line, and that the question seems to have been limited to the matter of State life assurance. In my opinion no Public Service Bill is complete that does not provide for the superannuation of public servants. Even if the amendment of the honourable member for Bourke were lost, I should have to move a further amendment which would have the effect of favouring the introduction of a superannuation scheme. Personally, I should prefer to see the life assurance principle adopted by the Government at once with regard to the public service ; but failing that, I should certainly like the Government to introduce a superannuation scheme, which would place those who leave the service of the State after years of faithfu l work beyond penury. In cases of the comparatively small number death I should like the Government to take steps which would provide for the widows and children of members of the public service. I have already alluded to the South Australian scheme, which, however, only provides for life assurance indirectly. It provides that after a member, or a subscriber, as he is called, has paid into the fund for a certain number of years, he shall be permitted to withdraw two-thirds of the whole premiums which he has paid during the time he has been a subscriber. In addition to that, it provides that if a subscriber should die within or after five years' membership, his family shall draw a certain allowance-hi s widow during the term of her life, and, if she should die, the children, until the youngest has reached the age of eighteen years. That is not a matter of theory, but has been in practice in South admirably. In the beginning it was necessary that the Government should guarantee the fund, but so successful has it been that not one shilling of guarantee has been called up. The fund has given such",72,William Lyne B A T They Do Not Mr O Malley I Will Fix That Up For

There are many things upon the we had arrived at such a stage of knowledge desirability of which the Government may on this'matter, that, subject to a wise system be at one with honourable members, but this in detail, the principle could be decided may not be the time to do them.

It might perhaps prejudice the prospects of this proposition if honourable members were to endeavour to drive the Government in any way, they being most amenable, as far as I can see, to all the suggestions that have been made from all quarters. As these matters have been dealt with in such a friendly and accommodating spirit from the beginning to the end of our proceedings, we should endeavour as far as possible not to put the Government in any false same position, and to all intents and position. Under these circumstances I am inclined, as long as the Government behave in this most reasonable manner, to support them. I must congratulate the Government, in reference to this Bill, upon the admirable spirit of subjection which they have shown to all suggestions coming from all quarters. the right honourable and learned member was away. pliance was more marked when I was away than it has been during the present sittingI should not like to say anything unkind-bu t it seems to me that every one has been at the helm during the present sitting besides the two Ministers at the table. If there was anything more mixed than that I am sorry I was not present, because this is a new method of conducting responsible Government. However, I think it would be ungracious to force the Government in this matter after the statement they have made, and perhaps the honourable member should not press his amendment at this particular stage, but should give the Government some time in order to complete their education on this subject when possibly some result may come of it . refusing to conquer England! who view most favourably such a proposal as that made by tbe honourable member for Bourke. I am desirous of seeing the State in some shape or form take up the duty imposed on it in this amendment. find the Government extremely sympathetic to the proposal, but regarding themselves, as they are bound to do, not only as a committee of this House, but as trustees for the Commonwealth and its finances, they are taking up, in my opinion, a proper position when they say they are not going to commit the Commonwealth to this proposal without f u l l and fair information. When we have before us the example of New South Wales aud the report of Mr Fenton, I think that if the Government are making an error at all they are making it on the right side, as they are not going to leap first and look afterwards. Whatever may be said by the leader of the Opposition, he comes to the same conclusion as the Government upon the question. He is in the purposes he supports tlie view taken by the Government that they should not commit themselves to this until further information is available. I look upon it in this way-if it were my own affair, and I were as favourably disposed to it as I am disposed to such a scheme being adopted on behalf of the State, I should hesitate very much before I embarked on such an enterprise in the present state of knowledge upon the subject. I should want more investigation. We have the promise of the Government that, as soon as they can, they will bring forward proposals which will enable Parliament to discuss the matter in a large spirit. They have not said that they intend to bring any proposal in. Minister for Home Affairs to say something to that effect. Affairs said the other thing. league said, and what I say, on behalf of the Government is, that the Government w ill be prepared to bring forward such proposals if further investigation justifies them in doing so. I understood tlie statement made before. A t the same time. I do not think I can press the Government to go further at present. I shall be one of those who will expect them to make up their minds definitely on this subject, and I believe they are prepared to I do so. extent to which they imitate the right honourable and learned member's experience. by minutes.

MrO ' MALLEY (Tasmania) I am pleased to hear such a splendid debate on the insurance question. . I am glad also to hear the Prime Minister declare that the Government have a great insurance scheme in the process of incubation. I do hope things will go on all right in time. 1 would ask my honourable friend, the member for Bourke, to amend his amendment so as to provide for a complete system of State insurance. ThenI may be the Minister for Insurance. There is no doubt that there are a great many insurance experts in this House, and we can all get jobs as insurance actuaries, because we know all about it. I heard my honourable and learned friend, the member for Northern Melbourne, talk about 60 per cent. I have been doing business for many years, and it is very trying to hear a lawyer talking about percentages. peachment that 60 per cent, is the charge on the first premium ? Mr O'MALLEY -Nothing of the kind. They may get £ 1 per £100. gets 60 per cent, is an emperor of insurance. You can get a lawyer for a few pounds, and then you will get another lawyer, like our right honourable and learned friend across the way, or like the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, who do not go for any small percentage. I remember that one time in Columbia, on the Brazos river, in Texas, there were four fat farmers and four hungry lawyers. They went along for two or three years, and there were then four fat lawyers and four hungry farmers. WhatI want to impress on my honourable friends is that lawyers should never talk about percentages. Mind you, I have the greatest sympathy for them. They are the friends of humanity, because when we are in trouble they get us out-and get our families in. Another point on which I would like to have a word is this: are to ""start an insurance company or not we must establish in the Commonwealth a department of insurance, and we must bring the insurance companies under absolute State control. We must say to every man ancl woman in the Commonwealth, who invest their money with the societies for the benefit of their children, that they are protected. Honourable members will see how simple it is. All we have to clo is to have a department such as they have in the State of Massachusetts. I would not think of suggesting to a British community something which they have not in existence somewhere else, because you do nothing that your fathers have not done before. I have the greatest respect for you as a progressive people, but you must have some custom or use for what you do. You clo not experiment. What is the reason why Great Britain is behind in manufactures? It is not due to free-trade or protection: but it is simply because we do not get the latest machinery. We want new machinery in Australia to control insurance companies ; to bring them under State supervision, and compel them to deposit a percentage of their reserves in Commonwealth bonds, and let the Commonwealth hold those bonds if necessaiy as a guarantee for their servants. But are the civil servants of so much more account than other people-tha n the people who have to struggle, the pioneers of civilization ; the prospectors of this country, who go through all the hills and mountains seeking the wherewithal to keep the civil servants ? That is the rooster I want to pluck. Let The man who us be sensible on this point. If honourable members carry this amendment, as the Prime Minister says, they cannot put it into execution : they have no data to go on. The fact is that they do not know where they are. I want to be absolutely fair, ancl I hope, if the lionorable member for Bourke is going to press his amendment, he will go for a complete State department. Look at another point. What1 said here the other night I repeat. Isi t fair to these few civil servants that they should be paying into a Government assurance department where they will not get one cent barring the limited amount which their little premiums will be earning. MrO ' MALLEY I have heard a lot here to-night about the earnings of assurance companies. If the amount which big assurWhether we ance offices have loaned on their policies is taken off, how much do they earn ? Take the very company which has been quotedthe Australian Mutual Provident Society. I do not mind giving them an advertise( ment, for I am a Christian.
