As many voluntary voting despite the fact that the members have already said, the bill provides majority of Australians have clearly shown for a very unwelcome departure from the that they are in favour of the retention of usual form of voting in federal and state compulsory attendance at the ballot. politics: it is voluntary and it is by post.

Generally speaking, this postal voting for some purposes in Australia balance of parliamentarians and selected already-that postal votes run the risk of known and prominent citizens will mean that being rorted. If you think about the way post there is a bias not only in favour of the is delivered in large complexes with a high conservative view but also towards older turnover of residents, there is every chance members of our community. It is almost that ballots will be picked up by people for certain that, if you look at the bias, it will be whom they are not intended. Preventing that in favour of the older members and, as Bean, may well result in further informal voting: for one of our prominent political scientists has instance, requiring people to put their date of indicated, age has the most consistently strong birth on the outside of the envelope, which is effect on choosing a monarchy.

Thursday, 15 May 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 3831 Thursday, 15 May 1997 Second Reading Debate resumed from 26 March, on motion by Mr Miles: That the bill be now read a second time. legislation. The opposition supports it, so I do not intend to detain the committee by making any sort of lengthy speech. Obviously, it reflects the extension of Australia's network of double taxation agreements, a clearly important move from the point of view of fostering trade and investment flows between Australia and other countries, particularly those in our region. The specific measure here in relation to tax sparing was one where the present government had an exchange of notes on 22 November 1996. It is completely uncontentious and we support it, and I will say no more than that. International Tax Agreements Amendment Bill (No.1) 1997. This bill will provide for the insertion into the Income Tax (International Agreements) Act of 1953 the text of the notes exchanged between Australia and Vietnam, amending the comprehensive double taxation agreement between the two countries. These notes were exchanged with Vietnam on 22 November 1996 and give effect to Australia's undertaking in 1992 regarding double taxation. In 1992, the double taxation agreement with Vietnam was signed with the purpose of Australia granting tax sparing for special Vietnamese tax concessions. Tax sparing is a situation whereby Vietnam offers tax concessions to attract foreign investment. Under these tax sparing credit arrangements, an Australian investor who takes up an offer of specialised tax concession is deemed to have paid the tax actually forgone by Vietnam for the purposes of Australian foreign tax credit rules. These arrangements are necessary in that, without tax sparing credits, the concessions granted to Australians by Vietnam could be negated by Australia's foreign tax credit rules. Three conditions must be met to qualify for tax sparing concessions under the terms of these notes. Firstly, the activity undertaken must meet the conditions of a specified Vietnamese law contained in the notes. Secondly, the incentive must be for a specified activity listed in the notes which will result in genuine economic development and active business income. The third condition allows for the exclusion of certain activities and tax sparing incentives. These include the banking and the finance sector, and some shipping and aircraft operations. Also included in this condition is a general anti-avoidance provision. At the time of the negotiations on the parameters of the credit notes there were a variety of tax rates applicable to foreign investors in Vietnam. These ranged from 25 per cent down to 10 per cent. It was therefore important to establish a benchmark for the underlying rate in order to calculate the amount of tax forgone by Vietnam. It was agreed that this benchmark rate would be 20 per cent.",120,Social Security Legislation Recipients No Longer Depended On Welfare One Amendment Work For The Year After Completing The Ace Program In

There is provision for the extension of this period, which began on 1 July 1993, on the grounds of a future agreement. The notes will enter into force when the future exchanging of diplomatic notes advising of the necessary constitutional processes has been fulfilled. A final binding treaty, and the enactment of this legislation, will complete the processes required by Australia for these purposes. This exchange of notes is an important step in the recognition by Australia of the importance of Vietnam to our region. In the last few years Vietnam has started taking great strides in its economic development. On 28 July 1995 Vietnam became a full member of ASEAN. Only two weeks earlier, the USA announced its normalisation of diplomatic relations between the two countries. These were two significant events in the opening of Vietnam to international trade and growth. Basic elements of commercial operations are currently in place and rapidly expanding. There are an abundant number of business opportunities emerging but there is currently not enough local capital to develop these possibilities. During the 1990s, Australia has experienced a tenfold increase in bilateral trade with Vietnam and we are currently one of the top 10 foreign investors in Vietnam. As part of the coalition government's commitment to assisting trade in our region, the minister, Mr Fischer, established the Market Development Task Force in 1996. The role of the task force is to better coordinate government activity within the trade portfolio. The task force is involved in setting realistic and achievable priorities in bilateral market access, trade promotion and trade development. The task force is about achieving outcomes and has recently given close examination to the emerging markets in our region, including an examination of the possibilities arising from increased growth in Vietnam. The relationship between Australia and Vietnam is one of increasing strength and cooperation. As part of Tuesday's federal budget, the government announced that country program assistance to Vietnam will be maintained. This means a coalition commitment of $66 million in aid to Vietnam over 1997-98. Projects in Vietnam that will be. funded include malaria prevention, providing a reliable supply of clean water, general sanitation projects, and the construction of the My Thuan bridge. The My Thuan bridge will open up the Mekong delta to increased economic development and is one of Vietnam's highest infrastructure priorities. This bill is an important part of our increasing trade relationship. It is a signal to the Vietnamese that we are taking our maturing trade relationship seriously. As trade between our two countries increases, it is important that the government can come to a fair agreement on tax sparing that matches the changing nature of the trade relationship. I commend the bill to the House. (No.1) 1997 sets out to enhance Australian business opportunities in Vietnam by providing a more agreeable tax environment. lL serves to formalise Australia's undertaking, given in 1992, to grant tax sparing arrangements for specific Vietnamese tax concessions. Double tax agreements are generally supported in principle by Australian tax experts and are acknowledged to be an integral part of our economic internationalisation. However, a submission made to the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties in March of this year on behalf of the Institute of Chartered Accountants, the ICA, reveals a number of concerns with this particular agreement. The ICA is concerned not only with the limited application of the",127,Representatives Main Committee
228,Mr Rocher (Curtin) (10.06 A.m.),"The International Tax Agreements Amendment BillThursday, 15 May 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 3833 legislation to Australian exporters but also with the lack of consultation with industry in the treaty making process. The member for Braddon( Mr Miles), in his second reading speech on behalf of the government rightly points out that tax sparing is utilised by the Vietnamese government to encourage international investment in Vietnam. He also suggested that without tax sparing credits: ... Vietnamese tax concessions granted to Australian residents could be negated by Australia's foreign tax credit rules which would effectively top up Vietnamese taxes paid to the level of tax that would be payable on an equivalent amount of Australian domestic income. He paints a very rosy picture of the benefits of tax sparing for Australian investors in Vietnam. Those Australian companies which qualify for the exemption will no longer be forced to pay the difference between Vietnam's tax rate and Australia's. This is both reasonable and sensible. The Institute of Chartered Accountants makes it clear that whilst tax sparing does not represent a cost to Australian revenue: Many of the features of the tax sparing agreement are those insisted upon by the Vietnamese government. These include the cap on the tax sparing rate, the exclusion of accounting and auditing services from tax sparing relief, and the defined permitted activities. The ICA acknowledges at the same time that these conditions are consistent with Vietnamese domestic taxation law. However, it is obvious that only a limited pool of Australian investors in Vietnam will benefit from this agreement. Services-including accounting, consulting, banking, commercial and insurance-will not be able to utilise the tax sparing agreement. The Treasurer ( Mr Costello) has also conceded that aircraft and shipping operations will only benefit in part from this tax relief. Many tax experts believe this to be inappropriate. The Institute of Chartered Accountants maintains that other prospective tax sparing agreements should not be restricted to reflect the domestic law of the country in which the tax sparing income is sourced. It agrees that some Australian enterprises could be encouraged to export to foreign markets by tax sparing negotiations, but it stipulates that: Until the source country extends its domestic law to allow a tax concession, no practical issue will arise. The ICA agreed that it is necessary to maintain the integrity of tax sparing arrangements with Vietnam, but it v:ent on to note: In material terms, the Vietnamese domestic law will limit tax sparing available to Australian taxpayers, and this would make the conclusion of the double tax agreement expedient in its present form. To date, our trade with Vietnam has been quite limited. Australia's 1995-96 trade table showed Vietnam as 32nd among our top 45 trading partners. Total two-way trade between Australia and Vietnam in that year amounted to around $527 million, which represented a 0.3 per cent share of our total trade figures. Significantly though, our total export dollars were almost half that of our total import expenditure. In fact, our net exports are calculated at minus $131 million for the year 1995-96. This figure represents a substantial reversal in the flow of trade from 1989 to 1990, when Australian exports exceeded Vietnamese imports by some $66 million. We certainly have some ground to make up if we are to establish balanced two-way trade with our Vietnamese partner. Now is the time to do it. 3834 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 15 May 1997 David Lague, a journalist with the Australian Financial Review, observed on 3 March 1997 that: Vietnam's economic reforms and the possibility of funding from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, mean trade could grow rapidly over the rest of the decade. Mr Lague notes that, as Vietnam overcomes long standing regional antagonisms and reestablishes economic relations, both within and outside the Asian domain, investment opportunities in Vietnam will boom. The formalisation of this double tax agreement and the recent appointment of Australia's first trade commissioner to Hanoi are a recognition of the opportunities evolving in Vietnam. Australia currently ranks as the third biggest foreign investor in Vietnam, trailing only Taiwan and Hong Kong. A number of analysts predict that the United States will soon reassess its trade embargo on Vietnam and that it is essential that Australia consolidates its investment and trade relationships with Hanoi before that occurs. As indicated earlier, the ICA's submission to the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties expressed concern over the inadequate consultation in the formulation of this double tax agreement. It correctly asserts that the Australian Taxation Office should seek early and extensive deliberations with all relevant professional parties. The ICA submission goes on to read in part: Future tax related international agreements should be subject to the full consultative progress, as occurs and operates well in some other aspects of taxation law and policy. The clear inference there is that proper and meaningful consultation with industry did not occur in this case. This bill formalises an undertaking made five years ago between the Australian and Vietnamese governments. There is no excuse for the circumstances described, or for the former government not to have canvassed industry feedback on the nature of the agreement in that period. Given the coalition's election commitment to reforming the treaty making process, there is no justification whatsoever for this tardy management of legislation. In his speech on 2 May 1996, the Minister for Foreign Affairs( Mr Downer) promised the Australian community a more consultative and accountable treaty making process. Amongst other things he said: Every Australian individual and interest group with a concern about treaty issues has the opportunity to make that concern known. Consultation will be the key word, and the government will not act to ratify a treaty unless it is able to assure itself that the treaty action proposed is supported by national interest considerations. Clearly, the Institute of Chartered Accountants is not satisfied with either the timing or the extent of consultation on this particular tax agreement. They argue that they have not seen the Minister for Foreign Affairs' 'democratic deficit' in our treaty making process applied in this instance. The ICA submission suggests that organisations with expertise in the field of international tax law should be consulted once the initial round of diplomatic negotiations has been conducted. I am interested to hear the coalition's response to this recommendation, given its pledge to its Australian electors at the last election to be more inclusive than its predecessor. . The parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on Treatit:noted that the consultation with ll1dustry was unsatisfactory in the lead-up to making the double tax agreement with Vietnam. Thursday, 15 May 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 3835 The member for Wide Bay( Mr Truss), who sits on the treaties committee, noted that there had seemingly been no discussion with the professional bodies in Australia in regard to this international tax agreement. He observed: This was a very complex issue, and it was only when the committee drew attention to the fact that there had been this lack of consultation that there was able to be a resolution of some of the issues of concern. The consultation should not be left to the time when the Treaties Committee makes these reviews. I repeat what he said: The consultation should not be left to the time when the Treaties Committee makes these reviews. The chairman of the committee, the member for Groom( Mr Taylor), said: We were concerned that the consultation between the ATO and professional accounting bodies and the quality of the national interest analysis that accompanied the agreement was less than satisfactory. According to the chairman, the national interest analysis-the NIA-was not only unnecessarily difficult to understand but it actually omitted important information. The whole point of introducing NIAs was to facilitate parliamentary scrutiny of treaties. In the words of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, they are designed to 'note the reasons why Australia should become a party to a treaty.' The exclusion of important information from any NIA, whether the exclusion is intentional or not, has the potential to render the whole process a farce. The ICA is not only concerned about the timing of the dialogue between industry and the government, it is equally concerned with the content of this dialogue. It suggests that for Australia's treaty making process to be fully transparent, consultation with industry should cover all aspects of the proposed tax agreement. The ICA's report said: There is no justification for the consultation to be confined to those areas of a treaty which the ATO or Treasury decide are significant. If the ATO has reservations due to the confidential nature of the international negotiations, it is submitted that they are unfounded. Members of the profession have expressed their willingness to sign the same secrecy provisions which bind members of the ATO in order to promote consultation. Neither the ATO nor the Treasury should wield discretionary power in this matter. The Institute of Chartered Accountants is right to assert that all aspects of this and future international tax agreements should be the subject of objective and consistent checks and balances. The Minister for Foreign Affairs( Mr Downer) is recorded in Hansard as having said: I firmly believe that the impact of international laws in the domestic context makes it imperative that we continue to improve (that) transparency and recognise the fundamental right of people to scrutinise the way international law is made. Amen to that. That was what the minister had to say 12 months ago; yet here we are today, debating only the second international tax agreement since he made that remark, and we have both the Institute of Chartered Accountants and the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties questioning the treaty making process. The bill does provide incentives for certain Australian businesses to develop the Vietnamese market-to what extent, though, is anyone's guess. The fact that the financial impact statement provided with the proposed legislation can at best only estimate an annual cost to revenue of somewhere between $10 million and $15 million indicates that no-one is really sure what impact this agreement will have on Australia. Specifically, Australian businesses investing in infrastructure in Vietnam should benefit from this tax exemption. It is on this ground that I support the bill. 3836 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 15 May 1997 However, this agreement has demonstrated big holes in the coalition's supposedly impervious treaty making process. Perhaps the Foreign Minister's new code of conduct is working well in the area of Foreign Affairs, but it is obviously not effective in the domain of the Treasury or the Australian Taxation Office. The Institute of Chartered Accountants and the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties have described substandard practices in both the timing and nature of consultation within industry. Industry groups have called on the Australian Taxation Office to commit to a review procedure. A review of the ATO's method of consultation is, of course, of particular importance, given that the coalition government has indicated that it will negotiate as many double tax agreements as it can in the future, and I stress 'as many as it can'. If double tax agreements are a necessary part of economic globalisation-and clearly they are-they need to be negotiated to maximise the benefits to Australia. That will necessitate a truly open and accountable process of consultation. I understand that the ATO expects to present a proposal to the Treasurer later this week, seeking authority to consult more widely on international tax agreements. One option that the ATO is exploring is the publication of details of pending double tax agreements in the national printed media. That would certainly be a step in the right direction. However, it would not bring about a reform of the subjective manner in which the ATO arrives at the details of future tax treaties, if the present example is to be relied upon. Further, this proposal will not guarantee more time for discussion by experts and interested persons unless the ATO publishes, or makes available, details early on in the negotiation stage. As I indicated earlier, Australia's dealings with Vietnam are limited relative to our trade with other nations. But what the International Tax Agreements Amendment Bill (No.1) 1997 serves to highlight is the critical need for a truly open and meaningful consultation process in this country. It is equally obvious that such a process is not operational at present. It is the maintenance of checks and balances like those outlined by the Institute of Chartered Accountants that contributes towards a workable and sustainable democracy in Australia. Those proposals deserve serious consideration by the government. I repeat that I support the measure. Dr THEOPHANOUS (Calwell) (10.26 a.m.)-Although the bill before us, the International Tax Agreements Amendment Bill (No. I) 1997, is not controversial in the sense that it is not being opposed, it is an important bill. I must commend the member for Curtin( Mr Rocher) for his excellent presentation of the issues involved in this bill and some of the problems related to it. It is true to say that in a sense this bill is symbolic because it is dealing with one area. But the ramifications of the bill are huge in the sense that we also have agreements similar to this with Malaysia, Singapore, Sri Lanka, China, Kiribati and Korea, and we are looking to other agreements. In this context, it is very important that we get the nature of these agreements correct and also that we learn some things about how we can benefit Australia in this process. Essentially this proposal is concerned with the notion of tax sparing, which has to do with allowing Australian companies to gain a tax concession on the basis that they have been given a tax concession by the government of Vietnam. The government of Vietnam, like many Asian countries, gives tax concessions for investment in various industries and also concessions when profits are made. Thursday, 15 May 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 3837 In this situation it is important that you do not get a negation of that effect by the company then having to pay tax in Australia and being put in an awkward position. This bill is intended to extend this notion of tax sparing in relation to Vietnam so that we have a situation where companies can claim the same concession basically being transferred into Australia. It is interesting that this phenomenon is occurring and I read out before the other countries with which we have these arrangements-they are all Asian countries. What is important here is that it is in Asia that we see this massive effort-not just in Asia but primarily in Asia, especially in Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore and China-to give big concessions to industry for investment. I note this point in the context of Tuesday's federal budget. What was interesting in the federal budget was the complete absence of any incentives at all for Australian industry. You could not get a bigger contrast when you think about it. We are supposed to think of ourselves as part of the Asian region and associate ourselves with the Asian region. Virtually every country in Asia gives significant and major concessions for industry development, especially manufacturing industries, and we do not. We don't do anything. There is absolutely no reason why anybody should invest in Australia when facing the kinds of concessions given to companies to invest, especially in manufacturing and production, in other parts of the world but especially in the Asian region. Vietnam has opened up its economy and more and more foreign investment is going into Vietnam. I read recently that Vietnam is trying to copy what has been going on in China under the policies of Deng Xiaoping. I have just come back from a visit with a parliamentary delegation to China. You would not believe the development and the production that is going on there. It is very hard to believe. This kind of development is also starting to happen in Vietnam. In China, they build whole cities like Shenzhen-with 3Y2 million people in 15 years-and huge skyscrapers, railway systems, roads, bridges, five-star hotels and factories, one after the other. There is production, manufacturing and development. Compared to all that dynamism, the Australian economy is a disgrace. Yet we are saying, 'Let's try and get Australians involved in this process.' That is why I support this bill to get Australians involved in Vietnam and, by extension, in the other countries where we have double taxation arrangements. But we have learnt nothing ourselves from all of the developments in the Asian region. We do not give these sorts of concessions; we do not even think about it. We are obsessed with only one thing and that is whether or not there is a surplus in the budget. We have no idea about spending a dollar so as to make two or three in the future, especially in infrastructure development. It is very interesting that investments in infrastructure in Vietnam will be covered in these proposals, yet we ask ourselves, 'What is happening with investment in infrastructure in Australia?' We have an infrastructure investment situation, but it is measly compared to what is required for this country. When we think about budgeting, the analogy is often used about the household. The Treasurer ( Mr Costello) said you cannot spend what you do not have. If you took that idea totally literally, nobody would ever buy a house on a mortgage because they certainly do not have the money. They have to borrow the money. 3838 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 15 May 1997 Borrowing for investment in growth, infrastructure and development of industry is an investment in the future. Such borrowing is going to come back in a positive way, just as when you invest in a house and you go to the bank and you borrow money, it comes back positively. That simple fundamental economic lesson seems to be one which is totally missed here because this government is totally obsessed with an ideology that is out of date; it has been rejected around the world. What are even conservative governments around the world doing? Most conservative governments are actually borrowing. They are investing, they are growing their economies, they are pushing them along-with the exception of the Australian government. In relation to Vietnam and the other double taxation arrangements, as the member for Curtin mentioned, even this particular proposal is not sufficiently wide and open. A number of possibilities have been closed because this agreement was achieved without sufficient consultation with interested parties. That shows the total ignorance our public servants have about what is happening in Asia. Basically, they are hopeless. The advice they have given to the government about what is happening in Asia-how the various countries of Asia are developing their economies, how they want Australian investment and Australian dual projects, how they want Australia to get into China, Vietnam and all those other countries-shows that our bureaucrats, our public servants, do not have a clue. Let me give an example. What would happen to a businessman in Vietnam or China who applied for a visitors visa to come to Australia to have a look around and see what business he could do? He would probably be rejected. A number of businessmen in China and Vietnam and so on have been put off by the fact that they cannot come here because they cannot get a visa for a month or two to have a look around. They are given a grilling. This is our idea of how to do business with Asia. international tax agreement and the total failure to consult with Australians who have an interest in the matter. This is one example of what is going on. The reality is that unless we improve our approach, our knowledge, our understanding of what is going on in Asia, that unless we actually decide that we are going to get together with the communities in Asia in terms of dynamic economic development, then we are going to be left behind. Do not think that there are not alternatives to Australia for these people. There are alternatives. Other countries are already looking at taking a section of our trade, even primary commodities. If you think the business we already have is guaranteed, you should see the competition occurring amongst companies from all over the world that are trying to get into Vietnam, China and other Asian countries. Australia was not admitted into the discussions between the European Community and the various countries of ASEAN. We were not admitted into the discussions between China and the European nations. The danger is that these arrangements will occur amongst Europe, the United States and the Asian nations and we will be left in some kind of backwater. When we make agreements of this kind, we should have people go there, look at what is required, and do whatever we can to promote business, interconnections, trade and investment between Vietnam and Australia and, indeed, between China and Australia, as well as Malaysia,",128,Representatives Main Committee

230,Dr Theophanous,"The member for Curtin has pointed out the holes in thisThursday, 15 May 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 3839 Singapore and the other countries of Asia. If we do not do that, we will be in a very serious situation. This general arrangement of international tax agreements was initiated by the Labor government. It was, as I mentioned, one of several such agreements which the Labor government initiated. The previous Prime Minister had a commitment to improving links with Asia. He understood the importance of links, especially economic links, with Asia so that we could become part of the action in that dynamic region of the world. Naturally, the Australian Labor Party was involved in developing these agreements and it supports the general thrust of the legislation although, I must say, I agree with the qualifications and the problems outlined by the member for Curtin. The legislation could have been more extensive. It could have allowed for greater investment and, most importantly, it could have been based on consultation between the people affected, in both Vietnam and the Australian companies and individuals interested in doing business with Vietnam. Mr Bruce Scott-That was never the Labor way. a thing I have said, have you? You are such a fool. on the member. seriousproceed. Australia to get involved in the economy of the Asian region. I have been comparing the Australian economy and the Asian economies. We are told that a growth of 3.75 per cent is a wonderful achievement when, in fact, the average growth of the Asian economies is about eight per cent-and some are reaching 10 per cent, 11 per cent or 12 per cent. Some regions of China are reaching 15 per cent growth levels, and yet we think that three to 3.5 per cent is going to be sufficient to achieve something in this country. We need a faster rate of growth and greater involvement and participation in the dynamism of the region. To conclude, we support this international agreement, although we feel that it could have been stronger. We also support increasing the number of such agreements and extending them to other countries in the region so that we can have closer liaison with those countries. However, we also make the point that we could learn from some of the initiatives being taken in the Asian region and from some of the major projects to bring industries and investments into those regions. We could learn from those exercises and we could do a hell of a lot better in Australia. morning to sum up on behalf of the government. I led a delegation of Vietnam veterans to Vietnam last year.

238,Mr Bruce Scott (Maranoa,"Minister for Veterans' Affairs) (l0.43 a.m.)-I rise this3840 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 15 May 1997 There is no doubt that the International Tax Agreements Amendment Bill (No.1) 1997 is a very important bill. It will give the force of law in Australia to the exchange of notes that took place on 22 November 1996 amending the Australia-Vietnam double taxation agreement. The exchange of notes was announced by our Treasurer ( Mr Costello) on 22 November 1996. The notes implement, effectively, the tax sparing provisions of the double tax agreement. A benchmark rate of 20 per cent has been set for the Vietnamese tax otherwise payable. If the prevailing Vietnamese tax rate drops below 20 per cent that lower rate will become the benchmark. When the notes were negotiated, a variety of nominal tax rates were applicable to foreign investors in Vietnam, ranging from 25 per cent down to 10 per cent. Under the notes, the tax sparing is for the 10 years commencing from the date of effect of the Vietnamese double taxation arrangement, which is 1 July 1993. The government firmly believes that this exchange of notes will contribute positively to the strengthening of trade and investment and to a wider relationship between Australia and Vietnam. That is particularly important, given the importance of its geographic location in the Asian area, but also because of the need to continue to strengthen our relationship with Vietnam. Under the new arrangements introduced by this government to promote greater community awareness and discussion of treaty obligations, these notes and a national interest analysis were tabled in the House on 11 February 1997. The notes have already been reviewed by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. This is the first tax treaty to be reviewed by the committee. It held two hearings on this treaty and took submissions from the Australian Taxation Office, the Institute of Chartered Accountants and the Australian Society for Certified Practising Accountants. It was during that process that a number of important issues concerning these notes were clarified. The committee reported on this treaty in March of this year. The tabling of the committee hearings has permitted significant public debate and clarification of these notes already. The committee recommended that the exclusion of accounting and auditing services from the tax sparing would be kept under review and if Vietnamese legislation is amended, negotiations commenced to provide tax sparing. Importantly, the committee did not recommend changes to the notes and supported the early ratification. It is important that we consider the fact that this is the very first bill that has been considered under the new arrangements that this government put in place in relation to international treaties. Under the previous administration you would not have had this process of consultation. Therefore, it is an important step forward and a very positive one. I think that coming out of it, it is important to make sure that we do proceed constructively in relation to the way that we deal with foreign treaties. The member for Curtin( Mr Rocher) raised the issue of consultation. CanI say that the government will be positively looking at improving consultation as part of the treaty process. The government will be responding also to the recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. Not only is this bill important from the point of view of international treaties, it is also important from the point of view of our relationships with other countries, and in this case Vietnam. In conclusion, I want to thank those members from both sides of the House who have contributed to this debate. Thursday, 15 May 1997 MAIN COMMITIEE 3841 Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Bill-by leave-reported to the House without amendment. Second Reading Debate resumed from 26 March, on motion by Mr Williams: That the bill be now read a second time. The Crimes Amendment (Forensic Procedures) Bill 1997 represents the fulfilment of yet another commitment made by the previous Labor government. In the Justice Statement launched in May 1995, the previous Labor government committed itself to the introduction of: ... a forensic procedures bill to allow police to apply for court orders to take samples from suspected criminals for identification. As the Justice Statement went on to state: The use of forensic samples is a very important tool in crime investigation. The compulsory taking of samples is necessary for effective law enforcement. The lack of such powers might advantage criminals. The Commonwealth legislation will build in substantial civil liberty safeguards. Later in 1995, the Crimes Amendment (Forensic Procedures) Bill 1995 was introduced and passed through the House. That bill was based on the Model Forensic Procedures Bill developed by the Model Criminal Code Officers' Committee of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General. In tum, the model bill drew on the recommendations of the Report on Body Samples and Examinations published by the Victorian Consultative Committee on Police Powers of Investigation. The 1995 bill found its way to the Senate and, following consideration by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee which reported in October 1995, the bill lapsed when the parliament was prorogued for the 1996 federal election. The bill currently before the House relies heavily on the 1995 bill, although amendments have been made adopting most of the 20 unanimous recommendations of the Senate committee. Only three of those recommendations have not been adopted in full. Recommendations 1 and 3 sought to limit the power to take body samples and conduct examinations, particularly of breast swabs in the case of recommendation 3, to circumstances in which the offence was punishable by imprisonment for five years or more. The government has applied this recommendation, save that it has reduced the scope of the exception to apply it to indictable offences only. It also appears, on the basis of further consideration, that the Senate committee, in agreeing to recommendation 3, failed to fully appreciate the nature of the procedures contemplated by the relevant provisions. Accordingly, the opposition believes that these amendments are appropriate. Recommendation 2 prevented the taking of dental impressions. This recommendation was based on the state of forensic dontology as it was in 1995. I am advised that technical developments made since that time mean that low-invasive techniques for the taking of dental impressions are now available.",135,Representatives Main Committee
239,Mr Mel Ham (Banks) 00.48 A.m.),"I propose to speak only briefly in relation to this bill.3842 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 15 May 1997 It follows that this bill remains, in essence, and largely in substance, Labor's 1995 bill. I note that this bill is also designed to serve as a model for state and territory forensic procedures bills. I hope that the various jurisdictions will give strong consideration to bringing their laws into line with those to be adopted in this bill. The consistency of Australian criminal law has long been overdue. As it is implemented, it will greatly enhance citizens' knowledge of and consistent treatment by the law. It will also enable our law enforcement authorities to spend less time worrying about which law they need to apply and more time catching and prosecuting criminals. The benefits of the bill, both in its longer term use as a model for the states and territories and in its immediate application to provide consistency of forensic procedures for the prosecution of Commonwealth offences, are obvious. What concerns me on a personal level is that I had some reservations in the previous parliament on aspects of this bill. I voiced those reservations within the caucus committee of the Australian Labor Party. A number of those reservations are still relevant. We have to be very careful as a parliament not to bring in legislation just to the lowest common denominator. If we are going to be invading people's liberties, then there has to be some protections. Whilst the opposition will be supporting this bill, I put on notice to the government that there are a number of submissions that I anticipate are still coming to the opposition as to how the bill could be improved. I put the government on notice that, between the passage of this bill in the House of Representatives and its final consideration in the Senate, the opposition is going to be consulting with a number of community groups and individuals who are working at the coalface to ensure that this bill has adequate protections and to see whether it can be further improved. We are not going to do that in a destructive manner. We hope to do it in a constructive fashion, because there have been some improvements in terms of forensic dontology and other aspects of forensic behaviour in that time. We also need to look at these things afresh. Some time has elapsed. We want to get the federal model right so that the states can pick it up, but we want to have the right balance. We want to be very careful that we do not put in some protections because they are too hard or because some states might not like them. I put that reservation on the table. I have not been able to give specifics because we have not had further submissions, but I have been personally contacted by people in this area who lobbied me last time. I think it is a matter that I should put on the record, that on the previous bill I was not totally happy with it. We hope to discuss these matters with the government in a constructive fashion. The Labor Party does not want to just take an oppositionist role. These things have important ramifications when they affect the powers of police. r am not one who subscribes to the view that what we do is legislate to the lowest common denominator and then you have a situation where some police could abuse these powers. And that is the situation-there has been a number of royal commissions conducted around this country that show that police have abused powers that have been given to them. By and large, the opposition is supporting this bill. It is an improvement on the bill that we introduced in the last parliament because the government has picked up some of the recommendations of the Senate committee. We would just ask that the government look again at some of the reservations that were in the Senate committee's report that did not form Thursday, 15 May 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 3843 recommendations. There were some reservations of committee members and we would ask the government to have a look at whether, with the passage of time, some of those reservations might now be further considered to be put into this bill. The opposition commends the bill to the House. to legislation which give police greater powers. I am always concerned that those sorts of amendments have to be carefully looked at. Having said that, I wish I had more time to carefully look at these amendments to the Crimes Amendments (Forensic Procedures) Bill. We must always remember what was said nearly 150 years ago by Vice-Chancellor KnightBruce, I think it was, in a case that I cannot remember the name of. In talking about the striving to get people convicted if they were guilty, he included a cautionary note in relation to the question of truth. He said, 'It may be pursued too keenly. It may be loved unwisely. It may cost too much.' It is a principle that I think has to always be borne in mind in considering these sorts of matters. It is always a matter of getting the balance right between the community's interest in ensuring that people who commit serious criminal offences are convicted and punished, and the interest of the individual who may be caught up in that process and who has been dealt with harshly in being so caught up. There have been a number of very prominent examples of that this century where individuals have been caught up. As I think I have said before in the House, once the criminal process begins it is not very nice to be on the other end of it. It is a very all-embracing process and people who get swept up into it really find it very difficult to get out until those magic words are pronounced by the jury. I have seen a number of cases where judges have virtually told juries to acquit because of the paucity of evidence and the way the investigative procedure has been conducted. With that in mind I also say that, on the other side of the coin, it is important for police to be armed in a modem age with all the powers that lead to the undertaking of forensic procedures so that they can carry out investigations in a thorough and proper way. The investigative arm conducted by the police is not frozen in time, and ought not to be frozen in time. There are constant changes and developments in science and technology that must be kept pace with. In that regard I think it is also important, in the overall context of the community's interest in ensuring that gUilty people do get found guilty and do get punished, to say that the end result must also be considered. I have, for example, great difficulty-I mention this since the Attorney-General is here-with the fact that appeal courts can enter verdicts of acquittal where scientific evidence is being questioned. A very notorious case in relation to that is the case of the Queen and Raymond Carroll. Carroll was charged with the murder of Deidre Kennedy. It was a shocking crime that occurred in 1973 in Ipswich where a 17-month-old child was murdered. Carroll was charged quite a number of years after-I think almost 10 years after-with the offence. He was found guilty by a jury but the court of criminal appeal quashed the conviction and entered a verdict of acquittal. In that case, the question of a bite mark on the child's thigh was concerned and the admissibility or reliability of various evidence about that particular matter came into close focus. With the advances in technology that case may well be able to be re-opened but for the fact that the court of criminal appeal has pronounced on it. I am not passing judgment on the Carroll case. WhatI am saying is that one must look at the overall need to ensure that guilty people are brought to justice and I question the powers",137,Representatives Main Commitiee
240,Mr Tony Smith (Dickson) (10.57 A.m.),"I am always very concerned about amendments3844 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 15 May 1997 that are given to appeal courts to enter verdicts of acquittal where scientific evidence is raised in sharp focus. A division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 11.03 a.m. to 11.16 a.m. verdicts of acquittal. I throw that into the melting pot merely to emphasis the fact that in a legislative package like this, we have to think of all of the ends that are sought to be achieved. It is no good having these sorts of procedures which are good, in general, if we do not also look at the powers of the courts of appeal. Generally speaking, I do not believe that a court of appeal ought to have the power to enter a verdict of acquittal, but there are always exceptions. Very briefly, in relation to the bill, they are model provisions drawing on the 1989 Coldrey report. It is basically the creation of a code for taking bodily samples for examination. It balances the interest of the public and the rights of the suspect, and there is a great emphasis in the particular legislation on the rights of the suspect. Non-consensual examination can occur within strict guidelines. It does end the present reliance upon varying state jurisdictions for their particular legislation. For example, in Queensland it is section 259 of the criminal code. In passing, I would like to have, as a defence lawyer, this particular set of provisions in Queensland instead of section 259, which is a fairly rigid section in terms of the powers that are given to take samples. I do not need to go into it, but the rights of suspects in relation to section 259 of the code are very much circumscribed. But, of course, there is always the supervisory jurisdiction of the court at trial and the exercise of discretionary principles that might arise under Bunningv Cross, and other cases. I have mentioned before the fact that forensic science is not frozen; it is constantly evolving, and this has to be borne in mind. I have just a couple of concerns about the bill itself-I emphasis again, I have not read it all, unfortunately. I find a couple of inconsistencies in the bill and I think that these should be addressed. Generally, may I say at the outset, there is an awful tendency on the part of legislators, and even at courts of trial, for courts to patronise people of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander descent. At times, it can become nauseating at the bar table to hear prosecutors asking questions of Aboriginal people in a manner which I do not think is intentional, but gives the impression that they almost believe that the Aboriginal person does not have a brain at all. I mention that in order to point out something that perhaps should be addressed in the legislation. Clause 23WX, subclauses (1) to (4), and also clause 23XR-by way of looking at the trend in the legislation--cover procedure, of course. Clause 23WX in part reads: (2) A suspect who is: (a) a child; or (b) an incapable person; must be represented by an interview friend and may also be represented by a legal practitioner. (3) If the applicant believes on reasonable grounds that the suspect is an Aboriginal person or a Torres Strait Islander not covered by subsection (2), the suspect must be represented by an interview friendPlease note the mandatory provisionsand may also be represented by a legal practitioner.",139,Representatives Main Committee
241,Mr Tony Smith,"I am very concerned about the powers of the courts of appeal to enterThursday, 15 May 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 3845 (4) Subsection (3) does not apply if the applicant believes on reasonable grounds that, having regard to the suspect's level of education and understanding, the suspect is not at a disadvantage in relation to the hearing by comparison with members of the Australian community generally. I have no problem with that provision. But you cannot say that, because a person is an Aboriginal, they are somehow different in terms of knowledge and understanding. So there ought to be a discretion for the applicant to make that assessment: it is quite common in other legislation. Similarly, there is that trend in clause 23XR. But the time limits in the bill, in relation to people under some disability, are such that the examination for forensic procedures must be carried out within two hours, for a child or an incapable person not in custody. In relation to Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander persons, there is also a two hours mandatory provision. But, for a suspect not covered by either (1) or (2)-that is, not a child, an incapable person, an Aboriginal person or Torres Strait Islander person-the limit is four hours. I see that as inconsistent with the other clauses of the act. Really, there should be a discretion there-to follow the clauses that I have referred to-to permit a longer period if the applicant, the investigating police officer or some person involved in the investigation believes on reasonable grounds that, having regard to the suspect's level of education and understanding, the suspect is not at a disadvantage. It seems to me to follow; otherwise, you are drawing a distinction between one section of the community and another, and there are plenty of people of European descent who are at great disadvantage in the community, and plenty of people of ethnic and other origins who also are at great disadvantage, and they are not covered. Looking at the rest of the act, I believe there should be a provision that allows a degree of liberality, if you like, so that we are not focusing on one section of the community and patronising it by saying that, somehow or other, that section of the community requires a two-hour limit because we accept that that section of the community is simply not generally capable of having the same level of understanding and judgment that another section of the community has. I can tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, from many cases I have done in your neck of the woods up in the South Burnett, there are many people of Aboriginal descent who, in terms of their level of understanding and knowledge, would leave for dead some people of European descent whom I have acted for. On the other side of the coin, there are people of Aboriginal descent who do need great assistance in relation to interview procedures and procedures of this particular nature. It is a matter that really ought to be looked at, to give some sort of consistency to the overall thing. I put that point respectfully, Mr Attorney, and I am sorry for the notice. I did speak to one of the officers only this morning about this. It is something that I think should be looked at, overall. Another thing occurred to me: what about the position of transsexuals? I can imagine the case arising where a transsexual person is going to have to be examined. Where do we go, in terms of the act, with that person? That is going to happen. It is not so unusual to find oneself in that situation today, and yet that is really not covered in the bill. After all, we are trying to construct a piece of legislation which will lead to a more effective administration of the criminal justice system. I have looked generally at other sections. As I say, it is a much more comprehensive piece of legislation, which I generally support-subject to those qualifications and subject to the fact that I have not considered the entirety of the bill. But, generally speaking, I support it as an instrument that balances fairly the needs of the community against the individual rights of the suspect who is being interviewed. Subject to those particular matters and the important matter 3846 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 15 May 1997 of ensuring that the whole package in the criminal justice system is always looked at when one is introducing measures of this nature, I think, on the whole, it is a valuable piece of legislation in the Commonwealth Crimes Act and one that will, in my view, achieve a good deL-] of good by ensuring the administration of the criminal justice system. commenced his second reading speech by saying that the Crimes Amendment (Forensic Procedures) Bill is long overdue. It does, as previous speakers have indicated, arise from legislation that lapsed when the parliament was prorogued before the last election. As the member for Banks( Mr Melham) indicated, the opposition supports the legislation. On the basis of the bill including some of the proposals that have come out of the Senate committee process, it believes the legislation is in some respects a modest improvement on earlier legislation. The legislation represents a very important step towards a higher level of commonality between the various criminal justice jurisdictions in Australia. In this area of the law, as the member for Dickson( Mr Tony Smith) indicated, there is not yet adequate commonality. Certainly, this legislation contributes to that and builds on the pioneering work that was done in Victoria and makes it better. There are a whole range of areas in the administration of the Attorney-General where evolving commonality is clearly desirable. Perhaps one of the closest examples to the processes involved in this legislation is the national automated fingerprint identification system-and that involves a very important collaborative effort between different jurisdictions. I mention also the evolution of the role of the national exchange of police information process, the operations of the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence and the establishment and work of the National Institute for Forensic Science. There is a range of evolving areas where, as a national parliament and on a bipartisan basis, we ought to be doing everything possible to ensure that this greater degree of commonality between Australian jurisdictions continues to evolve. Obviously, the gun laws, in the context of the discussions here last year, are another important example of that on-going evolution of commonality. This legislation, hopefully, will take that process forward in the very important area of forensic procedures. The bill also seeks to strike the fundamentally important balance between ensuring the rights of the accused to fairness in the investigation and prosecution processes and ensuring that our law enforcement agencies have the advantage of the most up-to-date technical capacities in relation to investigation and prosecution. I would imagine that the principal application of this legislation will be in the area of biological samples. In the forensic science area there is a range of other technologies that may relevant, including the analysis of textiles, for example, and the analysis of glass or metal specimens taken from crime scenes and the like. But I think it is in the biological specimens area that this will be the most relevant, and that is clearly a rapidly advancing area of technology and one which is very important for the reasons I have suggested. It is certainly a technology that has a very powerful capacity to implicate suspects. It also has, probably even more importantly, a very important power to exculpate or remove a suspect from consideration in relation to a particular offence. We should not get too carried away by the importance of this-and I will get onto the point of not getting too carried away by the aura of science in a moment. In very serious offences such as murder, the scientific evidence may only be peripheral. In a large number of murder",140,Representatives Main Committee
242,Mr Sercombe (Maribyrnong) (\ 1.26 A.m.),"The Attorney-General( Mr Williams)Thursday, 15 May 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 3847 cases there would not be much doubt about the identity of the person who carried out the killing. The question before the court is usually one of intent rather than identity. In relation to matters such as rape, often the courts are not dealing so much with identity or with the act of intercourse that may have occurred, but with the que-tion of consent. The question of consent is often before the court in those matters. One should not be unduly carried away and think that this particular technology is going to solve all the problems, but it is clearly going to be important. It needs to be understood that the aura of science should not dominate process. Not too long ago, in the United States in particular, serious questions were asked in the courts about DNA sampling. For example, in the early 1990s, arising primarily from a case called the Castro case, the US National Academy of Sciences said that DNA technology was sufficiently questionable for it to call for its non-admissibility in relation to court matters. Earlier in this decade, the Tran case in New South Wales was often talked about as one which raised serious questions about the quality of the DNA evidence being presented in our courts. I am advised by forensic scientists-and I make no pretence of understanding the particular technologies in a scientific sense-that PCR technology is now commonly used in most Australian jurisdictions, though I think there is some doubt about what Tasmania uses. As I understand it, many of the problems related to the adequacy of the scientific techniques and the scientific methodologies of earlier technologies have now been overcome. I add the cautionary note that forensic science is not without its faults and problems. The most notorious case in recent times in Australia was the Chamberlain case, which led to the 1987 Morling Royal Commission of Inquiry into the Chamberlain Convictions. It was found that the scientific evidence in that particular case was seriously flawed. According to Morling, a number of tests were done without the results being verified. It found that there was a failure to use adequate controls, particularly in testing blood samples from the Chamberlain car. The commission also found that testing was done on articles from which a clear result could not be expected and that there was a failure to use a control or scientific methodology in such circumstances. The commission found a failure to take adequate account of the effects of heat in a car with the eftluxion of time when interpreting test results. Things have moved on considerably since that time but, nonetheless, as well as the findings of the Morling royal commission in relation to scientific evidence, there has been a range of other cases, such as the Stuart matter in South Australia and the Shannon royal commission, which found reasonable doubt as to the validity of scientific evidence used in the conviction of Edward Charles Splat. The list goes on. There has been a tendency unfortunately, I would submit, for police, courts and juries to give an aura to scientific evidence. In many cases that aura is undesirable. It has led to a situation where, as a community, we need to make sure that there are rigorous controls in relation to the evolution of that science at all times and that an adequate balance is achieved. This legislation has considerable merit in that respect but it is a matter that needs to be continuously and rigorously looked at if injustices are to be minimised in the future. It is very important in that process that the commonality of approach between jurisdictions in Australia be rigorously pursued. If there are major problems in scientific evidence in one jurisdiction, that will discredit similar evidence in other jurisdictions. It will create circumstances where not only do innocent people run the risk of being convicted-as was the case in the Chamberlain matter-but where guilty people are not convicted because the evidence is tainted. 3848 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 15 May 1997 -----------------------This was the case earlier this decade, in my understanding, in the United States, where, as a result of the Castro case and the position argued by the Academy of Sciences in the US, there was very serious doubt. Guilty individuals who should have been convicted were not convicted because that evidence was not presented. There are also questions of costs involved in this process. Once again, we do not want to get carried away, but it can be a very expensive technology. I understand that the Victorian Institute for Forensic Medicine charges something like a couple of hundred dollars to carry out elemental DNA testing. In some circumstances, that can rise significantly higher, so there are limitations on the utility of some of this stuff. The bill also provides for the establishment of a database where blood samples are taken from individuals convicted of serious offences. That is going to be an extremely important tool to investigations provided it is properly managed and properly utilised in the same way as the national automated fingerprint identification system. But it is a more complex matter and a more difficult matter than fingerprinting. There was a story in the Australian on 3 April which was headed, 'Criminals in line for DNA database'. Perhaps the Attorney-General, in winding up this particular debate, might be able to update us as to where the evolution of that particular proposal is. It is clearly a very important one, but it is one that, in the context of forensic evidence generally, because of its importance both in implicating and exculpating suspects, needs to be extraordinarily carefulIy managed if it is to retain credibility. I am sure that the database is not going to be particularly useful in prosecutions. I would have thought that if it was put before a court or a jury that a significant basis for prosecution was that the person had been checked off on the database and a match had been found, that would be clearly indicating to the jury that the person had prior convictions. By definition, a person is not going to be on the database if they have not had a prior conviction. A person is entitled to be tried without the jury having knowledge of prior convictions. How the database will be used in the process of prosecution or what the utility of it is in that respect is very much a matter for discussion. I would welcome any comments from the Attorney General on that. It is quite clear to me at least. I hope that the relevance of the database is going to be for investigation and not for proseclltion. OveralI, the opposition does support the bill, as I indicated at the outset. In fact, the member for Banks indicated that there are some modest improvements in the legislation as a result of the government picking up some of the Senate committee's points. We wish it rapid progress. But I have a feeling that the legislation is going to be back before the parliament in the not too distant future, given the fairly dynamic nature of this area and the evolution of forensic science for some further update, and that seems eminently sensible and appropriate. Miss JACKIE KELLY (Lindsay) 01.40 a.m.)-The Crimes Amendment (Forensic Procedures) BilI 1997 is an example of parliament trying to keep pace with rapidly changing technology. It can be seen in a number of other areas that are readily used today such as the Internet, where our children find it very second-nature. I think the older generation has some difficulty coming to grips with it. The problems are then with parliament. With it being prorogued, our major democratic system finally comes round to catching up, as it were, to technology. The technology here is not very high flying. There are things as basic as fingerprinting. We have gone so far with DNA identification now that we can actually isolate genes which are Thursday, 15 May 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 3849 causing a particular disease and treat embryos before they are born. There is the ability to clone animals, and there is some doubt whether the technology exists yet to clone human beings. Technology is presenting us with so many moral questions well ahead of our human and moral development to be able to answer any of those questions. While you have crime in the community, people's perception of crime escalates. They become very apprehensive about crime, demanding solutions to the problem that is affecting them in their environment. This is true especially of females in that the ordinary use of the community is severely curtailed by apprehension about their movements after dark, thinking, 'AmI alone?' or 'Is the taxi safe?' Every female suffers some curtailment of her ordinary right to the night by that fear of crime, especially rape and sexual abuse. That severely curtails females' rights to go about their business in society and it changes their behavioural patterns quite considerably. Women are demanding some action on that. They can see where technology is going. They can see the extraordinary science that is available and they also see a number of alleged criminals beating the rap. Often in a lot of sexual abuse and rape crisis counselling the female is put on trial at the trial rather than the suspect. This sort of technology just facilitates the police roles and meets the public demand for not only apprehension but conviction. This sends a clear message to the community that crime does not pay-'You will be apprehended and the chances of you getting off are very narrow; we will have all sorts of technology to beat you.' Certainly in the future, the way that technology is going, that will be so. Currently, the forensic procedures we are looking at are really quite basic and non-intrusive. I refer to the external examination of the genitalia or anal area, the buttocks, or, in the case of the female, the breasts; the taking of a sample of blood; the taking of a sample of saliva or a sample by buccal swab; the taking of a sample of pubic hair; the taking of a sample by washing from the external genitalia or anal area of the buttocks or, in the case of the female, the breasts; the taking of a sample by vacuum suction; scraping or lifting by tape from the external genital or anal area, the buttocks or, in the case of a female, the breasts; and the taking of a dental impression. These are not really the intrusive types of examination that is available and will get exceptional results. The dignity of the suspect is also protected in a number of areas in terms of who is able to take that sample. It generally has to be an appropriately qualified person, generally a medical practitioner, a nurse or a dentist. In some cases, such as taking a sample of hair, other than pubic hair, or the taking of handprints, fingerprints, toeprints or footprints, it can be a constable. So we are setting up safeguards to protect the suspect's dignity. Obviously the samples will be taken by individuals of the same sex and there is the option to have the whole procedure videotaped or recorded. Again, that is protecting the suspect. They can decline to have a video taken and, again, that protects their dignity. There is also an important section, clause 23XU, which provides for the sharing of samples with the suspect. In other words, if any samples are collected, the suspect must be given an examinable amount so that he can carry out his own testing procedures, using his own expert. If there is not a sufficient amount taken to provide that, then he is entitled to be present when the appropriately qualified person tests that sample. That is an important preservation of the suspect's rights. As the member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Sercombe) said, there is a lot of scepticism about technology today. I think the Lindy Chamberlain case was the classic case. There is scepticism 3850 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 15 May 1997 about technology: yes it is high tech, yes it is very accurate, but how many people are experts? Whenever you introduce technology into a bureaucracy, and you give it to people who signed up as policemen 20 years ago to organise, there is some standardising that has to occur. There has to be some training and there has to be some expertise developed in the area to satisfy people's wariness of new technology. The classic example is radar traps. We are still having ongoing disputes about the use of radar in order to convict speeding motorists. That technology is still being challenged in the courts and the operators are being found to be wanting in some cases. When you introduce technology it has to be probably not as current as what is available, but it has to be sufficient that those currently in the field can get up to speed with it, and use it appropriately and accurately. It is the accuracy that is available to us with modem technology that is being sought and demanded by the public. They are demanding not just an apprehension or far flung accusations; they are demanding a conviction. This technology is there and, in the future, I think criminals will be very wary about their prospects of getting away with anything as more and more technology is incorporated into police procedure. Currently, we have seen a classic move in the drugs scene where people have gone from secreting a drug in their luggage and passing it through Customs in various forms, to having it on the person, strapped around the body, and now to it actually being in bodily cavities. As technology moves and as police procedures move towards apprehension, the criminals, who do read papers and are aware of the movements and the powers of police, continue to move to avoid them. These procedures are just one step in the continual process of being able to apprehend and convict people who have committed crimes in our society. I think the member for Maribymong had some scepticism about the databases that can be created from these procedures. They are purely statistical and statistics are very important. He mentioned a few in relation to whether it was actually the intercourse in a rape case which was being disputed or whether it was the consent. With statistics, police can analyse where their cases are falling down and where further funds need to be spent to repair the holes in the prosecution case. With the statistics which will be collected on that database of samples and of convicted people, we will start being able to profile things. There are safeguards such that personal information relating to that sample can be deleted. It really is a database just to give us more information on crime and to analyse crime, criminals and our actual conviction procedures. Miss JACKIE KELLY-That is an important point too, because a lot of the material is time delayed. A lot of material has to be tested within a certain time, a lot of material has to be destroyed when it is tested. If that is so and that material is destroyed in the testing process, then the prosecution is unable to admit that in the case. It is only admissible by the suspect if the material is destroyed in the testing process, so any analysis out of that material cannot be used in evidence against them. That is safeguarding the suspect's right. The whole movement today in criminal apprehension is always a balancing act between demands of society for the right to go about their business, and use public areas with immunity, and the individual's right to be treated with dignity, to be innocent until proven guilty and not to have to submit to a number of invasive or intrusive or degrading procedures to prove his innocence or otherwise. It is always a balancing act. This act has certainly got",142,Representatives Main Committee
243,Mr Sercombe,"That is almost completely right, but it is only for this biological material.Thursday, 15 May 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 3851 the balance fairly in favour of the suspects. You will still see a greater push by victims of violent crime wanting greater powers of investigation and greater certainty in conviction, and procedures where the witness does not have to go through the whole trial again with forensic evidence when a lot of circumstantial evidence is able to be produced which clearly puts the criminal at the scene of the crime. With an act of sexual intercourse or with drugs, it puts them fairly well in a limited narrow sphere where they are relying on defence such as consent or very legal technicalities to get out of it. The important message is that the rope is closing. We are doing more. We are moving a fair way down the track to give the night back to females and to really frighten off the criminals with the certainty that they will be caught. We do have national legislation, which will gradually see adoption throughout all the states, where they cannot come to the ludicrous situation that occurred with one of my constituents. The sexual assault occurred in Tasmania, the offender went to Victoria, they moved to New South Wales, and nothing has happened because, out of the three jurisdictions, it all got too complex. Evidence collected in Tasmania would not be admissible in New South Wales. Very complex jurisdictional issues are a great loophole for criminals to scoot through. It is certainly something that we have to make a move to legislate on and give to Australians in such a mobile and fast-moving society. We are no longer the Federation of 1901 of a two-day draycart drive to Melbourne. Within an hour, you are changing states, you are getting out of jurisdiction and you are getting away with murder. It is important that we send a very national message that the rope is closing, it will not be tolerated and we will keep moving in this direction. I commend the bill to the House. reply-I want to start by thanking members who have spoken today, the member for Ban'ks ( Mr Melham), the member for Dickson( Mr Tony Smith), the member for Maribymong ( Mr Sercombe) and the member for Lindsay (Miss Jackie Kelly), for their valuable contributions. This bilI does raise a number of difficult questions for us as legislators. As the member for Maribymong reminded the committee in the second reading speech, I indicated that it is a bill that is long overdue. At present there is no general Commonwealth law dealing with medical or forensic examination of persons in lawful custody. The state and territory laws on which the Commonwealth currently relies are often unclear and subject to varying and limited safeguards. As the member for Lindsay has pointed out in her concluding remarks, the virtues of uniformity are plain. This bilI has been developed after a most exhaustive process of consultation. I believe that it achieves a right balance between the privacy of the individual and the needs of effective law enforcement. If that puts me at odds with the member for Lindsay who thinks that it favours the offender, then we will have to agree to differ. It does provide a comprehensive scheme for obtaining forensic samples, setting out in clear detail the powers and obligations of police and an exhaustive range of safeguards to protect the rights of individuals, with particular provisions for Aboriginal persons, Torres Strait Islanders, children and incapable persons. Unless a suspect gives his or her informed consent after receiving all of the relevant information, including the right to refuse, no intimate procedure may be performed except by order of a magistrate. To make that order, the magistrate must be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the person",146,Representatives Main Committee
244,Mr Williams (Tangney,"Attomey-General and Minister for Justice) (11.43) a.m.), in3852 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 15 May 1997 committed a relevant offence, that is, the same standard as for arrest. However, if a person is in lawful custody, non-intimate procedures may be carried out by appropriately qualified persons, as ordered by a senior constable. Further safeguards include: time limits for conducting procedures; the right to contact a lawyer and to communicate with him or her in private wherever possible; the right of certain suspects to interview friends; the right to an interpreter when necessary; tape recording of requests to consent and the conduct of procedures, and the provision of full information about the relevant procedure. Most importantly, the bill includes a legislative barrier to the admissibility of evidence which is obtained from forensic procedures which are carried out in breach of the legislation. All procedures must be carried out by appropriately qualified persons. There is a right to have a medical practitioner of choice present during most procedures, and a medical practitioner of the same sex if practicable. There are limitations on the numbers of constables that may be present during the carrying out of a forensic procedure and restriction on the presence of opposite sex constables to cases of necessity. There are also comprehensive requirements for the destruction of forensic material after a conviction is secured or charges dropped. The government is grateful for what might be described as the lack of opposition by the opposition to the bill, although the member for Banks did indicate that the opposition proposed to monitor the debate in order to see whether the bill could be improved during its passage through parliament. That is, of course, legitimate. It would help that if any deficiencies, or alleged deficiencies, are identified, they are made known to us so that the issue can be addressed and an appropriate answer can be given if there is one. The member for Banks raised the issue of certain recommendations of the Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs not being accepted by the government. Among the Senate committee recommendations which were not taken up are some I will mention. Recommendation 1 limits the operation of the bill to offences with a maximum penalty of five years or more. This has not been adopted. The relevant offences tend to have maximum penalties of two to five years, being offences against the person in the main. The most useful application of the procedures would be excluded if it were limited to those with a penalty of five years or more. Reference is made to dental impressions. I think the member for Banks acknowledged that there had been an advance in technology since the original bill was prepared. Evidence before the committee, I am advised, was in fact outdated and came from the mid-1980s. The government has received up-to-date expert advice, which indicates that such evidence, using modem techniques, is both reliable and useful. The third recommendation was that the examination of female breasts should only be in relation to alleged offences of over five years maximum penalty. Similar arguments apply to that as I offered in relation to the non-adoption of the first recommendation. In certain crimes, especially violent or sexual crimes, evidence may be found on any part of the body, and the government saw no more reason to exclude the female breast area, subject to appropriate safeguards, than any other area of the body. Recommendation 9 was to the effect that the suspect definition be confined to persons a constable believes, rather than suspects, on reasonable grounds to have committed a relevant offence. That has not been picked up. That would have had the effect of excluding many people from the protections of the bill. The police could still seek their consent for procedures, Thursday, 15 May 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 3853 as they can for non-suspects, but the protections in the bill would not apply. Several other recommendations, which were not fully accepted, were in fact accepted in part or in spirit or implemented in a somewhat different way. Greater detail on these matters can be found in the government's formal response to the committee's recommendations. The member for Dickson expressed some concern about aspects of the bill relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, particularly the possibly patronising effect or appearance of provisions treating Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders as disadvantaged. He pointed out that this would be the case no matter how well educated or socially competent they may be. He gave an example in relation to the application of the lower two-hour time limit for the procedures in relation to those people. That provision and similar provisions in part 1C of the Crimes Act, relating to pre-charge investigation periods, were inserted following full consultation with Aboriginal organisations and also result from recommendations of the Senate committee. The government was aware of and concerned about the possibly patronising connotations. But those, it appears, were outweighed by the benefits of the provision in the eyes of the affected groups consulted. The member for Maribyrnong expressed some reservations about the reliability of DNA evidence and he raised some questions about databases. The bill does not require a court to admit any forensic evidence and it does not require a jury to give forensic evidence any particular weight. It merely allows forensic evidence to be obtained and leaves the question of admissibility and the question of weight to the judge and to the jury as appropriate. Recent criticisms of DNA evidence are an understandable reaction to the widely held but inaccurate view that DNA matching can always conclusively determine guilt or innocence. In fact, the value of DNA evidence varies from case to case, depending on the quality of the sample at the crime scene, the nature of the tests performed and the distinctiveness of the DNA in question. In some cases DNA evidence will be of little value; in others, it may show a high probability that DNA found at a crime scene is the suspect's DNA. The defence can conduct its own analysis of the defendant's DNA. If it is able to create real uncertainty as to the reliability of DNA evidence on which the prosecution relies, a jury would be unable to find the defendant guilty beyond reasonable doubt. The 1996 Esteal Interim report on the establishment of a national convicted offender database considered comprehensively the international evidence now available in this area and concluded that it is a powerful tool in law enforcement. It has the potential to reduce costs by eliminating suspects at an early stage and focusing the investigation to allow optimal use of investigation resources. Dr Esteal's final report is due to be presented to the Australasian Police Ministers Council meeting in July this year. In relation to databases, the bill does not establish any database, nor does it require any law enforcement agency to create a database, but it does recognise two kinds of existing databases. The first are identification databases, such as fingerprint databases, which contain a description of certain forensic material and the identity of the person from whom it was obtained. This allows police to match forensic material found at the scene of a crime against material in the database to identify suspects. However, as soon as forensic material is required to be destroyed, all information about that material must be removed from the identification database. All other material will be destroyed if proceedings have been unduly delayed, if the suspect is not 3854 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 15 May 1997 convicted or if evidence arising out of the procedure is held to be inadmissible because there was a breach of the bill's requirements. The other type of database that the bill recognises has a quite different purpose. Information about forensic material taken in accordance with the bill may be entered in a statistical database, but only in a form that cannot be used to identify any person. A statistical database of forensic material is a necessity. Much forensic evidence involves comparison with a large sample group. For example, the more DNA records the police have, the more accurately they can state the probability of two samples of DNA having come from the same source. A couple of other matters were raised that I think warrant comment, not because they were critical, but in a sense because they were supportive and raised issues of some significance. In the course of raising questions as to the quality of some evidence, in particular DNA evidence, the member for Maribymong suggested that science should not dominate the process. I think what I have said in relation to DNA evidence in particular should answer that, in that at the broad level science does not under the rules of evidence dominate the process. AndI do not think competent lawyers or courts will allow it to do so. The question of cost does arise, but that is really outside the terms of reference of this particular bill and no doubt will be a matter addressed in other forums, in particular those dealing with legal aid. The member for Lindsay perhaps adopted a slightly different approach to some issues than other speakers. That might not be surprising, given that all the other speakers were male and the member for Lindsay is female. The principle that there should be certainty of identification, a high level of skill in investigation and therefore the probability of greater conviction is important in offering the community both assurance of protection and the fact of protection. Women in particular have a perception that there are great risks in the community. Statistically those risks are in fact quite slight and the perception is of a greater risk than there really is. This is well documented by work done by the Australian Institute of Criminology. The member for Maribymong referred to the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence, the National Police and Research Institute and the Institute of Forensic Science and made the point that there is cooperation between different law enforcement agencies and, in particular, police forces, through these cooperative bodies. That is a very important point to be made. I think we could also add there that the Institute of Criminology, with its Criminology Research Council, similarly operates, in effect, as a cooperative body. There is a great deal of cooperation between the different law enforcement agencies. The existence of the ABCI, for example, enables the possible setting up-to give another example--of a paedophile database. The existence of the National Exchange of Police Information, another cooperative body, was crucial in setting up appropriate uniform procedures for registration and licensing of firearms under the uniform gun laws that have been introduced in the last 12 months. The uniformity of law that would arise if each jurisdiction adopts a bill based on this model, a model developed by the Model Criminal Code Officers Committee, would be undoubted, a point emphasised by the member for Lindsay. The passage of this bill through this parliament will constitute a milestone in moving towards that target. I will hand up a replacement explanatory memorandum. This replaces the original one which Was found to contain some minor errors, such as numbering errors, affecting a few sections, inaccuracies in describing the effect of two provisions and some typographical errors. I commend the bill to the House. Thursday, 15 May 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 3855 Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Bill-by leave-reported to the House without amendments. Second Reading Debate resumed from 26 March, on motion by Mr Miles: That the bill be now read a second time. upon which Mr Latham moved by way of amendment: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House: (1) expresses concern at the failure of the Howard Government, after 12 months in office, to respond to the recommendations of the report of the Joint Select Committee into Certain Family Law Issues entitled 'Child Support Scheme: An Examination of the Operation and Effectiveness of the Scheme'; (2) believes the Government should be concerned about the well-being and welfare of all families: whether they be intact families, separated families, single parent families or serial families; (3) notes with concern the failure to implement some of the report's recommendations has caused parents and their children to suffer needless hardship; (4) believes that there is important and urgent need to improve and strengthen the Child Support Scheme; and (5) considers that much time has been lost and therefore the Government should respond to the recommendations of the report concerned with changing the child support formula as soon as possible and introduce legislation within six months to this effect"". by their very nature complex and technical, and they deal with very emotionally charged issues. The task of the Child Support Agency is, of course, an enormous one. It has responsibility for most areas of child support, from regulation to assessment, to collection of child support and payment to the custodial parents. It must also assess and adjudicate on any request for a variation of child support liability, based either on an estimate of changed circumstances or on any other review grounds contained within the act. There have been a number of problems with the Child Support Act, many of which were identified in the 1994 report of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues. Of course, those of us working in our electorate offices have people coming in daily talking to us about the human consequences of the problems of dealing in this highly vexed area and the act as it now stands. The amendments contained in the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill (No.1) 1996, which is before the committee today, are designed to ensure that the child support system continues to evolve to meet its objectives in the future as best it can. They represent a number of common sense administrative changes which were flagged by the joint select committee that I have just referred to. In particular, the Child Support Act was introduced to address the need for a better, more informed system of ensuring that a parent's child support and child maintenance obligations are assessed accurately and met regularly. The underlying principle of the child support system",147,Representatives Main Committee
245,Mrs Stone (Murray) (12.13 P.m.),"The Child Support Act and associated regulations are3856 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 15 May 1997 is that both parents, custodial and non-custodial, have a joint obligation to provide for the care and upkeep of their children as best they can. When the child support legislation was first introduced, the stated objectives of the cabinet subcommittee on maintenance and child support were that: non-custodial parents share in the cost of supporting their children according to their capacity to pay; adequate support is available to all children not living with both parents; Commonwealth expenditure is limited to the minimum necessary for ensuring that those needs are met; work incentives to participate in the labour force are not impaired; and the overall arrangements are non-intrusive to personal privacy and are simple, flexible and efficient. These principles remain the guiding force in the government's consideration of the child support scheme and any reforms that are necessary. In particular, the final objective is addressed by these amendments being debated today. The Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996 contains three main changes. These changes are to the estimates provisions, the employer withholding provisions and the treatment of child support liabilities by the Family Court. The bill also includes consequential changes to child support legislation to reflect changes made in the Social Security Act 1991, the Family Law Act 1975 and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. These changes are aimed at increasing flexibility for the Child Support Agency and for the parents involved, reducing the level of intrusiveness, and improving certainty and the clarity of the law. Currently, where the Child Support Agency is involved in the assessment of child support, it calculates the amount to be paid based on the non-custodial parent's income from two years ago. This figure is offset against the income of the custodial parent once that income reaches a certain threshold. One of the difficulties with this situation is that a person's economic and employment circumstances can change dramatically within a two-year period. People may find themselves in a situation where the amount of child support that they are paying is much higher than if they were assessed on their current income--or, alternatively, it could be much lower. Currently, to address this problem, the child support system incorporates an estimate procedure. Either parent can apply for a variation of child support payments if they believe that their income in the current year will vary by more than 15 per cent. The reassessment is then backdated to the end of the previous financial year. This process is fraught with practical difficulties. It often means that the custodial parent has to refund to the non-custodial parent money that they have already spent on the care and upkeep of their children. It could have been spent on education, clothing, food, sporting activities or housing. It also may mean that the parent paying child support has to repay much of the amount which would be refunded later in the year when they may not be in a position to do so. So it is very often a lose-lose situation, and it affects not just the parents, but the children. It may cause tensions and stress, as well as economic hardship. The provisions contained in the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill (No.1) 1996 will amend the effect of an income estimate election to make it less likely that a person receiving child support will be asked to repay amounts in the future, and they will make the effect of an income estimate election a much more accurate reflection of a paying parent's capacity to pay. Revised assessments, on the basis of an estimate, will apply only from the date that the estimate is lodged. These amendments allow that a custodial parent will not have to refund money that they have already received but, rather, any overpayment will reduce the amount Thursday, 15 May 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 3857 that the non-custodial parent is required to pay for the remainder of the year. The only exception to this would be when the amount payable, after the readjustment, is actually lower than the amount that has already been paid. Another important change is that non-custodial parents, when unemployed for part of the year, will not have to pay child support. The revised income estimate will be used by the Child Support Agency to reassess the amount of child support payable for that year. These measures, it is important to note, do not actually change the amount of child support that a person is liable to pay. They simply change the way in which any reassessments affect the timing of liabilities and ensure they reflect the person's ability to meet their child support obligations at any given time. These changes therefore address one of the main disadvantages for custodial parents who are having to repay child support that they have received and spent in good faith. It is a significant change for custodial parents, particularly those who may have a variable income. Such amendments are of particular importance for many people in my electorate where we have numbers employed as seasonal workers. It is very difficult for seasonal workers in the food producing, fruit picking and transport sector-which is very subject to seasonality-to accurately forecast what their income will be from one year to the next. Seasonal workers are often given short notice as to extension of their employment-extra overtime in the factory, some night work. Due to the uncharacteristically good season, they might find themselves with many more weeks of work than they had expected, at a higher pay. Many of these people are anxious to meet their child support obligations, as are all parents. Ensuring that they do not accumulate large arrears debts is also a major concern for them. Under the current system, if they lodge an estimate at the time their income is about to increase, the increased amount of child support is backdated to the end of the financial year. This can then be a disincentive for additional work. While parents are prepared to pay additional child support when their circumstances improve, being hit immediately with an arrears debt and even further increased payments is often unfair, and is certainly felt as unfair. to do the right thing, especially in my area. The amendments to ensure that estimates only operate from the date they are lodged will help to alleviate their situation and ensure that the child support assessments reflect the non-custodial parent's current financial position. The Child Support Agency can collect child support in a number of ways. Another option for collection is that the paying parent pays the amount directly to the Child Support Agency. There is also the possibility for parents to reach a private arrangement between themselves as to the amount and payment of child support. In these cases, the support agency will not intervene unless the custodial parent has applied for a means tested social security benefit, for example, a supporting mother's pension or disability support pension. In these cases, the Child Support Agency must make a child support assessment. The evidence given to the 1994 Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues found that approximately one-third of separated parents are clients of the Child Support Agency, while the rest have made private child support agreements. The Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill (No.1) 1996 seeks to amend the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988 to allow a payer of child support to make payments directly to the child support registrar in certain circumstances. Obviously, the main criteria will be that the registrar is",151,Representatives Main Committee
246,Mr Lieberman,Maybe some parents; some not.,153,Representatives Main Committee
247,Mrs Stone,"Some parents indeed! Some do not, but many parents are very concerned3858 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 15 May 1997 satisfied that the person will meet their child support obligations. These are simple administrative measures, but they have some very important effects. At present, the Child Support Agency is often seen as invading the privacy of a noncustodial parent when it takes employer withholding action. Even though that parent might have the very best intentions towards their family, they still feel a great sense of being accused of wrongdoing and wrong intent. These changes will reduce the intrusive nature of the child support collection process in many cases. The changes also provide greater flexibility in the way the child support payments are collected, which we expect will substantially reduce administrative costs. The changes will also reduce the compliance costs placed on employers who are directed to withhold child support payments, as more people will now be allowed to pay directly to the Child Support Agency if these amendments are passed. Such changes are especially important given the government's commitment to reducing paperwork and the costs for small businesses. While it may be relatively easy for large employers to meet their withholding obligations under the child support system, it is a further burden on small employers, especially when in many cases it is not necessary for them to be involved at all. This is particularly a problem where you have family members-perhaps the family of the custodial parent-employing the non-custodial parent. Matters of privacy can become very important. In having to be directly involved in maintenance payments, there can be a lot of inter-family stress. It is important to ensure that children are never disadvantaged in the event that child support is not paid on time, or at all. The child support register will maintain the primary responsibility to ensure the collection of child support in a timely manner. This, of course, is as it should be. The amendments provide for strict safeguards in the event of default. If a person elects to pay directly to the Child Support Agency and then defaults in payment, there are a number of important safeguards in place which are to ensure that the children are not disadvantaged by the failure of non-custodial parents to meet their child support obligations. Ifa person does default, the CSA can require that child support be withheld by a person's employer in the future and a payer will not be able to make another election for direct payment for six months. In most cases, payers who default after choosing to pay directly to the registrar, will have strictly limited future access to this provision. Where a person applies for direct payment to the registrar and this application is refused-presumably on the basis of a history of defaultthis person will not be able to apply for direct payment again for two months. These amendments reflect recommendations 55 and 57 of the joint select committee report and remove the situation where, under section 43 of the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act, the child support registrar is required, as far as practicable, to collect child support from the wages of the employed, liable parents. I understand that the practice of the Child Support Agency, in compliance with this legislation, is that, as soon as they become, or are made aware, of the employer of a noncustodial parent, they take action to commence employer withholding. Often the first notification that the person has that their salary is being withheld to meet their child support obligations is when they receive a reduced pay packet, or their employer advises them of the notice that they have received to make these deductions. That is hardly fair and, as I said Thursday, 15 May 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 3859 before, can lead to very substantially exacerbated tensions between the parents of the child. In this case, of course, the child suffers as much as the parents. Evidence presented by the Child Support Agency to the joint select committee indicated that there had been an improved level of voluntary compliance. For example, it was reported that 56 per cent of all child support liabilities registered under the scheme were paid on time and that almost half of these were paid without the use of automatic withholding. It is important that parents are given the opportunity, where appropriate, to pay their child support voluntarily, and these amendments help to make that happen. This bill will also amend the Family Law Act. The amendments will mean that the court can take child support liability into account when ruling on property and spousal maintenance issues, even where a child support assessment has not been issued. This will help to ensure that property settlements more accurately reflect the true situation of both the parties and take into account the impact that future child support liabilities may have upon the non-custodial parent's financial situation. It is clearly desirable in family law matters that parties reach agreement on pivotal issues such as child support. However, the current arrangements mean that parties must apply for a child support assessment-even where they wish to make private arrangements-before the court can take into account those commitments when making orders regarding property or spousal maintenance. These amendments reflect the position that all parents should be treated in the same manner, and we support that strongly. I support the changes proposed today as practical and sensible amendments to the child support legislation. The business of taking care of children in a situation of separated parents is one that the state must overview-in this case the nation-but we must also give parents the greatest possible chance to continue to live in harmony so that their harmonious relationships offer the best possible chance of parenting to their children. In particular, I should also add that we believe that these amendments are supported by both sides of the House and we believe that they have had a strong investigation by both parties in previous times as joint select committees have worked through the issues. In particular, these amendments give parents dignity and a greater chance to continue cooperative relationships. I therefore commend the bill to the Main Committee. indicated, there are few areas of government responsibility that raise emotions more than matters pertaining to family law. Certainly, since its introduction, the Child Support Act has created a lot of angst within the Australian community. It is an act that is in need of reform, there is no doubt about that. Before going on to those matters, however, I think it is important to recognise that the system we have today is much better than the system we had previously. The introduction of the Child Support Act was probably the biggest shake-up in terms of family law in this country since the introduction of the Family Law Act of 1975. It was an important initiative, one which has delivered to this country a much better system than we had previously. It addressed the high cost of applying for maintenance before the courts in this country. We must remember that, before the introduction of the scheme, only about 26 per cent of sole parents were in receipt of some form of maintenance from the non-custodial parent. It addressed the problem of the lack of indexing of the commitments of non-custodial parents as determined by courts of the land.",153,Representatives Main Committee
248,Mr Fitzgibbon (Hunter) 02.30 P.m.),"As the member for Murray( Mrs Stone) has3860 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 15 May 1997 It overcame the difficulties inherent in enforcing court orders. We can now rely upon the tax system and the powers of the Child Support Agency to ensure that non-custodial parents in this country make their contribution, quite rightly, to the children they have fathered or mothered. The previous situation was unacceptable. We had a situation in this country where it was the taxpayer generally, through the provision of the sole parents pension, that was carrying the maximum weight of the cost of raising these children, rather than the responsibility being sheeted home to the person responsible for fathering or mothering the child, that person no longer having contact. The scheme was a very important initiative and I think that, as a matter of principle, it enjoys the support of both sides of this parliament. But it is desperately in need of reform. That is why today I am supporting in this place the amendments put forward by the member for Werriwa( Mr Latham). This bill, while I welcome its initiatives and while I am happy to say that it will go some way towards addressing some of the inadequacies of the scheme, does not go far enough. It fails rather poorly to pick up the recommendations of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues. I know that a number of those on the other side will say that the former Labor government failed to put them into practice, but we were getting there. Many of them were introduced or picked up, and the reform process was continuing. I always remind myself, as a member of this place, to remember that one day-fingers crossed-I may be in government. I remind myself to be very careful about the things I say in this place, because they do have a habit of coming back to bite us. In my first 12 months in this place I have watched with great interest the transformation of many of those on the other side as they have felt their way into government. The Child Support Agency was a great ogre in the eyes of many on the other side when they were in opposition. Now, 14 months into this government, what we see is this Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill (No.1) 1996, which does very little indeed to address the inadequacies of the system. I point that out to members on the other side with some great pleasure. Government members interjecting Mr Deputy Speaker, that the success of the scheme was originally underestimated. No-one ever dreamed that the success of the child support scheme would be so large. It was originally under-administered; not enough money was going into the scheme to enable those very hard working members of that area of government to properly administer the scheme. That is slowly being addressed. The former Labor government picked up many of the recommendations of the joint select committee, and that process was ongoing. Having heard the whining from the other side when they were in opposition, this is their attempt at fixing up the child support scheme. They are making a few very minor changes which I welcome, as I said, but they are going to do very little to address the problems faced by both custodial and non-custodial parents in this country. I note that, very subtly, many of them have raised concerns that they have on a wider basis. They have all given examples of how they continue to experience problems with the system, particularly with respect to non-custodial parents, and yet their bill before the House today does very little to address those problems-and there are plenty of problems. It is very dangerous for a male member of this place to do so, but I have seen too many cases where non-custodial males are being absolutely devastated by this scheme-not to say",155,Representatives Main Committee
249,Mr Fitzgibbon,"My team introduced the scheme in the first place. You Will remember,Thursday, 15 May 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 3861 that I think the pendulum has swung too far the other way. It was the case that, prior to the introduction of the scheme, the non-custodial males were getting away with murder. They were being carried by the Australian taxpayer. Now, instead of the pendulum swinging back to the centre, I think it has gone a little too far the other way. Now there are too many male, noncustodial parents out there with problems-and, indeed, female, non-custodial parents as well. AlthoughI have not come across them, I am sure they are out there. I know how dangerous it is to say this because I know that whenever someone prefaces a racial remark by saying, 'But, let me say, I am not a racist,' I immediately come to the conclusion that they are. My preface in signalling my concerns about non-custodial parents is not going to help me much, but I felt an obligation to say it. I also feel an obligation to say that the system is acting as a disincentive to many workers because, over time, it is not a proposition to them anymore; it is not worth their while. The system is leaving many non-custodial parents with no opportunity to start again. It is leaving them without the financial means to start life again. And, of course, those financial strains also flow on to strains on the relationship with their second partners and, subsequently, this can lead to a second breakdown and another child support liability-and it goes on and on. For the non-custodial parent, the whole thing can be disastrous. The scheme does not take into account a child's income. Theoretically, if I separated from my wife, I could have a 17-year-old child earning $80,000 a year and still have a liability to my ex-wife. It does not take into account the income of the new partner of the custodial parent: if I had an ex-wife, she could be living with or be remarried to someone earning $1 million a year and yet my liability to my children would not change. Obviously, in those situations, my commitment should remain. I should always have a liability to my children-and I am pretty confident that most non-custodial parents believe they should have, too-but common sense must prevail. With the introduction of the actual means test used to assess one's eligibility for Austudy, we now take into account much more the direct income stream of the parents involved. We look at a few other functions as well, including their expenditure patterns and other liabilities they might have as a family. It would make a lot of sense to apply those same principles to the child support legislation because, for example, it does not now take into account the cost incurred by the non-custodial parent at those times when he or she enjoys the company of the children. When you are estranged from your children, you want to give them the very best during those short periods you have with them. You want to treat them; you want to take them out; you want to take them to the show, and you want to buy them good things. Under the child support scheme, your liability does not take into account the cost involved. SoI think there is some scope for some big changes there. Probably the more important point to make is that we in this place should be talking about family law generally rather than restricting ourselves to amendments to the child support scheme. For example-just to quote one case-I have a very distressed constituent who has a child support liability to, I think, six children. He is a coal miner and therefore enjoys a pretty reasonable income. But his liability to child support is very large, as you can imagine. He is not complaining about that; he pays almost happily. What he is concerned about is the welfare of his children. When the custody was being determined, while his ex-wife enjoyed the benefits of the support of legal aid, he did not. He was forced to represent himself before the Family Court and his child support liability was so large that he was left with no money 3862 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 15 May 1997 with which to engage a solicitor. In any case, because he was the male in the relationship, his chances of success in terms of his attempts to gain custody of the children were minuscule. The ex-wife was granted custody and now he has an ongoing concern about the welfare of those children. We all have cases come into our office regularly, and often they are very sad cases. But we always treat them very carefully because we know that there are always two sides of the story. But over time, I have done the dangerous thing and come to acceptof advice. It is so true. But I have come to lean towards the man's side of the story. I have become concerned about the children as well, because of some of the incidences that he relates to me. As a member of parliament, I am in no place to make a judgment about these matters and, indeed, the Department of Community Services in New South Wales is equally concerned. Of course, they cannot move until the situation is absolutely drastic. So where does my constituent tum? He cannot go back to the courts to appeal the custody decision because he has no money, mainly because of his child support liability. So he is forced to sit back and wear the current Family Law Act and many of the inequities contained within it. So we cannot just take the child support legislation on its own and pretend that we are going to seriously address the family law issues facing this nation. This is a start and I welcome it. As I said, the recommendations contained within it are helpful and will address many of the inequities, particularly those that are introduced when an overpayment, or an underpayment, is raised. I think this is a much more sensible way of addressing those problems. But, as the member for Werriwa points out in his amendment, this bill reflects the absolute lack of commitment on the part of the government to address the real issues contained within the child support legislation. It displays absolutely their unwillingness, now that they are in government, to address the real issues in terms of family law and, while we are not denying the bill a second reading, of course, I think that it is important to highlight that fact. I commend the amendments of the member for Werriwa to the House. in the electorate of Dunkley, across all income ranges and family types. In every suburb throughout the electorate people are experiencing contact with the Child Support Agency. The marriage and relationship education courses in Frankston and other Peninsula locations are offering people improved encouragement so that they do not find themselves in the situation of having to separate from their children and from their partners, and basically to help them get on with the rest of their lives. The Child Support Agency is an important part of the institutional framework that seeks to ensure that the children of discontinued relationships continue to be cared for and develop with the support of both parents, where their parents move on to pursue separate lives. WhatI like about this child support legislation is that it seeks to further humanise this institutional framework with changes that ensure that the legal and administrative arrangements can take account of real people's lives and their individual circumstances. The bill before this committee will not be the last word on changes to the child support scheme or family law. It is a partial response to some of the recommendations from the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues, whose November 1994 report has been well documented. It is the",156,Representatives Main Committee

It is interesting to look at some of the remarks members opposite are making, and particularly the amendments offered by the member for Werriwa( Mr Latham). Again, there was very little in the way of constructive contribution to addressing these significant problems but more evidence that Labor is happy to sit back, chant from the sidelines, but leave it to the coalition parties to make some useful changes to this situation. As a member elected in 1996, I am well aware that this inquiry recei ved 6,197 submissions, the highest ever for any parliamentary committee in our country. I remind the House that noncustodial parents made 3,292 submissions, or 53 per cent of the submissions, and custodial parents 32 per cent. Further changes are required to respond fairly and effectively to the many issues raised during the inquiry and since then, and I am committed to pursuing them. The Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996 is a start. Today's bill addresses three areas. It aims to make income estimate elections notified by parents paying child support a more accurate reflection of their ability to pay. So when a payer's income drops more than 15 per cent, and they lodge an income election, their future liability will be reduced, rather than the complicated and annoying system that operates at present. This will lessen the chances of parents who receive child support already spending the money but not being aware that the paying parents income election has changed the amount of moneys effectively due. Fewer payees will be required to repay overpaid amounts of child support, and payers who are unemployed for part of the year will not be required to pay child support. The child support system will be better able to accommodate changing circumstances of the non-custodial parents. As I was saying, this change will help to avoid the hardship created when the agency seeks to recover payments from custodial parents who may well have already spent the money on raising the children. Secondly, the bill seeks to reduce the big brother nature of the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988 where it is unnecessary. The amendment allows child support payers with a good record to make payments directly to registrars rather than going through employers. Importantly, a person must have a good payment record before he or she can make payments in this way. If a default occurs, payers will not be able to remit moneys directly to the registrar for another six months. In the meantime, they will have to revert to garnishee orders through their employer as a penalty. Finally, the Family Law Act is to be amended to enable people voluntarily paying child support to have that taken into account when the Family Court is making a property or spouse maintenance order. No longer will court orders fail to reflect the true circumstances of a person already paying child support. This measure will remove the current disincentive for parents of goodwill towards each other after a separation who have amicably entered into an arrangement for a child's care only to have these private arrangements ignored when the Family Court makes orders. I support any measure that enhances the opportunity and likelihood for private and satisfactory agreements to be entered into. I endorse the comments of the Attorney-General who, in this House on December4 1996, said: Most people ... would prefer to deal with the whole process of separation and associated agreements over children, property and maintenance outside the court environment. 3864 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 15 May 1997 As with most members, my office receives case after case of constituents' concerns regarding child support and family law. I would just like to compliment all the staff in electorate offices from all sides of the House who have to deal with these cases. They are often very emotional, very highly charged and very difficult to deal with, and I extend congratulations and best wishes to the staff of the Child Support Agency who I suspect experience similar exchanges with people involved with the system. I want to point to a couple of examples. They highlight how the difficulty with the Child Support Agency is not typically skewed to one party, whether it is a matter of gender or custodial responsibilities. I have a constituent in Mornington who says it is all too easy for custodial parents to deny access, to make false accusations and have them acted upon through intervention orders. My constituent says there is no accountability and there is no deterrent against vexatious accusations that are costly to defend. He asserts that people can perjure themselves in the Family Court with apparent immunity. If you do not have the means to be able to take that matter further, then simply your access to your family members is curtailed because of those accusations. I have a female constituent in Karingal who has equally valid concerns. Her case is more complicated-it dates back almost a decade. Some ambiguous, badly drafted order from the Family Court has been interpreted by the Child Support Agency in such a way that she is now faced with having to refund over $3,000 of payments. I doubt, quite sincerely, that there has been an overpayment at all. It again shows the difficulty that many people experience with their interaction between the Family Court and the Child Support Agency. When we turned to the Family Court for assistance it was unable to access any records to shed any light on this case. Now this person has the difficulty of not only raising the children but also having the fear of the $3,000 hanging over them, which the Child Support Agency asserts-and I greatly doubt-needs to be refunded. The performance of the Child Support Agency has improved; I will not go over that, but it is an encouraging sign. This is the first step and there is more work to be done. I cannot see how people can expect to look for better behaviour from people who have gone through a difficult, emotional, and often very financially significant, experience such as a separation, if the system is not structured to encourage it. Far too many non-custodial parents come into my office, despairing at the difficulty they are having in re-establishing their lives. They have moved on to new relationships, they may even have new families, but because of some of the arrangements that are in place at present they find it very difficult to make a fresh start. They point to the way that entitlements and payments are calculated and that the circumstances of the other former partner are not taken into account in the same way in which their own are. The capacity of both former parents to contribute to the raising of the child does not seem to be equally investigated. At the end of the day that is the key; it is what is in the best interests of the child. Far too many people come into my office--excuse me if these terms are unparliamentaryand elect to take the 'stuff it' option. It is just too much for them. They wonder why they are working very hard to try and re-establish their lives and to make an appropriate contribution to the care of children from former relationships, only to find that they just cannot make ends meet. One partner explained to me how, upon separation, all the family furniture and the family house was provided to the parent who was going to continue the primary custodial duty. Thursday, 15 May 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 3865 That person tries to generate additional income through overtime so that the fruit boxes that are used as chairs in the lounge room can be replaced. But every time that extra effort is made, more of the resources go out of that person's pocket into the custodial person's pocket, in the non-custodial person's eyes without due cause. That person is saying, 'Hang on, the capacity to raise the children is something that we share; it's a responsibility we both have to bear, and as our lives move on, surely the circumstances of both of the original parents should playa larger role in calculating the child support payments.' I was somewhat disappointed that some very constructive measures that the subcommittee of government backbenchers put to the government were not incorporated in the budget. Some members on the other side might find that as an opportunity to have a go at us. But what I am suggesting to you is that work is going on; we understand that there are problems here. I also understand and accept the government's position that some well-intended, wellresearched ideas do need to be carefully looked at by government. But my message to the government is that we have not gone away, that those concerns remain, and our efforts to address them will continue. The great disappointment in the motion of the member for Werriwa and the contribution of the member for Hunter( Mr Fitzgibbon) is that they were simply carping away, saying there were issues that have not been resolvedthat is right; we understand that-just as the more contentious recommendations in the joint standing committee's report were left on the shelf by the previous Labor government. There is no gain in their contributions. There are families out there battling to make ends meet and that contribution is absolutely useless to the task that is before us. I encourage all those members opposite who have a contribution to make, to make it in a positive way. These are real people's lives and they are doing it pretty hard out there. In sticking with the theme of encouraging people to do the right thing, the member for Moreton( Mr Hardgrave) outlined, in his contribution, some of the ideas that we have been working through. These include: the way entitlements are calculated; how income is treated; what level of payment should be made once someone gets to 2Y2 times the average weekly earnings; how the custodial parents' circumstances change and how they should be addressed; the amount of exempt income so that people can get on with their lives; and the cost of raising children. If the task of raising the child is beyond the means of the two partners, we then have to look at whether our family payments system is supporting the raising of that child. Payments for child support should represent one of the first obligations all non-custodial parents have. If, after making those payments, their circumstances leave them in such an impoverished state that they are not able to carryon with their own lives, and perhaps the raising of other children that have come about from a subsequent relationship, we should take that into account. That costs money. We have to argue our case well and we are endeavouring to do that. I respect the government's role in making sure we are not doing anything too hasty that is not going to improve the situation. The issue about how reviews are conducted also troubles me. From the research I have done, the approach of the Child Support Agency seems to vary from state to state. I wonder whether it is not time to introduce the same sort of statement of principles you see operating in the Department of Veterans' Affairs so that all cases are dealt with equitably. In a state such as mine, a review application for child support payments far too often sees arrears wiped off. The fact is that it is money that the custodial parents would and should have had in their pockets to help with the raising of the child but it is wiped off. I understand that 3866 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 15 May 1997 there is a totally different practice in Queensland. That is unacceptable. They are all Australians. They are all facing similar dilemmas and they should all be treated reasonably equitably. I also believe there is an argument that says the question of visitation to children should be linked with people's performance in honouring their child support obligations. For people who cannot see their way clear to honour those obligations, I think there is an argument that says that the benefits and the joy of being involved with the development of your child should be curtailed. People say that that is harsh and unfair but, at the end of the day, it is about making sure the resources are available for the education, learning, training, growth, feeding, clothing and housing of the young child. If people cannot see their way clear to honour those responsibilities, I wonder whether they should be able to have as active a part in the rearing of that child. But there is a flip side to that for those non-custodial parents who are paying their way, and who find themselves in a situation where the custodial parent decides to move to Queensland with the child, which is often the case in the sunny Mornington Peninsula-sadly, some do not appreciate the beauty of our environment. I try to understand what it would be like if, heaven forbid, my relationship broke down and I was not able to have a role in the development of my child. I would consider that an enormous loss. I would want the opportunity to make a contribution in the development of something that I have played a part in creating so that needs to be weighed into the equation. If that means that the cost of gaining access to the child has to be somehow reflected in the payments, so be it. If that means that the non-custodial parent has to look at those visitation rights, and if it means that the Family Court and the Child Support Agency have to consider how they can more effectively interact so that the two sets of issues mesh more comfortably, then we should also be looking at that. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. Leave granted; debate adjourned.
