Sir Johnquick When The Return Showing The Cost Of Federal Printing, Which Was'ordered About Three Months Ago, Will Be Presented To The House ? I Should Like To Know The Cause Of This Ex","traordinary delay T received returns from most of the States, but the information from South Australia was in such a form as to be useless, and we bave again applied for it in a different shape. This has not yet been received, but I hope that the return will be completed at an early date. I shall probably be able to inform the honourable member definitely on Tuesday. Minister representing the Minister for Defence whether, when he is making inquiries into the deplorable state of affairs which is reported to have existed on the troopship Drayton Orange, he will extend his investigation into the conditions which prevailed upon the troopship, which arrived here previously. I am advised that very similar conditions existed on board that vessel, although, fortunately, they were not attended with the same fatal results as in the case of the Drayton Grange. Sir WILLIAM LYNE I am perfectly willing to make inquiries as desired. I may inform honourable members that I have received information by telephone this morning that the statements made with reference to the Drayton Grange are altogether exaggerated The report of the investigating officers will be in my hands within an hour. Sir. JOHN QUICK asked the Minister for Trade and Customs, upon notice1. Whether it is true that the Collector of Customs in Melbourne has impounded and refused to deliver to the agent of the importer certain American Dunlop bicycle tyres, unless and until a royalty of 2s. 6<L per tyre, alleged to be due, is paid to the.Dunlop Tyre Company, of Melbourne ? If so, uuder what circumstance has the Collector nf Customs constituted himself the representative and protector of patent rights ? 2. What objection is there to patentees enforcing their own rights, if any, in the ordinary honourable and learned member's questions I desire to know are as follow :1. This was a matter which arose under the local Trade Marks Act 1889, which is not admin, istered by the 1'ederal Government, though executed by Customs officers. The State collector of Victoria appears to have acted in pursuance of the practice established before federation', We have which was to detain the.goods if apparently imported in violation of the Trade Marks Act, and to notify the owner of the trade mark. This was done in this case, and some agreement was made between the importer and the owner of the. trade mark which enabled the goods to be delivered after a few days' detention. -2. There is no objection to any patentee or owner of a trade mark enforcing any rights in an ordinary court, and the Government recognise the desirability of early federal legislation in reference both to patents and trade marks.",14,Setup

10,Mr Thomson,"There need be no fearcheap fodders equal to requirements in times of drought. But growers will never willingly produce quantities equal to requirements when there is serious drought in other portions of Australia. We do not wish to encourage them to do so, because that would only lead to heavy losses in good seasons. The demands caused by drought are exceptional, and usually there is not a sufficiency of supplies; but we can surely give tlie opportunity by not imposing these duties-which , it must be remembered, are of no benefit in times of' plenty-to save sheepj cattle, and dairy herds. The removal of a duty of 25 per cent.,' and on some lines of fodder 2s. per central, is equivalent to 100 per cent., and would at least enable 25 per cent, more of stock to be saved ; and the abolition of a duty of 100 per cent, would, of course, mean a much greater saving. In times of drought those who are fortunate enough to have fodder would make handsome profits. Sir WILLIAM McMILLAN man, but not the farmer. not parted with his stock, he would make a profit. We know that usually it is the middleman who benefits, but for present purposes we may assume that the profit would be made by the farmer. In times of plenty the farmer would not benefit from the duty owing to the great internal competition, and in times of drought he would under any circumstances get a profit, though perhaps not so much as he would if there were a duty. In any case, however, while others were being ruined the farmer would prosper. The freight on this class of produce amounts to 25 per cent, to 50 per cent., and that is as much protection as has been asked for in connection with some of the largest industries in Victoria, and ought.to be sufficient. This, of course, is a final appeal on this question. We have appealed frequently to PharaohI think the Minister for Trade and Customs well represents that long-gone gentleman. The Minister hardens his . heart and, I suppose, will continue to do so ; but it is only right for those who represent suffering States to place the facts before the Government and the committee. I anticipate, of course, that we shall not be able to soften the Minister, and all I hope is that the Senate will stand its ground in connection with these duties. If the Senate does so it will clo more for the best interests of Australia than can the Ministry by their refusal to dispense with the imposts. MrA . M c LEAN (Gippsland) -Whil e I clo not always agree witli the views of the honourable member for North Sydney, I can say that there are few Members of this Parliament for whose judgment I have more respect. To whatever views the honourable meniber may give expression, we all give him credit for being thoroughly sincere. But the honourable member was hardly fair to the honourable member for Moira: When the latter gentleman pointed out last night that the pastoralists had passed through a severe drought in 1897, he did not suggest for one moment that that fact made them better qualified to endure the present losses. The honourable member for Moira made it . very plain, I think, that the experience gained during the previous drought should have taught a lesson, by means qf which much of the unfortunate suffering being experienced at the present time might have The middlebeen averted. If the farmer had There has been no rain in parts since 1897. MrA . McLEAN -Instances were given in which pastoralists had actually grown fodder of the kind, but instead of storing it, they preferred to sell it . Mr F. E. McLEAN -Thos e were iso lated instances. MrA . McLEAN -The honourable member for Moira pointed out that the pastoralists were now buying back this fodder for double the price at which they themselves sold it . No eloquence is necessary to show the consequences of the drought. The facts come home to each of us, and every rightthinking person must sympathize deeply with the unfortunate people who are immediately concerned. The consequences of the pastoralists' losses fall upon the whole of the community : and we, as a Federal Parliament, should deal with this question in the way that will be best in the interests of the sufferers and the people of tlie Commonwealth. It is not fair or right to use this unfortunate drought as the basis of an appeal to the sympathies of the people, in order to bring about by indirect means what cannot be obtained on its merits. It is not the relief of the pastoralist, through the abolition of the duty, that is sought by the amendment; the object is to obtain a littl e modicum of free-trade which could not otherwise be hoped for.",16,Customs Tartjpt Bill

McLEAN -Farmers, on the faith some way. of the fiscal policy in several of the States, went to great expense in sowing crops and about the spirit of the Constitution 1 making provision for bad seasons ; and the amendment will deprive those men of the benefits of their forethought. And who will gain by the abolition of the duties? Not only the pastoralists but the whole of the larg6 consumers in the cities of the Commonwealth, who can well afford to pay reasonable prices to the farmer. It is the people of the cities who will get 'nine-tenths or, at any rate, five-sixths of the benefit, because they consume more largely than do the few pastoralists M3' sympathy with the pastoralists cannot be doubted. I have been connected with the industry all my life, and I have not only a large number of friends, but some near relatives, who are at present suffering from the drought. My business as a stock and station agent depends upon the pastoral industry, but at the same time. I cannot shut my eyes to the farming interests, which are entitled to just as much consideration. farmers are suffering more than any one any part of the world, and make a free gift of else from the drought, and are paying £ 2 a it. day for feed.

If they get a remission of the duty they pay they have nothing to complain of. Sir way the honourable member reads the Constitution 1 MrA .

Usually under such circumstances he would be able to see that the simplest way of doing what he requires would be through the Governments of the various States. the present time only, but for the future as well. MrA . McLEAN -That is a proof of what I say. I maintain-and I know it for a fact, because I have seen the effects of such a policy in Victoria-that if these duties are abolished a large number of people will, be prevented from making provision against drought, because, instead of being self-reliant and depending upon their own resources, they will be induced to depend upon foreign supplies for the relief of their necessities. That is a weak and childish policy to pursue. sorry to see Australia, which has perhaps agricultural resources as large as those of any country under the sun, stop ploughing the land and producing, and depend upon the industry of more enterprising and energetic people in other parts of the world to supply its wants, and come to its relief in the hour cf need. My honourable friend the member for North Sydney, in his very plausible and able way-h e puts his case so well that, if persons were not thoroughly conversant with the subject, they would be liable to be misled-pointe d out that protection could not benefit the farmer, because in times of scarcity his resources are not equal to the demands of the continent. fodder. MrA . M c LEAN in times of plenty a duty will not benefit the farmer, because he produces more than the Commonwealtli can consume. When we produce in excess of our requirements we export. That is what we have endeavoured to impress upon honourable members opposite, and what they have refused to understand. We have tried to show them that when we produce more should be very sorry than we can consume, a duty is not a tax or a burden in any shape or form, because internal competition regulates the price. My honourable friend by own argument admitted' that this morning. He forgot that he was the object is giving away his previous contention. He admitted that when the farmers produce My honourable friend sufficient to supply the whole of our own requirements and leave a surplus for export the duty cannot injure the public. when we over-produce prices are regulated by foreign markets. MrA . McLEAN -Then why talk about a tax on the consumer 1 I fail to see that there is any tax upon the consumer. country gets to the exporting standard. MrA . M c LEAN It is so in regard to any commodity. Victoria at the present time, in many lines of production-suc h as boots and shoes-ha s overtaken the local demand, and is exporting. Yet my honourable friend persists in saying that a duty which is dormant upon the statute-book is a tax upon the people who use the commodities affected. What such a duty as this does is to secure the home market for our I should be own farmers. It assures tbe farmers that if they have sufficient enterprise and energy to sow their lands and cultivate products they will at any rate have a market to the extent of our own requirements. Buti f they have to face the competition of the outside world, they will not have that assurance. Before duties were imposed in the interests of the agriculturists in Victoria, we had to import nearly everything the farmer produces. We possessed an excellent soil and climate, admirably suited for the production of agricultural commodities, but the farmers would not grow them, because they did not care to compete with the outside producer. They were afraid that perhaps there would be a glut of products in some adjacent place, which would pull down prices below the rate at which it would pay to produce them. But within a few years It is quite true that after the imposition of duties in the interests of the farmers we were producing largely",18,William Mcmillan Is That The Being A Bigoted Free Trader Himself Wants

31,The Chairman,"It has been myitems, and I fchink the arrangement is an excellent one to save time. 1 referred to the experience of farmers in Victoria some years ago only to show honourable members that, in the light of our past experience, we were justified in assuming that if the duty were abolished the farmers would not grow sufficient fodder to make provision for future dry seasons. Perhapsi u five years out of six the farmer derives no actual benefit from protection, because we produce sufficient for our own consumption. It is in years of drought, when our own production is slightly below our requirements, and when he has to compete to some extent against outside competitors, that he obtains a benefit from it . My honourable friends opposite do not object to protection, provided that it does not increase by one penny the price of the article taxed,' and as long as it will induce the farmer to grow sufficient to keep produce cheap to the consuming public. But the very moment the farmer is likely to obtain any benefit by reason of higher prices,' they advocate the abolition of the duty and unrestricted competition on the part of the outside world. Nothing could be more unfair o r unjust than to enter into a deliberate compact with the producers of the Commonwealth to put an Act ou the statute-book securing the local market to them up to a certain limit specified in that Act, and then to abolish the duties the moment they are likely to obtain any benefit. Mr F. E. McLEAN -To what Act does the honourable member refer ? MrA . McLEAN -To the existing State Acts protecting the productions of the farmers in the protected States. Those Acts have been confirmed by'this branch of the Legislature of the Commonwealth, and on the faith of them our farmers have been cultivating their lands. The cry for the remission of these duties does not come from most of the States iu which the farmers have been protected. that they have not experienced a drought. MrA . M c LEAN knows that in all the States there are some areas which even in years of drought are exempt from the severity of the visitation. During any dry season that we have experienced, the farmers in New South Wales could have produced sufficient for local requirements if they had had received sufficient encouragement. But, like the Victorian farmers prior to the imposition of protective duties here, they did not feel justified in entering upon the work. They knew that in years of plenty prices would naturally be low, and if they thought that in the years of drought and scarcity they would obtain no better returns for their small supplies, they would not be so foolish as to enter upon these undertakings. What is demanded can be done, and done much more effectively, through the States Governments, and we contend they are the proper authorities to deal with this matter. Therefore I hope that honourable members, before casting a vote against the farmers, will consider the injustice of depriving them of the slightly increased prices obtainable at the present time for their produce. Those prices are not very excessive in the various centres of population, although no doubt they are materially increased, owing to the cost of carriage and other charges, by the time that the produce reaches the unfortunate pastoralists infcheinterior. We have known prices to be infinitely higher. I have seen £ 1 a bushel paid for wheat. has known wheat to be imported when it . was not available here. MrA . McLEAN -The honourable member for North Sydney wishes to see it imported once more. I do not. I do not know of an industiy which is so eminently suited to our conditions as is the production of wheat.

36,Mr Joseph Cook,"How can the farmerthose whioh surround him. I shall now state what he is not prepared to do. Supposing that we had a year of drought, in 'which the yield was, perhaps, 50 per cent, less than partial both to the unfortunate squatter usual, and that New Zealand, the Argentine, or California, with an exceptionally good season, had considerably above a normal yield, their surplus would be sold at whatever price could be got. That is the competition which the farmer is not prepared to meet. says let them starve here, rather than that they should take that surplus t MrA . M c LEAN those who contend that universal protection is necessarily good. There are conditions in which free-trade is preferable to protection, and conditions in which protection is preferable to free-trade. There are industries which are not so suited to our conditions as to justify a policy of protection, while there are other industries which are well suited to our conditions of life, to our soil, and to our climate, and which, I think,' it is worthwhile to protect, if protection secures a permanent and .uniform reduction in price, except in abnormal seasons. This is an industry which we all admit to be admirably suited to our conditions, and I submit that for the sake of getting an ample supply in five seasons out of six, it is worthwhile to pay a little more for the product during the sixth season, in order to secure TO the consuming public the benefit of uniformly moderate prices. While I am sure it is the earnest desire of every honourable member, no matter on which side he sits, to afford relief in the best possible way to people who are suffering from drought, I hold that to reduce the cost of fodder to the large consumers in the various cities of the Commonwealth, at the expense of the farmer who was induced on the faith of an Act of Parliament to cultivate his land, is not a fair or just way to give that relief The fair way is to give the relief directly to the people who are suffering from the effects of the drought. I hope tliat honourable members will give due consideration to the two points I have submitted. I contend that the interests of both the farmers and the pastoralists can be served by giving relief to light and bedding their horses at night by the pastoralists directly, but without giving relief to large consumers in the various cities and large centres of population throughout the Commonwealth. question presents itself to my mind in two aspects. I desire to be strictly imand the small settler who grows turnips, and I take as my guide tliose perfect lines of Burns, which might at times be taken almost as a scriptural textMan's inhumanity to man Makes countless thousands mourn. From the appeals I have heard made in the Chamber, I can well believe that the difficulties of the large pastoralists have not been overstated. I can quite understand that I am not one of there is a class of pastoralists who, having been in fairly good circumstances, have now to stare ruin in the face. I know no set of circumstances which would produce dark despair more quickly to a man who has known all the comforts of life, than to be, at a moment's notice, faced with the position of having to give up his old home, with all its pleasant associations. There is, I should fancy, another class of pastoralists who will be able to weather the storm, however severe it may be. A pastoralist of this class will have to put his shoulder to the wheel again, as many of us have had to do, and by strenuous exertions he may in time recover from his difficulties. There is, I should imagine, still another class of pastoralists who spend thousands of pounds weekly in keeping tlieir stock alive. As a result of the drought a pastoralist of this class may find his banker's balance reduced and his fixed deposits or Government debentures standing at a lower ebb than in previous years. His son may have a smaller inheritance than he had previously, and his daughter may enjoy a smaller dower than her betrothed might reasonably have expected her to get. But the actual comforts surrounding that pastoralists life are not materially lessened. The comforts of his table are the same. The supply of delicious wines for his guests in all probability is not considerably reduced. In contradistinction to the pastoralists I have spoken of, I wish to speak of the small farmers in some of the States. In TasmaniaI have seen these men go into the forest lands, having very few comforts, getting no enjoyments, rising before sunthe light of a lantern day after day in extreme weather. Afte r the forest land is brought somewhat under cultivation the first effort of a man of this class is to",21,William Mcmillan Is That The Being A Bigoted Free Trader Himself Wants

38,Mr Hartnoll (Tasmania),"Thisproduce a. turnip crop amidst his stumps. I have known the rabbits in a few nights to -devour one-half of that which had taken months to produce. When the crop is ready for the market, the grower has to pay his neighbour 5s. a day to help him to pull and top his turnips. Jt costs 5s. to provide the bags for a ton of the turnips. A t the most moderate rate it will cost 2s. 6d. atontogetthe crop to market. Year after year I have seen poor struggling farmers take their turnips to Devonport for export, and sell fchem at £ 1 per ton. The net price to the settler is not more than 10s. a ton. In some instances I have been called upon to help a settler through his difficulties. When the price has been exceedingly low, and no buyers have been forthcoming at Devonport, the farmer has been persuaded to send his consignment through an agent to Sydney, ancl I have seen the account sales showing him to be in debt, thus losing the whole production of a year. These are the normal conditions of fche poor settler in the backwoods, and I speak with authority, as I know him most familiarly. During the present season the price of turnips rose to £ 2 per ton in Devonport, and I have known them to realize £4-. per ton. These high prices have induced the settlers to rush their produce into the market, bufc in very many instances the middleman has reaped most of the benefit. The abnormal rise in the price of turnips has not been brought about by the special demand for food for stock, because the turnips have been needed for human consumption. scarce, owing to tlie drought in New South Wales and Queensland, that urgent cables have been sent to Tasmania asking that turnips might be forwarded, however high the price might be. However great the difficulties and trials of the pastoralists may be, they are no greater than those with which the ordinarj small farmer's have 7 to contend year after year. farming for the grower of root cr&ps to sell his produce, and those who are in fair circumstances would never dream of doing such a thing. Therefore, under ordinary conditions, only small farmers sell their turnips and mangolds. Under the present abnormal conditions, however, many well-to-do farmers, who generally use their mangolds and turnips for feeding their stock, have been selling them at the rate of £ 2 per ton, the buyer having to take them out of the ground and top them. I think that, under all the. circumstances, an opportunity is presented to give way, to some extent, to fche wishes of the Senate, and fchat we should be evincing a compromising spirit if we reduced the duty to Is. per central. This would give a fair amount of protection to our own producers, and would at the same time afford some relief to pastoralists who are now hand-feeding their stock. I sold the best Algerian oaten hay just before I left Tasmania on the last occasion at £ 3 per ton, and thousands of tons are to be obtained there at about that price. The conditions under which the hay is sold is that the farmer shall find wood and water for the buyer who sends his chaffcutting plant on to the farm. Eight shillings per ton would be required to defray the cost of the chaff cutting, and the bags required for a ton of chaff would cost 5s. Then the cost of carting the chaff to the port of shipmentwould have to be defrayed, and the freight from Tasmania to Sydney would be 15s. per ton. Therefore it should be possible to land Tasmanian chaff in Sydney in first hands at £ 4 17s. 6d., or at the most, £ 5 per ton. An average crop of oaten hay would yield 1^tons per acre. In Tasmania some of the farms are cultivated according to the most approved principles. The farmers, who pay a rent of say 10s. or l'2s. 6d. per acre fallow tlieir land, and, therefore, do not obtain more than one crop of hay in two years. Then they have to pay for artificial manures, for putting in and harvesting the crop, and a Vegetables have become so number of other incidental expenses which would amount to, probably, £ 1 10s. per acre, making a total, with the rent, of £ 2 10s. per acre. If the farmer obtained £ 3 , per ton for his hay, his gross return at the rate of l i tons per acre would be £ 4 10s., and, therefore, his profit would not amount to more than £ 2 per acre. Those who know the conditions under which It is bad farmers have to carry on their operations, will admit that £ 2 per acre represents a very moderate profit. The profits derived by those engaged in commercial occupations are very much larger. Farming under present conditions is, no doubt, a delightful occupation, but it will bear no comparison with commercial life as a profitable undertaking. I think thafc we should deal with the requests made by the Senate in a friendly spirit, and endeavour to arrive at some reasonable compromise, and that we might very well consent to a reduction of this duty without depriving our farmers of fair protection. regret that the duties upon hay and chaff have been discussed in connection with the request of the Senate thab f r u it and vegetables should be placed upon the free list, because the effect is to confuse the issue. Hay and chaff are produced abundantly within the Commonwealth, whereas turnips and mangolds and other vegetable products of a similar character are produced here in such small quantities that they need hardly enter into our calculations. In regard to commodities produced abundantly within the Commonwealth, my sympathies are to a very great extent with honourable members who are supporting the Government, because when the States entered into the federal compact ifc was understood'thafc a certain amount of consideration would be given to our agriculturists. the spirit of the federal compact if we were to allow New Zealand to introduce her commodities into our markets with ease at all times, but the products which that colony can supply at low rates do not affect the constitutional question. The stocks available in New Zealand and the States of the Commonwealth where root crops are grown would not be commensurate wibh the demand. ber for Gippsland suggested that the State Government of New South Wales might overcome the difficulty by remitting the duties, but that suggestion does not appeal to my mind, because it would really 'be offering an inducement to the Stafces to act contrary to the spirit of the Constitution, and to do that, which in a private individual would be regarded as a moral, if not a criminal, evasion of the law. seven years ago, and during fche whole of I do not think that the honourable member for Moira did himself justice last night. Probably he was provoked a little by the spirit of the discussion, because he must know that the New South Wales pastoralists have not come ""squealing"" to this Parliament for assistance. Only within the past week I visited a property in that State, for which I act as attorney, and upon which there are 100,000 starving sheep. Although, if min does not fall within the next three weeks, probably 50,000 of them will perish, I have never been asked by any pastoralist to press this matter in the slightest degree. I know the difficulty of feeding such a large number of sheep. If to-morrow I could land £3,000 worth of fodder at market rates upon that property, which is situated upon the Murrumbidgee, I would do so. supply is not available that tlie honourable member cannot do so. cannot carry it . The Acting Prime Minister has been kind enough to place in my possession the actual figures which he has received from the Statistician's office, and these show thafc in Victoria we have 3,000,000 surplus bushels of wheat, 2,165,000. bushels of oats, and 320,000 tons of hay. I have checked these figures, and I believe that they are accurate. I repeat that the fodder is available, but the railways cannot carry it . Only the other day at Albury, I saw quite an acre of ground covered with trucks, the contents of which had to be It would be entirely against transferred to other trucks owing to the break of gauge. The New South Wales Raihvay Commissioners have done all they can in regard to tliis matter. They, are willing to carry this produce for any distance at 2s. per ton. Probably the honourable member for Moira was deceived in consequence of having visited New South Walesi n some particularly good year'. Five or seven years ago that State enjoyed excellent seasons, The honourable memand the result of the visits which I then paid to it induced me to believe that in Victoria the value of the land had been altogether over-estimated. In one agricultural district in New South Wales a friend of mine requested me to send him up some farming hands. I undertook to do so, and despatched him a working manager and a thoroughly .good ploughman. He cleared about 2,000 or 3,000 acres. That was that period he has not taken off the ground in the way of crops as much as he has put into it . How can the honourable member for* Moira say thafc fodder canbe grown under conditions of that kind ? able member to say that it was entirely the fault of the pastoralists themselves that, in good seasons, they did not provide against bad years. the land in New South Wales is not fit for agriculture, and I have always said so.",22,William Mcmillan Is That The Being A Bigoted Free Trader Himself Wants

Only two years ago I saw 2 tons to the acre taken off Toganmain* enter into big operations of that character. I find fault with the honourable member for liaving accused the pastoralists of coming "" squealing"" to this House for assistance when it is not the case. Of course, there is no doubt that the dairy farmers do not grow sufficient fodder, even in good seasons. I well remember reading an article by an American writer who addressed himself to this subject. He said, "" We often hear farmers calling out for a better class of. dairy cow; but if the cow could speak she would probably ask for a better class of dairy farmer."" A d mitting all that, however, we are faced with an abnormal condition as regards dairy farms. It is all very well to say that because the dairy farmers neglect to adopt a certain course, and because the Constitution says so and so, we can do nothing for them. Nero fiddled while Home burned. We say the State Government should do this, and the Pederal Government should not do that, and nothing is being done. I hold that no matter of mere sentiment should be allowed to stand in the way of admitting root products such as mangolds, turnips, ifcc., from New Zealand free of duty. There is plenty of hay and chaff in A ictoria which could be exported to New r South Wales if the railways could carry it . hay and chaff beyond the Commonwealth.

In regard to the remarks of the honourable I was dealing with member for Gippsland, I am sure that riper reflection will induce him to change his opinion, and to recognise that it would be very dangerous for us to declare that whenever any State desired to interfere with Commonwealth legislation, it could do so by refunding duties imposed by this Parliament. The whole principle upon which uniformity of trade throughout Australia is based is one of equality. We are told that the States have a legal right, but no matter what legal right there may be, I do not think that any State ought to break the spirit of the Constitution. Most of the speeches from the other side have been of a very provincial character ; and the extreme weakness of the honourable member for Gippsland's case is shown .when he asks why the Goverument of New South Wales do not refund fhe duty, or, if necessary, directly import fodder for the starving flocks and herds. MrA . McLEAN I only gave-that as an illustration. surely that would have the same effect as a remission of the duty. MrA .

55,Sir William Mcmillan,"I do notfuture, possibly, cause strained relations amongst the States. We ought to be careful before we commit ourselves as to what is a fair course to be adopted by any State on the broad basis of federation. The honourable member for Gippsland says that the desire is to take advantage of the drought, in order to get a modicum of free-tradethat the sole object is to break down the entrenchments on the other side. But for a moment we might broaden our view of the whole situation. It is granted, I think, that when we impose a duty, we do so for the general benefit of one large class of the population. A t the present moment, not only the squatters, but the dairy farmers and agricultural settlers throughout the length and breadth of Australia are calling out for relief. But is it not a fact that, notwithstanding the interests of the little district represented by the honourable member for Moira, and notwithstanding the interests of Tasmania, it is proposed to impose a duty against the interests of the great majority of the people, whom, uncler the guise of the Tariff, we are supposed to assist. Of course, I am now referring only to the two articles, turnips and mangolds. I believe that the great body of agriculturists of Australia, combined with the pastoralists and others interested in stock, are entirely against a duty which will shut out New Zealand turnips and mangolds. If that be the case, the question is being regarded from the wrong point of view. The honourable meniber foiGippsland talks about the necessity of farmers growing produce for winter, and I believe that in this connection tliere is a great weakness in our farming community. But even in the dairying districts there are large numbers of farms which, with the grazing land, have very little fit for proper cultivation, the latter costing from £ 2 0 to £ 4 0 per acre. MrA . McLEAN ing land that is not agricultural land. nevertheless a fact that a great deal of the dairying land is fit only for grazing. I do not mean to say that an effort should not be made to cultivate, but when we consider that much of the land used by agriculturists and daii-y farmers is second class, and only fit for grazing, it is ridiculous to talk about raising these particular commodities in the far interior Here we have a body of citizens whom, presumably, we are trying to protect, but who do not want protection. MrA . McLEAN -Most of the dairying land is of the very best. difficult to dissent at times from the honourable member for Gippsland, who is so strong and impressive as to make me almost doubt my reason. In this country we desire the farmer to supply milk not merely during five, six, or seven months of the year, but, as in the older countries, all the year round. But we cannot, with an autocratic wave of the hand, tell the farmer that he must also cultivate other commodities. As1 a matter of fact, farmers do cultivate oats and other products. This time of scarcity is no mere incident, but will recur again and again in two of the largest States; ancl at the very time the farmer is being urged to make sheds for cattle and increase his supply of milk during the winter, he is being deprived of the means of doing so. take the duty off his products. pretend to be an expert, although I have learned a little lately. But there is a difference between the stuff grown for fodder and that grown for the market. that in isolated portions of Australia this produce is raised for feed, but tlie great mass of the people, whose interests we ought to conserve, simply grow fodder for consumption on their own farms. MrA . McLEAN -Every item raised for home consumption has a market value. duct will not stand any d u t y ; and here we have an instance of the cruel cunningI can use no other expression-by which the duty has been raised practically to the point of prohibition. I am interested in some of It is very poor dairythe. items, my attention, as a matter of business, having been drawn to the importations It is from abroad during the last five or six months. This drought is not an ordinary Visitation, but one of the most fearful ever experienced in Australia ; and when to the price of the commodity in Australia is added the freight and other charges, we get just to the point at which it is too risky to import, and this or any duty on a low-priced product becomes absolutely prohibitive.

The present duty, as I have said, deals with only two articles, turnips and mangolds, which are the lowest kinds of fodder. fodder of a succulent character, -which is necessary along with the preserved fodder. In times of drought such as the present, the only fodder we can grow is hay and other dry stuff, and the turnips and mangolds, which cannot now be supplied in Australia, are absolutely necessary in order to keep tlie stock in perfect health. Mr A. member ever calculate the cost of feeding stock on imported turnips? know that I have, but I know the cost of feeding stock, because I have been paying £100 a month on that score. I am not dealing with this question in view of the present drought. The condition of drought has become largely chronic, and will recur in two of the largest States, which contain probably a majority of the population of Australia. A t the presenb time the population of New South Wales is 1,350,000, and that of Queensland something over 500,000 ; and the conditions, climatic and otherwise, of these States are much on allfours with those of Western Australia. When we add the population of Western Australia to that of the two eastern States, we have represented more than half of the whole people of Australia. cultural land to supply the whole of Australia. deavouring to take abroad view of the position. The populations which are increasing in tlie greatest ratio are those of New South Wales and Queensland, and in a very few years these will be the preponderating States. We are framing, not a provincial Tariff, but a national Tariff for a Commonwealth with a coasb-line of 8,000 miles. MrA . McLEAN -The honourable member is forgetting that Queensland was a protected State. honourable members can broaden their view beyond isolated areas, where turnips are grown What we have now to consider is two-thirds or four-fifths of the whole of Australia. I am not pleading on account of the present drought, or merely on account of New South Wales, but I do say that the richest and : Tariff BUI. 14995 most populous part of Australia to-day is the part to which we can refer as a ground for this concession. One thing about the We' are considering Tasmanian farmer, and others of the class to which he belongs, is that they can always make a living, but when you come to deal with the pastoralist you have to face conditions in which men may be wiped out altogether. That is the condition of thousands of men in Australia at the present time, and they are engaged in industries which form the backbone of our material Chamberi t might have been reasonable for representatives of the farmers to fight I do not hard to gain a majority, but in view of the circumstances in Australia as a whole, I contend that we should rise above mere provincialism, and be glad to take advantage of the opportunity which the Senate has afforded us to give way a little. pose to enlarge upon the question before the Chair, except to correct some statements that have been attributed to me, but which I never made.

I find that the value of chaff in Melbourne, on the railway or wharf, is quoted at £ 3 15s. to £ 4 .

80,Mr Kennedy,"I have given the gistdifferent kinds of products required at the present time for feeding stock, I distinctly stated that I was speaking not from my own personal experience, but that I was quoting an authority on the subject. I even gave the page from which I quoted. I repeat that, according to bhat authority, 1 cwt. of turnips per week, with dried feed in addition, is necessary in order to keep an 8-stone sheep in a normal condition. The extract which I gave was flatly contradicted by the honourable member for Parramatta, who said that Frnivm, did not say so. which I quoted is as followsIn calculating the quantity of stock which a crop may carry, the weight of the crop must be considered. If there is an average of 20 to us per acre, including swedes, kohl-rabi and mangolds, it may be taken that an S-stone sheep will eat 1 cwt. per week, with dry food in addition. A 12-stone sheep, under the same conditions, would require'H cwt. : and an old sheep, if allowed as much as it could eat, with a short allowance of dry food, would probably consume between 2 and 3 cwt. per week. I took what from my point bf view was the inostdisadvantageous position, for i cited the case of a sheep eating the least quantity. The cost of New Zealand turnips, exclusive of duty, in Melbourne or Sydney, is 3s. per cwt., and-discountin g by 50 per cent, the quantity of turnips said by this authority to be necessary-if it were possible bo susbain an S-sbone sheep on 56 lbs. of burnips per week, the cost to the stock-owner would be Is. 6d. per week, exclusive of the cost of transit from Sydney into the interior, and of giving this feed bo the stock. The cost of feeding a sheep for eight weeks at that rate would thus represent the actual value of a store sheep to-day. done in many ciises ? single instance. herds whioh have eaten their value twice over. graziers have fed their stocks at that cost: but is it likely that keen business men would feed them with turnips when they could keep them in au equally good, if not better, condition on fodder which is more readily obtainable, and can be purchased ab ber did not quote his authority. He quoted one-fifth the cost? I have said already-and only a part of it . It was that to which I I think the statement has been confirmed42 o that where sheep have plenty of paddock room and easy access to water it is possible to keep them on 1 lb. of wheat per day, provided that they have not got down too low. Leb us fix the allowance at 1 lb. per day. only on wheat. differ from the honourable member. I have fed them in that way. I can name a number of stock-owners, including some of the biggest graziers, who have also done' so during the present year. I know that I did not say that. Mr Horsfall, of Momalong, has adopted this practice. There are conditions under which sheep will not thrive when fed only on. wheat, but over the greater portion of the. lime and salt country of New South Wales, they will live for a considerable time and maintain a fair condition of health when fed in that way, provided that they have easy access to water. Takingblie maximum price of wheat ruling in any of bhe ports to-day at 4s. 6d. per bushel, and doubling the allowance by fixing it at . I lb. per day, the result is that a stockowner can maintain his sheep on wheat at . a cost of Sd. per week, instead of having to pay Is. 6d. per week for feeding them on turnips. The same thing applies to the use of oats, hay, or chaff. My own opinion is that a mixed ration is the best food for stock under such conditions, but we know that it is impossible to obtain it . Turning to authorities as to the food qualities of different products, what do we find ? I do . not pretend to know anything of chemistry ; but I am aware that protein is the chief ' factor in determining the value of any of these food products. According to Henry Armsby, Ph.D., director of the Penn. sylvania State College Agricultural Experithat being mental Station, whose opinions are confirmed ' by tests which have been carried out upon I do not know of a a scientific basis, turnips do not contain one-fifth of the quantity of protein to-, be found in any of the other products. which we are using to sustain sheep, cattle, or horses. They contain a very large quanI t is possible that tity of water, but only one per cent, of protein. I should not have ventured to detain the committee by dealing with these matters, but for the fact that my autliorities-: were absolutely challenged. took exception.",28,Mclean Di D The Honourable Wealth When Party Feeling Ran High In This

What opinion does he express? He says that with the supplies available here it is impossible for him to get fodder landed at the place where stock are starving at a price he is prepared to pay. New Zealand values for oats and hay chaff are actually on a par with Melbourne values, yet the honourable member distinctly says that through the inability of the railway staffs to meet the abnormal demand for haulage, he cannot, and will hot, enter into a contract for the delivery of this foodstuff. and carriers ? engaged in dairying pursuits. In the district in which I live dairymen who a year ago were receiving for their produce from £20 to £ 4 0 per month, are paying from £ 1 0 to £ 3 0 a month to keep their dairy herd alive. I told the House last night that some dairy farmers who sold the produce of last harvest for £ 2 a"" ton are getting it back at £ 5 a ton. It was from want of forethought that it was sold. from want of money ! of actual necessity with any of the men whom I have in my mind's eye, though there may have been some exceptional cases. Let us realize more clearly the varying conditions with which we are confronted from year to year in these States. In Victoria, for a cycle of years, we sold beef down to 9s. a c w t , and we sold fat mutton in Melbourne and Sydney for l d . per lb. Unless we realize the true causes of these troubles, we shall not discover a perfect remedy. We-should preserve our market to our own people, induce pastoralists and others to grow hay, grain, and root crops for the maintenance of their stock under normal conditions, and educate them up to the necessity of conserving that class of fodder for abnormal conditions. It has been said that I have a sovereign contempt for the disasters of the pastoralists. That statement is only made by those who do not know that I depend on pastoral and agricultural pursuits for my livelihood. If any one should have a true sense of the necessities of the situation I think I should. We have not enjoyed a very fair season by any 42 0 2 means. In my district there are farmers who practically reaped no harvest 'last year. Where the average yield had been 15 bushels they got only 6 or 7 bushels, and some of the crop was not worth harvesting. We have not had"" sufficient rainfall since last August to grow a bit of grass. The district has not lost any stock from want of feed. Last night I said that Australia lost a larger percentage of stock in a previous year than she is losing in this year. I repeat that statement. it was through the fault of the pastoralists, because they had not grown any fodder'. Cani t be grown in the western division of New .South Wales? specific illustration on the Murrumbidgee.

117,Mr Kennedy,"W h y does the honormy authority, and I have proved that what 1 stated was taken verbatim from the text of that authority. ""We are obliged to the honourable member for yet another lecture, and we are indebted to honourable members on the Government side of the chamber, for having once again pointed out the cause of the whole trouble in Australia, and how the remedy can be immediately applied. We have been told once again that protective duties will force the pastoralists and agriculturists all over the countiy to raise their own fodder crops. Tliis is all very interesting, no doubt, but it is sickening to be told over aiid over again that which we already know.. The pastoralists andagriculturists who are suffering from the drought do not want to be told their duty, but they need some help. They know that they have -made mistakes, and they are as well aware as the honourable member for Moira of the causes of their present unfortunate condition. Therefore, what is the use of the honourable member wasting time in telling them facts .which have been brought home to them by the most bitter experience 1 The pastoralists and agriculturists are asking us to tide them over a difficulty, ancl tell us at the same time that they will see whether they cannot alter their methods when more normal seasons come round. What is the use of giving to men who are almost in a death grip tlie relative values of turnips and wheat for feeding sheep? All that would be very well in the lecture-room, and would be most interesting to discuss there, but it is not in point when stock arc starving, and their owners are in need of help, which this Parliament can and should afford at the earliest possible moment. I did not challenge the authority emoted by the honourable member for Moira, but I asked that he should quote fully. The honourable member gave us the f u l l quotation, only when I insisted that he should do so. He told us in the most airy and general way that a sheep would require 1 cwt. of turnips per week, in addition to other kinds of food, ancl it was only when I interjected the question, ""For what purpose?"" that he said, ""To keep it in normal condition."" The honourable member suppressed that important portion of the quotation, and that made all the difference We are not asking that sheep should be kept in "" normal condition,"" nor are we asking that they should be given all the food they want, which, according to the authority quoted by the honourable member, would amount to 3 cwt. of turnips per week. We ask for the food necessary to keep the sheep alive, not rolling in plenty. We are not now speaking of normal conditions, but of a . time of drought, when the great problem is to keep sheep, not rolling fat, but alive. normal condition. the honourable member for his profound information. . The analytical quality of his mind is surpassing -But tins is not the place for him to air his theories. The honourable member for Moira told us that if a sheep were given all it wanted it would require 3 cwt. of turnips per week. No one disputes that; but it has nothing whatever to do with the matter we are now discussing. Moreover, no one has suggested that we should feed sheep on turnips' instead of wheat, and therefore the honourable member's comparison as to relative values of turnips and wheat as food for sheep is entirely beside the mark. We say that the squatters and dairymen want turnips to mix with ' dry food for their sheep and' cattle, and no one suggested that pastoralists would feed their sheep entirely on turnips even if they could get them without the payment of the duty. We are speaking in the interests of the farmers, as well as are the honourable member for Moira and the honourable member for Gippsland. The fanners require cheap fodder, and cannot procure it , and they wish to have the duties remitted. If we believed in the theory of the honourable member for Gippsland that the higher the duty the cheaper fodder would become, we should ask that the duties might be piled on, because the owners of stock require both turnips and wheat at cheap rates, and they will use both in the way that seems best to them. From the remarks of the honourable member for Moirai t would appear that every one who holds a view opposite to himself is an arrant f o o l ; that the pastoralists and agriculturists are arrant fools, and that they are asking for what would not suit them if they could obtain it . The honourable member for Laanecoorie also said last night that the stock-owners were arrant fools, ancl had no sense.

121,Mr Salmon,"I said nothing of the kind.member said thej were not fools, but 7 that they had no sense. That is a veiy nice distinction to draw. We may tell the farmers what they should do to grow fodder at some time when the skies are more kindly, and when the rains have fallen and refreshed the earth. In the meantime they cannot grow crops whilst the ground is baked and parched, as it has been in some cases for years. The Agricultural department of New South Wales, with which I was connected for twelve months, has been engaged for the last nine years in making experiments upon a farm in the midst of the drought-stricken country. Year after j ear they have carried on the struggle r in the hope that better conditions would prevail, but they have now given it up, because they cannot get their crops through the ground, and cannot make the farm pay. South Wales Agricultural department would attempt to grow wheat under those conditions. member brings us back to the old position, that every one is a fool but himself. One of the best agriculturists in New South Wales had the management of that farm, but after seven or eight years' experience lie failed to accomplish any good result, and the farm has been abandoned. What folly it is for the honourable member for Moira to tell the farmers and pastoralists that they should overcome climatic conditions, and grow their own fodder ! If the honourable member were to show them how thej could do it, they would give him a r great deal more money than he could earn by following his present occupation. He is the man whom they have been seeking for vears. If he can grow fodder in the far west he is the most wonderful individual in the world, because nobody else can do it. It has been attempted, and the attempt has failed because of the climatic conditions which exist. That is the most effective answer which can be given to the honourable member. His methods would have been adopted in the great areas which are suffering most severely from drought had that course been possible. I had intended to deal with some remarks of the honourable member for Gippsland, but I am disposed to let him off, because his impressive style always disarms me. I hope that he will not again challenge me to debate with him, because I tell him candidly that I would not undertake the contract, as I know that his impressive manner would gain the sympathy of the audience. One remark, however, was made by the honourable member for the Grampians, concerning which I desire to say a few words. He stated that under our federal conditions we ought not to be too eager to admit produce from New Zealand free. I wish to ask whether he imagines when we desire to obtain New Zealand produce that we do so with the object of -obliging New Zealand sellers 1 I always understood that we do so from a desire to benefit ourselves. tween that which we produce abundantlj', and that which we cannot produce. for wishing to buy New Zealand produce is that we believe we can obtain it upon but the New advantageous terms. We desire a remission of the duties upon fodder so that our own people who cannot raise it for themselves may have a chance of securing it . -The honourable member talked about the Riverina district. But I . would point out that we are not concerned with the Riverina farmers-the y can shift for themselves. We are concerned, however, with a great portion of New South Wales where it has been proved, year after year, that it is absolutely impossible to produce this fodder. In time of drought, therefore, it must be imported either from other parts of the Commonwealth or from places beyond it . Just now it can be secured more advantageouslj from outside the Commonwealth. 7 That is why we think that, in time of special stress like the present, these duties should be removed. the honourable member for Moira concentrated his attention upon turnips has given rather an unfair turn to this debate. It was understood that the committee were to discuss the duties upon fodder, and not the question of how long a sheep can live upon turnips. As I pointed out previously, if turnips were imported from New Zealand they might possiblj be utilized for stock 7 purposes by the dairy farmers in our coastal districts, thus relieving, to some extent, the demand which exists for other classes of fodder in the interior.

127,Mr Spence (Darling),"The fact thatfodder for stock, and the editor, in a brief footnote to a letter upon this subject, saysWe have recently heard of 25,000 acres in Riverina which, tlirough the summer of 1894-5, earried 50,000 sheep and 700 head of cattle on thistles alone. To be consistent, the honourable meniber for Moira should therefore propose the imposition of a duty upon thistles, because they might be imported from Argentina as a fodder. He has endeavoured to convince the committee that if we levy a duty upon fodder, it will make it cheaper. aspect, of the question. of a week or two we shall find out what the honourable member does mean. Last night he blamed the pastoralists for neglecting to grow their own fodder, but finding that the committee would not accept him as an authority upon the feeding of stock, he ""introduced other authorities. In this connection I wish to quote from Mr S. Fairbairn, who, in an interesting letter to the Queenslander, saysWe are continually reading in the papers recommendations to out and store the natural grasses in good seasons to make fodder provision for bad seasons, arid the impi-ession in the pubhc mind is that the grazing tenants in Queensland are improvident in not having done so. All the sheep men know the utter absurdity of doing anything of the sort, and therefore I think it worthwhile to write and point oufc that absurdity. I am dealing with the inside county, where the drought prevails mostly, and where the grasses . make the best bush hay. After entering into details regarding what is requisite, he thus summarises the result of his investigationsI t would be impossible to cnt and stack it at '£.1 a ton, and it would cost another £1 a ton to distribute it, so that by the time you had cut, stacked, and fed the sheep with it, it would have cost £.1 a sheep. That is the statemeut of a thoroughly ' practical man in contradistinction to the theoretical advice given by outside people who know nothing whatever about the subject. The same writer goes on to show that a vast army of draught horses, waggons, and haycutting machines would he required to cut the grass and stack it even for 100,000 sheep, because it would mean cutting 15,000 acres. Quoting again from the Pastoralists' Beview, for 16th June of the present year, I find the following records of actual experiences of pastoralists having the control of large estates, chiefly in RiverinaOn one place 17,000 lambing ewes were fed on 1 lb. of chaff, ^ lb. of oats, and they saved 70 per cent, of lambs. Weaners were allowed J lb. of chaff, and J lb. of oats. On another place wethers are being fed on 4 lb. of oats, and they get a little picking in the paddocks as well. Another sj'Steni of feeding for ewes is £ lb. of bran and £ lb. of chaff', and this has given excellent results, so good that one of the most experienced managers tells us bhat it may be cousidered the best, and better than any of the above. .Cost, average 8d. per week, and some even up to Is., according to distance from railway. I did not-refer to that Cattle are getting 6 lbs. of hay a day, which just keeps them alive, but this only when feeding starts, when they are in good condition. averaged 8d. per week. ber did not tell us that some sheep cost Is. per week. Moreover, he knows that most pastoral country is situated a considerable distance from the railway, and that, therefore, the cost of cartage is no small matter. Regarding the use of maize, the same publication statesThe quantit3' allowed for sheep is from J lb. upwards daily, according to what can be afforded, and condition of bhe sheep, Other pastoralists have found the pricklypear an excellent fodder for stock, and one individual advocates the use of the bottletree cut into chips. Therefore, the honourable member for Moira should move for the imposition of a duty upon bottle trees. I understood him to say that sufficient fodder could be grown in the agricultural districts of New South Wales to supply the needs of the pastoralists in bad times. individuals who live by growing wheat, oats, hay, Sso., are expected to produce a sufficient quantity in a good season to be able to supply the pastoralists in times of drought. They are to keep this fodder stored and to wait for droughts to occur before realizing upon it. That is an absolutely ridiculous position for any one who professes to be a farmer to take up. Bothi n New South Wales and Victoria there are pastoralists who hold land which is fit for agriculture. These could grow upon their agricultural areas fodder that would serve as a "" stand-by,"" but to suggest that the farming community should grow and store fodder for other people is ridiculous.

He must live. purchase the fodder when it is cheap, and keep a reasonable supply on hand. for Gippsland has now come to the rescue. He claims that the pastoralist ought to pay to those companies which already have him by the throat, a heavy interest upon something which he does not want, and possibly may never want. The farmer is expected to grow and store what he does not want, and the pastoralist is expected to purchase and keep what he does not require. stock must be fed on mouldy fodder. able member for Moira, the great authority to whom the farmers of Victoria look for guidance, has had to feed his own stock. coming from at the present time % foolish it is to blame the pastoralists for not growing fodder which they cannot grow, and to chide the farmers for not keeping fodder in stock. farmers are struggling to make a living, and they have to find a market where they can. It has been made clear that in some cases farmers, who were obliged to sell to speculators, have bought back at 4s. what they sold at 2s. 2d., the bags of wheat not having even been taken away from the railway stations. Our farmers are in the unfortunate position of not being able to hold their grain for a decent rise in the market, and it is absolute nonsense to expect them to store fodder in order to meet abnormal conditions. It goes without saying that we ought to grow all the fodder necessary for Australia, but if the supply has to be conServed, different methods will have to be adopted. We might have to resort to the old Egyptian system of storage, and we might find that the honourable member for Moira is a Josephi n disguise. If such a step should be necessary, the information which has been elicited recently will prove of great value. But whether or not the fodder can be grown here is beside the question. There is the fact that additional fodder may be obtained with injury to none and benefit to many ; and, from that point of view, we are perfectly justified in reducing the duties. I agree that in times of trouble the State might send away ships for supplies; but the inference that might be drawn from the speeches of honourable members opposite is that they would prefer to see stock, and even people, die rather than interfere with the sacred principle of protection. I am sure, however, that that is not the real sentiment of protectionist members; and I would remind them that to send ships away as suggested, would prove a much greater interference with their principles than the mere removal, of a duty. I want to convince the honourable member for Moira as to the very limited area there is in New South Wales where both wool and fodder can be grown, and to that end I shall read a few extracts from sworn testimony given before the Royal commission appointed to inquire into the position of the Crown tenants, particularly in the western division of New South Wales. This testimony shews that people have tried to grow fodder in Where are the supplies those districts and have failed. I have given the committee the benefit of the opinions of practical men in regard te native grasses in New South Wales, and here I may say that there have been occasions in the Cobar district when a man on horseback Both pastoralists and could not be seen owing to the height of the grass. Those who have seen good seasons of that character may be excused when thej suggest that the native grass7 should be. cut and stored for hay, but they speak in ignorance of the history of the district, the rainfall, and other circumstances. There are very few occasions on which such prolific crops are grown, as compared with the many occasions when fodder is required. A t the experimental farm in my electorate there is a most efficient and experienced head in the person of Mr Peacock, who has made a wide and close study of agriculture. Mr Peacock, in speaking of land bordering on the country where Victorian people have lost a lot of money in attempting to grow supplies of fodder and wool at the same time, saidThe experience at Coolabah has been that the seasons are so unreliable that it would be foil}' for farmers to come west to earn a living by agriculture. Rainfall cannot be depended on. The heaviest rains occur in January, Februaiy, and March, but duriug the last three years even those rains have failed, and the proportion of bad seasons to good ones would be so great thafc the farmers would be ruined.

If there had to be a sufficient supply farmers who cannot afford to store their Government of N e w South Wales can do, misleading statements which must be made the remission of the duties arose in Georgetance from George-street, held a meeting at which a remission of the duties this period of trouble is no time for party moves. Our protectionist friends do not seem to realize what the present price of meat ineans to the poorer classes of the community. Wethers are sold at £ 2 10s. 6d. per head in Melbourne, and in Sydney ewes are 25s. and wethers 42s. Last week only 3,000 head of stock were offered at the Homebush sales, the pastoralists being compelled, in spite of the extreme prices, to preserve their sheep for stocking. Even with good seasons it must be three years before the present deficiencies can be made up. In the face of this absolute scarcity the people are using largely rabbits, and, altogether, the position could not be more serious. Many of the stock-owners will probably be ruined, and the general public are affected not only by the loss of wealth on the production of the wool, but also by the loss of employment. I could give figures in this connection, but the debate has already been very prolonged, though perhaps not more so than the situation demands. A t the present time there is no sign bf the break-up of the drought, and whatever the Federal Government are able to do to alleviate the situation ought to be done. As to the fiscal cry, there are fads on both sides ; but no fad ought to be allowed to prevent help being given to the suffering. All fads should be set aside when humanity calls, even on behalf of the poor dumb animals. Honourable members cannot realize the gravity of the situation, or they would not drag in the old miserable cries, and discuss the probable effect of a remission of the duties in the distant future on the prospects of some Victorian farmers. The honourable member for Moira referred to the fact that the people in New South Wales did not go in for wheat growing. But apparently he does not know that some of the greatest increases in land settlement in that State took place before there was anj' duty in operation. The protectionists associate everything with a duty. They seem to think that the world would cease going round, and the sun would no longer shine, if there were no protective duties. One becomes sick of hearing such statements. The fact is that New South Wales is rapidly overtaking her own consumption. Owing to the demand for land in the agricultural districts, and the pressure put upon the Government to throw land open for selection, fresh areas have been opened up, and every time fresh land is thrown open there is a rush for it. AVe shall soon have a big supply of wheat and fodder of all kinds, and, normally, we shall have a considerable surplus after meeting local requirements, if we have decent seasons. But at present, in several of the farming districts of New South Wales, there is no crop whatever. The people of Victoria do not realize what the present drought is like, but in New South Wales the situation is a very serious one to eveiy one concerned. This Parliament should do everything it can to bring about a relief. mainlj'. to refer to the statement of the lionorable member for Parramatta with regard to the quotations of the honourable member for Moira. I have listened to both his speeches, and have had an opportunity to refer to the books from which that honourable member quoted, and I beg to state, for the information of the committee and the country, that the statements he made were strictly in accordance with the authorities he cited. There was no suppression on his part of anj' word or sentence which would have had the slightest effect on anj' argument he was using. Let me tell honourable members from the other States that the honourable member for Moira has had a long, varied,' and honourable connection with the industrj' about which he has been speaking. During the time. I was associated with him in the State Parliament of A ictoria, he was alwaj'S regarded as being r a strictly honourable man, thoroughlj' well acquainted with farming subjects. I feel that it is incumbent upon me, liaving had a considerable knowledge of the honourable member, to correct some of the statements concerning him. Reference has been made to some remarks of mine regarding the dairymen of New South Wales. We have been told that the alteration in the Tariff desired to be made by honourable members opposite would have the effect of assisting the dairymen who are suffering from the effects of the drought, and from a shortage of fodder. Now the dairymen of New South Wales have their finished product protected to the extent of 3d. per lb. of it at any rate, though the honourable member and his political friends would have deprived them of that benefit.",35,Mclean Di D The Honourable Wealth When Party Feeling Ran High In This

Butter from the Argentine and New Zealand would have Hooded the New South Wales and the Commonwealth markets. It is on account of their fiscal opinions that honourable members opposite desire to see this duty struck away, and the hollowness of their pretence that they are taking this action only because of the distress among the dairymen of New South Wales, is shown by the fact that only a little while ago they were prepared to take away from the dairymen the very small modicum of protection they are now enjoying. know why honourable members should have the price; but they admitted that the bulk of gone into a question of dietetics, and I the farmers had not a f u l l supply of produce. should not have referred to the matter The honourable member for Moira confessed except for the statement of the honourable thafcfchafcwasfcheposition, even in his own meniber for Moira, which, to my surprise, district, where rain has fallen.

"" How comes it that when honourable members of the Opposition pointed out that the duty on agricultural machinery would cause a rise in prices, owing to the insufficient local production, these very honourable members said, in order to curry favour with the farmers whom they represent, that such was not the case. I would point out to those who are so selfish as to advocate the retention of these duties, that if we allow stock to die, as they will die for want of food, there will be no call for the farmers' produce next year, because there will not be stock to consume it . MrA . PATERSON -And no wages for the shearers. quently the loss will be infinitely greater. Ten years ago there were 60,000,000 sheep in Australia. To-day it is believed that that number has been reduced to 30,000,000. I do' not imagine that honourable members will think I am over-stating the case when I say that, taking an all-round price of something like £200 per 1,000, there ought to have been a gross increase of nearly £6,000,000 in the annual value of sheep in New South Wales. That £6,000,000 would have afforded employment to thousands of men year after year at £100 a year, Still honourable members on the other side would lightly cast aside this request. They display a callousness that is absolutely astounding. I suppose we are all aware of the tales of vampires who used to suck the blood of their victims at night, and in that way exhaust thein, and of ghouls who used to feed on the dead bodies. I do not know to which of these two classes the Ministry belong. learned member must not refer to honourable members in that way. why the Ministry are so disposed by means of these duties to increase the number of dead carcases throughout the country. If they had any of the characteristics of either of the classes to which I have referred, one could understand it . I shall record my vote in favour of the amendment. Mr G. B. EDWARDS (South Sydney). -Fo r a few moments I should like to direct the attention of the committee to what I consider to be first principles. We have heard the phrase referred to once or twice, but we appear to be wandtring far away into the by-paths and divisions of this great question. [Committee counted.] When the agitation set in for the suspension of the fodder duties in the interests of owners of starving stock, I was not one of those who supported it . It seemed to me that, from the point of view of the proper exercise of the functions of administration, we could not ask Ministers to suspend certain duties set down in the Tariff. I considered that after the Legislature had agreed upon a Tariff we could not under any circumstances ask for the suspension of that Tariff in the interests of any one or more of the States, because such an action would be subversive of all trading regulations, and would upset the plans of all commercial men. I pointed out on the inConsetroduction of the Tariff that agitations would set in for the repeal of these duties in times of famine and scarcity, and for that reason I was strongly opposed to their imposition. I urged, with other honourable members, that duties relating to items such as vegetables and f r u it would not be operative whilst we had good seasons, and that the Government's estimate of revenue to be derived from them was remarkably small. I urged, however, that they were likely to yield considerable sums at a time when the people could ill-afford to pay them, and when, in fact, it would mean ruin to a vast class if they were called upon to bear them. Neither from the protectionist nor the free-trade point of view can we defend duties upon the particular items we are considering. In a normal year we want no protection to assist the production of wheat crops, vegetables, or fruits. On the other hand, this continent is subject to periodical famines ; and during those times the duties must act oppressively and disastrous^. It was for that reason that I contended from the first that we ought not to have imposed the duties. I hold that it would be wrong to suspend any duties during a time of panic or political excitement. We could not, I think, fall back on the sliding scale which was adopted in the English corn laws. We ought to approach the reconsideration of this question with some regard to whafc we have witnessed since the Bill was sent to the Senate. Last night I was rather struck with the speech made by the honourable member for Lang, who very eloquently and feelingly set forth the position in Queensland and New South Wales.

149,Mr Conroy,"I should like to knowpicture of affairs which he submitted. so far as I have been able to gauge the truth of his statements,. I think that he in no way exaggerated the terrible times which have been experienced in some parts of Australia. It is of no use for the honourable member for Moira to tell us that it is the result of a system of bad farming or want of precautions. disaster come out of any individual want of forethought; Australians as ,a race cannot be accused of being deficient in common sense or wanting in forethought. ' In his striving after what he called a practical remedy the honourable member for Moira' has not been able to submit any remedy which would be half so efficacious as would the removal of the duties. The only remedy -which we could submit would be a Bill to secure an inch of rainfall per week throughout the Commonwealth. are doing the best we can to mitigate the terrible results of the drought Australia, and although the honourable member referred to the varying values of turnips and hay as feed for sheep, it has been shown by practical men, notably the honourable inember for Darling, that the effect of the removal of the duties would be to supply the wants of people nearer the cities, and so enable feed to find its way to the far west. The country immediately round Sydney has been so deficient of feed that there was none to spare for the west, and if by the introduction of turnips we could lessen the demand on the part of these people near the coast, we should increase the quantity of feed available for men further west, and in the interior. It is uot the pastoralists alone who have been demanding the admission of this fodder, although the meetings in Sydney were .attended by some of the greatest pastoralists in New South Wales, and they were unanimous in what they wanted. which is subject to periodical famines a duty of this kind should not be imposed. some honourable members talked about the famine of 1897 and the famine of 1902,1 interjected that in some parts of Australia the famine of 1897 is not over yet. There is much reason for considering that the famine of 1897 is the .famine of 1902, for in cevtain parts of Australia right through. commercial men right through the community. are places to which the mercantile and Mr G. B. Edwards. But trading community have not thought fit to send a representative for the past five or six years. There is not a commercial house in Sydney which has the slightest desire to send a traveller to sell goods in Bourke and elsewhere, because it is known that they cannot be paid for. The producers have no money; the storekeepers have gone We do not see a sudden national insolvent one after another, and there is no desire to do business i u the towns. Every it is experienced all round. individual in the Commonwealth is affected by the drought. The only assistance we can give the pastoralists at the present time is by taking off duties which can operate only when famine is in our midst. The discussion has centred on turnips, but the item includes all forms of vegetables and fruits. Norfolk Island is being cruelly crushed out of existence by the operation of the f r u it duties. The only articles it produces, to any extent, are fruits and vegetables, which We on this side in the past have been exported to New Zealand. Its fruits and vegetables are throughout now left to rot on the ground, because they cannot be sent to Sydney on account of this impost of 2s. per central. The other day Lord Carrington presided at a meeting in the Mansion House, London, to raise funds for establishing a line of steam communication between Norfolk Island and Australia. If his lordship would interest himself in bringing about an alteration in the relations of Norfolk Island with the Commonwealth, he would do more good than can be done by establishing a line of steam communication with the mainland. If we are not careful we shall find the islanders agitating for the island to be placed under the control of the Government of New Zealand. What is the use of these duties on fruits and vegetables? When we have a sufficient crop the duties do not .operate, and that is the normal condition. When the crop is deficient In a country we must have a supply. The very farmers in whose interests the duties were When imposed are, many of them-if I exclude the honourable member for Moira-the strongest advocates for repealing them, or at any rate for suspending them. Certain honourable members have discounted, or feigned to disbelieve the statements which have been made regarding the it has lasted effects of the drought in New South Wales This question concerns and Queensland, and the honourable member for Moira said it .was open at any time for In New South Wales there the pastoralists to plant turnips. I am interested in agriculture only in the smallest possible way, and within 13 miles of SydneyI have had to hand-feed a dry cow for four months, and a crop of turnips I planted nevor came up. The experienco of persons further away must have been more disastrous than mine. A man may sow. tlte seed, but he cannot insure getting a crop in a season when the rainfall is 40 per cent, less than the average for many years past. I hope that the committee will see fit to give this small concession to those who are suffering so much throughout the length and breadth of the Commonwealth. I represent is very seriously affected by the drought, and its interests are vitally at stake. There are no items in the Tariff which appeal more directly at the present time to New South Welshmen than do the fodder duties. I should like to have a reasonable opportunity to submit some information which may lead honourable members who are not acquainted with drought conditions, such as are experienced in the western division of our State, to look with . a little more sympathy on our proposals than they appear, with their present information, .disposed to do. I should.be very thankful, as we are within a few minutes of the hour of adjournment, if the Government could see its way to let the settlement of this question stand over until next Tuesday. Tbe reason why I ask for an adjournment is that a presentment of the conditions has been made by Government supporters, which, to my mind, is. contrary to those which obtain in New South.Wales. An adjournment would enable the people of that State to become acquainted with the statements of those honourable members, and-to place their case before the committee on Tuesday. I .vegetables n.e.i."" be added-put . The com-trust that the Government, recognising the mittee divided. very great interests which are at stake,will agree to an-adjournment. I could not treat the question in anything like a reasonable way -when the hour of adjournment is about to strike. was mode that we should adjourn about twenty minutes to eleven last evening, and it was then understood by every one that we should probably conclude the debate upon this question within a couple of hours. The discussion has, however, lasted all day, and I now ask honourable members to come . to a vote. I can only appeal to honourable members who luive already spoken upon this request to abstain from addressing the committee when tbe next request .comes under discussion. We cannot object to listen then to honourable members who. have not spoken upon this question, but I hope that they will curtail their speeches as much as possible. am willing to defer any remarks I may have to make until Tuesday. MrA . PATERSON (Capricornia) -If the Government accede to the request of the Senatei n regard to the duty upon vegetables, we shall not incur any appreciable loss of revenue, because nearly the whole of the receipts undor the head of fruits and vegetablesare derived from f r u it . If we refuse to meet the views of the' Senate itmay appear that we are determined to force a quarrel upon the other House, and there would be no justification for adopting any such attitude. Ministers have made liberal concessions to manufacturers by exempting from duty articles which constitute their raw materials, and it might reasonably be claimed that tu mips and mangolds are among the raw materials of those engaged in the grazing industry. I do not think honourable members. realize the terrible condition of affairs which prevails iri the northern States owing to the drought. In Rockhampton alone there are .800 empty houses, and wo can well imagine the wail, that would arise if there were 24,000 empty houses in M bourne.
