Some pensions have been reduced to as little as 3s. a week on the ground that the pensioners own property, no regard being paid to the fact that the property is not revenue-producing. Will the Prime Minister give effect to the promise that he made to the deputation of pensioners which I introduced to him at the Commonwealth Bank, Sydney, in January of this year, that in any amendment of our pensions legislation, attention would be given to the position of pensioners owning property which was not revenue-producing, in order that pensioners should not be called upon to suffer undue hardship ? honourable member has .raised, and all other matters relative to pensioners were considered by the Government when its financial proposals were being framed, and also when those proposals were undej discussion in this House.

[3.29] -When ,thc House rose on Friday afternoon last, I was referring to old-age and invalid pensions. I said that there was no necessity for the Government to reduce invalid and old-age pensions, because it had finished the financial year with a balanced budget, the credit for which is due, not to this Government, but to the Scullin Government. This Government's action in reducing pension payments, besides pauperizing and humiliating all recipients of the pension, is a severe blow to those unfortunate people who have to depend upon this income for their living. In the debate on the Financial Emergency Bill, I and a number of other Jionorable members expressed tbe view mat the Government's amended proposals with regard to invalid and old-age pensions were not necessary to save the million and a quarter pounds which the Government expect to save on this account, and that the finances could be benefited in other ways. Experience has proved the correctness of our assumption, for it is well known that, since the act has come into force, thousands of persons who formerly drew pensions in all States have returned their cards, preferring to look to other sources for their income rather than risk losing their homes, under the provisions relating to property qualification. I have had personal experience of a number of such cases. So complicated now is the act that a number Territory (Administration) of officers in the Pensions Department, with whom I have spoken, have admitted that they are somewhat in a quandary with regard to some of its provisions. When the bill was under discussiou, its opponents declared that many of its provisions would be unworkable. This opinion is now being borne out by actual experience. In administrative matters, the Government has thrown too much responsibility on pensions officials. It is unfortunate that officers who, hitherto, have always done their duty satisfactorily should now be placed in this position. This Government's radical interference with the Scullin tariff, which was designed to protect the industries of Australia, has resulted in an increase in customs revenue beyond all expectations. According to the latest figures issued by the Treasury, the surplus for the first three months of the financial year is £2,619,000. If this revenue position cau be maintained, aud if the overseas trade balance be not unduly disturbed, there will be no justification for a reduction of pensions, maternity allowance or Public Service salaries. It is wrong for this or any other Government to interfere with social services when at the same time it is reducing taxation on other sections of the community. The honourable member for Denison( Mr Hutchin), when speaking on Thursday evening last, expressed the view that the Labour Premier of Queensland ( Mr Forgan Smith), had supported the Premiers plan in globo. I think he offered this opinion in reply to a statement made by the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) who, after quoting from a debate in the Queensland Parliament, asked for an authoritative statement from",14,Personal Explanation
61,"Upon Which Mr Scullin Had Moved, By",,15,Lyons
62,Mr George Lawson (Brisbane),"the Prime Minister as to the attitude of the Queensland Government towards the plan. Being closely associated with the Queensland Government, I can say definitely that the Premier of that State does Court have generally had good results. not wholeheartedly support the Premiers plan. What he has done aud is doing is to carry out his election promises. During his campaign, he made it clear that, if returned, his Government would review the Premiers plan. That has been done. Following his election, he attended the conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers at Canberra and Sydney, and declared that ho would not be a party to the adoption of the Premiers plan as he knew it. He agreed to honour certain obligations imposed by the plan on Queensland, but stated that he would not approve of any action to reduce the purchasing power of the people. Denison endeavoured to make the House and the people of Queensland believe that the Premier of that State was wholeheartedly behind this Government in enforcing tlie principles of the Premiers plan. That is not in accordance with the facts. The policy of this Government during the last few months has been directed against the best interests of Queensland. Many honourable members and a great many people outside this House regret the slashing attack which it I do not agree entirely with the Governhas made against the most important of the Queensland industries. The honourable member for Denison also attempted to lecture members on the system of arbitration. Let me remind him that he has not a monopoly of the information with regard to the historyof industrial legislation. I claim to have had ns much experience as he has had. It was somewhat amusing . to hear from the honourable member for Denison( Mr Hutchin) and the honourable member for Adelaide( Mr extent of many millions of pounds each Stacey) what wonderfully good employers they are, and how well they get on with their employees. Bound-table conferences may be all right in certain circumstances, but in my 25 years' experience of industrial affairs, extending from 1908, when 3 was appointed to the first wages board created in Queensland, until 1931, I have found that employers generally take everything they can get and give as little ability to destroy the confidence of inas possible. Round-table conferences between employers and employees have proved valueless in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, whereas conferences presided over by judges of the Arbitration ences would not be failures if men like the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Holloway) represented the workers.' marks of the honourable members for Denison and Adelaide are inconsistent with their action in assisting to deprive the public servants of this country of an award obtained as the result of a roundtable conference. In not dealing with the problem of unemployment, the Government is neglecting its duty. In Queensland, many reproductive works could be undertaken The honourable member for to the advantage of the country generally, as well as of those who would be given employment on them. I hope that before Parliament adjourns the Government will tackle this question seriously, in order that those who are now faced with starvation may at least look forward hopefully to the Christmas festive season.

Not only are our railways under political control, but the costs for rolling-stock and plaut are about 100 per cent, higher than in any other part of the world. This, according to the Prime Minister, involves not only an average annual cost of £23 per head to every income taxpayer, but also an immense burden to every primary producer. Yet the Prime Minister, by the policy of his own Government, is accentuating this disability. Commissioner of Railways urges that all the railways of Australia should be brought under one control, while at the same time he operates the 6 miles of railway from Queanbeyan to Canberra as a separate concern. monwealth Government should ask the New South Wales authorities to manage the few miles of railway between Canberra and Queanbeyan; but the Commonwealth Government insists on a separate way-bill for goods carried between those two places, although they are only half a dozen miles apart, adding greatly to costs here. This sort of thing means unnecessarily high operating costs. The excessive tariff rates imposed by the Commonwealth force the State authorities to pay exorbitant prices for the railway material which it is necessary for them to import; and those authorities are also required to abide by federal industrial awards. The losses on the railways of Australia are not to be met by maintaining high freights, or by forcing the motor truck off the road, but by managing the railways on business, principles, without political interference. Government states thatUntil the transport problem has been solved, commercial undertakings we must keep it is doubtful whether the States can ever them as free as possible from anything regain financial equilibrium, or whether the in the nature of political interference. taxpayers can Jiope for relief.

During the period of six years when I had ministerial control of the railways in Western Australia, I saw to it that the management was free from political influence, and remarkably good results were obtained..

They The Comwere able to make their own industrial arrangements with the Commissioner, free from political interference. During that period of six years, the railway service was entirely contented, and surprisingly good financial results were obtained. I have no desire to boast because of the part that I played in that matter, but I may mention that superphosphate was carried by rail at £d. per ton per mile, and that had never previously been done in any other part of Australia. In the last four years, without raising our freight charges, we increased wages about Is. per day. We reduced freight charges by over £150,000 per annum, paid off all the State debts that had accrued since federation, and for the first time showed a substantial surplus. In two years tbe whole of the good work that had been accomplished was nullified. The mistake that I made was that I did not have^the The Railways Act so amended as to render it impossible for political control to be exercised in the Service.

73,Mr Gregory,"No. I left the conconsistent growth in the salaries of public servants, who also enjoy many concessions that ought not to be tolerated. ""Why should a special allowance be paid to those public servants who have to live in Canberra? Why should not the Public Service Board have unfettered control, and fix the salaries according to the value of the position held ? I am not in favour of low salaries or wages, but I do object to the giving of concessions. Men who are employed outside the Service are not paid child endowment; why, then, should that payment be made to public servants? I know, of course, that the contention is that they defray the cost. The greatest blunder ever made was in the appointment of a Public Service Arbitrator over the Public Service Board. In the Estimates one finds a long list of officials a judge, but when they got into court they who are required by the board to discharge its functions at immense cost; yet the Public Service Arbitrator has the power to reverse many of its decisions. That is preposterous and absurd. I hope that the Government will realize that too much is being taken from the people, and that it is essential to reduce the cost of government. The best means to that end is to amend some of our legislation, and to refrain from interfering with what is entirely the concern of the States. It should also be the policy of the Government to reduce the cost of living. Nothing is more important to a future worthy of this country than an increase in its productive wealth. Knowing the high prices that I have to pay for all the articles that I purchase, I wonder how the worker on low wages manages to carry on. member always votes for proposals to reduce wages. workers have had to suffer reductions. Unfortunately, in the past we have had experience of the operation of slowingdown tactics. If the honourable member compares the labour cost of a house to-day with what it was some years ago, he will find that there have been faults on more than one side in industry. It is dishonesty to practise the art of slowing down and to refuse to give value for the wages received. ber ever stood for higher wages ? according to value received; I do not believe in paying the duffer as much as the man who gives good service. One of the principal results of arbitration has been the destruction of that spirit of service which is essential to the building up of industries. For years I have argued that the Commonwealth should retire from the field of arbitration. I believe that it causes enmity between employers and employees. There are faults on both sides, for we seldom see in company balance-sheets provision for an employees' superannuation fund, as is found in other countries. On the institution of the system, both sides in industry felt that it would be a good thing to have the issues between them decided by found that they were engaged in a fight. I do not suppose that in any country in the world there is the degree of industrial enmity that exists in Australia, notwithstanding our arbitration courts and other industrial tribunals. This is not so pronounced at the present time, because there is so much unemployment. The employers approach the court for reduced wages and increased hours, while the employees seek higher wages and fewer hour3. At the conclusion of a case the men leave the court with the impression that they owe nothing to their employers, and decide to do as little as possible for them. Let us adopt the Canadian system. In that dominion there is no question of the enforcement of conditions by law. In the event of a dispute appearing probable, the Minister for Labour may appoint a commission the honourable to inquire into the merits of the case. That .body endeavours to bring the parties together. If an agreement is reached, it may be registered and have the force of law, so far as the parties interested are concerned, but failing agreement, the commission is bound to publish its findings, and the public is thus able to judge between the parties. The terrible fights that occur between employers and employees in Australia are rarely experienced in Canada.

77,Mr Gregory,"I favour paymentrestriction against trade and industry; and, unfortunately, those restrictions are imposed in the interests of a favoured few. I can understand honourable members opposite, in their desire to help a few big combines, reacting to such a suggestion, but there is not the slightest doubt that such a policy has been followed. I hope that the public will realize that one cannot take out of a pot more than is put into it, and that only the production of wealth will ensure good conditions to our people. The usuallysuggested methods of providing relief against the dread menace of unemployment are to borrow and to inflate the currency. Probably, at a time like the present, with distress so prevalent, a small dose of such medicine is necessary. But the Government must set its face against the continuance of cither method. By the end of this year, wo shall hav<-i inflated to the extent of £100,000,000, and the fact that our public debt now approximates £1,200,000,000, and that we have but few tangible assets to show for that huge sum, should make us realize the failure that has attended the policy pursued by Australian governments of entering into commercial and industrial pursuits. I do not propose to deal now with the tariff or the Ottawa agreement, as the opportunity will be presented later to debate these matters. But one must notice the^demands that have been made by the right honourable the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin) for a continuation of the embargoes, surtaxes, and exorbitant duties, for whose existence he is primarily responsible. Time after time, he has boasted of the alleged success of such devices in changing our adverse trade balance into a favorable one, and, in the interests of a few monopolies, and those engaged in sheltered industry, the right honourable gentleman urges a continuation of that policy. He is careless of the consequent high cost of living imposed upon the workers, and of the effect of that policy on our great primary industries, which are the very life-blood of the nation's commercial activities. I copied the following extract from a report which appears in to-day's press. It refers to a petition signed by 180 leading economists and tariff experts of the United States of America, and presented to President Hoover, and readsMany duties written into tlie Smoot-Hawley Act arc intended to raise prohibitive tariff walls against international trade defy all sound principles of economies. They spread the blight of unemployment, and strangle commerce. They impoverish the working people of all nations, while deluding them with a false promise of improvement of their conditions. It is our earnest belief that farmers, wage-earners, and business men have infinitely more to gain from a reduction than an increase in tariff rates. The contentions of the Leader of the Opposition are absolutely absurd. Employment depends on the purchasing power of the people, which, in turn, depends upon the value of the wealth produced. In contradiction to what the right honourable gentleman says, our imports suffered a decline because we had no money to pay for them. We could not borrow from abroad. The value of our exports fell from £131,000,000 in 1930, to £88,000,000 in 1931, and £84,000,000 in 1932. Unemployment increased enormously, so reducing the spending power of the people. How then could importations continue on a large scale? Does the right honourable gentleman imagine that exporters would force their goods on to us, and seek no payment? Our imports declined for two reasons, chiefly because we had no credits abroad to pay for them, and, to a far lesser degree, because of the restrictions imposed by this Government and its predecessor in ofiice in accordance with an agreement made for political purposes, and not in the interests of the Australian people. An examination of statistics over a long period of years quickly explodes the contention that imports create unemployment. I have here a list showing the value of imports, and the number of employees engaged in factories, and with the leave of the committee I shall have it inserted in HansardEmployed In Imparts.

From the year 1907, when the Commonwealth Statistical Department was established, the figures are for Australia generally. clusively that as imports increase, employment in factories also increases; and -that as imports decrease, employment decreases. We must get down to hard facts, and recognize that only by wealth production can we restore prosperity, and remember that wealth comes from the soil. I should like to know what action the Government proposes to take this year to assist the wheat-growers. I admit that the financial difficulties with which the Government has to contend are great, but it is imperative that it should give serious consideration to the catastrophe that must inevitably follow if our wheat growers are unable to continue operations next year. The result would be disastrous not only to the farmers, but to our manufacturers, to labour, and to trade generally. My advices are that the opening sales of wheat this season w ill be about 2s. 4d. to 2s. 5d a bushel at sidings. Under any conditions that would be unpayable. In Australia, where the costs of production are the highest in the world, and following two disastrous seasons, it is useless to expect a continuation of production unless assistance is given to the growers. I wish again to impress on the Government the advisability of considering the great value that Australia Mr Gregory. derive from a subsidy on the manufacture' Employed in and sale of fertilizers. I suggest that it. Factories. should take effect, not this season, but from January next. The reports of experts indicate that our soils are deficient 51,809,000 248,841 49,777,000 257,494 in phosphate contents, and it has been 61,172,000 266,405 60,014,000 286,861 demonstrated that, by the use of super66,968,000 811,772 phosphate, huge areas may be developed 78,159,000 327,466 79,749,000 337,101 into wheat fields and improved pastures. 103,000,000 395,425 Obviously the resultant increased values 412,410 429,990 would benefit the community even more 157,100,000 439,949 than the individual. This is what Pro151,600,000 436,297 164,700,000 452,184 fessor A . J. Perkins has to say on the 147,900,000 449,728 subject143,600,000 450,482 131,081,000 419,194 With tlic assistance of heavier phosphatic 60,960,000 339,000 44,730,000 dressings to harvested crops, pasture top dressings, &c, it should eventually be possible for a Mallee farm to carry a sheep to the acre on the land available for grazing without any reduction in the area normally allotted to wheat. Professor A. E . V . Richardson, Director of the Waite Agricultura l Institute, also They demonstrate conemphasizes the need for heavier dressings of superphosphate in order to produce maximum crops. The following quotation from his writings is typical of his views on the subject:One striking peculiarity in Australian soils, as compared with those of Europe, is the uniformly low phosphatic content. There is abundance of evidence to show that heavier dressings of phosphates than are now customary could be used to advantage, and that the wheat crop and the grazing value of grass would be materially improved by such liberal dressings. Experiments conducted by the Department of Agriculture (Victorian) at the State farm show conclusively that heavierdressings than are now generally applied would greatly increase production. As the application of soluble phosphates encourage deep-root development, they are beneficial wherever drought conditions are likely to prevail. In New Zealand a bonus was paid by the Government to the manufacturers of fertilizers, with the result that the use of manures was very greatly increased, and this in turn led to an increase in productivity from the land. This Government also should take steps to increase the yield from the land by encouraging the use of fertilizers. It has been demonstrated that, by the use of sulphate of ammonia as a top-dressing on pasture's, the carrying capacity of land in parts of Australia has been increased from one would sheep to three sheep to the acre. farmersto use fertilizers even if no : bounty -were' paid? but if we could cheapen fertilizers, more of them would be used. We should endeavour to encourage increased production, rather than place obstacles in the way as is being done at the present time by high tariff duties. The primary producers have clone their share during the last two years to increase the wealth of the country. The quantity of butter, wool, wheat and fruit exported has been greatly increased, though the lower prices realized have nullified the effort of the producers. I have here a copy of the September report issued by the Bau-k of New South Wales, setting forth the exports of primary products oyer recent years. Compared with the' period 1927 to i929-when , OAving to abnormally high prices one would have expected alarge production for export practicaFly all primary products show a very marked' increase for' 1931-32. The quantity of butter exported increased by 118 per cent., flour by 23 per cent., wheat by 82 per cent., greasy wool by 7 per cent., scoured wool by 11 per cent., mutton arid lamb by 20 per cent., beef by 34 per cent., dried fruits by 23 per cent., and fresh fruit's by 78 per cent. The one big reduction was in hides and sheep skins, probably due to the action of the Labour Government in placing an' embargo* on the export of sheep skins. The' figures show the grea't efforts made by the"" pro1 ducers to play their part in rehabilitating Australia. The volume of our exports could' be still further increased by a more widespread use of fertilizers, as has been amply demonstrated even in this country. During the Western Australian centenary celebrations, pressmen who visited the State from all parts of Australia, were astonished to observe the remarkable yields obtained as a result of top dressing on one farm at York. On that farm the carrying capacity has been increased threefold. It would be better for Australia if we could induce settlement on smaller areas, each with a high level of productivity. I insist that something must, be done to help the wheat-growers this year,and a renewal of the wheat bounty is necessary. I realize, of course, the difficulties of the Government, but it would be a badthing for the 1 manufacturers and the cities if the wheat-growing industry were allowed to collapse. I believe I am ex-pressing the opinion of many United Australia Party members When I say that the Government, in its recent negotiations with the Country party regarding the formation of a coali-^ tion government, went out of its way to widen, rather thanto heal, the breach between the two parties. If its object had been to make effective co-operation between the parties absolutely impossible it could not have chosen a better way.

Earle Page) stating that if certain f members of that party could be induced flo'* agree tb' a coalition on the promise of receiving' portfoliosthe honorable member is not referring to any' individual member of the Government"" speaking of the Government itself.

85,Mr A. Gresn (Kalgoorlie) [4.30],"The need for higher prices for our commodities is no now discovery; it has been shouted from the housetops throughout the existing depression. Indeed, complete recovery without an increase in commodity prices is as impossible as Hamlet without the Prince. The right honourable gentleman would have the people believe that his Government has a monopoly of patriotism, aud even the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory) said that but for the advent of the Lyonp Ministry, there would have been no chance of the restoration of confidence. As a matter of fact, the task of restoration was well in hand before the Laboui Ministry was defeated in circumstances which I need not recapitulate. What has the present Prime Minister contributed towards a restoration of confidence? About twelve months ago, the United Australia Party was formed. The anti-Labour forces have, in common with persons who are well known to the police, a remarkable propensity for frequent changes of name; as soon as one name is in disgrace, they masquerade before the public under another title. Thus we have the United Australia Party, alias the Nationalist party, alias the Liberal party. But the party to which I belong has always been, and always will be, the Labour party. Another peculiarity of the anti-Labour forces in the public life of Australia is their claim to have the support, not only of the Empire, but of everything -hat is good in the world; they almost claim the endorsement of Holy Writ itself. From some of the statements made by the honourable member for Swan( Mr The honourable member for Swan reGregory), I dissent. We all recognize that railway finances are in a sorry state; and all primary producers will declare that freights are too high. Nevertheless, in Western Australia, and 1 believe in other States, super-phosphate for the farmers is carried at a id. a ton per mile, which is about one-third of the actual cost. That fact must be counted to the credit of public ownership. Eveu those who are opposed to the Labour party's' policy will agree that there are some public utilities which we cannot afford to hand over to private enterprise. That is true of the railways; no private organization with continent-wide ramifications should have, as the American Mr A. Oreen. railway companies have had, the power to exact in freights as much as the traffic will bear. The unprofitableness of the railway systems is not a feature peculiar to Australia; the same difficulty is to be observed in other countries. In support of that statement, T quote the following paragraph from the Melbourne Herald of the 12th October:Ottawa, 11th October. Tlie report of the Royal Commission on Transportation tabled in Parliament to-day contains several important recommendations iu addition to those announced iu the summary recently issued. The commission recommends that the capital of the Canadian National Railwavs, which totals $2,000,1)20,370 (£533,985,274 ""at par), should be very heavily written down, but that the time for this operation is not now 'opportune. Tliere must be a cessation at once of the aggressive and uncontrolled competition between the Canadian National and the Canadian Pacific systems. It has been found that money has been wasted by the railways in construction, and in carrying on hotel business. It was ascertained that the private automobile was chiefly responsible for the diversion of traffic from the railway to the highways. Motor coach traffic is not yet, however, of w r y large dimensions. Wp also know that receivers have taken charge of the affairs of some of the railway companies in the United States of America, and that the capital of other concerns has been written down extensively. In some of the more closely settled Australian States, particularly Victoria, traffic .receipts have been very adversely affected by the competition of motor traffic, and this is a problem which will have to receive attention. ferred also to the slowing down in industries. I submit that it is impossible for slowing down to take place in the present circumstances of industry. About 400,000 men are out of work, and any man who goes slow on the job is speedily dismissed. The honourable member for Denison( Mr Hutchin), in au excellently worded speech, sought to show that the Arbitration Court was blasting the prospects of industry, but the fact remains that in all callings, men are working below award rates; with unemployment so widespread, it is impossible for the trade unions to prevent that evil. To-day the employers are getting men to work on their own terms. In many instances work, particularly in the building trade, in which I was engaged for years, is being done by contract. 1 advise lionorable members to read a book . entitled, The Bagged Trousered PhilanIhrophist, written by a carpenter, to enable them to understand the unfortunate position in which men, at that time, were placed owing to the rotten piecework system. competition in the building and other trades is so keen that the employees are unable to earn a living wage. Practically the whole of my boyhood was spent in Melbourne, where, in conjunction with my father aud brothers I was employed, under this wretched system, at about 8s. a day, although the work which I performed was worth very much more. Under this system men have to work at great pressure, and ' consequently are unable to do their best. record of this Government? It undertook to balance the budget; but expenditure had been reduced and taxation increased by the Scullin Government before it went out of office. In order to reduce expenditure, it had to discard long-cherished principles, and sever long political associations. Government considered it necessary to balance the budget, and although members of the industrial section did not agree with its policy, they thought that the workers would be thrown to the wolves if we did not remain in office to protect the interests of the workers. In order to reduce the deficit to £20,000,000, the Scullin Government was compelled to reduce invalid and old-age pensions from 20s. to 17s. 6d. per week. On the other baud, this Government, which has to meet a deficit of only £1,400,000, has not only reduced the salaries of public servants, but has made a further cut in invalid and old-age pensions and the maternity allowance. The matter of a further reduction in soldier pensions was discussed in caucus or Cabinet. The action of this Government in reducing invalid and old-age pensions by £1,100,000 can be characterized as cowardly. reduced expenditure by £8,600,000, and increased taxation by £7,500,000, but this Government, while reducing invalid and old-age pensions, also proposes to reduce taxation paid by those who can well afford to contribute to the revenue of the country. It proposes to lower the status of those who receive less of the good things of life, and to improve the position of those who Under that system the possess more than a fair share of this world's goods. This Government is controlled by some of the leading newspapers of Australia, which are continually bringing before the public the necessity to reduce the cost of social services and taxation. That policy is strongly enunciated by tlie press, and, unfortunately, this Government is subservient to its influence. The Postmaster-General( Mr Parkhill) referred to the restoration of confidence, the reduction in unemploy""What is the ment ancl the fact that the budget would be balanced. But has one additional man been put to work since this Administration has been in power? men have been put to work. of the honourable member, I propose to quote from the Quarterly Summary of Statistics, No. 128, to June, 1932, which deals with unemployment in Australia. The returns furnished by union secretaries show that, for the second quarter of 1931, the percentage of unemployment was 27.6; for the third quarter, 28.3; and for the fourth quarter 2S, or a difference between the third and fourth quarter of only .3 per cent. To show the extent to which confidence was restored when the Lyons Government assumed office, I may say that, for the first quarter of 1932, the percentage was increased from 28 to 28.3, for i,iie second quarter it was 30 per cent., ancl for the third quarter 29.6 per cent. In the aggregate, unemployment has increased since the Labour government was in power. In these circumstances, the right honourable the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin) was justified in directing the attention of the Government to the serious problem of unemployment. Not one shilling has boen provided in the Estimates to assist the 400,000 men who are out of work.

We were told by one gentleman who accompanied the .Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) on his South Australian tour that his' meeting's resembled a Methodist revival service, and that his influence was sweeping over the country like a whirlwind.

This Government has not provided one penny to meet their needs. With aii estimated deficit of only £1,400,000, it is taking £1,100,000 from invalid and old age pensioners.

It will be seen, therefore, that since this Government came into office, Parliament has been in recess twice as long as it has been in session. This is surely unique, particularly as the again that the affairs of the country needed most Careful watching. It' is a wonderful thing' to me that, although the Country party made continuousappeals to the Scullin Government to assist the primary producers, it has scarcely mentioned the subject to this Government, which, it is supporting.

The subject of finance has been dealt with largely by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin). It is the most important problem confronting Australia to-day, and the Government that fails to tackle it-whethe r it represents the Nationalist, Labour or Country partyis entirely failing in its duty. Commonwealth Bank was originally intended to be the people's bank. I have no wild ideas about finance, and I do 'not pretend to understand fully the abstruse views of experts, which, unfortunately, vary to a considerable extent. Our experience during the recent depression, however, has shown that we cannot Shares Banki.

The financial problem is confronting not only Australia but the rest, of the world, and this country, at any rate, should take one step towards solving its financial problems by placing the control of our finance in the will not now deal with the hands of the Commonwealth Bank. I do not say that we should confiscate the debate. In passing, funds of the private banks, or compulsorily suspend their operations. There' are sixteen private banks in Australia, each with separate offices, each showing a profit for its shareholders, and each placing large sums of money to reserve funds every year. We cannot afford to let that waste continue as a charge on primary industry. We must come to some arrangement with the private banks, perhaps in conference with them, with a view to buying them out, or persuading thom to cease operations within a certain period. That is a matter for negotiation and fair dealing. Time has shown that we must, during our critical The periods, depend upon the Commonwealth Bank for the releasing of credits, in order to encourage private enterprise and industry throughout Australia.

Mr E. J. HARBISON (Wentworth) [5.15J I was pleased to hear the remarks of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr A. Green) respecting our trade with the East. ' In reviewing the budget I was particularly struck with the increases of our trade iu the Eastern markets. It is gratifying, particularly when we take into consideration the low prices that have been operating for some time past in the markets of the world, to know that we have increased the value of our sales there from £14,060,000 in 1929-30 to £21,500,000 in 1931-32. That fact shows beyond doubt that our volume of trade overseas is increasing, notwithstanding the depressed state of the market. Still it is obvious that our sales could have been still more increased had we understood better the Eastern conditions and requirements, and had better knowledge and a spirit of sane understanding regarding the requirements of the markets there. The following is a comparative statement of our sales to certain Eastern nations in the years 1928-29, 1929-30, and 1930-31:1928-29. £ China Japan India Dutch East Indies British Malava. . 25,571,170 15,802,974 1S,017,410 Balance Valuation of Reserve Assets over Amount Paid Carried Landed and Liabilities.

I have no doubt that honourable members will be surprised that we are doing such a volume of trade with the Eastern. countries, although it is to be deplored that we have not maintained the value of our exports. Lower prices have certainly played some part in that. There is a stage in the life, not only of every nation, but also of every business, at which natural trade expansion ceases, and I feel it is necessary for Australia, if she is to take her place among the nations of the world, to seek expansion of trade overseas. Now that conditions are improving, and reverting to something like those of 1928-29, we should establish ourselves in these rising markets, particularly as they may become of considerable importance to us. The figures that I have quoted show irrefutably that the Eastern markets are worth ' exploiting. At present we are touching only the fringe of those markets, taking into consideration tlie immense populations of the Eastern countries. China has a population of 500,000,000; Japan of 1929-30. 1930-31. 90,000,000, and the Dutch East Indies of £ £ 53,000,000. There is, therefore, in those 1,117,142 273,507 3,330.113 11,518,980 0,555,003 9,500,499 countries an immense opportunity for 8,874,947 5,452,421 2,949,375 the sale of the products of this continent, notwithstanding the concessions that we 2,075,664 2,122,722 1,412,500 have granted to the British Empire as a result of the Ottawa Conference. The 1,984,431 1,399,321 818,917 British Empire must be our first consideration, but we should not be blinded by tbe decisions of the Ottawa Conference. I think Australia would have derived a greater advantage had we lowered the British duties instead of increasing foreign duties. when the British markets may not be assured to us. ""We must have a greater expansion of trade. markets elsewhere to ensure that, if the time does come when the British markets are lost to us, we shall not have a lopsided development in our commerce. It, therefore, behoves us to watch the Eastern markets carefully. that our proximity to the East, or our neglect to take advantage of the conditions operating in the Eastern countries, or even our White Australia policy, has prevented us from exploiting their markets as we should. It may be that we have naturally built up jealousies and prejudices which other countries have avoided. Those countries, by intensive organization and by entering into trade treaties, are improving their position in the Eastern markets. Figures that I have quoted show the effect that this intensive drive has had against us. When one considers the efforts of the Australian governments and our producers as a whole, one wonders whether the advantages to be derived from the Eastern markets are fully understood. Australia has much plant which is idle and rusting because of the internal trade depression. If we use that idle plant, and put our men in employment, it will be necessary for us, if Australia is to take its place among the nations of the world,, to dispose of our surplus products overseas. We must carry out an aggressive campaign in the East, but not necessarily against the trades and industries of the Eastern countries. Their peoples would certainly object to any aggressive policy on our part which was likely to interfere with their local trades and industries, which are of considerable economic value to them. But we are entitled to sell to those countries commodities which we can produce possibly a little better and more profitably than any other country. nations in the East have no natural resources. peculiarly resources. Mr E. J. Harrison. which may have natural resources are not properly exploiting or developing them. Therefore, they must, for some considerable time to come, import raw The time may come and semi-manufactured materials. China, with its internal jealousies, riots, and continuous wars, and other Eastern We must 3eek countries in which there is a total absence of primary education, has little or no opportunity to exploit fully the natural wealth of the soil. Since the government of China is not consolidated, it is likely that, for many years to come, the It may be Western nations will find a ready market for their products in that country. Doubtless the time will come when China will concern herself with the development of her own natural resources; until then it behoves us to take advantage of the very profitable market available to usthat lies within a few days' steam from our shores. The internal disturbances in China may tend to restrict our trade in that growing market, but I can assure honourable members that our rivals are losing no time in strengthening their position. Many of them have appointed trade representatives and commissioners,, and are spending immense sums of money iu extending their trade relationswith the East. In 1900, China imported from other countries, in round figures,. 211,000,000 taels worth of goods-the tael being equivalent to 2s. I d . in English sterling-and in 1929 her imports had increased in value to 12,657,821,000 taels a truly remarkable development. ment doing to secure a portion of that trade ? Mr E. J. HARRISON I suggest that action should have been taken by the party to which the honourable member belongs when it was in power to appoint trade commissioners and make trade agreements with China and Japan and other countries in the Far East. The sister dominions of New Zealand, South Africa, and Canada have done this. They recognize the immense advantages to be gained by thus Some increasing their trade. Canada has been particularly active in this matter. She Japan, in particular, is has trade representatives at Kobe and enough without natural Tokio, in Japan, and also in Manchuria Other Eastern countries and in North, Central, and Southern China. Successive Australian govern-",26,Commonwiialth
92,Mr Riokdan,"What is this Governmerits have failed to follow up our trade advantages in these markets, and, so far, we have made no trade agreements with these far-Eastern countries. Of all the important nations doing business with China, Australia is the only country with1 out a commercial representative in the East. Consequently, we have been unable to take advantage of the resultant lower rates of duty. Canada is spending approximately £40,000 a year in developing her overseas markets, in the interests of her primary and secondary industries. It is important to remember, also, that the Eastern nations are becoming westernized,so that in fabrics there is an increasing demand for wool 'm preference to cotton,, and their foodstuffsare being, changed to conform to those in use by Western nations. The market, being, a naturally cheap owe,, price is necessarily an important factor in successful competition for trade. Hitherto our high costsof production, have limited our remunerative exports, to wool and wheat, for which there is a good demand... Since it is not likely that we. can cut production costs below a. certain level,, we should' endeavour to establish a reputation for quality that will enable us to. secure and retain a footholdin that market. South Africa is now a. competitor withus in. wool,, andas production, costs are lower in that country than in. Australia, it will, be a. formidable trade rival to us ih the near future. Our position, with regard to wheat exports sh.oul.di be rather better,, because of the mechanization of the industry. Furthermore;, the excellent-milling, quali ty of our Bard wheat gives, us a distinct advantage over Canada in Eastern, markets. If we do not hold our export, business in wool and wheat, our trade with tlieEast w ill be ruined. that trade for years. Mr E. J. HARRISON -Yes ; but we have not made the progress we should 1 have made. Ohina has bought only a certain amount of Australian wheat, ancl I suggest that combined action be taken to keep clown costs in all directions, including interest or*inflated land values so that we may extend our sales'in the East very materially. As with our wheat and wool, so with our minerals. We have immense mineral deposits, but owing, to high costs of production, we are able to develop only the richest of our resources. Mineral propositions which would be profitably developed in the United States of America and Canada are neglected in this country on account of the high cost of production. I consider it essential, if we are to hold our trade with China and Japan, to have a more diversified exportation to those countries. To achieve this end, it is necessary for this Government to tackle the high cost of production and distribution. We are exporting a fairly wide range of products, but our business is not increasing rapidly enough Take for example our trade with Chinain 1930. Of a total import trade of, in round figures 1,500,000-000' taels, Australia and New Zealand supplied only about 7,000,000 taels This seems to be a) ridiculously low figurein view of our' proximity to that market, and our other natural advantages .

Mr E. J. HARRISON-Trad e representatives such as I have in mind would be persons possessing an intimate knowledge of the conditions of this country, and persons in whom the people repose (.lie utmost confidence. I doubt that the necessary business knowledge and experience is to be found in the ranks of the Public Service. As with individuals, so with governments. To win confidence is the first consideration. The governments of the countries to which our trade representatives may be appointed must have complete confidence in them and in us if our business relations are to be developed along satisfactory lines. There is definite need for trade agreements between Australia and these far-Eastern countries if we are to hold the markets which we already possess. Statistics show that the balance of trade between Australia and China, and between Australia and Japan, is largely in favour of Australia. In regard to Japan, Australia ranks fourth as regards imports, and twelfth as regards exports. In my opinion, this state of affairs will not continue long, for claims that South African wool is not already Japan is complaining of the goods imported from Australia. Eor the ten years ended 1931, Japan exported to Australia goods valued at 391,932,938 yen, and imported from Australia goods to the value of 1,170,631,740 yen. Japan resents that her unfavorable balance of trade with this country amounted to £77,S69,870 for those ten years, and is now endeavouring to foster trade with South Africa by way of retaliation. Similar conditions exist in connection with our trade with China. During a period of eight years, China exported to Australia goods valued at 7,754,959 taels, and imported from Australia goods to the value of only 35,259,975 taels; an unfavorable balance of trade, viewed from the Chinese stand-point, of 3,438,127 taels, or approximately £515,719 per annum. That is a serious state of affairs. These Eastern nations, to which we look to buy our goods, are in turn seeking markets for their goods, but instead of encouraging reciprocal trade with them, we raise a high tariff wall against their goods, and place other restrictions on trade with them. We will not send trade representatives to their countries, or enter into trade agreements with them. the honourable member suggests and at the same time grant a preference to British goods? Mr E. J. HARRISON -Our resources are sufficient for us to develop markets both in the East and in European countries if only we reduce the cost of production and handle things properly. Emjtire will give offence to Eastern nations no less than will preference to A ustraliau mamifacturers. Mr E. J. HARRISON -Not necessarily. If our goods are right, and our prices reasonable, and if , in addition, we are represented in these countries by the right men, we shall have the preference which our geographical position gives us. Let us see how South Africa treats Japan. During 1931, Japanese goods valued at 19,282,605 yen were disposed of in South Africa, and in return, Japan bought from the sister dominion goods to the value of 1,332,952 yen. Japan regards South Africa as a good customer, and now only better than ours, but that it is also better graded. Mr E. J. HARRISON I refer the honourable member to the Gepp and Melbourne reports. In the past, Australian wool was well graded, excellently sorted, and well baled, but now Japanese buyers accuse us of bad grading and sorting, and false baling. Mr E. J.

Complaint is also made that representations of birds that are regarded in the East as sacred are used for commercial brands. It is necessary thoroughly to study the requirements of Eastern markets. In the past we have not regulated the quantity of our exports of various commodities, but it is definitely necessary to establish quotas. Our practice has been merely to exploit the markets when we have had surplus production, whereas we should build up a steady trade. The following table shows the value of our exports to China during the period from 1922 to 1929 Year. 1922 1923 1924 7,000,000 1925 1926 1927 192S 1929 .. 0,000,000 Those figures show that our exports to the East cannot be said to have been stabilized.

Cannot we now create a sinking fund of steady markets in the East, so that when the pendulum of adversity again swings against us, we shall be prepared, by reason of careful trade organization, to meet a period of depression. It is the duty of the Government to cooperate with the producers to see that these markets are exploited to the full. It should appoint trade commissioners for the East, establish bureaux of commerce, and send special representatives abroad t<5 investigate trade conditions in these countries. About six weeks ago, the budget speech was delivered, and since then a series of supplementary budget speeches have Taels. been made by the Prime Minister( Mr 1,000,000 Lyons) and other members of the Go.. 3,000,000 vernment. So conflicting have some of 1,000,000 the speeches been, that it is difficult to .. 4,000,000 know whether to discuss the original .. 1,000,000 announcement or those which have been .. 2,000,000 made since. Formerly the Treasurer's budget speech was taken to indicate the final and considered financial policy of the Government for the year. The speech was framed, as a rule, after careful deliberation on the part of the Government; but it seems to me that, in many respects, the present Government has set a new standard of vacillation, and has practically said that if its supporters do not like some of the most important proposals in the budget, these will be replaced by others that may suit. We were given to understand, in the first invalid and old-age pensioners had been carefully considered by the Government before its financial proposals were brought down, yet before Parliament had had an opportunity of discussing them, the pensions payment was altered. In my opinion, the alteration made the position worse; of the two the Government's original proposal was less obnoxious. But it Avas extraordinary that the Government should have changed its policy in this regard before the matter had been discussed in Parliament. One of the most important features of the budget was the announcement that a considerable number of tariff reductions had been provided for. This proposal was very acceptable, indeed, to the party",32,Commonwiialth
102,Dr. Earle Page (Cowper) [5.59],"which I have the honour to lead; but we have been rather dismayed by the fact that within six weeks of the announcement of the remission of duties, the Government has tabled a schedule which involves 429 increases of duty. My party was particularly pleased some six weeks ago to know that the primage duty on galvanized iron had been removed. that as a definite gain to country people throughout Australia. But a fewdays ago, the disturbing announcement was made that the Government had reconsidered the position, and had decided to reimpose that duty. ""Under the agreement made with the British Government at the Economic Conference at Ottawa, protection is to be afforded only to industi-ies that have definite commercial possibilities, and yet provision is made, in the uew tariff schedule, for a 10 per cent, increase in the duty on clothes wringers. Many members on the Government side recently voted against the former increase in duty, and I believe that the national position, with a view to distwo members of the Cabinet actually refrained from voting on it. A few weeks ago, before the Resident Minister in London( Mr Bruce) . left the United States of America, he made a speech which was broadcast from Washington, and in it he said that the forthcoming world conference could not be successful unless tariffs the world over were reduced. He declared that there had to be a settloment of the war debts problem, and also a reduction of tariffs. Yet, despite that announcement, this Government proposes to raise the Australian duties against other nations in 429 instances! It is most difficult to reconwe must make every effort to recile within a short space of time such conmove the shackles that at present are flicting statements of policy as those rehampering industry. By a lowering of cently made. Personally, I should like to know exactly, what may be considered to be the definite policy of the Government in regard to tariffs. When we come to the budget figures themselves, we notice that this year the Government is budgeting for a deficit. It is true that the deficit is said to be covered by the surplus of last year; but we find that the accumulated deficit has increased from £4,900,000, the figure at which it stood when I left the Treasury, to £17,216,000 this year, despite the fact that during the last two years, £2,900,000 per annum less than when I was Treasurer has been paid into the sinking fund. The present budget vindicates my Treasury record. The figures that apply to my term of office stand out in sharp contrast against those of the Treasurers who have succeeded me. ""We regarded Since the delivery of the budget speech, the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) has referred to the possibility of the reduction of taxation. I trust that the revenue will be found sufficient to enable that to be done. If the Government is of the opinion that the customs receipts this year will be largely in excess of the estimate, and that there is the possibility of a remission of taxation on that account, it should take Parliament and the country frankly into its confidence. The budget debate affords honourable members an opportunity of examining, not only governmental finance, but also covering remedies for our ills. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin) has suggested that the problem of unemployment, which is by far the most serious of the problems with which we are confronted at the moment, should be met by the inauguration of a vigorous works policy, the financing of which should be by the nationalization of banking and the release of public credits. I consider that it is not advisable to proceed with public works to any great extent, which, in the past, have proved unproductive rather than productive. If we are to get the people back to work, taxation and of tariffs-whic h I consider would lead to a greater amount of revenue being received-w e must make it possible for private enterprise to employ a larger number of persons. An examination of the figures relating to employment will reveal that private enterprise is responsible for 90 per cent., and governments for only i0 per cent, of it . Thus it is to private enterprise that we must look for the solution of the problem of unemployment. I am pleased to be able to congratulate the Government upon the fact that, since the budget was presented, the conversion of the New South Wales loan has been effected on such exceptionally favorable terms. I endorse the claim that was made this afternoon by the Prime Minister regarding the merit of that operation. The position in regard' to long-term loans differs considerably in Australia and Great Britain. I hope that in the future we shall be able to obtain even better terms, and judging by our experience in the 'nineties, I believe that we shall. At that time, even though Australia had passed through a period of very serious depression, we were able to borrow at as low a rate as 2& per cent. The Sydney Bulletin, which as honourable members know is not a very strong supporter of mine, points out that the recent conversion on such favorable terms was made possible by an act that I , as Federal Treasurer, was responsible for having placed among the laws of the nation. The creation of the Loan Council, and the incorporation of the principle underlying it in the Financial Agreement that was ultimately adopted by the whole of Australia, led to every State having the advantage of the credit of the nation. It is worthwhile remembering that when that fight was being waged in this Parliament, the Labour party fought and voted against the validation of the Financial Agreement, and stated definitely that it would compass its destruction at the first opportunity. right honourable gentleman's word for that. prove the truth of my statement. gentleman is taking the whole of the credit. placing before honourable members the opinion of the Bulletin. Under the heading "" State Loans and the Commonwealth "" that journal in its last issue saysEarle Page may at least bo given full credit for the creation of the Loan Council. At the beginning-in 1923-it was little more than a consultative body, consisting of the treasurers of the Commonwealth and the States, the object being to prevent cut-throat competition due to clashing in the raising of loans. From the outset it did its job in a business like way. Dealing with the Financial Agreement, it saysFrom this date (1st Jul}', 1929), it assumed "" As between the Commonwealth and the States the liabilities of the States to the bondholders."" It is due to Earle Page to say that he is entitled to the full credit for that measure also-includin g the sinking fund. An examination of the budget figures discloses three striking features. First, they vindicate my treasury record, and completely give the lie to every criticism, in this chamber and outside it, of my administration. The charge of extravagance that has been levelled against me is shown to be a myth. If I were extravagant in good times, when the national income was £650,000,000, how dore ancl the present Treasurer in the succeeding years when the national income had shrunk! gentleman was in office in very prosperous times. fact, I spent less than the government with which the honourable gentleman was associated. On page 4 of the budget papers will be found set out the total expenditure under Part1 for the past five years. In 1928-29, the last year that I was in office, the expenditure under that part was £51,899,077. The national income in that year, which was one of great prosperity, was £650,000,000. Iu 1929-30, when prosperity had commenced to decline, Mr Theodore, as Treasurer in the Scullin Labour Government, spent under the same head £52,304,000; and in the sticceeding year, the expenditure was £52,249,000, although the national income had dwindled to something like £450,000,000. Last year, the present Government expended £43,865,000. But to make a proper comparison, several items must be added to that amount. The first is the sum of £4,100,000, representing interest due to the British Government, which was paid by the two previous governments, but suspended during last year. Then, too, the payment by this Government into the sinking, fund was £2,900,000 less than was the case three years ago, and an amount of £4,000,000 in interest has been saved under the com-",33,Commonwiialth

These various amounts, without the interest reduction of £4,000,000 total £S,600,000 which, if added to the £43,S65,000 spent last year, make a grand total of £52,465,000, or £400,000 more than the amount expended during my last year of office. That is a complete vindication of my regime as Treasurer, and an adequate answer to my critics. If we also take into £4,000,000-whic h was really a tax on the bondholders under the compulsory conversion scheme, a sum that was neither collected in revenue nor paid out in expenditure during last year-it will be seen that, during the last three years, tliere has not been in what might be termed the essential governmental expenditure of the Commonwealth, a decrease anything like commensurate with the decline in our national income. I am not indulging in carping criticism, but am proving that if there is anything in the comparison I have made between my administration and that of my successors in office, the criticism levelled against me, that I was an extravagant Treasurer, could more aptly be applied to the critics themselves. Possibly the best method of assessing the real control that was exercised by myself as Treasurer is by examining the departmental expenditure of the Treasury. When I first took control of that department at the beginning of 1923, the total departmental expenditure for the year was £1,019,000, whereas for the last year in which I was Treasurer it was only £656,000, a reduction of approximately £350,000. In the following year, a term in which the national income had appreciably fallen, and when my great critic, Mr Theodore, was in office, the expenditure for the Department of the Treasury was £670,000, or £14,000 more. In the following year, with the Treasury still under the control of Mr Theodore, i lie expenditure was £714,000, and last year, under the control of the present Government, it was £66S,000, while this year the estimated cost of the Treasury is £666,000, or £10,000 more than the cost incurred in 1928-29, when I was Treasurer. ' Thus, to prove beyond dispute that the charges of exspent on defence £1,600,000 travagance that have been levelled against rue are groundless, I need do nothing more than quote the official figures of the budget. Let me take the ordinary departmental votes, a reasonable basis of comparison. In 192S-29, a period of great S posperity, as the Deputy Leader of the pposition has said, the total departmental votes amounted to £2,987,000, and they approximated the same figure during the two succeeding years. This consideration the year, when the Premiers plan is in operation, and a reduction of 20 per cent, has been made in Public Service salaries, the departmental votes total £2,361,000. Apparently all that the Government can do to improve the position is to make that preentage cut. At any rate, despite the pressure of the economic crisis, it has proved itself incapable of controlling the departments any more rigidly than I controlled them three years ago. The comparison is so obvious that it is unnecessary for me to labour it further; if I was an extravagant Treasurer, those who have followed me have been infinitely more extravagant. AlthoughI was in office during a time of booming prosperity, I exercised such strict supervision that I reduced the cost of administration in my own department by £350,000. I brought it down to a figure that cannot be improved upon even in these times when the public so insistently demands economy on the part of the Government. It is imperative that the cost of taxation and administration should be reduced. As the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Paterson) recently pointed out, if existing rates of taxation continue, it will be impossible to decrease interest on mortgages, that is, on private enterprise, the life-blood of the country. Every avenue must be explored in the endeavour to bring down that interest and effect an expansion of industry. I shall try to show how it can be done, but, first, I wish to draw attention to some features of the budget which need considerable discussion and clarification. First of all, I ask what is going to happen to the unfunded debt",35,Commonwiialth
110,Dr. Earle Page,"In 1928-29of the Commonwealth and States which the Prime Minister says now amounts to about £82,670,000? That means that, during the past three years, there has been what might be termed camouflaged borrowing to that extent; actually, it means that the annual. average rate of borrowing has been roughly £27,000,000, which does not materially differ from the rate of borrowing prior to the depression. The position in that respect is therefore unchanged, and the Government, apparently, is making no endeavour to face it. that formerly money was borrowed to finance public works, whereas recently it has been borrowed to finance deficits. Dr. £33,000,000 has been spent upon works, but the remainder has been used to make good deficits. In any case, many of the works upon which the money secured by these means has been spent are not reproductive, and it is certainly difficult to justify the adding of a great proportion of it to the national debt. Take, for instance, the £3,000,000 -unemployment winter loan for the year just ended. I have sought diligently, but can find no provision for the amortization of that amount for which there is no tangible asset in the community. Surely, something should be set aside for its redemption! Provision has been made for the amortization, over a period of 15 years, of £3,400,000, which is being paid out of our overdraft on account of wheat bounty; and I think that £325,000 is to be set aside this year as the first instalment. Had the policy advocated by the Country party for the last two years been adopted, the wheat-growers would have been assisted by means of a sales tax on flour, and their position would have been on a much sounder financial basis; year, with the wheat-growers in just as desperate straits as last year, the problem could have been dealt with satisfactorily, and without the Government's hesitation and the general difficulties that assuredly must arise in the payment of a bounty-becaus e the last bounty has not been paid for. The position of the wool industry is still most doubtful. It is common knowledge that the industry carried on last year at a loss of some £7,400,000. If , as the result of the findings of the committee of inquiry which has been appointed to investigate that great industry, the real backbone of Australia, it is found that it needs assistance, that assistance must be forthcoming during this temporary period of stress, no matter what the cost may be. But it is essential that we should put our finances on an absolutely sound basis, so that we may be able to help the stabilization of these important industries. An investigation of the Government's overdrafts, and an examination ofthcbank balances, impress upon the observer the fact that during the last three years there has been a change in the character of the advances made by banks. Three vances was practically the same as it is today, but an analysis of them shows thai this year £30,000,000 more has been advanced to governments, and £30,000,000 less to private enterprise. It is obviour that we must look to private enterprise for that rehabilitation of the country which is desired by all, and we must, therefore, do something to ensure that private enterprise and not governments receives the revivifying blood supply of our finance. I am satisfied that we shall not escape from this depression until we courageously face the facts. When we suffered a depression in 1890, the taxation in this country was roughly £3 par capita. To-day, Federal and State taxation aggregate approximately £14 per capita. That is a terrific additional burden which make3 it imperative that every endeavour should be made, during the next couple of years, to cut down costs of government, Federal, State, or local government, and concentrate upon finding a way out of our difficulties: and this otherwise we shall never win through. This budget, Avhich should express the Government's policy for the year, makes no mention of any constitutional reform which will enable the cost of government to be systematically reduced. There is a growing insistence for a complete examination of the whole position of Federal and State duplication, to see whether it is not possible to cut out overlapping and unnecessary costs, not only in government, but also those that impose",36,Commonwiialth

Much more could be done in the way of effecting co-ordination of Commonwealth and. State social services. Many honourable members will recall that in 1928 I brought down a bill to deal with the whole subject of national insurance. If that scheme were implementing now, we should have been able to save from £200,000 to £300,000 a. year on invalid pensions, because they would be on a contributory basis instead of being, as at present, solely a charge upon the revenues of the Commonwealth, and this year's budget might have been lightened by from £500,000 to £800,000.

The experts who were called in to advise governments on these matters have told us that in this way only lies safety. They They lead to have declared that we must first reduce the cost of government, and then so raise price levels as to reduce the As I have mentioned existing gap between the prices of farm products, and those of industrial products. The Prime Minister( Mr Lyons), and Commonwealth telegraph in his budget speech, as shown on page 9 of that document, quoted the recommendations of the economists, as follows:That equilibrium between costs and prices be sought as a basis for the restoration of employment. That Parliament authorize the Commonwealth Bank to manage the exchange rate to this end, taking into account economic conditions. Those recommendations are on all-fours with the declaration of the Currency Committee at Ottawa, that we must, by some means or other, raise .price levels. It is now generally recognized that world recovery must begin from the point of raising price levels in such a way as to reduce the gap between the price of farm produce and that of manufactured goods. No general world recovery will take place unless steps are taken in a local and^ special manner to bring about this result. If this process can be begun in Australia we shall so restore prosperity and confidence, not only to our governments, but throughout the whole range of industry, that money will once more become available for investment. It is of little value to Australia that government bonds are at present selling at a premium. people are afraid to put their money into industry, because they have no confidence and fear ultimate loss. bring about a condition of affairs which will restore to the farmer, who owes money on his property, some equity in that property; to the workman who has borrowed money to build a house, some equity in his home; and to debtors generally some prospect of repaying what they owe in somewhat the same terms of currency as those in which they incurred their indebtedness. Andi f , at the same time, we can bring into closer relation with each other the prices of farm products and manufactured goods, wo shall be beginning to stimulate employment, and make progress. How is this to be done? The economists have said that Parliament authorize the Commonwealth Bank to manage the exchange rate to this end, taking into account economic conditions. Let us examine what it is that determines the exchange rate under normal conditions; that is, when we are on a gold basis. We have now been off the gold standard for three years. It was in December, 1929, that an act was passed through this Parliament definitely removing us from the gold standard, and it will probably be five years at least, if not longer, before we get back to that standard. It is imperative that, at the earliest possible moment, we should fix upon some scientifically exact basis to determine the proper rate of exchange which shall govern tbe trading transactions between Australia and foreign countries. If we can so fix upon some means of managing the exchange rate in the interests of the people of Australia as a whole as to maintain the price of farm products, and at the same time reduce costs of production, Or. ilarlc Page. we shall have not only taken an important step towards solving our local problems, but also have made a big contribution towards solving the problems of the world. Let us examine what determines the rate of exchange, disregarding all embroidery such as tariffs, &c. If , when we were on the gold standard, £100 would buy in Great Britain as much as £125 would buy in Australia, the It merely indicates that effect would be to stimulate every English exporter to send as much goods to Australia as possible. He would sell for £125 We need to in Australia £100 worth of English goods, and receive payment in England of, say, £123 10s. The effect would be that every British exporter would want to send goods to Australia, and soon there would be in England a big demand for Australian money, which would tend to raise the rate of exchange. As more and more British exporters endeavoured'to reap the benefit of the Australian market, the competition both among themselves and with Australian manufacturers would so tend to reduce the price of goods in Australia, that our market would cease to be attractive, as price levels would fall and the rate of exchange rise and the volume of imports from England would fall off. Thus, with the exchange rate rising and our price levels declining by should reason of increased competition, English traders would limit their exports, and the balance of trade between Australia and Britain would tend to adjust itself. Professors Gregory and Cassel, as well as other economists, have stated that the fundamental principle which governs the volume of trade crossing international frontiers in normal times is the fact that the volume of trade is, in the final analysis, governed by the difference in price levels in the trading countries. But Australia is now off the gold standard and the rate of exchange is no longer automatically regulated by the ability to take payment in gold. We have gone on to a managed exchange rate, and it will be many years before we get back to the gold standard. Therefore, it is necessary that, at the earliest possible moment, we should establish contact on a real standard with something stable-eithe r sterling or gold. We should-, know 'what exactly is the difference between the purchasing power of our money, and the purchasing power of sterling in London, or gold in New York. The Country party suggests, as did the honourable member for Corio( Mr quoted in Winnipeg at 61£ cents a bushel; Casey), that there should be set up an economic committee of experts to determine the actual facts of the case, aud to advise the Government upon the real difference between the purchasing power of Australian and English money. When that is done, there could be evolved some formula whereby we could use the known relationship between English and Australian money as one of the factors in determining the rate of overseas exchange. At present nobody knows where we are. This is clearly demonstrated by two recent experiences. During 1930, the exchange rate had been kept for most of the year at 6 per cent., and then it slipped up to 9 or 10 per cent.; when the .Bank of New South Wales broke away from the exchange pool it immediately rose to 30 per cent., showing that previously it had been kept at an unnaturally low level. Again, in August, .1931, we were 30 points off sterling when sterling was on the gold standard. Then, one day, Britain went off the gold standard, and sterling immediately went 30 points off gold, but we, instead of then being on a par with sterling, were still 30 points off sterling, ing the last month we have seen a gradual and 60 points off gold. There had been no variation in Australian price levels to account for this sudden and violent fluctuation in the exchange rate. WhatI have suggested in the way of Kingdom at world prices; therefore, we setting up an expert committee to get the must make certain that we get the full facts arid to provide machinery to keep advantage of the exchange rate, so that exchange stable at a rate that suits the the primary producer may receive a fair exporting industries is exactly what return.

[Leave to continue given.] In Liverpool, on the Sth August, thu price of wheat was 66$d. per central, while on the 15th October it was still 63-kl. per central, a drop of only 3d. per central. Thus in England where exchange is being managed by the Bank of England in accordance with the plan I have suggested should be adopted in Australia, the fall in the price of wheat was only 3d. per central, whereas in Canada, where no such system of control operates, the fall was as much as 8d. a bushel. Simultaneously, the fall in Australia was from 3s. 6d. to 3s. 2d. f.o.b., or about half that which occurred in the uncontrolled markets of the world. The only justification for not stabilizing the exchange would be the certainty that world prices will rise; but although there has been a mild boom in the United States of America, largely due to the reflationary effort to pump credit into the system, that phase has passed, and durrecession of prices the world over. The condition on which Australia gets the preference of 3d. a bushel on wheat under the Ottawa agreement is that it must be able to offer its wheat iu the United",37,Earle Page About Years Ago The Amount Of Those Bank Ad

113,Dr. Earle Page,"That must be fairly large, tbe wool clip will be slightly less than it was last year, whilst the returns from butter will be nearly 20 per cent. down. We shall be lucky if we receive within 5 per cent, of the £78,000,000 we received last year for our exports; a considerable rise in world prices would have to occur before we could get much more. On the other hand, a large increase of imports is assured. During the last eighteen months imports have been so restricted that stocks of many indispensable materials not made depleted. the sales of goods had increased by 10$ per cent, over those for the corresponding period of last year, yet there was 10 per cent, less goods on the shelves of 40 of the big firms than there was at the beginning of that month twelve months earlier. With a bigger demand and depleted stocks of goods, many of which are not produced in Australia, business cannot be carried on unless we import. I am convinced that these goods will be imported. Moreover, the importers have learned to buy and sell futures in exchange. They have become more or less accustomed to exchange as a factor in their dealings, and it is not the deternecessarily mean scarcity of money in rent to business that it was eighteen months ago. Rut unless something is done to stabilize exchange and avoid the wide fluctuations and big lurches which dislocate business, the position will become such before long that the Commonwealth Bank will lose control, as it did in January of last year. In comparison with the amounts nt our disposal four years ago the funds at present available in London are still alarmingly inadequate. In August, 1928, those of the Commonwealth Bank amounted to nearly £24,000,000. In Australia the note issue was backed by £22,000,000 worth of gold, and there was a further £23,000,000 worth in the vaults of the private banks. That £45,000,000 of gold in Australia was liquid money, which could, if necessary, he transferred to London for the adjustment of international balances. In other words, we had available at that time £69,000,000 worth of liquid money, as compared with about £24,000,000 to-day. The Commonwealth Bank funds are roughly £14,000,000, and our gold Dr. Earle Page. reserve about £10,000,000, yet at the present time it is more necesssary to have money available in London, because, whilst in 1928 we could have raised loans to ease our position, I doubt if we shall be able to float new loans for new money abroad for many years. In deed, we should not attempt to do so. I hope that we shall be able to convert our maturing loans on good terms, but we must endeavour to avoid new borrowing abroad. It is essential for us to build up in London in Australia have become the largest practicable fund, not only In August of this year to meet the interest bill and pay for essential imports, including tea, rubber, and the raw material of our local industries, but also, if necessary, to pay off a proportion of any loan that may be maturing. With substantial funds available in London we can negotiate much more favorable terms in connection with any proposed conversion. Therefore, before we attempt to bring the rate of exchange below its present level we should resolve to build up an insurance fund in London against any vicissitudes that may occur. I am not afraid of the consequences of building up big funds in London under the control of the Commonwealth Bank. Such a proceeding need not Australia, because by the amending act of this year it is possible for the bank to issue notes in Australia against sterling assets in London. Such assets can be held there to meet any emergency, whilst money can be made available by the bank in Australia to meet seasonal and commercial requirements. Machinery for the stabilization of exchange similar to that adopted in the United Kingdom should be introduced in Australia. The British system cannot be truly said to be governmental interference with the Bank of England, nor would political interference with the Commonwealth Bank be involved in the creation of an exchange adjustment fund to protect the bank against losses resulting from its efforts to stabilize the exchange rate. ' To carry out such a scheme the Commonwealth Bank must be prepared to buy all exchange offered by the associated banks and private commercial houses; otherwise, it cannot effectively stabilize exchange ; but the country as a whole must be prepared to provide the money to enable these operations to be carried on without risk to the bank. If the bank were directed to regulate exchange according to a formula drawn up by experts which had regard to the purchasing power of our money, as compared with that of other countries, we couid have the same stability in exchange as when the country was on the gold standard. Exchange should not be stabilized at an absolutely fixed figure. There should be a possibility of slight variation, according to the disposition of our funds in London. The adoption of obviate the big variations that otherwise will assuredly occur, causing dislocation of business, and preventing the development of that confidence in industry which is so essential to general re-employment. But associated with this system must be provision whereby the customs duties shall be brought into direct relation to the rate of exchange when above normal. I shall not attempt to dogmatize as to what that relationship should be, but I suggest that the Commonwealth Bank Board and the Tariff Board should be asked to confer with a view to evolving a formula which would operate automatically whether Parliament was in session or not. I was astounded when, a few days ago, the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr recent reduction in wages, invalid and Gullett) stated that in future the Tariff Board would not take info account exchange and primage when determining customs duties. Not even the most reckless optimist can expect that, until many years have elapsed, the Australian currency will be on a par with English currency. The adverse exchange having some degree of permanency, the resultant difference in the purchasing power of our money should be taken into consideration in determining the effect of customs duties. ""When this Parliament imposes duties, it fixes a rate which it regards as sufficient to protect the Australian manufacturer if exchange were normal. We in this Parliament do not calculate that he will also have the additional protection of 25 or 30 per cent, exchange and 10 per cent, primage. If this triple protection be continued, many industries that are economically unsound will come into being, so that when normal conditions are restored, we shall be con' fronted with demands for increased duties because vested, interests have been established by the aid of exchange and primage. The relationship of tariff protection to the exchange rate should be determined by a conference between the Commonwealth Bank Board and the Tariff Board, and we should also amend the Customs Act to enable the adjustment to take place automatically, as the rate of exchange moves up or down. If we do that, both importers and manufacturers will know, at all times, how they stand, and our exporters will get the full advantage of this proposal would, however, the exchange, the equivalent of a bounty on what they sell overseas, whilst their production costs will not rise as they would without such a safeguard. allowed to the right honourable member has expired. proposal we shall be doing much to stabilize Australia's position and create confidence, which will encourage people to withdraw money from government stocks and fixed deposits for investment in industry, thus providing increased employment. The more one studies the latest Treasury figures the more one is convinced that the old-age pensions, and the maternity allowance, imposed by the Government are not only unnecessary, but also absolutely unjust. The figures already disclosed by the Treasurer ( Mr Lyons), show a surplus of approximately £2,600,000 for that portion of the financial year already passed. In these circumstances, the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin) should appeal to honourable members, particularly as it relates to the subject of unemployment. If there is one feature of the budget that is more outstanding than'another, it is that this Government has not put forward any practical scheme to deal with that important problem. The amendment, if carried, will be an instruction to the Government, not merely to go On talking of unemployment, but also to do something practical.

120,Mr Eorde,"Listening to the resurplus of £7,400,000; and when he handed over to the Scullin Administration, he left an empty Treasury, an accumulated deficit of over £5,000,000, and an adverse trade balance amounting to £70,000,000. The Government of which he was a member held office during a period when the revenues were buoyant, and when phenomenal prices were being obtained for our exportable products. Tinder these conditions almost any political fool could have been a good Treasurer, but the right honourable gentleman was an abject failure. During the period lie was in office he received £44,000,000 more in revenue than he would have received had the revenue remained the same as it was iu the year prior to his assuming office. I point out that during the same period the overseas Commonwealth debt, excluding State debts, increased by £47,000,000, and the overseas interest bill by £2,319,000. The right honourable member took a good deal of credit for presiding over the meetings of the Loan Council, and using a restraining hand upon the extravagance of the States. During that period, the Commonwealth and State debts increased ""by £152,000,000, and Australia's interest bill by £8,400,000. The right honourable member and others will probably say that a new government is now in office. Thi3 Government may appear to be new, and it represents a party with a new name, but the difference is only in name, its members belong to the same old political school that led Australia right up to the verge of national bankruptcy. When the right honourable member for Cowper joined the right honourable member for Flinders, he said that the new government bore very little resemblance to the old and discredited Hughes Administration, and he has become a good apologist for the misdeeds of the Bruce-Page Administration, but his statements are not taken seriously by those who know the position. I say to the farmers, a good many of whom I represent, that they may take as so much political eye-wash all this sham fighting that is now going on between the Country party and the Government; because, in reality, the members of both parties belong to the same political school. It is a matter of fighting for political plums honourable member to deal with the financial statement. member for Cowper referred to an increased expenditure from revenue of about £4,000,000 during the financial year 1930-31, when the Scullin Government was in office, a3 compared with 1928-29. The first item of this increased expenditure, which was inescapable, was £1,224,000 in interest, sinking fund payments and exchange. If the right honourable member had his way the exchange rate would soar sky high, and there would be a greatly increased annual payment in respect of exchange on moneys sent overseas to meet interest and other charges; In the next breath the right honourable member contends that he does not believe in inflation. He is as inconsistent in this respect as he is in connection with fiscal matters. He advocates high duties on a few commodities produced in primary industries, and free trade in connection with the products of secondary industries. Unless the Scullin Government repudiated its obligations to the overseas bondholders, the payment of (£1,224,000 in interest and sinking fund, and exchange, was inescapable. The next increase was an amount of £1,275,000 in connection with invalid and old-age pensions. Owing to the financial depression which came upon Australia there was a greatly increased demand on the Pensions Fund. With their sous and daughters out of work, a larger number of the aged aud infirm were forced to become a charge upon that fund, thereby increasing payments from that source by £1,275,000. That was another payment which was inescapable, as the right honourable member knows. The Scullin Administration was not as extravagant as the government of which the right honourable gentleman was a member. During the year concerning which he so adversely criticized the Scullin Administration, there was an increase of expenditure on war pensions of £201,000, and on repatriation services of £147,000. The former was due to some extent to the appointment by the",43,Earle Page About Years Ago The Amount Of Those Bank Ad

122,Mr Forde,"The right honorableBruce-Page Government of a War Pensions Entitlement Appeal Board. was said that the administration of the department concerned was somewhat harsh, and the Government of the day appointed a board before which decisions -of the chairman of the Repatriation Commission could be reviewed. The greater proportion of the appeals were allowed, with the result that the annual cost of war pensions during the first year the Scullin Government was in office increased by £201,000. The cost of conducting the Postal Department and meeting interest and sinking fund payments increased by £504,000. Payments to and for the States, including a special grant of £320,000 to South Australia, increased by £508,000. The total increase of inescapable expenditure was £4,145,000. Moreover, a special grant of £1,000,000 was made available to relieve unemployment. With the limited financial resources at the disposal of the Scullin Government and a hostile majority in the Senate, it was impossible to solve the unemployment problem. We decided to earmark £1,000,000 from revenue to provide relief for the unemployed, and £150,000 for the repatriation of surplus coal-miners. Inescapable expenditure was thus increased by a little over £5,000,000, of which £1,224,000 represented interest and exchange, and £1,275,000 invalid and old-age pensions, notwithstanding that during the first year of office, we reduced the cost of governing in abounding revenues, but acting ment by £1,000,000. To-day, the right honourable member for Cowper offers advice ; when he was Treasurer to the Commonwealth, he spent money freely. The Government of which he was Treasurer created 58 boards,commissions, and committees at a cost of £600,000 to the taxin 1928-29. Never in the history of the payers of Australia. Eor the financial drift, he and the Government of which he was a member must accept the responsibility. During the right honourable gentleman's term of office, the revenue of the Commonwealth, not including interest on loans raised for the States, invernment, the revenue per head of the creased from £63,800,000 in 1922-23 to £65,000,000 in the following year, to £67,700,000 in 1924-25, to £70,200,000 in 1925-26, and to £75,500,000 in the followcrease of 10s. and 20s. respectively.

In other Mr forde. words, comparing the year 1922-23 with It 1928-29, the revenue of the Commonwealth increased by £11,000,000 as the result of good seasons, and high prices for our exportable products. The right honourable gentleman, during his six years of office, enjoyed a revenue of £44,000,000 more than he would have received had the receipts remained on the 1922-23 level. In addition, the Bruce-Page Government inherited an accumulated surplus of £7,428,000; but it left office with a deficit of over £5,000,000. The expenditure under the right honourable gentleman's administration, not including the interest on loans for the States, or public debt redemption j > a y n i e n t s > w as £62,800,000 in 1922-23, and £65,000,000 in 1923-24, rising to £79,250,000 in 1927-28; in 1929-30 it was £77,250,000. For the la3t six years of his term of office, the expenditure amounted to £431,500,000, compared with a revenue of £427,000,000a deficit of about £4,500,000. No provision was made for the lean years to follow. Although the right honourable gentleman had a good deal to say about the high customs duties imposed by the Scullin Government, no one stood for higher revenue"" duties than he did when in office. The'right honourable gentleman apparently believes in imposing duties for revenue purposes. He would have them low enough to allow goods to enter this country in increasing quantities, resultdetrimentally on Australian industries, ancl stifling development. In 1922-23. when the right honourable gentleman became Treasurer of the Commonwealth, tlie customs and excise revenue was £32,S72,000. It increased to £41,000,000 Commonwealth has there been a Trea. surer who heaped up excise and customs duties in order to obtain revenue, to the exitent that the right honourable gentleman did. During the term of office of the Bruce-Page Gopopulation increased from £11 6s. to £11 16s., and the expenditure from £11 3s. to £12 3s. per head, a per capita inshould not have placed these facts on record had it not been for the unjust criticism of the Scullin Administration by the right honourable gentleman. [Quorum formed.] The right honourable gentleman criticized the Scullin Government for its administration of the finances of the country, hut he was not generous enough to admit that that Government came into office at a time of acute financial diffition to deal with the monetary problem.. culty. So badly had the Bruce-Page Government bungled the affairs of the country that the Scullin Government was faced with an accumulated adverse trade balance of £76,000,000. Our interest bill overseas for the same period was £174,000,000, while the balance against Australia was the enormous sum of £232,000,000. Instead of creating an excess of exports over imports in order to enable us to meet our interest payments, the Bruce-Page Government borrowed money to pay interest on money previously borrowed. Overseas interest rose from 10 per cant, of the value of our exports in 1913 to 19 per cent, in .1928-29, and to 34 per cent, in 1931-32, basing the exports for the last-mentioned year on British currency value. As a result of the Scullin Government's efforts to adjust the trade balance, there was in 1931-32 a favorable trade balance of £30,000,000. I regret that the Government has not round to the view of the Federal Labour done anything to solve the problem of party. To-night, the right honourable unemployment.

The only possible remedy is systematic protecting Australian industry. It was reduction no mean achievement for that Government to convert an unfavorable trade balance of £33,000,000 in 1929-30 to a favorable trade balance of £30,000,000 in. 1931-32. If the Scullin Government had had a majority in bothi Houses of Parliament, it would have beer* free to place on the statute-book legislaUnfortunately, its proposals, although accepted by this chamber, were rejected by another place. Because another place toyed with the Scullin Government's legislation to establish a central reserve bank and to make available a fiduciary note issue, hundreds of thousands of workers were unable to find employment. The banks turned a deaf ear to every request to make money available for reproductive works. When the farmers of this country were in distress, and thousands of them were being forced off the land, the Scullin Government introduced a measure to provide for a fiduciary note issue of £18,000,000, of which £1,000,000 a month for twelve months was to be devoted to the relief of unemployment, and £6,000,000 to assist the wheat-growers of Australia. That measure was defeated; but since then many supporters of the present Government as well as large numbers outside Parliament have come It is time that the leading central banks dantly, with the means of payment that a fall in prices would be impossible.

I couid cite a number of other authorities all of whom favour au increase in price levels throughout the world. To-day, many gentlemen to whom the word "" inflation "" was at one time anathema are' advocating a modified form of inflation to infuse some lifeblood into the veins of industry. The policy of deflation which has brought the world to the verge of starvation must cease to operate. The farms and factories of the world can produce as much as, or even more than, what was produced five or six years ago. The demands of the people have increased accordingly, but we still have over-production and underconsumption. Millions of people are on the verge of starvation. It is evident to. every one that the monetary system of the world has broken down. Professor Copland in Australia and Professor Keynes, McKenna, contend that unorthodox methods must be adopted if the world is to be lifted from the financial slough of despond in which it finds itself. have been reduced to such an extent that the leading economists of the world arc now advocating the doctrine that was preached by the Federal Labour party two years ago, aud which was then spurned by every one outside the ranks of Labour. To-day, it is being accepted as probably the only method of overcoming our financial difficulties. But the present Government has no policy of monetary reform. It simply has its ear to the ground to hear what is being said by the private trading banks, whose main consideration, as the Leader of the Opposition pointed out, is the making of profits for their shareholders. are not. likely to adopt any monetary reform that will militate against their profit-earning propensities. The Country party, which speaks in one breath, against inflation, is now in another breath urging inflation of an increase of the exchange rate. It is a typical instance of its inconsistency. The contention of the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory) that the policy of protection has failed to provide employment has been refuted by the official figures, which show that Mr Forde. since the war secondary industries have absorbed 100,000 additional workers, whereas, despite the expenditure of £35,000,000 on settling returned soldiers on the land, there are to-day 50,000 fewer people employed in primary industries, and 9,000,000 more acres of land under cultivation producing 2,000,000 more pounds of wool per annum than in 1911. If 50,000 fewer people in primary production can produce sufficient for Australia's requirements and for export, how are we to absorb the 200,000 workmen who for years were engaged on construction works paid for out of the moneys borrowed, chiefly abroad, at the rate of £30,000,000 per annum during the period when the right honourable member for Cowper proudly presided over the Loan Council? It is certain that they cannot all be absorbed in primary Sir Robert Home, Mr industries. It is disheartening to in Great Britain, all hear, day after day, the utter nonsense talked by the supporters of the Government to the detriment of the secondary industries established under the Price levels protectionist policy as , accepted by the majority of the people of Australia. There are nearly 500,000 people engaged in these industries. Had a truly protectionist policy been put into operation at the time when we had the huge national income of £650,000,000 per annum, when phenomenal prices were ruling for wool, wheat, butter, meat and other exports, there would have been a tremendous development of secondary industries in this country. Unfortunately, when the Scullin Government took ofiice, and I was able to play a humble part in putting into operation the protectionist ( Mr Scullin) rightly policy of the Federal Parliamentary Labour party, we found ourselves in the They throes of a depression, and the national income had. fallen by £200,000,000 per annum. The primary producers were obtaining so little for their products that they had no money for investment in industry. After all, factories are by means established by thrifty persons who , are prepared to invest, their money for the purpose of providing employment in the production of goods which would otherwise beimported. Had it not been for the protectionist policy of the Scullin Government, many more thousands of our citizens would to-day be walking tbe streets or the country seeking work. This Government has sadly overlooked the problem of unemployment. At the elections, the United Australia Party made all kinds of specious promises. On the hoardings and throughout all the tory newspapers of Australia, all kinds of propaganda was indulged in by that party. Every person out of work was to be given a job. This Government has done nothing to give effect to its election out of employment within Australia, and promises. Sincei t has been in office, unemployment, according to the Statistician's figures, has increased. When the Labour party lost office the number of members of unions reporting as unemployed was 118,732, or 2S per cent. At the end of the first quarter of the year when this Government was in office the number reporting as unemployed increased to 120,366, or 28 per cent.; and for the second quarter of the year the number increased to 124,068, or 30 per cent. Lang have to that increase of unemployment? office the Nationalist party blamed him for all sorts of things, but since he has been out of office unemployment has increased, and the Nationalist party must accept the responsibility for that. find from the census of 1921 that the number of people out of employment was four 'times the number of unionists reporting as unemployed. That means that to-day there are approximately 495,000 people out of work in Australia, under the regime of the so-called United Australia Party Government. The United Australia Party said that if it were elected to office there would be a restoration of confidence, a steady flow of credit, and jobs for the workless. It is poor consolation to the 495,000 people who are out of work todaj to find that this Government has done nothing at all for them. During rhe election, the United Australia Party displayed placards on every hoarding to the effect that work would be provided for the unemployed. The present Postmaster-General, with crocodile tears running down his cheeks, loudly expressed his sympathy .with the workless and homeless. for Flinders( Mr Bruce), speaking at that time, said that if confidence were restored there would be an immediate stimulus to commerce and industry, aud tbe re-absorption of the nnemployed would start immediately. We are waiting for a start to be made in the absorption of the unemployed. As the Postmaster-General has said, we have had sufficient talk. Now we want the work to be provided. There are 495,000 people there is nothing in the budget to indicate that anything practical is to be done for l hem. Much has been said on the svibject of the Ottawa conference, and we shall later have every opportunity to discuss the details of an agreement, which, iu my view, is really just another bunch of carrots dangled before the people of Australia. The Prime Minister said that it was difficult to forecast with certainty what would be the of the tariff alterations made in pursuance of the agreement, but that we could be reasonably certain that the tariff alterations would bring about a reduction of revenue with consequent relief to the taxpayers. Under the protective policy of the Scullin Government imports were We largely restricted, but the reduction of duties now instituted by this Government will permit of additional imports and result in increased customs revenue. During the last three months the-revenue from customs and excise has been £1,500,000 in excess of the estimate, indicating clearly that during the present financial year, there will IKS a much greater revenue from customs and excise than was at first anticipated. The Ottawa agreement reveals every advantage that Australia is likely to reap under it, but it wraps in obscure phrases the actual price that this country is paying and may be called upon to pay for the concessions that it has won from Great Britain. As sure as night follows day, there will be a suhstantial increase of unemployment in this country as the result of the bargaining that took place at Ottawa. Our secondary industries have been placed in jeopardy for' some uncertain and problematical advantage to a section of AusThe right honourable member tralian primary industries.

I take the contrary vie\A , and believe that T our Resident Ministeri n London w ill shortly be able to record further successes in his loan conversion negotiations in the best interests of the Commonwealth. I repeat that effect has been given to the first plank in the Government's platform-the restoration of confidence-and that the problem of unemployment is being tackled in a business-like way. Eor the last two years, I have been a member of the local unemployment central relief committee in my district, aud I am thus able to speak with some authority as to the position there. I happen also to be a member of the Northcote City Council, which is vitally interested in this probI f Mr Hogan was exlem, and I have obtained reliable information from Mr Zwar, M.L.A., Avho i» closely identified with relief in the adjoining suburb of Preston, where there is a population of over 30,000.

144,Mr Dennis,"Parliament also to take an active interest in the solution of this great problem. In my opinion it is desirable, in the best inwould be a very great, risk of some of these terests of the community, that a committee of, say, ten or twelve members representative of every party in the House should be appointed to co-operate with the Government in devising ways and means of reducing unemployment. The Ministers of the Crown have their hands ful l with their ordinary administrative work, and for this reason I believe that a committee such as I have suggested would be able to make valuable suggestions to the Government on this subject. I believe that members of every party would be glad of the opportunity to serve on it. I make this proposal in all seriousness. There are many ways of relieving unemployment. member for Calare( Mr Thorby) made a good suggestion in regard to the employment of men on farms. The Government should give earnest consideration to that proposal. The' honourable member for Kennedy( Mr Riordan) has recently, both in a speech and in interjections, advocated that sewerage systems should be provided in suitable country towns. That also is a suggestion which justifies close consideration. I know that certain honourable members who support the Government think that the time is inopportune for the expenditure of money on such undertakings, but now that we can obtain money at reasonable rates of interest, such as that secured a few days ago by the Resideut Minister in London( Mr Bruce), I believe that we should float a loan for the purpose of instituting reproductive character that I have mentioned. As a member of the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of WorksI am aware that a number of undertakings which that board desires to put in hand have been held in abeyance because of the high interest rates that have prevailed in recent years. Most honourable members of this chamber know the industrial town of Sunshine; but they may not realize that it is still without a sewerage service the lack of which, in my opinion, is a menace to the health of the whole of Melbourne. Probably 50 per cent, of the persons employed in Sunshine reside in various suburbs of Melbourne. If an epidemic Jlr, Dennis. oi disease were to break out as the result of the inadequate sewerage facilities there people carrying the germs of the disease from Sunshine into other localities. It is estimated that the establishment of a sewerage system for Sunshine under the usual conditions of the Metropolitan Board of Works, including supervision charges, would cost £140,000. It would provide sewerage facilities for 1,173 tenements, and give employment to 500 men for twelve months in reticulation and other subsidiary works. When those works were completed the task of connecting dwelling houses with the system would provide employment for 120 men for another twelve months. Although the return from this undertaking would be a little under 3 per cent., I consider Recently the honourable that the indirect benefit that would result from the improved health of the community, would justify the Government in providing money for the work, even free of interest for the first year. I am in deadly earnest in making these suggestions. I play second fiddle to no man in my desire to find work for the unemployed. I know of men who have been connected with my firm for 40 or 45 years, and many other honest, hard working men who are greatly depressed at present because they cannot . earn sufficient money to provide for the needs of their families. If a committee, such as I have suggested, were set up, I believe that it would very soon be able to submit concrete proposals to the Government for the wise expenditure of money on necessary public works. public works of the I am not a pessimist. Now that we have turned the corner, and can obtain money at a lower rate of interest than in recent years, we should do well to take advantage of it. I referred a little while ago to the recent New South Wales conversion loan. It is not long since New South Wales had to pay 5f per cent, for the money that it required. Such a high rate of interest deterred many public and semi-public bodies from putting works in hand, but now that we have returned to more normal interest rates, this reluctance to spend money in the directions I have indicated should be overcome. The Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works was established in the 'nineties during a period of depression, and for a number of years it did invaluable work for the community. I believe that it and similar bodies could do a good deal of useful -work of the same kind at present. I hope the Government will seriously consider my proposal for the appointment of a committee representative of the various parties in the House to investigate this whole subject. The unemployed who are suffering so acutely at present should not be the pawns of party politics. I do not blame the Government for the present situation, nor do I blame the Opposition for criticizing the Government. But, in view of the fact that, within a few days, the Prime Minister will be attending a Premiers conference as the representative of the Commonwealth, I sincerely trust that he will take steps to provide money for the assistance of the farmers, and the community generally. I referred a few moments ago to the Northcote brick works. I now direct the attention of honourable members to the activities of the Pelaco shirt factory situated in the constituency of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr tion, the deficit, even if the revenue Scullin). A representative of that firm advised me a few days ago that, during September, 9,200 dozen shirts had been manufactured at the factory, and that employment had been provided for 800 girls, which is in excess of the number usually employed. ""We want to see all our factories at work again. It is not only the contend that it has now altered its primary industries, but also the secondary industries that need stimulation. I sympathize with tlie honourable members of the Country party. I am not a farmer, but I have securities in the country. I know that many farmers are unable to pay interest on the money they have borrowed. This naturally makes one sympathetic with country interests. I know also, that it probably takes 2$ bags of wheat to pay a debt that one bag of wheat would have satisfied some little time ago. But in spite of all our troubles, I am perfectly sure that if we were to pull together, we could provide work for our unemployed, ancl so get out of our troubles. tralia, in common with other countries in the world, is at present passing through a period of unprecedented industrial depression. It was little enough to expect, therefore, that a Government, electee! largely as the result of its nation-wide assertion that it, and it alone, could solve the unemployment problem, would have made definite proposals in its budget to deal with this subject, and the closely related problem of monetary reform. But an examination of the budget fails to show that there is any unemployment problem whatever in Australia. I propose later to deal at some length with certain aspects of this problem, but first, even at the risk of reiteration, I shall stress one or two outstanding aspects of the Government's proposals for, the balancing of the budget. Taxation has been remitted, ancl in order to permit of this, sections of the community least able to bear additional burdens have been called upon to suffer. The reduction in taxation is estimated at £1,200,000. Assuming for a moment that the Government's estimates of revenue are reliable, it is budgeting for a deficit, including these taxation remissions, of £1,4(9,000. It will be seen, therefore, that had there been no remissions of taxafigures had not been under-estimated, would be only £279,000. In order to save less than £1,500,000, the Government has decided to take £1,100,000 from that section of the community which is in receipt, of the munificent income of 17s. 6d. per week. The Government may proposal for the reduction of the invalid and old-age pensions, but the fact remains that the Estimates provide for that reduction being made. The maternity allowance has been reduced, and the Government expects, by this means, to save £60,000, while a further saving of £220,000 is contemplated as a result of a further reduction of the salaries of public servants. Obviously the budget has been prepared by the Government in a characteristically casual fashion. In his budget speech the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) pointed out that the Government expected to save £240,000 by the reduction of public servants' salaries, ancl thus get a surplus for the year of £12,000. But instead of the reduction, amounting to £8 per head, it has been applied on the. graduated scale of £8, £5 and £4, the",50,Earle Page About Years Ago The Amount Of Those Bank Ad
145,Mr Baker (Oxley) [9.58],"Auslast-mentioned figure having relation to female workers, and the Government will now save by this means £20,000 less than was originally estimated, which means that it is budgeting for a deficit of £8,000. The difference may be small, but the Government has not yet made any reference to it in its Estimates. The Labour party contends that there is no need for the reduction of the invalid and old-age pensions, and that, but for the remission of nearly £1,250,000 in taxation, the pensions could have been restored to the old level. The Prime Minister has recently admitted that at the earliest opportunity there will be further remissions in taxation. [Quorum formed.] Apart from the large amount of taxation to be remitted by the Government, the Estimates provide merely fov a deficit on paper. The Prime Minister has followed the example set by an ex-Premier of Victoria, who, on receiving from the departments the annual Estimates, added £5,000 here and £10,000 there to the expenditure side in order to show that special economies would be needed to balance the budget, and naturally at the end of the financial year, always had a fine surplus. Some persons regarded him as a great financier, but a large surplus indicates as great a lack of financial ability as does a large deficit. The Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Gullett), referring on one occasion to the leader of the Country -party (Dr. Earle Page), said that he was the most tragic treasurer Australia had ever had; but I contend that the present Prime Minister has submitted the most pathetic budget that has ever been placed before this Parliament. The most charitable construction that can be placed upon it, in order not to accuse the Government of deliberately inflicting unnecessary suffering upon the people, is to say that the right honourable gentleman did not exaggerate his own lack of financial capacity when, shoi'tly after leaving the Labour party, he said that he had no knowledge of finance. merely due to his innate modesty. budget speech I do not think that anychambers for a long enough period body can regard it as a modest statement. to give partial effect to its policy. The revenue for tlie first three months of this financial year shows a surplus of £2,619,000, when compared with that of the first quarter of last year. I realize that during the first three months of the last financial year, the Labour Government's economies had not shown their effect; but the present Government's economies do not take effect until this month, so that it is reasonable to assume that the estimates of revenue will be exceeded to a still greater extent in the eusuing months. The la3t Government had to make reductions of expenditure. Paced with a deficit of £20,000,000, and in order to bring about a favorable trade balance, it had to reduce imports to such an extent that the customs revenue was reduced by £14,000,000, which accounted for the greater part of the anticipated deficit of £20,000,000. The position today is very different. The last Government's action in sacrificing customs revenue was successful in producing a substantial trading surplus last financial year. Our exports exceeded in value that of our imports and our interest charges on overseas loans and still left a margin of £8,000,000. During the first two months of the present financial year, the trade balance showed, instead of a surplus of exports to the value £2,500,000, a surplus of imports to a similar amount, so that the country is really £5,000,000 worse off than at this time last year. No doubt, this is Only what may be expected of a free trade government. At the last election, the ministerial party denied that any of its members were in favour of free trade, but the results of the Ottawa conference having been placed before us, such a denial would now be useless. Honourable members opposite have deliberately avoided facts, and have asked why the Labour party did not do certain things when it was in power. I point out that Labour, although in office, did not have a majority in another place, and its legislative proposals were usually vetoed in the other branch of the legislature. tion of federation has the Labour party had a majority in both",52,Earle Page About Years Ago The Amount Of Those Bank Ad

147,Mr Baker,"Sinc e reading theI t then brought into existence tbe Commonwealth Bank, and placed on the statute-book the Australian Notes Act. To-day, our opponents say that sane finance has prevailed because the measures proposed by the Labour party have not been adopted. Had a majority of the Senate been opposed to the Labour Government of that day, and brought about the defeat of the Commonwealth Bank Act, and the Australian Notes Act, the same claim would be made. .The last Labour Government, unfortunately, was in office but not in power. A few weeks after its election to office, it succeeded in passing an amendment of the Commonwealth Bank Act providing that the gold reserves of Australia should be mobilized so that they might be exported overseas for the purpose of discharging our liabilities there. Later, it again ennotes which could be issued in England deavoured to amend the act in the direction of providing for the reduction of the 25 per cent, statutory limit of gold to bank notes, so that £5,000,000 of our gold reserves might be exported; but that measure was defeated, in the other branch of the legislature. A few months later, however, by reason of the stress of economic circumstances, that chamber was forced to agree to a measure designed to reduce the statutory limit so that liabiliAt that'time there was no talk of inflation ties amounting to. £5,000,000' which fell due on the 30th June, 1931, might be met. That bill was considerably modified, and as enacted, provided that the percentage of gold to bank notes must be 15-per cent, for the twelve months ending the 30th June, 1933, not less than 18 per cent, for the twelve months ending the 30th June, 1934, not less than 21$ per cent, for the twelve months ending the 30th June, 1935, and not less than 25 per cent, subsequently. We would have been working on a 15 per cent, basis of gold at the present time, but that recently the present was fixed in accordance with a recommenGovernment was obliged to adopt certain more drastic measures. The Scullin Government Interest Bill, the purpose of which was to reduce the payments upon fixed deposits in the banks, and also the interest payable to those institutions upon overdrafts. That measure failed to become law because the Government did not have in both chambers the power to impose its will. It brought forward the Central Reserve Bank Bill and the Fiduciary Notes Bill, which also were defeated in another place. to enable £6,000,000 to be distributed among the wheat-farmers, and £12,000,000 to be expended at the rate of £1,000,000 a month in the provision of unemployment relief. It also contained a proviso that, in the event of the Commonwealth Bank advancing credits to the Government, the amount of the fiduciary notes issued should be reduced to that extent. An honourable member opposite said ""hear, hear!"" when I mentioned the defeat of this measure. Apparently, he is not aware that in England there is a fiduciary note issue of £260,000,000. At the outbreak of the war, the amount of was less than £20,000,000. It may be information to those honourable members who complain so bitterly of political interference, that at the outset the English Treasury took control of the note issue apart from that particular fiduciary issue of £20,000,000, and issued notes to the extent of several hundred million pounds for the purpose of prosecuting the war, no check being imposed on it by statute. nor of fiduciary notes being of no value as currency. For ten years after the ; termination of thewar the English Treasury retained control over the note issue, and issued notes of the denomination of £1 and 10s., the Bank of England 'being confined to the statutory limit of £20,000,000. As the result of various conferences it was decided that this note issue should be handed over to the Bank of England, and that for that purpose a definite limit must be placed on the amount that could be issued. A limit dation that in no particular year should' the fiduciary note issue exceed that for introduced tlie Bank the preceding year. For several years the note issue had diminished until, in 1928', it was handed over to the Bank of England and a limit fixed at £260,000,000, with the proviso that should additional funds be required additional notes could be issued with the consent of the Treasury upon application by the Governor of the Bank.

If On page more food than ever before, it is time that There are now some 400,000 to 500,000. Personally, I believe When speaking the Postmaster-General estimate was arrived at. honourable gentleman's attention to the fact that, according to the 1921 census, the number of salary and wage earners then in Australia was given as 1,679,992. it is logical to assume that, since our population has increased considerably in tlic past, eleven years, the number of salary regarded as the working population of the community-ha s also increased appreciably. If we take the 1921 figure and compare it with the present percentage decrease of employment, as given by the Commonwealth Statistician-upo n which our figures are based, although the Postmaster-General does not appear to know it-w o find that in the first year that this Government came into power, 27.4 per cent, of the population of Australia was unemployed, while at the end of June last the figure had reached 30 par cent. There are no official figures since that date, but I have elicited from a reliable source that the present percentage is 29.6. Tho reduction of unemployment about which this Government is so highly jubilant amounts therefore to only .4 per cent, for the last three months, while during its period of office unemployment has increased from 27.4 to 29.6 per cent. I believe that the reduction that has occurred recently is largely due to the return of a Labour government in Queensland. debate we have heard many remarks concerning Mr Forgan Smith, the Premier of that. State. It is but fair to read extracts from some of the speeches made by that gentleman at the Premiers Conference held last June. of all, I desire to compare that conference with a similar gathering held . in April. at the April conference, and also in his budget speech, that the experts' report, which was presented to the gathering of Premiers, was practically an ultimatum by the Federal Government to the April Premiers Conference that, before further Ion si moneys would be released, there must be a reduction of 10 per cent, on the 1928 basic wage figure. That reduction would have brought the basic wage far below t he "" Harvester"" wage fixed in 1907, which Mr Justice Higgins said was designed "" for the normal needs of the I draw the average employee regarded as a human being living in a civilized community."" That figure was not fixed upon any definite statistics or as the result of specific inquiry, but merely upon the average wage payable in Melbourne in 1907. As an example of the reactionary practice of this Government of always looking and wage earners-usuall y backwards, and of learning to go forward by observing what governments did many years ago, it is instructive to notice that it was even willing to jettison the principle of the basic wage-whic h was first laid down in Australia in 1890 in a Queensland Parliament, and. formulated by Sir Samuel Griffith in an act of that Parliament wherein it was statedThe natural and proper measure of wages in such a sum as is fair immediate recompense for the labour for which they are paid, having regard to its 'character and duration; but it can never be taken at a less sum than such as is sufficient to maintain the labourer and his family in a state of health and reasonable comfort. Yet this Parliament has, by its disallowance of determinations of the Public Service Arbitrator, declared that it does not now recognize the principle of a basic living wage. The Government's endeavour to obtain inspiration from bygone ages is again demonstrated in the pension reduction principle, conDuring this cerning which the Brisbane Courier, the leading conservative organ in Queensland, said in the course of an article intended to bestow great praise upon the Commonwealth Government. But first In effect tbe principle upon which the Federal Government proposes to act in regard to pensions is not new to English law. ""The Tour Kelief Act 1(!01 provided that every The Prime Minister admitted person should be bound to provide necessary maintenance for his father and mother. One reason why the Labour party has always refused invitations to join national non-party governments is that members of the anti-Labour parties always approach industrial problems in the light of what occurred ten, twenty, or one hundred years ago, or, as in the instance I have just, quoted, 331 years ago. At any rate, they expect so called non-party governments to act in accordance with those beliefs. The Labour party, on the other hand, believes that ideas should advance of-date principles should be discarded, and that the old industrial system must give way to the new. attitude is not extreme or radical. Even in the middle ages there were men, more far-seeing than their fellows, who recognized that the feudal system would not last indefinitely. Society is always in a state of transition, and it is the duty of members of Parliament to see that every change is for the betterment of the masses of the people. In a world' of plenty no man should want, and during the present crisis a greater responsibility is cast upon those directing the destinies of the nation than has existed in any previous period of our history. Though the ministerial press may, in chorus, abuse politicians, those who serve in the parliaments of the country have a more, important duty to do today than ever before, and if they are not doing their duty they have no claim to represent the people.' miers ConferenceThe policy pursued in Queensland during the last three years, based on the principles cnir bodied, iu the Premiers plan, has not had the desired effect. . . . Despite the exercise of severe economies and the reduction of wages, there has been a definite increase in Our budgetary deficits each year. It should be regarded as a cardinal principle that national budgets cannot be balanced while the budget of the individual is unbalanced because Of wage reductions, rationing, and unemployment. In support of that contention, he quoted the opinions of well known authorities. Eor instance, he referred to a speech made by Sir Robert Home on the FinanceB ill in the British House of Commons in May last, when he saidThe raising of the sterling prices of goods was vitally important, as it would enable us to realize the budget estimate. It was going to be a very close thing between the survival and decline of civilization. Yet some honourable member's opposite would have us believe that everything is all right, and that we need not worry! Mr Forgan Smith also quoted Mr J. M . Keynes, the famous economist, as having said in an article published in the Sydney Morning Herald, of the 27th June, 1932It is a serious mistake for any country, in my judgment, to attempt to. complete Mr linker. adjustments to the price level of wholesale with the times> that outprices, whether measured by gold or sterling. . . . Every country in the world has. the same problem as Australia in some shape or form. If each attempted to solve it by comThat petitive wage reductions and competitive currency depreciations, nobody would be better off. There is no. exit along that route. Indeed, the tendency of wage reductions must necessarily be to rivet more securely the existing level of prices, for, in the long run, it is the wage level which mainly determines the price level, especially with countries not rigidly linked with gold. The Commonwealth Government is flying in the face of opinions expressed by worldfamous economists. Mr Forgan Smith continuedThe point that I wish to emphasize is thai every effort should be made so to control our internal economy as to raise price levels within Australia, restore confidence to industry, and provide employment for our own people. That is,. I consider, our most urgent duty at tbe present time. To the declaration of critics that the Labour Government of Queensland is following the lead of the anti-Labour governments, including' the most anti-Labour Government of South Australia, the answer is that Mr Forgan Smith's Ministry is the only one in Australia in the last two years that has submitted a budget that does not propose further reductions of wages and social services. Reference has been made by the Postmaster-General to the ""mystic price levels of 1929."" The economists of the world are almost unanimous in declaring that prices must be restored to the levels of that year. The policy of the Labour party is to increase the power of the Commonwealth Bank w i th a view to nationalizing all banking. A writer in a weekly journal published on the 23rd A p r i l points out that in Australia SO men have control of £200,000,000-no t their own money, but the savings and investments of the people which they can place or divert as they w ill . Three combinations control the greater amount of Australian capital. There is the Burns, Philp group closely allied w i th the Colonial Sugar Refining Company; the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company with its associated companies; and there is also an overseas group. It is interesting to note that the Ministerf or Commerce( Mr. Stewart) is a director of two companies controlling a capital of almost £4,000,000.",54,Earle Page About Years Ago The Amount Of Those Bank Ad
150,Mr Eorgan,"Smith said, at the PreWe are not complaining of that, but of the fact that these hundreds of millions of pounds of capital are controlled by a few men who have absolute power over the nation. companies are responsible to their shareholders. that, but their duty to their shareholders is to provide a maximum of profit regardless of whether that is, or is not, of benefit to the nation as a whole. The directors of Burns, Philp and Company and the Colonial Sugar Refining Company control the Bank of New South Wales as well as several other banks, also the Sydney Bulletin, which publishes articles on finance, and several other newspapers. B y controlling the credit of the Commonwealth, these people have a tremendous influence over Australia and its people. As members of boards of numerous banks, insurance, trustee and mortgage companies, they can direct the policy of the country regardless of what the Government says or does. The Government should extend the powers of the Commonwealth Bank so that there w ill be one banking institution controlling the issue of credit to the nation. We know that the banks have power to create credits. There are two methods, apart from coin clipping which is now out of date, under which there can be inflation. One is by an inflation of the note issue, and the other is by an inflation of credit. The banks have absolute power to decide the amount of credit to be issued. Concerning the word "" inflation "", which has been used so extensively in recent times, MrA r t h u r Kitson, a well-known British economist states-^This word (inflation) which has been made a shibboleth by the supporters of the dearscarce-mouey policy,, is immediately mentioned the moment any proposal is made for expanding the currency. Prior to the war, "" inflation"" was only employed to define any attempt to increase the currency supplies beyond the needs of trade and industry, and which, therefore, could only tend to raise the level of commodity prices without increasing the volume of goods. But to-day the term "" inflation "" is wrongfully used to characterize any attempt to expand the currency, even though such expansion is obviously essential, as it is to-day, ber for Bendigo( MrE . F . Harrison) to save our industries and trade from utter collapse. It would not be too much to say that the world to-day is threatened with ruin owing to the fear which this word inspires! [Leave to continue given.] We have followed a policy of deflation The directors of such so long that we must retrace our steps. The term "" in f l a t i o n"" has become such a political bogy that it is now termed "" reflation "" which is only another name I am willing to grant for inflation. It has been said that no nation having once inflated its currency has ever been able to deflate it. Obviously, that is wrong, because, with the exception of . America, practically every civilized nation which fought the war on an inflated currency has since deflated much further than was necessary. Mr Kitson goes on to saynumerous The examples of currency inflation experiments of Germany and Russia are usually mentioned to warn the public of the dangers of employing the chief remedy which at present would be effective in restoring prosperity. Those who cite these examples are careful not to mention the real objects of the inflationary policies of those two nations. When Lenin commissioned hia government printing presses to pour out paper roubles in unlimited quantities, his object was to destroy entirely the value of the rouble for the express purpose of ruining private traders; and he succeeded 1 Similarly, when the German banks issued billions of paper marks during the 1022-23 period, the Government's object was to rid Germany of her internal debts! This also proved successful. It is not inflation to get back to the 1929 price levels, as is suggested to-day by a great majority of leading economists. In this connection, it is only f a i r to give dore) who was the first to put forward the suggestion of adopting the 1929 price levels. He made that suggestion at the Premiers Conference in February, 1931, and his arguments were so logical that the then Treasurer of Queensland, Mr. Barnes, a most conservative man, supported the resolution submitted, but on the conditions that the banks were agreeable. The proposal, however, did not suit the private interests and the private banks, but had a Labour Government been in control in another branch of the legislature effect would have been given to it , and f u l l y 75 per cent, of the trouble which we have experienced would have been avoided.

153,Credit To The Ex,"Treasurer ( Mr Theoinformation with respect to our unpreparedness for war, but he did not say how a future war could be fought, in view of the fact that it is impossible at present to provide sufficient funds to find work for the unemployed. There is not one honourable member who has the slightest doubt that, if , in the interests of the nation, money was required for the purposes of war, funds would be quickly, made available. We would fight another war as the last was fought, by providing sufficient currency to meet our expenditure and the requirements of trade. sible for our position to-day. tion has been brought about by following a policy of deflation to the extent we have. Had we stopped in 1929 when the price levels had dropped, and we were getting back to normal, we should have avoided many of our present troubles. ment is not carrying out the policy decided upon at the last Premiers Conference, which was first to provide for unemployment, and then to balance the budget. At rjresent it is trying to balance the budget first, whereas the first essential in any constructive move for rehabilitation is to get our people back to work. This is what the Premier of Queensland is trying to do. If that is done, there will be very little difficulty in of the witnesses that in some form banking balancing the budget. Unlike the April conference tliere was no suggestion at the June-July conference that a 10 per cent, reduction should be sought in the value of real wages. On the other hand, it was discovered, after consultation, that such a reduction would be unnecessary if the banks would find £7,000,000 to provide employment. If the banks.had done that when the Labour party was in power, there would have been no need to issue that amount of fiduciary notes. But when the Labour Government suggested such a thing, it was said to be impossible. The Labour party's attitude is that the Commonwealth Government, which is the said that Professor Copland was one of most powerful legislative instrument in the most conservative economists in Austhe Commonwealth, should obtain credits tralia. That being so, his statement that through the private banks, but that the there must be some kind of inflation is objective should be the nationalization of surely proof positive that it is badly the banking system of Australia. It feels needed. In all the circumstances it must that the banking power is too great to remain in the hands of private institutions. It would be just as logical to assume that private banking companies would act disinterestedly in the interests of the whole community as it would be to assume the Inchcape shipping line would take our produce overseas at a cheaper rate than that normally charged, or that the pastoralists and wool-growers would agree to sell their meat and wool at lower than the ruling prices, simply from a sense of public duty. The fact is, of course, that private commercial institutions owe a duty to their shareholders. We believe that the interests of the nation should be paramount. In the book The Crisis of Australian Finance 1929-1931, edited by Professors Shann and Copland, certain comment is made on the award of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court in June, 1930. It is mentioned that Mr R. F. Irvine, for many years professor of The Commonwealth Governeconomics at the Sydney University, stated in his argumentThat it is practically a question of life and death to stop deflation and initiate a movement in the other direction, that is, to retrace our steps by way of a carefully guarded inflation. Such a policy is forced upon us by the facts. The court subsequently stated in its findings thatThere was almost unanimity in the opinions policy should be changed and that there should be a limited note issue. Professor Copland, MrF . F . A . Russell, KC., one time lecturer in economics at Sydney University, Mr Portus, of the Sydney University, Mr Dyason and many others are in agreementthat if the risks of indiscriminate inflation can be avoided the position can be substantially assisted by a change in banking policy for the purpose of facilitating some stabilization of price levels. ber for Hindmarsh ( Mr Makin) said that the opinions of those gentlemen were not worth having.",58,Earle Page About Years Ago The Amount Of Those Bank Ad
