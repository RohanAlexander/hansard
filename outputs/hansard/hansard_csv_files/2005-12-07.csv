287,Mr Mcgauran To Move:,"Wednesday, 7 December 2005 ----Ms Irene Rose Moran morning to pay a tribute to Irene Rose Moran, who passed away on 28 November this year. As members of parliament we all appreciate the importance of having good staff. For that reason I want to pay a tribute to Irene today. Irene first came to work for me when I was President of the ACTU in the early 1990s, having worked for the ACTU prior to that. Irene was a woman from the suburbs, having grown up in the Dandenong area. She left school at year 10, was trained in accounting and bookkeeping and pursued a professional career which led her overseas, and this led to her love of travel. In the late 1980s Irene chose to change direction in life and pursue a career working for the Australian trade union movement. Her values of care and loving were based on her respect and love for her family. She was the youngest of seven children, with five sisters, Thelma, Gwen, Frances, Maureen and Val, and a brother, Don. She was also very active in the Uniting Church. At a service last Friday at the Edithvale Uniting Church, we saw the respect that she had in the local community and the commitment and support she gave to that church. Those values defined by her involvement in and love of her family and her support for her church led her to make a huge contribution to working people in this country, first as an employee of the ACTU and my personal assistant, and subsequently when I was elected to parliament in March 1996. She requested and I willingly accepted her proposal to transfer from the ACTU to my employ as one of my electorate secretaries. I want to highlight Irene’s contribution to the union movement and the fact that many working people in this country are better off because of her involvement in key campaigns under the accord process. She was involved with the action program for working women, proper attention to equal pay and affirmative action in child care and had a desire to actually do something about working people such as clerks, child-care workers and meatworkers. She was also of immense assistance to all my constituents. The number of phone calls and expressions of sympathy that I have received in the last week and a half are beyond belief. On behalf of all those working people, I want to say: thanks for your dedicated loyalty and commitment, Irene. You will be sadly missed by working people, not only in Batman but throughout Australia, because of the huge contribution you made and huge dedication you showed to the cause. Vale, Irene Rose Moran. Queensland Parliament and unequivocally, the Queensland parliament’s action last Friday to observe a minute’s silence for the execution of the young Vietnamese-Australian, Nguyen Tuong Van. It was a tragic loss, but for the Queensland parliament to take this step, with 49 of its members observing a minute’s silence to mark that young man’s life being taken away, was a gross act of disrespect and dishonour to the men and woman of this country who have given their lives in service and sacrifice for this nation.

290,Mr Johnson (Ryan) (9.33 Am),"Today in the parliament I want to condemn, absolutelyI am sure all of us in the parliament and across the nation would have enormous compassion and enormous sympathy for the family, friends and relatives of the young man whose life was taken through execution in Singapore. But to take a very formal step in the parliament of a state of this country, where his life is honoured and elevated to a position alongside the men and woman of this country who have fought and died in war for the freedom of this country, is reprehensible in the extreme. I want to take this opportunity in the parliament to thank all those in my constituency of Ryan who have written to me. I also want to acknowledge the very strong words of the Queensland subbranch of the RSL and to thank them for issuing their press release which equally condemns the Premier of Queensland, particularly since he holds the position of Chairman of the ANZAC Day Commemoration Committee of Queensland. I am sure that all members of the coalition would stand behind my sentiments here today to condemn unequivocally this action of the Queensland parliament. I want to absolutely condemn the actions of those who represent the state seats: the member for Indooroopilly, Ronan Lee, and in particular the state member for Mount Ommaney, Julie Attwood, who is associated with the Mount Ommaney RSL subbranch. I thank Mr Tom Davies of Ryan, who expressed in no uncertain terms his absolute disgust with this action of the Queensland parliament. To the Premier and the members of the Labor Party in Queensland who stood in a mark of respect of this man’s life, shame on you! This man was a convicted drug dealer. He trafficked in heroin, and had that heroin come to this country, the number of Australian lives that would have been lost is beyond count. We all feel sympathy for his family, but at the end of the day this man’s life cannot be equated to the lives of men and women of this country who have given their lives in sacrifice of this country’s freedom. (Time expired) Vietnam Veterans: Health of Children Study health of the children of Vietnam veterans. On 28 May 2004 Labor announced that, if elected to government at the forthcoming election, we would conduct a full health study of all veterans’ children. Labor’s study was to cover the health of the children of all veterans, including those who served on peacekeeping missions and in recent deployments to the gulf, East Timor, Afghanistan and Iraq. In response to Labor’s policy announcement, the government came out and stated that it would examine the feasibility of conducting a study into the health of the children of Vietnam veterans. It was a poor copy of Labor’s policy. The problems of children’s health are not restricted to Vietnam veterans’ children but include all those whose family circumstances suffered from service related stress or the unknown effects of exposure to hazardous substances. It has long been accepted that veterans’ children suffer psychologically as a result of family disturbance caused by service related stress. It has also been accepted that physical deformities can occur in the children of veterans due to the veterans’ exposure to hazardous chemicals. In the first health study of Vietnam veterans, conducted in 1998 by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, it was revealed that there was a disturbingly greater incidence of congenital abnormalities than in the normal population-namely, spina bifida, cleft palate, acute myeloid leukaemia and adrenal gland cancer. Health care is already provided to those with these conditions, despite the lack of firm scientific evidence of any causal link. Counselling is also available in a family context for those exhibiting symptoms of stress. The most disturbing indicator of behavioural difficulties MAIN COMMITTEE",255,Statements By Members
291,Mr Griffin (Bruce) (9.36 Am),"I rise today to speak on the proposed study into thewas the elevated risk of suicide, with the AIHW study showing that the suicide rate amongst the children of Vietnam veterans was three times the expected rate, and death from other causes including accidents was doubled. It was stated in Senate estimates in November that the feasibility study on the children of Vietnam veterans health study had been finalised and is currently in the hands of the Department of Veterans’ Affairs. I would urge the department to examine the recommendations of the feasibility study in a prompt manner so as to allow for its recommendations to be presented to the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs. The government at the last election, unlike Labor, only committed itself to the feasibility study. It is now imperative that the minister, after considering the recommendations of the department, finally commit the government to undertaking the health study of the children of Vietnam veterans. As can only be imagined, there is an increasing concern within the veteran community over the health implications that their service may have for their children. Parents exposed to hazardous substances naturally make a link with service, but to date the research conducted is inadequate. We must never forget the thousands of sons and daughters of veterans who wish to know more about the health issues they may be facing and how to address these health problems. Veterans and their families need to know more, just as the current serving members of the ADF need to learn from the experience of our veterans and hopefully avoid some of the difficulties faced in the past. This study must begin in earnest and all obstacles that would delay its initiation must be removed. I would like to conclude today by thanking the members of the Scientific Advisory Committee and especially members of the consultative forum for the tireless work they have volunteered in this endeavour. Queanbeyan TodayI wish to raise a matter which is effectively seeing the growth of Queanbeyan restricted quite substantially. When the ACT was given self-government, one of its responsibilities was to take control of water for this region. Googong Dam is wholly within New South Wales. The ACT government supposedly has control over that water and for some time now has effectively been preventing Queanbeyan from growing because it is denying it water. The ACT government claims that it provides Queanbeyan with water under a former Commonwealth act, but that is to Queanbeyan as it was then. Not to allow Queanbeyan any growth is a ridiculous situation. Queanbeyan has been growing quite substantially and there is certainly pressure for it to grow further. A lot of the developers who used to develop in the ACT have, since the Labor government came into power in the ACT, moved across the border because of the virtual socialisation of land development in the ACT. I believe the ACT government is holding back on an agreement with New South Wales to provide this additional water because it wants to control all land development. It wants the only land development to occur in the ACT. It has a Treasury problem and, therefore, if it can control that, it will help its coffers. I am pretty fed up with the arrogant attitude of the ACT government towards New South Wales on this and other issues. We have had the jail plonked on our doorstep with no consultation and now the ACT government is denying Queanbeyan water-and water, I might add, which is totally captured and stored in New South Wales. It cannot continue and I will not allow it to continue. I have looked at the Googong Dam Catchment Area Act and I believe it MAIN COMMITTEE",256,Statements By Members
292,Mr Nairn (Eden,"Monaro-Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (9.39 am)is within the power of the Australian government to enter into an agreement directly with New South Wales with respect to water for a growing Queanbeyan and the ACT government would be required to adhere to the terms of that agreement. I intend writing to the Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads, Jim Lloyd, along these lines. If there is any doubt legally-and the legal eagles always get involved in these thingsabout the validity of such an agreement, I am ready to prepare a private member’s bill amending the Googong Dam act to ensure that the ACT government adheres to such an agreement. The time for stalling is now over. Either the ACT government agree immediately to provide water for Queanbeyan’s growth or I will act federally to force them. Mr Russell Workman an example of a callous forced redundancy imposed on my constituent Mr Russell Workman, a museum photographer, who has provided 36 years of continuous loyal service to the University of Sydney. Mr Workman came to my office in October and described how a newly appointed Director of University Museums moved ruthlessly to end his employment by way of forced redundancy. Although Mr Workman and his colleagues are protected by the industrial instrument titled General Staff Agreement 2003-2006, it appears the university has little regard for this agreement and is not willing to reconsider its decision. Mr Workman told me, ‘I was asked by the new Director of University Museums to see him in his office. I had no idea why he wanted to see me. Immediately I arrived he told me he was restructuring the museums to his plans and I was redundant. When I told him I was less than three years to retirement and I would lose half my superannuation, projected over 20 years to be around $300,000, he talked over me, changing the subject.’ I wrote to the vice-chancellor, Professor Gavin Brown, concerned about the university’s conduct. In particular, I believe provisions in the staff agreement that require the university to (1) carefully consider alternatives and use targeted redundancies as a last resort, (2) conduct meaningful and timely consultation with affected staff before decisions are made, (3) provide reasons for declaring a position redundant and (4) give four weeks notice from the date of formal advice to allow the employee to take voluntary retrenchment or seek redeployment were all totally ignored. The university’s reply did not begin to answer any of my questions. In 2003 and 2004 Mr Workman had two major archaeology publications illustrated with his photographs and, recently, 170 CD-ROMs have been archived of his digital photography. For all his loyal service Mr Workman was told that any staff member could do his job. As Mr Workman explained in a letter to me, ‘The actual reason the director wants me gone is that he sold his restructure plan to his superiors as being cost neutral and he wants my salary for planned new museum administrative positions.’ I note that the university’s so-called restructuring threatens to mothball a series of unique historic collections. I refer to a report in the Inner Western Suburbs Courier dated 6 December 2005 which says ‘current and former museum staff fear redundancies forced on long-term staff will lead to a knowledge crisis and the effective shelving of museum collections’. I will pursue this matter on behalf of Mr Workman. However, it is important to note that this case also highlights the cruel humbug and cant contained in the government’s argument to justify its extreme industrial relations changes-that is, the argument that employees do not need the MAIN COMMITTEE",257,Statements By Members
293,Mr Murphy (Lowe) (9.42 Am),"This morning I bring to the attention of the parliamentprotection of general or collective agreements because they are always able to negotiate an individual agreement to their advantage. Mr Workman and his colleagues are fighting with their employer to honour a general staff agreement. What hope will any employee in any workplace have when forced to negotiate an individual agreement? Mr Workman and millions of Australians know that, without the protection of a no disadvantage test, they are not in a strong position to negotiate an individual agreement and therefore there can be no choice about the outcome. (Time expired) Moncrieff Electorate: Postal Services the Gold Coast is the fastest growing city in Australia today. It is now Australia’s sixth largest city and we anticipate that, in the coming years, Queensland will become the second most populous state in Australia. It is for that reason and the rapid pace of growth on the Gold Coast that I today highlight a petition that has already been tabled with the House for a new post office at Worongary Village Shopping Centre. The Director of AHC Ltd, Mr Wayne Lester, came to meet me several months ago to talk about the need that he felt existed for a post office serving the suburbs of Worongary, Tallai and Merrimac. I am very supportive of the bid that Worongary Village Shopping Centre has put forward for a new post office. I wrote to Australia Post requesting the installation of a licensed post office. Australia Post indicated in their reply that, in determining whether or not to install a licensed post office operation, they would take into account several factors: the actual anticipated levels of usage of an LPO-a licensed post office; the location of other postal facilities relative to the site where it is proposed that the LPO will go; and the rate of growth for a particular area. I believe that Worongary Village Shopping Centre satisfies the threshold criteria on two of those countsthe location of other postal facilities and the rate of growth for the particular area. There can be no doubt that the Gold Coast is growing rapidly and, with it, suburbs like Worongary, Tallai and Merrimac. What is also clear is that Australia Post has a duty to a prospective purchaser to ensure that actual and anticipated levels of usage warrant the installation of a very expensive, high capital cost, licensed post office. Because of the duty of care that Australia Post must have towards those who would seek to operate and purchase a licensed post office, it is understandable that Australia Post requires that there be an adequate level of anticipated usage for the post office to be justified. Although we are not currently at that position, I am certain that over the coming years we will reach that threshold and a new licensed post office will be able to be installed at Worongary Village Shopping Centre. This is something I believe the residents need, it is something I clearly understand residents are calling for and it is something I completely and totally support. I pledge to work closely with Wayne until we have the installation of a licensed post office. I strongly support this petition of 2,883 signatures. I congratulate the residents of Worongary, Tallai and Merrimac on getting behind this project. I will work closely with them, and I intend to continue to bring to the attention of Australia Post the important need for a new LPO at Worongary. Cyprus Minister of Turkey, Mr Erdogan, to Australia. In doing so, I urge the Australian Prime MinisMAIN COMMITTEE",258,Statements By Members

295,Mr Georganas (Hindmarsh) (9.48 Am),"I rise to acknowledge the visit of the Primeter to raise the issue of Cyprus with his Turkish counterpart. More particularly, I call on Mr Howard to raise with Mr Erdogan the issue of Cyprus and the absolute necessity for the withdrawal of all occupying troops from Cyprus. It is now more than 30 years since the 1974 Turkish invasion of Cyprus. As members may be aware, the invasion resulted in the expulsion of some 200,000 Cypriots from their country. They lost their homes and, in many cases, their friends and family were killed by the army and its confederates. Their property and their churches were illegally confiscated. They continue to be prevented from returning to their homes. In effect, they are refugees from their own country. The Turkish invasion of Cyprus and the subsequent partitioning of the island have rightly been condemned throughout the civilised world. Indeed, to this day the only country that recognises the Republic of Northern Cyprus is Turkey. Despite the passage of over 30 years, not one other country has been prepared to endorse or sanction the 1974 illegal invasion and occupation. Tragically, though, Cyprus remains divided. More than 40,000 Turkish troops continue to be stationed on the island. This, as UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan reminds us, makes Cyprus one of the most militarised areas in the world. This is a most undesirable and a most unenviable status quo-one that is not in the best interests of either Greek or Turkish Cypriots. It is an intolerable situation which cannot, and must not, be allowed to continue. Cyprus must again be united. The healing process must be accelerated. One crucial step has to be the removal of all occupying troops from the island. I urge the Prime Minister, both as a matter of principle and urgency, to raise this with Mr Erdogan when he meets with him tomorrow. Our Prime Minister has a duty to raise these issues with the visiting Turkish PM as many Australians are directly affected by the illegal occupation by Turkey of Northern Cyprus. After 1974 many Cypriot refugees found their way to Australia and today have made Australia their homes. Many of these Cypriot refugees that settled here in Australia can never return to their birthplace. They have lost family homes that have been confiscated. So for these people, many of whom live in the electorate of Hindmarsh, we have a direct responsibility to ensure that we do all we can to solve an unacceptable situation that exists today in their birthland of Northern Cyprus. These people should have a right, just like anybody else, to be able to visit their birthplace and have the three freedoms of movement, settlement and ownership. So it would have been remiss of me if I had not raised this matter today. I have a duty, as an elected member representing many Cypriot Australians in my electorate, to ensure that this issue is brought to the attention of the Turkish PM, to ensure that the Australian government raises the unacceptable issue of Cyprus with the Turkish PM on his visit. I wish to raise another issue which relates to the mainland of Turkey-that is, the Christian Orthodox school of Halki, which has been around for hundreds of years, and the forcible closure by the Turkish authorities of this school. There has been an international campaign to convince the Turkish government to allow the Halki school to reopen. This matter should also be brought to the attention of the visiting PM by our Prime Minister. Dunkley Electorate: Police Resources Secretary to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs) (9.52 am)-I rise today to once again draw attention to the need for additional police resources in the Greater Frankston and Mornington Peninsula area. I have raised this matter on a number MAIN COMMITTEE",259,Statements By Members
296,Mr Billson (Dunkley,"Parliamentary Secretary (Foreign Affairs) and Parliamentaryof occasions and have sought to constructively engage with the local police authorities, the local community, chambers of commerce and others that are part of the broad basis of concern within our community about the availability of policing resources. The Greater Frankston and Mornington Peninsula region has a population of over a quarter of a million. During summer months in particular it swells substantially further than that, placing further strains on the resources of the police authorities. During off-peak times there can be as few as two patrol cars covering the entire region. I have previously mentioned my efforts to draw this to the attention of the state police minister. The minister advised me that it was an operational matter and it got bunted back to the police minister’s offices. All of that is fascinating, and I am sure some people are enjoying themselves greatly, but the reality is that we still have a concern and it needs to be addressed. A crisis public meeting is to be held in Frankston next Wednesday. Recently 70 police from the region met with the police association to express their deep concerns. The association says staffing levels at Frankston are well below the established profile for a 24-hour police complex. It has been estimated that Frankston station has a current uniform profile of two senior sergeants, nine sergeants and 40 constables and senior constables, giving a total of 51 uniformed officers. It should have about 88, including 73 constables and senior constables, 13 sergeants and two senior sergeants. The police themselves are saying the resourcing issue is worse than ever. I know this is a topical issue that comes up from time to time. It saddens me that some are viewing this very real problem-a very genuine concern within the local community, a very sincere belief by police officers themselves-as nothing more than an industrial campaign. It saddens me that they are missing the point. We have seen example after example-and I have raised some in this House-of how calls to police for assistance are either not responded to or are responded to many hours, or in some cases days, after the event. This is of very real concern. For people to discount this as simply an industrial campaign saddens me greatly because we do need extra resources in our area. I have mentioned the patrol cars. We have officers who are still cadets and have not even left the academy who are appearing on staffing rosters. This is distorting the picture of the usable available tools that our police officers and the police command in our area have available to them. I admire the way the police go about their work in our region. They are extremely dedicated and committed. They are extraordinarily flexible in light of this very real resource demand. I think we need to focus on this area urgently. I call on the state local members of parliament to get active and involved and address this very real concern in our community. Environment Ms KATE ELLIS (Adelaide) (9.55 am)-TodayI rise to speak on the need for leadership and bold action to tackle environmental issues. For 10 long years, since the election of the Howard government, we have witnessed a devastating absence of innovative and visionary environmental policies. The government has turned its back on the dire environmental problems that face both our country and our world-problems like climate change, water quality, adequate water flows for rivers and estuaries, native vegetation and maintaining biodiversity in our ecosystems. MAIN COMMITTEE This is not the first time that I have spoken on issues of the environment and it will not be the last. It is about time that the government showed some leadership and developed some long-term goals. In recent years, we have read a number of disturbing reports about the state of the global environment, but what action do we see from this government? Pretty close to nothing. The government disregards the problems damaging our environment and blatantly refuses to commit to international efforts to combat climate change. Thanks to the Howard government, our leadership in reducing greenhouse gas emissions has been appalling and the government’s failure to ratify the Kyoto agreement has sacrificed our position as a leader in international negotiations. Australians are now more concerned about the health of our environment-and, considering the current circumstances, we should be. More than ever, we are witnessing the devastating effects that humanity is having on our environment. But, fortunately, it is not all doom and gloom. I would like to commend the South Australian Labor government for their commitment to environmental policies and to listening to the concerns of the South Australian people in taking an active role on environmental issues. The South Australian government has recently announced a series of initiatives, which I would like to outline to the House. By1 January 2009, the use of single-use plastic bags will be banned in our state. The government has also converted 535 buses and 95 railcars to using biodiesel fuels, making Adelaide’s public transport fleet the greenest in Australia. South Australia now easily leads the nation in wind power, solar power and water recycling. Thanks to the South Australian government, the latest SA wind farm will save 300,000 tonnes of CO2 from being pumped into the atmosphere-the equivalent of taking 70,000 cars off the road. South Australia’s state Parliament House is now powered by solar energy, our state library is in the process of converting to solar energy and the government is currently installing 250 solar panels on the roofs of 250 South Australian schools. These are examples of innovative and long-term policies. I call on the Howard government to show us some more. This is the kind of leadership that the federal government should be demonstrating. I commend our South Australian Premier, Mike Rann, for both his vision and his leadership when it comes to tackling environmental issues. I just think it is an absolute pity for all of us, as Australians and, indeed, as members of the global community, that we do not have some national leadership from our federal government. Motorcycle Charity Run proached by Danny Kennedy, a Vietnam veteran and a member of the Ulysses MotorCycle Club, to see whether I would don the leathers and join him in a charity bike ride. WouldI ever! My greatest love is motorbikes. This annual event sees a huge convoy of riders take to the highway to deliver Christmas toys to local children. So, naturally, I could not say no, and I turned up last Sunday at the Shoalhaven City Council car park, along with over 400 other riders. Also, the Minister for Education, Science and Training, Brendan Nelson, who is a member of the Ulysses club, joined in the ride, bringing his toys for the kids. I am grateful to him for choosing to get involved. Even though I have my own motorcycle licence, I have no bike. SoI accepted Danny’s offer of a dink on his Harley Davidson Goldwing ‘trike’. I should also like to thank Danny’s wife, Sue, for lending him to me for the morning. Danny came in a couple of days beforehand MAIN COMMITTEE",260,Statements By Members
297,Mrs Gash (Gilmore) (9.58 Am),"A few weeks ago at a veterans function, I was apand fitted me for my helmet and clothes, so I was ready to go. I suppose the most heartstirring moment was when all the bikes fired up at once. The roar of the engines was truly inspirational, and I know of one or two people who had a tear in the eye at that particular moment. The local police provided escort duty, and I must thank them for their cooperation and assistance in maintaining the integrity of the convoy right through to Berry Bowling Club. The ride was exhilarating. I had forgotten until that moment what a joy and sense of freedom a bike can bring. The riders ranged from some very well-respected people on sleek machines to ‘rough trade’ bikies, but all with golden hearts. The ride took about 20 minutes through the lush countryside between Nowra and Berry and ended with a sausage sizzle and an opportunity to share the moment with fellow enthusiasts. I have resolved that next year I will ride again, but on my own bike-not that I did not enjoy yours, Danny. These are terrific people-real salt of the earth. It is little wonder that so many people in later life sign up to the intrepid band called the Ulysses Club, whose motto is ‘Grow old disgracefully’. What they and other motorcycle riders did on that Sunday was no disgrace but a magnificent gesture of generosity and community spirit. I pay tribute to the South Coast Ulysses Club, who organised the event, and of course a very special thank you to Danny for giving me this fantastic opportunity. I will give a brief history of the Ulysses club, which is for older motorcyclists. It is the largest organisation of its kind in Australia and is now a familiar part of this country’s riding scene. The original suggestion for a club for over-50s motorcyclists was put forward in the August 1983 edition of Bike Australia, and from that tenuous beginning it has never looked back. The club now boasts a large and extensive network of members throughout Australia. It describes very well indeed the sort of person who still has enough spark to go on riding in middle years and later times. Sunday’s ride also drew some younger types, but all were motorcycle enthusiasts. All the toys collected were later distributed to local charities. It is important to observe that this act of giving not only benefits children and various charities but also created a warm glow for each and every rider. I hope that in years to come the convoy gets longer and longer, for as it does more and more people will come to appreciate this act of giving and perhaps they too will be inspired to become involved in the Christmas spirit.

Ms LIVERMORE (Capricornia) (10.01 am)-Labor support the Anglo-Australian Telescope Agreement Amendment Bill 2005, as it amends the Anglo-Australian Telescope Agreement Act 1970 to incorporate the 2005 supplementary agreement to the AngloAustralian Telescope Agreement. In saying that we support this bill that is not to say that we support the government’s general approach to-I would say neglect of-science, research and, more generally, education in science and technology in this country. I will be moving a MAIN COMMITTEE",262,Statements By Members
298,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Ir Causley),"In accordance with sessional order 193,second reading amendment to this bill at the conclusion of my remarks to reflect Labor’s concerns in those important areas. This bill provides for the termination of both the original Anglo-Australian Telescope Agreement and the supplementary agreement on 30 June 2010. It allows for the transfer of ownership and control of the Anglo-Australian telescope to Australia. Finally, it establishes the United Kingdom’s funding levels for the telescope, as per the 2005 supplementary agreement, until the transfer of ownership to Australia in 2010. So far, the Anglo-Australian telescope has been funded on an equal basis by Australia and the UK. In fact, this bill and the comments by the Minister for Education, Science and Training do nothing to guarantee present funding levels to the telescope. The 2005 supplementary agreement could result in a cut in funding to the Anglo-Australian telescope, as the Australian government is not making up for the shortfall in funding provided by the United Kingdom in the lead-up to 2010. The scientific community is rightly worried about the government’s lack of commitment to such an excellent research facility. This government’s contribution to science and research in this country has involved cuts to university funding and vetoing research grants it does not like, so we should not be at all surprised by this latest cut. The withdrawal of the UK from the agreement presents an opportunity for Australia to expand its research commitment and output in astronomy. Australian astronomers can now spend more time observing at the telescope because the agreement allows time to each country relative to its funding contribution. But Australian science could miss out if the government does not guarantee higher funding levels for the telescope. The original Anglo-Australian Telescope Agreement, signed on 25 September 1969, allowed for the construction of the Anglo-Australian telescope at Siding Spring near Coonabarabran, New South Wales. Its mirror diameter of 3.9 metres and state-of-the-art design made it one of the largest and most sophisticated optical telescopes in existence at that time. Thirty years later the excellent design, a long period of stable funding and a continuing program of technical enhancements have kept the telescope at the leading edge of astronomical research against much international competition. Staff at the telescope are considered world leaders in many areas of astronomical instrumentation and are often asked to provide advice to other organisations and to build instruments for their telescopes. But the new generation of telescopes, with mirrors eight metres or more in diameter, are closing in on telescopes like the Anglo-Australian telescope. The UK terminated its involvement with the Anglo-Australian telescope to redirect its funding to the next generation eight-metre optical telescopes at the European Southern Observatory and Gemini Observatories. The Anglo-Australian telescope cannot keep up with continuing to provide Australian astronomers, students and the general public with access to cutting-edge facilities unless the government gets its priorities straight. At the moment, Australia and the UK provide $A4.112 million to the Anglo-Australian Telescope Board, which is indexed annually. In the lead-up to 2010, the UK intends to reduce its funding contribution to $A2 million in 2006-07 and to $A1 million for each year after that until 2010. This is a shortfall of some $A11 million over four years, which is a massive amount. The budget shows that the Commonwealth does not intend to increase its outlays on the Anglo-Australian telescope to compensate for the reduced UK funding. The government will contribute $4.5 million in 2005-06 and only $4.9 million in 2008-09. This is in contrast to the MAIN COMMITTEE $50 million that the Howard government blew, in about three nanoseconds, on its outrageous advertising campaign for the extreme industrial relations changes. The Prime Minister alone managed to spend $5.2 million in two years on overseas luxury travel bills, and the Department of Education, Science and Training spent $600,000 on canapes, champagne and corporate hospitality alone. So we know that this is a government that knows how to waste taxpayers’ money. It has become very good with the taxpayer credit card. Yet, when we have a valuable and critical facility such as the Anglo-Australian telescope, this government is nowhere to be seen. The sum of $11 million is peanuts for this extreme and extravagant government but, regardless, it is intent on destroying an important scientific asset. Last year the Department of Education, Science and Training advised the parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on Treaties that any additional funding would have to be through competitive grants: for example, through individual researchers applying for Australian Research Council grants. By their very nature, competitive grants are uncertain. It is ludicrous for the government to suggest that an $11 million black hole could be replaced by competitive grants either to the 12 or so staff employed at the telescope or to external researchers buying observing time at the telescope. Professor Penny Sackett, head of the Research Schools of Astronomy and Astrophysics at the Australian National University, told the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties that this funding uncertainty has caused great concern to the Australian scientific community. I would like to express my concern, however, that the declining budget for the AAO in the period 2006 to 2010 could have deleterious implications for the ability of this model national facility to maintain its excellent service to its user base while exploring new opportunities for optical infrared astronomy for the Australian community. A separate review of this matter would be timely. Even the government appointed Anglo-Australian Telescope Board could not resist saying: The gradual withdrawal of the UK funding does provide the AATB with some challenges. As this comes from careful and measured scientists who are not often prone to exaggeration, these words are alarming. The draft Australian decadal plan for 2006 to 2015 prioritises international collaborations on new generation optical telescopes and the major radio telescopes, but the Australian scientific community is concerned that Australia’s low contributions to very expensive international projects, usually around six per cent to 10 per cent, are a disincentive to successful collaboration and do little to enhance Australia’s international reputation in and contribution to astronomy. We must have excellent cutting-edge astronomical research facilities in Australia to allow for international collaboration and domestic projects and to provide a learning facility for Australian students. The Anglo-Australian telescope is a national facility in high demand. Observing time is always oversubscribed. According to a recent study, the Anglo-Australian telescope is the most productive telescope greater than three metres in size as it has a high number of citations in scientific papers. In total, 112 AAT data papers were published in 2003-04-an all-time high. Its Two Degree Field Galaxy Red Shift Survey was the biggest galaxy survey ever made, producing a map showing the location of more than 221,000 galaxies in space. It was completed in 2003 and labelled, by a leading cosmologist, as ‘undoubtedly Australia’s largest contribution to astronomical research ever’. MAIN COMMITTEE The Anglo-Australian telescope has enabled the discovery of more than 20 planets around stars other than the sun and a new class of galaxies-very small ones known as ultra-compact dwarfs. The Anglo-Australian telescope web site consistently attracts over one million hits per month. Through its strong links with universities in both Australia and the United Kingdom, the telescope plays an active role in higher education. This is a hard working telescope and we must support it properly. The telescope requires funding certainty to maintain its quality and scientific capacity. Given that the Mount Stromlo Observatory in Canberra was destroyed in the bushfires, there is even greater pressure on the Anglo-Australian telescope. But the Commonwealth government is not increasing its funding contribution to enable the Anglo-Australian telescope to meet growing demand. The minister for education has just washed his hands of this and asked the telescope board to raise external revenue from elsewhere-an extraordinary suggestion in a field which is reliant on public funding and which cannot easily go out and make a profit. This could destroy the telescope and its critical role in promoting Australian astronomy. Where countries like the United States and the UK are increasing funding, Australian funding for astronomy is fading away. The government has already cut over $5 billion from our universities. Funding for research and development has dropped to 0.6 per cent of GDP-the lowest in two decades-and it will fall further under this government; there is no doubt about that. This all means fewer researchers and fewer students. Those young researchers are concerned that they have no prospects in astronomy if they stay in Australia. Young researchers at the Science Meets Parliament event this year knew that if they stayed in Australia they would have to give up astronomy altogether and become computer programmers. There are a declining number of students applying to enter university physics and chemistry courses. Year 12 enrolments in physics, chemistry and advanced maths are falling steadily. Between 1980 and 2002 the proportion of year 12 students taking chemistry or physics nearly halved. We must engage young Australians in the wonders of science and the stars. We need to find new ways of instilling children with the wonder and curiosity about the world around them that will lead them to undertake scientific endeavours. Astronomy is an awe-inspiring opportunity to do just that: to capture our young people with the magic of the stars, to stretch their realm of understanding beyond our earthly confines and to engage them in the beauty and wonder of this universe. The Anglo-Australian telescope is part of our national wondermaking machine and it must be supported and funded to continue Australians’ fascination with the skies. The government must announce immediately additional funding support for the telescope. On balance, the supplementary agreement in this bill is necessary to continue the smooth operation of the Anglo-Australian telescope until at least 2010 and Labor will support it. However, as foreshadowed at the beginning of my remarks, I move: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for: (1) not making up for the approximately $11 million reduction in funding provided to the AngloAustralian Telescope by the United Kingdom in the lead-up to the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the Anglo-Australian Telescope Agreement in 2010; (2) the Government’s lack of commitment to Australian astronomy by not adequately funding an excellent research facility, astronomy research and science in our universities; MAIN COMMITTEE (3) jeopardising science and research in Australia by dropping its investment to 0.6 per cent of GDPthe lowest level in two decades; (4) its inaction while physics, chemistry and mathematics enrolments fall in schools and universities; and (5) slashing over $5 billion from our universities despite a massive skills crisis in the sciences and engineering. Amendment Bill 2005 amends the Anglo-Australian Telescope Agreement Act 1970 to incorporate the supplementary agreement to the Anglo-Australian Telescope Agreement. The supplementary agreement is a treaty action between the government of the Commonwealth of Australia and the government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. It was signed by both parties in Canberra on 3 November 2005. As acting chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, I tabled report 68 in this parliament on 7 November 2005. The report noted it was in Australia’s interest for the treaty to be ratified. I advise the House today that during those deliberations and indeed the public inquiry there was certainly no dissent from the opposition with regard to the report or the ratification of that treaty. The bill amends the original AAT Agreement which was signed on 25 September 1969 to modify arrangements for the operation of the Anglo-Australian telescope and associated facilities. The primary reason for the supplementary agreement is to provide for a gradual reduction in the UK’s involvement in the AAT, and it provides for the termination of the original agreement and the supplementary agreement on 30 June 2010 with the transfer of ownership and control of the facility to Australia. Australia benefits from the incorporation of the supplementary agreement as it will provide for the UK’s commitment to the telescope to continue until Australia obtains sole ownership in July 2010. In other words, there will be a phase-out period over the next five years which will allow Australia extra time and a clear framework to determine its long-term policy in relation to the Anglo-Australian telescope. It will also give us time to look at funding issues. I take on board what the member for Capricornia said in her speech today, although I reject many of her comments with regard to the AAT and the transfer of ownership to Australia. In the late 1960s, the United Kingdom and Australian governments agreed to undertake a significant collaboration in astronomy by jointly funding the construction and operation of the 3.9 metre Anglo-Australian telescope at Siding Spring in New South Wales. The AngloAustralian telescope was at that time one of the largest and most sophisticated optical telescopes in existence. Evidence to the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties indicated that over the ensuing 30 years the AAT made a significant contribution to astronomy, both in Australia and internationally, and had been a major factor in Australia’s high international standing in the field of astronomy. In evidence to the committee, Dr Arthur, the Group Manager, Innovation and Research Systems, from the Department of Education, Science and Training, advised the committee that the AAT remains one of the most productive telescopes in the world, particularly amongst MAIN COMMITTEE",263,Anglo Australian Telescope Agreement Amendment Bill 2005

300,Mr Danby,I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.,267,Anglo Australian Telescope Agreement Amendment Bill 2005
301,Mrs May (Mcpherson) (10.15 Am),"The Anglo-Australian Telescope Agreementthe four-metre class of telescope. Among other things, the AAT has been noted for its survey work in mapping very large scale structures in the universe. The United Kingdom government decided in 2001 that it would reallocate astronomy funding to other facilities such as the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii and the European Southern Observatory in Chile, which operate next-generation eight-metre optical telescopes. Under the current AAT agreement, either government has the right to terminate the agreement with five years notice, but instead of the UK issuing a five-year termination notice, the governments agreed to amend the agreement and set the end date for collaboration in 2010, at which time the AAT and associated facilities would pass to sole Australian ownership and control, where they are likely to provide a valuable scientific and educational tool for many years to come. The supplementary agreement benefits Australia in a number of ways and allows during the transition period for new financing and access arrangements to be negotiated. It gives us time to determine our long-term position with regard to the AAT. The transition time extends the scientific and technological collaboration with the UK and maintains UK funding, albeit at a lower level, for an additional five years. Without that transition period, we may not have had that funding. I think the UK government has been extremely fair in the negotiation process in allowing that transition period of five years. The supplementary agreement also provides early clarity regarding what will happen with the UK’s share of the equipment and facilities built up over 35 years. Essentially, the AAT will be gifted to Australia when the agreement ends in 2010. This gift will be a unique and valuable resource for research and teaching in astronomy for the foreseeable future. The AAT is the largest optical telescope that is ever likely to be built on the Australian mainland and has a notional value of around $48 million-a wonderful gift for Australia. A recent review of Australian astronomy found that the AAT will continue to be a world leader in survey astronomy for at least the next five years. Beyond that it would continue to be the largest source of observing time for Australian astronomers for some time, assuming it continues to operate. The Australian government has made forward estimates to support the telescope. For the current year there is an allocation of $4.594 million, with forward estimates of $4.694 million in 2006-07, $4.798 million in 2007-08 and $4.903 million in 2008-09. Also, the Minister for Education, Science and Training, Dr Nelson, has approved a one-off grant of $2.05 million in 2005-06 to address a number of occupational health and safety issues at the Anglo-Australian telescope. As the name suggests, the Anglo-Australian Observatory is a national facility shared predominantly with the United Kingdom, with other countries also able to use the facility. The facility is always in high demand and use of the facility is allocated based on the merit of proposed research programs. Through international collaboration during the life of the AAT, it has been involved in major surveys collecting information about tens of thousands of stars and hundreds of thousands of galaxies. These include the two-degree field galaxy red shift survey, which mapped more than 221,000 galaxies in space; the six-degree field galaxy survey of 20,000 quasars, or bright cores of distant galaxies, which will help to understand how the universe developed; and the radial velocity experiment, which will collect data on 80,000 stars to help reconstruct the history of the Milky Way. There is no doubt the AAT is a valuable piece of equipment that has made a significant contribution to astronomy. Instead of terminating the agreement with Australia, the UK has MAIN COMMITTEE agreed to amend the existing agreement to continue the UK’s commitment to the AAT but at a reduced level until the termination of both agreements in 2010. The new termination date and the telescope handover arrangements will ensure long-term access for Australia to a valuable scientific instrument in the lead-up to Australia’s acquisition of the Anglo-Australian telescope. I commend the bill to the House. In summing up this debate on behalf of the Minister for Education, Science and Training, I thank the member for McPherson for her contribution. BeforeI sum up, I will first deal with the very late second reading amendment to the Anglo-Australian Telescope Agreement Amendment Bill 2005 put forward by the opposition. The member for Capricornia was obviously sent in here by the member for Jagajaga to read a speech and try to attack the government, but she, like so many opposite, is a political scientist, not a real scientist, and probably did not know quite what she was criticising the government about on astronomy, because what she said was just so far from the truth it is not funny. Let me deal briefly with the amendment put forward. It criticises the Australian government because the arrangement we have made with the United Kingdom provides that the United Kingdom will reduce its funding over a transitional period. In Australia, it seems that when the various state Labor governments withdraw funding from something that has always been their responsibility the federal Labor Party immediately says: ‘Come on, you the Australian government should make up for the funding taken away by the states.’ And now it is saying that when another country makes a decision about its investment we are supposed to make up for that as well. More money than is claimed will be reduced will be made up in a whole variety of ways. For instance, even in the last four years, the Australian-Anglo Telescope has attracted $7.1 million in additional funding through competitive grants. It will be eligible for competitive grants both in the UK and in Australia-the AAT board will be able to apply for those. The AAT is currently bidding for an instrumentation project out of the Gemini and Subaru projects in Hawaii with a value of around $60 million, so to criticise the Australian government over this arrangement is, I find, quite amazing. The member for Capricornia also attacked the Australian government about our so-called lack of commitment to astronomy. This is where she really did not know what she was talking about. Two weeks ago I was at the 40th birthday celebrations of the Molonglo Radio Telescope, which is in my electorate, close here to Canberra. It is a fantastic facility that so many people do not know about. It does superb work, and the Australian government’s commitment to that has been very strong. In fact, only a couple of days before I attended that 40th birthday celebration-where we had some of the great radio astronomers of Australia in attendance-I was able to announce, as part of the Australian Research Council grants, additional funding to that radio telescope. We have a very strong commitment to the Square Kilometre Array. The member for Capricornia did not mention that-she probably does not know what it is aboutbut it is a major international project on which Australia is certainly working very closely with our overseas colleagues. We also are working on the ELT, the Extremely Large Telescope-she did not mention that-and looking at where Australia might be involved in that in the future as well. The Australian government will be committing $52 billion-unprecedented funding-in the 10 years between 2001-02 and 2011 for research and development. Just in the last year we MAIN COMMITTEE",267,Anglo Australian Telescope Agreement Amendment Bill 2005
302,Mr Nairn (Eden,"Monaro-Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (10.23 am)have seen a four per cent real increase in research and development, from $5.3 billion to $5.5 billion. In addition, the member for Capricornia’s amendment mentions inaction with respect to physics and chemistry. Here are some other aspects to consider: $29 million of scope funding for the Science Connections Program, which is aimed at year 10 students to encourage further study; $33 million for ASISTM, funding which brings schools, universities and industries together for young science students; and, from 2001 to 2003, a 14 per cent increase in science places at universities. So the amendment is just a stunt coming from an opposition that cannot bring itself to come out and support a bill totally-a good bill, which this is. I will refer now to the rest of the bill as part of the summing up. The bill before the House is necessary to enact a number of changes that have recently been negotiated to the long standing treaty between the governments of Australia and the United Kingdom regarding the Anglo-Australian Telescope at Siding Spring near Coonabarabran in New South Wales. Back in the late 1960s the governments made the decision to jointly build and operate a major new optical telescope. That decision was historic and significant for a number of reasons. At a time when most large telescopes were based in the Northern Hemisphere, it led to a substantial improvement in the capacity of astronomers to observe and understand the southern skies. It gave astronomers from both Australia and Britain access to one of the world’s most sophisticated optical telescopes, and it provided a focus for technological innovation and achievement that continues to the present. This was a key aspect in the growth of astronomical science, not only in Australia but in the whole Southern Hemisphere. I did two years of astronomy at university as part of my degree, and Australia is so highly regarded in astronomical matters worldwide it is not funny. I really saw that when I worked overseas at a research agency where there were Australians and others who had done work in Australia and then took that knowledge overseas. Even today the Anglo-Australian telescope remains one of the most productive major telescopes in the world, particularly amongst the four-metre class of telescope. Recent scientific highlights include the discovery of the 100th extrasolar planet and the discovery of a new type of ultracompact dwarf galaxy. The government is pleased that the new supplementary agreement extends the scientific and technological collaboration with Britain for a further five years. The new agreement also provides for an orderly wind-down of the UK’s involvement over that time and for the AngloAustralian telescope to be transferred to sole Australian ownership in 2010, after which it will provide a valuable scientific and educational tool for Australia for many years to come. However, the conclusion of the Anglo-Australian Telescope Agreement in 2010 is unlikely to be the end of the immensely valuable collaboration with the UK in astronomy. I look forward to continuing cooperation to the benefit of both our scientific communities. Another aspect that I might mention in the flow-on of this research and this knowledge here in Australia is to the instrumentation which, unbeknownst to a lot of people, is situated in my electorate. Not far from here, in Queanbeyan, is a company called Electro Optic Systems, which builds telescopes. One part of its operations, besides the laser tracking that it does, is in building telescopes that are going to various parts of the world. It has been the development of this knowledge and capacity here in Australia through this agreement over more than four decades that has helped develop this industry-a very strong and growing industry, I might add. I commend the bill to the House. MAIN COMMITTEE now read a second time. To this the honourable member for Capricornia has moved as an amendment that all words after ‘That’ be omitted with a view to substituting other words. The immediate question is that the words proposed to be omitted stand part of the question. Question agreed to. Original question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment. Procedure Committee Report Debate resumed from 28 November, on motion by Mrs May: That the House take note of the report. Ms HOARE (Charlton) (10.33 am)-I am pleased to speak to this report, A History of the Procedure Committee on its 20th anniversary. It marks and chronicles 20 years of the operation of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Procedure, of which I am proud to be a member. Members over the years have spoken about the many and great achievements of this committee over the past 20 years, all of which are listed in this report and two of which I will go to shortly. First, I want to go to a major aspect of the Procedure Committee, and that is the contribution of backbenchers-both new and longer serving, government and opposition, experts in procedure and nonexperts with plenty of enthusiasm-to reforming the procedures of the House of Representatives. The Procedure Committee effectively replaced the Standing Orders Committee of this House, although that was not meant to be at the time. The membership of the old Standing Orders Committee included members of parliament with vested interests, such as leaders of the House, managers of opposition business, ministers and shadow ministers. Thus, the membership of the Standing Orders Committee maintained and pursued vested interests, and those were the interests of government or opposition for the benefit of government or opposition. However, 20 years of the Procedure Committee has allowed backbenchers to pursue changes. This history stands as a testament to the contribution of 53 members of parliament over the past 20 years to the changing and evolving procedures of the House of Representatives. All members who have contributed to the committee have truly wanted the institution to work not for vested interest but for the democracy of our country. All these contributions have come from various levels of expertise. Indeed, chapter 9 of the report includes a section entitled ‘Expertise versus effectiveness’. I believe the title should also include ‘enthusiasm’. As a new non-expert member of the Procedure Committee, I have been very impressed by the level of discussion by all members concerning the various questions which have been before us over the past 12 months. I would like to pay tribute to the longest-serving member of the Procedure Committee, the Hon. Roger Price MP, the member for Chifley. I thank him for his wise guidance and counsel over the past 12 months. I would like to refer to two major changes. The first being the establishment of the Main Committee, where we are now discussing this report. There were many long discussions about MAIN COMMITTEE",269,Anglo Australian Telescope Agreement Amendment Bill 2005
303,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Ir Causley),"The original question was that this bill be the establishment of a second chamber in this place, where so-called non-controversial legislation could be discussed to allow ongoing operations and government business to move through parliament. As a backbencher who has had various opportunities to speak in the Main Committee, I believe that it has been a success. There have been various discussions in the Procedure Committee over the past 12 months about how the Main Committee can perhaps be further enhanced and gain greater stature within the parliament. It was of concern to all of us, from a discussion that we had with them, that members of the press gallery did not realise, so many years after its establishment, that the Main Committee existed. So we have made sure that they do know now and, hopefully, they will reflect their new-found knowledge in their reporting. The other procedural change that I would like to refer to relates to sitting hours. I think the issue of sitting hours will always involve ongoing discussion within both the Procedure Committee and the parliament in general. The former member for Charlton, Bob Brown, was the Chair of the Procedure Committee during the 1993-96 parliament, which amended the sitting hours to reflect more sensible times for members of parliament in this place. The sitting hours at that time ended at 8 pm on most evenings during the week. The first thing that Prime Minister Howard did when he was elected in 1996 was to change those sitting hours back to the old times-back to the days of late nights. What was most extraordinary was that the House of Representatives standing orders allowed the parliament to sit until 11 o’clock at night, yet there was an hour and a half dinner break, when the work of the parliament stopped. There are not many places you can go to and there is not much you can do in an hour and a half, from 6.30 until eight o’clock in this place-and then you have to come back and debate legislation from eight o’clock to 11 o’clock at night. Since 1998, when I first came into this place, I have had discussions with government members, where various government members have said that, as new government members in 1996, the first vote that they took in the House of Representatives was a vote that they were entirely against, for various reasons: the vote to extend the sitting hours until 11 o’clock. I congratulate the Procedure Committee, chaired by the member for McPherson, on moving those times back to the more sensible sitting times that we enjoy today. It is interesting to note the sitting hours introduced by the Prime Minister in 1996 were changed following lobbying by government members. They succeeded in their pursuit of changed sitting hours. Following the use of the gag or guillotine over the past couple of weeks in this place and in the Senate, where the government is now using its power to gag debate and pursue its agenda without the proper scrutiny of this parliament, I would like to see the Procedure Committee look at the imposition of the gag or the guillotine by governments and to investigate how effectively it closes down the investigation of legislation and the pursuit of detailed amendments to legislation by both government backbenchers and the opposition. I recommend that the Procedure Committee inquire into this over the course of this parliament. In conclusion, I thank the chair-my good friend the member for McPherson-for her work over the past 12 months when I have been involved in the Procedure Committee, particularly in relation to this report. I also thank the deputy chair-the member for Banks-and all other members of the committee. I thank the secretariat: the secretary of the committee, Ms Judy Middlebrook; Ms Robyn McClelland; John Craig; Samantha Mannette; and Penny MAIN COMMITTEE Branson. I apologise to Robyn for what she might have seen as my pedantic dissection of this report in terms of grammar and punctuation. The member for McPherson nods. We were both electorate officers and we are very good proofreaders. It was a bane to the secretariat but they took it all in good humour and with generous goodwill. In commending the report, and probably having my last opportunity to speak in this place before we rise for the summer recess, I wish all of my colleagues on the Procedure Committee and you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and everybody in this place a happy, safe and peaceful festive season. I hope that all of us will return in the new year. I think we all deserve to have a good break; we all need it. I thank all the staff who work in this place and wish them the best as well. dure Committee, which has produced the report entitled A history of the Procedure Committee on its 20th anniversary. I believe that the way in which we go about our business in the House and the way we conduct ourselves should be the subject of review and scrutiny if we are to continue to be relevant to our constituents and to retain their respect. It would be all too easy for an institution such as this, which operates to a complicated and arcane set of rules, to resist change. It would be easy because meaningful change requires considerable focus-we are often fully occupied with the routine business of this House and our electorates-and it would be easy because often we are preoccupied with party political conflicts. I commend this report as I believe it is important to record and reflect on the development of practices and procedures of the House of Representatives. As our report notes, this House did not devise its own rules and orders when it first sat in 1901. It started with a set of provisional standing orders drawing on colonial experience. Under our Westminster heritage, which remained in use for 50 years, the emphasis then, and for many years to follow, was on getting the business done. Enabling the government to legislate is one of our main functions, but we forget at our peril the duty to scrutinise, the duty to bring to the attention of the government of the day the concerns of our electorates. To do that, we need to have opportunities firmly embedded in the procedures of the House. Creating and maintaining those opportunities has rightly been the concern of the Procedure Committee since its inception. Creating the conditions for an effective combination of legislation, scrutiny and representation is a tall order. Fortunately, we have not had to deal with many of the major issues that the mother parliament in the United Kingdom has been dealing with since 1265. It was not until 1377 that they got around to appointing their first Speaker, Thomas Hungerford, and not until 1414 that HenryV undertook that ‘nothing be enacted to the petition of the Commons contrary to their asking’. Relations with the monarch of the day did not always run smoothly. In 1642, CharlesI attempted to arrest five members who were leading a campaign of reformMrs May interjectingportunity to strike another blow for the independence of the House when he uttered these words to the King in refusing to betray the five: May it please your Majesty, I have neither eyes to see nor tongue to speak in this place but as this House is pleased to direct me, whose servant I am here; and humbly beg your Majesty’s pardon that I cannot give any other answer than this to what your Majesty is pleased to demand of me.

305,Mr Hartsuyker,"Heaven forbid!-thus giving the Speaker William Lenthall the opNeedless to say, he was a lawyer. With one obvious exception, we have been spared major battles with our monarch or her representative. A division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 10.46 am to 11.35 am ception we have been spared major battles with our monarch or her representative and that we have been provided with a sound working model on which to base our own methods of running this House effectively. As a sovereign nation, we have a responsibility to find our own solutions to our own problems. As the nation of Australia, we are indeed unique. For instance, Canberra is far more distant from many of our citizens than London is from most of Britain’s citizens. Developments such as the televising of proceedings and the growth of the internet have therefore more significance for us, as does the sheer size of some of our electorates and the distances that many members have to travel to see constituents and to attend this House. It is right therefore that the thrust of the committee’s work to date has been on giving all members more opportunities to participate in proceedings. We have new arrangements for private members’ business, including grievance debates, and we have the Main Committee, which started its work some five years before the Westminster equivalent. Community involvement in the House and its activities has been improved and sitting hours have been restructured, all of which I hope make the proceedings of the House more relevant and open to our constituents. Where do we go from here? We need to give thought to a mechanism for ensuring that committee reports are properly considered and acted upon rather than being left in the air and at the mercy of the goodwill of political parties and the pressures of parliamentary business. The conduct of parliamentary question time has long been ripe for review. Are there processes of the House which have declining relevance to the House itself and the people we represent? Can we better use technology to more effectively conduct the business of the House? Electronic voting is a prime example of this. I believe the thrust of our work to enhance the role of individual members and to give them ample opportunity to bring the concerns of their constituents to the attention of the House should continue. But good intentions as expressed in committee reports are not enough. We must ensure that those good intentions are implemented. Debate (on motion by Mr Neville) adjourned. Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Committee Report Debate resumed from 28 November, on motion by Mr Schultz: That the House take note of the report. House of Representatives Standing Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry entitled Taking control: a national approach to pest animals. This report took a substantial part of this year to prepare. I do not think many are aware of the number of pest animals that exist in Australia and also of the difficulties we sometimes have when native animals become pests and get involved in our farming communities and also in our forestry operations. We made a recommendation in relation to 1080 poison in the Tasmanian situation. I would like to mention MAIN COMMITTEE",273,Committees
306,Mr Hartsuyker,I believe I was commenting on the fact that with one obvious ex,274,Committees
307,Mr Adams (Lyons) (11.38 Am),"It is a pleasure to continue to talk about the report of thethat in Tasmania the state government has phased out 1080 from forestry operations through its forestry commission but has left open the poison’s use in the private sector, where farmers and private foresters can still use 1080 as a way of knocking down pest animals. To explain that situation, the difficulty is that in Tasmania the planting of a plantation or renewing forestry means the planting of seedlings, which are very tasty to three species of the native animals. One is the possum and the other two are the wallaby and the pademelon. The pademelon is a small wallaby. They eat the top of those seedlings, which is a pretty costly operation, so there has been a process of poisoning using 1080 to knock down a certain number of those animals. There is always some criticism of the use of 1080 poisoning in Tasmania, but I point out that last year in Tasmania we used 10 kilos of 1080 poison. I understand that New South Wales uses 500 kilos. When I was in New Zealand, talking to the New Zealand government and their agencies in April this year, I learnt that they use over 2,000 kilos to keep down their wild animals-especially possums, which have a big effect on the dairy industry. Our recommendation grew out of evidence we received from the farmers and graziers that they still need an opportunity to knock down some of the native animals when they do certain operations. Some of the major recommendations in the report came about from the evidence. One of the main recommendations is that we establish a national pest animals and weeds committee so that we pull together in the country a focus as to how we are doing things. The traditional way has been that the state government old agriculture department is the focus of this, whereas we really do need a national approach so we can use the best brains in the country from time to time to tackle the problem. One recommendation is to make sure that we map populations-where they are going-of vertebrate and invertebrate pests to develop a risk assessment process for pest species that exist in the country and probably have not yet established fully. We are thinking into the future. Another recommendation is to develop national pest animal welfare standards: if we are going to knock animals over, we should do it in the best possible way. I think that is a good recommendation for the way we should be operating in Australia. We certainly took evidence on the camel and the donkey problems, especially in the Kimberleys and in northern Western Australia. People would not understand that the donkey issue had become quite a problem up there. The problem was being attacked through shooting from helicopters, mainly by catching a jenny donkey and putting a radio collar on that donkey. As the donkey herds with other donkeys, it gives trackers an opportunity of finding those herds throughout the months. That has been a very successful operation with the local processes funded by the Western Australian government through their board structure and by the pastoralists who pay towards that as well. On the camel problem in areas of Aboriginal settlements, the camels go in, drink out of the toilet bowl and then try to smash the toilet bowl to find the water underneath it-and therefore destroy property and cause a problem. Anybody who has been in that country in Central Australia will understand about the waterholes: some small, very deep waterholes have developed that are maybe one, two or three metres across and probably three or four metres deep. Camels will actually fall into these, trying to get water out of the bottom, and end up dying in there-and therefore destroying that water source for Aboriginal people. The pastoralists gave evidence of the damage the camels were doing to their fencing and mustering operations. MAIN COMMITTEE Camels cause major problems, also going to environmental issues. Great herds of camels are doing damage to some of the natural vegetation in that pretty desperate country, which will take some time to redevelop itself. The committee took much evidence on the issue of dogs, especially those close to Canberra, in the Cooma area. The front page of the report has a photograph of a sheep that has been very badly mauled by dogs. This was to try to make some impact and show that people are very concerned about their stock being hit by dogs. These dogs have interbred with dingoes. They are wild dogs. They could be half alsatian that have bred with dingoes and become wild. Many of these dogs exist. They come out of the national parks-the high country-in packs or alone and destroy wildlife. It is a major problem that needs to be tackled across state borders and with a national approach. There are an estimated 23 million wild pigs in Australia. It is an enormous problem. They are carriers of disease. We could be hit with diseases coming into the north, and pigs could be the vectors of those diseases around Australia. It is a major issue. I know that it is a major concern to the veterinary committees that gave evidence to us. It is an issue that needs focus. We need to be aware of it and tackle it in a better way than we have. We recommend in the report that the private sector become involved in this issue. We have never really had much private sector involvement in making baits and that sort of thing. I understand that people from some of the stations in the northern part and other areas of Queensland put forward the idea of going out in a chopper to shoot some wild horses. They would be butchered and, over a couple of days, their meat would be cut into chunks and laced with 1080. It would then be loaded into choppers, which would fly up and scatter it around the country so that pigs would come along and eat it-and that, of course, would be their demise. It is not a very sophisticated way of doing it. We could probably do it in a much better way in 2005 and beyond. We need to look at that in a new way. To an extent that has already started with the development of a bait which has a corn base-it is reasonably solid; it is a bit like a small salamiand some 1080 paste added to it. That can be released by aerial baiting. That has come about because money could be made from it. If we get private sector involvement in this, there could be an ongoing process, a new focus and some more research. I think that is a very sensible way of doing it. Recommendation 6 talks about interested groups coming together. Recommendation 11 talks about prevention and early detection of pests. There is no doubt that the best way of doing these things is to get focused. We need to ensure that, if we find a pest that has invaded Australia, we put every resource we possibly can into eliminating it first up, because once a pest gets a hold, it is just about impossible to eliminate it totally. Recommendation 13 refers to Australia Post. Australia Post cannot inspect internal post in Australia. It probably needs to. We made a recommendation that we look at that and at whether we need a change of law to allow state and territory governments some inspection powers for quarantine purposes. There is the issue of sleeper pests who may awake. Again, we need a national focus on what we need to do there. In recommendation 17 we recommend that, through the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, the government give some support to the examination and trials which have MAIN COMMITTEE been started at ports with monitoring systems for pests coming into Australia that may attack our forestry industry. We have been very neglectful of that and we need to lift our game. Some very good work has been done through Forestry Tasmania and a very good recommendation has been made in that area. Overall, it is a very good report with a lot of recommendations, which I hope will be taken up by federal and state ministers when they meet. These responsibilities need a collaborative effort. Pests cross state boundaries and we need to make sure that state and federal governments work together to overcome these enormous problems. This is the last time. I will speak in the Main Committee before Christmas. I take this opportunity to wish the clerks and all the attendants a merry Christmas and a happy and healthy new year. Debate (on motion by Mr Neville) adjourned. liament of Pakistan, who are here for a number of weeks having a look at the way we do it in Australia.

Joint Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund Report Debate resumed from 2 November, on motion by Mr Abbott: That the House take note of the report. mentary Joint Standing Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund, entitled Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund-Parliamentary Joint Committee-Report-19th report-Second interim report for the s.206(d) inquiry-Indigenous land use agreements-Government response, particularly as it relates to Indigenous land use agreements. I note the government has accepted, at least in part, some of the committee’s conclusions and recommendations-that is, the principle that agreements provide the most effective way of achieving lasting outcomes is of central importance in the Native Title Act. It is worth pointing out that the Indigenous land use agreements were a result of the amendments to the Native Title Act in 1998. That is important because those amendments came about as a result of initiatives from Indigenous Australians to try to improve in the legislation the way in which they could deal with land where they had rights under the Native Title Act. Prior to the 1998 amendments, there was general consensus that there was a need to improve the agreement-making provisions under the legislation. The original act was inadequate in that regard. As someone who was working for Indigenous organisations at the time of the 1998 amendments, I know that the very strong thrust of their view was that the only way in which they could treat their land appropriately under the Native Title Act was to reach agreements with the ILUA proposals. This provides them with a framework and a capacity to conMAIN COMMITTEE",274,Committees
308,The Deputy Speaker ( Mr Hatton) (11.51 Am),I welcome officials from the par,277,Committees
309,Mr Snowdon (Lingiari) (11.52 Am),"I am pleased to address the report of the parliatract arrangements with users of the land-for all manner of purposes-so that they can gain a substantial benefit, not only for themselves but for their communities. It is interesting to understand that the ILUA proposals have been developed to such an extent that they provide a capacity, particularly in the Northern Territory, the area with which I am most conversant, to deal with land in a way which, hitherto, Indigenous organisations were unable to. I note that in the case of the Northern Territory these agreements have been wide ranging. They have addressed issues in the pastoral areas and have addressed issues to do with community living areas, mining and exploration, and parks and reserves. I will quote if I may from the Central Land Council annual report of 2004-05, in which they refer to Indigenous land use agreements and other agreements. The Central Land Council is a native title representative body under the native title legislation, as is the Northern Land Council for the northern half of the Northern Territory. ‘The CLC, under this legislation, has implemented a clear strategy to secure beneficial outcomes for native title holders through negotiated Indigenous land use agreements and other agreements, including good faith agreements under section 31 of the Native Title Act.’ I think we need to comprehend here that there was a myth. From 1996, when the original native title legislation went through the parliament, to 1998, when the legislation was being debated, there was a view from some in the community-particularly from some in the pastoral industry and the mining sector-that somehow or other the world would end if Indigenous Australians’ rights to land were recognised in the form that was proposed under the native title legislation and that their commercial interests would be undermined. Of course, what we have learnt as a result of goodwill from the Indigenous landowners-in this case, in the Northern Territory the native title holders and applicants-and from people who are fair-minded and of good faith in the pastoral industries and the mining sector in the Northern Territory is that their mutual interests came together under this legislation so that they were able to reach agreements which were beneficial to all parties. Unlike the previous Northern Territory administration, the current Labor government-elected in 2001-has adopted a very proactive stance and approach to dealing with Indigenous people and their land-owning arrangements, both under the native title legislation and under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act. In this context it is beneficial and important that we appreciate what this means. I mentioned earlier the relationship with the pastoral industry. The CLC, as I am advised through its annual report, has executed 24 agreements in respect of exploration and mining, including 12 Indigenous land use agreements, that have been registered with the Native Title Tribunal. A number of these agreements were reached in 2005 and some of them are quite significant. They relate to places right throughout Central Australia. I can refer to some of them already: there was an agreement with Magellan at an area called Lake Lewis for mining and with Otter Gold, Tanami and Exploration NL at Coniston at Napperby. Then there are section 31 agreements with a whole range of mining interests at Supplejack, Napperby and Tennant Creek. These are important because they have demonstrated the capacity for the mining industry to work constructively with Indigenous interests through the native title legislation and, as a result of that legislation, formulate ILUAs to their mutual benefit. We need to contemplate-and it might be worthwhile recognising-that the previous conservative administration in the Northern Territory took the view that they were not prepared to MAIN COMMITTEE accept the existence of native title legislation and opposed at every opportunity attempts by Indigenous people to deal with their native title interests on land, particularly in the pastoral sector. They had no time for Indigenous interests in relation to land which might otherwise be seen as crown land. The current Northern Territory government took the view, after they were elected in 2001, that they would accept the existence of native title and immediately set about a process whereby they could negotiate a set of arrangements and agreements about how they might deal with native title in the Northern Territory. As part of that process, they reached an agreement with the two Northern Territory land councils-the Northern Land Council and the Central Land Council-which operate as native title representative bodies. They set out to register a number of Indigenous land use agreements, which were then published by the Northern Territory government. These are quite extensive. They will guarantee now and into the future access to parks and reserves in the Northern Territory that historically had been Northern Territory land, but now recognising them as having an Aboriginal interest and an underlying title-a native title-and the Indigenous landowners reaching agreement with the Northern Territory government that these lands could be used for the benefit of all Territorians and, indeed, all Australians. This was done without any great sense of drama. It has not been easy. Of course, the negotiations, as you will appreciate, were difficult, but they have reached a successful outcome. They mean that, through the process of negotiating Indigenous land use agreements, very large areas of the Northern Territory, parks and reserves, are now under land use agreements. Not only are there new management plans being developed for these lands-which will involve Indigenous people and give them a direct benefit as a result-but also they provide a management plan which gives Indigenous people the capacity to influence how the land is utilised and how it is managed in an appropriate way jointly with the Northern Territory government. Those sorts of historical arrangements did not exist prior to the election of the current Labor Northern Territory government in 2001. The previous conservative government of the Country Liberal Party took the view that they not only opposed land rights under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act but that they would oppose at every opportunity the prospect of Indigenous Australians having their rights recognised under the native title legislation. Because a different view has been adopted by the current government, we have seen very successful outcomes in negotiating Indigenous land use agreements with the Northern Territory government regarding parks and reserves. There have been a couple of exceptions where difficulties have arisen, but by and large they have reached agreement. A division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 12.03 pm to 12.17 pm is that it was published in 2001. At that point I was a member of the committee and participated in this inquiry. We now know that things have moved on since then and the experience of the native title representative bodies, representing native title applicants and native title holders, has grown. As I said earlier, in the Northern Territory this has meant a very mature approach by both the native title rep bodies and commercial interests, as well as the Northern Territory government, in using ILUAs to the mutual benefit of all parties. MAIN COMMITTEE",277,Committees
310,Mr Snowdon,"Of course the interesting thing about the document we are referring toOne of the interesting things that I think needs to be contemplated is the resourcing of native title representative bodies to carry out the functions under the Native Title Act. There are significant issues that the Commonwealth needs to confront. I note that the minister has indicated a desire to amend the native title legislation in a rather perfunctory way. He has not indicated what those amendments will be. I hope they will include amendments which might adequately address the funding of native title rep bodies so they can properly carry out their functions. When you look at the roles of the native title rep bodies and the statutory authorities which are there to administer native title, relatively speaking, the native title rep bodies are dramatically underfunded. On the other hand, the Native Title Tribunal is more than adequately funded. We noted during the inquiries that were undertaken as far back as 2001 that, because of the lack of resources, many of the rep bodies, when making submissions to the committee, indicated they found it very difficult to carry out their functions in a proper and appropriate manner. In the context of these ILUAs, because they lacked funding at that point, they found it difficult to properly represent the interests of their clients. Clearly, as I said earlier, things have progressed since that time, but it remains the case that there has been a severe underfunding of native title rep bodies and that the issue of funding needs to be addressed. The funding arrangement needs to be rebalanced so that more resources are given to native title rep bodies and fewer resources are given to the tribunal. I am someone who was glad to be part of the Keating cabinet considerations of the Native Title Act. I am pleased to have been someone who was able to be in the parliament and vote for that historic piece of legislation. I am pleased to have been able to assist Indigenous interests in putting proposals to amend the Native Title Act in 1998. AndI am pleased to now be engaged with Indigenous interests across Australia, but particularly in the Northern Territory, around issues to do with native title. But I am most concerned: I do not believe the government has properly and adequately addressed the needs of the native title rep bodies so they can properly carry out their functions. I note that it is important that the government scrutinise the work of these bodies, and that they be properly accountable. But it is also true that we need to be accountable downwards as well as upwards. It is very difficult for these native title rep bodies to carry out their functions if they are not adequately and properly resourced. I say to the government: of all the recommendations they ought to be considering, one of the most important is to properly and adequately fund these organisations. As to the other matters addressed in the report, I make the point that the report was done in 2001. We have moved a long way in terms of experience since then, and it may now be time to have another inquiry-or at least revisit the issues addressed in this inquiry-to see how, contemporaneously, they might be changed. I say to the government: this is a very paltry response to a report of 2001. Why has it taken almost five years?

The member for Lingiari did raise a valid point in his speech, namely, the amount of time it has taken to respond to this report. I think that is regrettable. The government endorses the parliamentary joint committee’s general findings about Indigenous land use agreements, but, as has been indicated, 2001 is quite a considerable time ago and maybe there ought to be a further investigation into the matters looked at by the joint committee at that time. Since their inception, these Indigenous land use agreements have proven to be a popular mechanism for resolving native title issues. As at 21 November this year, there were 224 registered Indigenous land use agreements, with a further 19 agreements going through the registration process. The majority of the recommendations, five of the eight, cover issues that are being reviewed as part of the reforms to the native title system that the Attorney-General mentioned on 7 September. That review may go some distance towards making sure that a full inquiry into these matters by a parliamentary committee is not now necessary. The five of eight issues include a number of things: recommendation 3, respondent funding; technical amendment, recommendation 7; examination of prescribed bodies corporate, recommendation 8; native title representative body reform, recommendation 4; and the claims resolution review, recommendation 6. These are the subject of separate consultation processes, which are currently under way. Although it has been useful to hear the different issues raised, to further debate these issues before the outcome of consultation is known would be premature and may pre-empt the review. I am advised that, in developing the native title reform package, the government will take into account the committee’s report into Indigenous land use agreements along with other committee reports and submissions to the committee’s current inquiry into native title representative bodies. As I said earlier, I am sorry that the government has taken so long to respond to this report. If we are to have a vibrant committee system it is important that responses be timely. Of course, governments have incredible pressure on their resources and their time, and sometimes the bureaucracy can only move so quickly, so it is not always possible, within a time frame, to achieve the results one would like. I do not want to be too critical but I think it is important that we not be in the position of debating our response some years after the event.

I believe that the work done by this joint committee is particularly valuable. The committee’s members work very well together. But, as I was saying a moment ago, it is regrettable that it has taken as long as it has to gain a government response to the report. However, as I also pointed out, a number of the matters which were included in the recommendations being debated have been looked at by the government and are in fact being reviewed as part of the reforms to the native title system that were announced on 7 September this year by the honourable Attorney-General-and I outlined those five matters just a few minutes ago. It really is important for Australia that we get the system of native title right. I was interested in a statement made by the member for Lingiari that the Native Title Tribunal is very well funded but certain other native title bodies are not.

322,Mr Garrett (Kingsford Smith) (12.31 Pm),"I thank the member for Fisher for providSeptember 2001 but that only in the last week of parliament in 2005 are we in a position to consider that government response indicates, I think, some need for the government to be mindful of a much more speedy response to enable us to have an adequate debate about such issues. A number of recommendations were raised in the committee’s report to the parliament. The government’s response indicates that it has taken them seriously and it has taken the report seriously, and I want to acknowledge the fact that the government has done that. Given the government’s responses, it is probably as important to examine briefly, given that I want to provide sufficient opportunity to speak to those who have prepared themselves for the adjournment debate, the context of proposed changes to the overall approach to ownership and control of Aboriginal land in Australia, particularly in the Northern Territory, given the ongoing need for clarity and efficacy and the need for ongoing protection and enhancement of traditional cultural rights in relation to land in terms of all of the likely interactions between commercial entities, individuals, pastoral lease owners, mining companies and so on. To that extent, we are in a period of some significant debate about the reform process, particularly concerning the government’s intention to amend the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 and proposed discussions that relate to the Native Title Act 1993. I note that one of the abiding features of this debate, particularly from our perspective, is the need to discern clearly, firstly, what has legitimacy in terms of improved policy outcomes as to both the administration and the undertaking of the land rights regimes spoken of generally and, secondly, what relates to the political motivations that are inherent in the various reform agendas that are about. I note that the Prime Minister is on the record as saying that the government’s intention is not to seek to wind back or undermine native title and land rights. It is in that context that we have to examine not only the government’s response to this report but also, and more importantly, the overall reform agenda that the government is bringing forward. I will not recite history and in a sense go back to the opposition that the government has had in relation to its reform agenda, even to the extent of the original decisions by the High Court and the subsequent enactment of legislation by the Keating government. But I do note with some concern the reappearance in the media of articles by commentators, including historians and others, seeking in a sense to link the issue of economic independence and the capacity of Indigenous communities to bring themselves out of poverty with a repudiation of the determinations that were made by the High Court which were subsequently reflected in the legislation of the time. It seems to me that, of all the government’s responses-not only to a committee of this kind but more generally to the question of Indigenous aspiration-this is in a sense distinguishing the politics from the necessary policy while we on our side of the fence are saying very clearly that we expect the policy to be wholehearted in its embrace of Indigenous interest and rights. I note very briefly, by way of closing, something of some concern to members of the House, which relates to the employment of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders within the government in terms of the policy commitments that emanate not only from our consideration of land rights legislation but more generally from the situation Aboriginal people find themselves in. Commitments that governments have made to actually do something ‘practical’ mean that, in something as basic as employment within the Public Service, there is an expecMAIN COMMITTEE tation, amongst other things, that you would increase the capacity of Indigenous people to be employed. That is not the case. The Minister for Health and Ageing yesterday made reference in question time to some of the health initiatives. Again, we are falling far short. But I am mindful of the fact that time is of the essence in this last week. I do note that the government has made its response to the second interim report. It has come very late in the day. I will not now discuss in detail some of those substantial responses that it has made; I will let those comments come in debate at a later time. Debate (on motion by Mr Barresi) adjourned. That the Main Committee do now adjourn. Word War II Commemorative Medallions the incredibly worthwhile experiences that I have had this year, with which other members would concur, during the presentation of the World War II Commemorative Medallions commissioned by the Australian government to coincide with the 60th anniversary of the end of the Second World War. The medallions are being distributed this year, I am told, to some 400,000 Australian, Commonwealth and allied World War II veterans, their widows and widowers. Some 252,000 have already received their medallions. In my own electorate of Fisher, on the Sunshine Coast of Queensland-the most desirable part of our country in which to live-we have had some 2,962 eligible recipients. They were all invited by the Department of Veterans’ Affairs to choose whether they wanted to have the medallions posted to them through the mail or to be presented with them personally by a representative of the Australian government. All of these veterans, widows and widowers are today quite elderly senior citizens. They have made a wonderful contribution to Australia. For various reasons, including frailty and illness, some have been unable to attend the presentation ceremonies on public occasions, but those who did attend found the ceremony a wonderful experience. Many people have reported being quite emotional at receiving the medallions, which symbolise our nation’s gratitude to the contributions that they made towards the freedom, stability and way of life that we have as a nation, which has made Australia the envy of people throughout the world. One gentleman who remembers receiving his medals through the mail at the end of the Second World War commented that having the medallion personally presented by an Australian government representative was an event he would not have missed for anything. He was literally beaming with satisfaction to be able to be called out by name at a formal presentation function, to stride out to the front and to then proudly accept his medallion with a group of his family and friends present as witnesses. The 60th anniversary medallion to him represented a type of closure some six decades after the fighting had ceased. There was no shortage of watery eyes amongst those who came forward to accept their medallions. Some others wept considerable tears, especially when considering those who fought beside them who did not come back.

Many young couples at that time made that sort of sacrifice. I think that in 2005 we find it hard to understand how people could essentially be married and immediately separated for years on end from their life partner. The commemorative medallion, referring to this lady who married as a teenager, was accepted proudly by her on behalf of her late husband. These medallions could be described as somewhat like large gold-coloured coins. The obverse design shows the Commonwealth coat of arms with the words inscribed ‘World War II service to Australia’. The reverse design shows a contemporary map of Australia. Three sets of lines across the map symbolise service in the Army, represented by horizontal straight lines across our continent; Navy, wavy lines below the horizontal lines to indicate the waves of the sea; and Air Force, lines that curve upwards to mirror the flight paths of the warplanes that took to the skies in defence of our country. That reverse design also features the imprint ‘1945 to 2005’ to indicate that 60 years have passed since the end of this international conflict. A division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 12.41 pm to 12.49 pm main chamber, the medallions were accompanied by a card certificate signed by the Prime Minister, the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs and me as the local member. We have had a range of ceremonies and they are continuing to be held. At the ceremonies there is a tremendous feeling of warmth and sense of appreciation that we as a nation owe to those who risked so much during the Second World War. All the veterans, widows and widowers who made these incredible personal sacrifices deserve to be recognised for what they have done for our country. An interesting thing is that they made their contribution not expecting anything in return. The commemorative medallion is a relatively small memento of the substantial gratitude the Australian government feels towards the recipients. They have received their commemorative medallions as a thankyou gesture from the government. To those who fought for Australia to make our country what it is today, I want to say as the federal member for Fisher that I personally honour you, I personally appreciate your contribution and I must say that your contribution has made Australia a much better place in which to live. Dental Care need for a Commonwealth funded dental health scheme. I have done this on a number of previous occasions. The need for such a scheme is undeniable. There is now evidence that it must be supplemented by an increase in the number of training places for dentists available in our universities. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare is expecting waiting times for dental care to keep growing as the demand for dentists increases. Even though a 10 per cent increase in the number of practising dentists in South Australia is expected by 2015, visit lengths are increasing, so demand is expected to increase by almost 20 per cent by the year 2015. Demand by those eligible for public, state funded dental care is likely to increase by about 30 per cent over the next 10 years, while demand by those not eligible will increase by only about 14 per cent. It is estimated that South Australia would need another 190 dentists over the next 10 years to keep up with demand. MAIN COMMITTEE",284,Adjournment

326,Mr Georganas (Hindmarsh) (12.50 Pm),"TodayI rise to speak on the issue of theAt the University of Adelaide, student numbers for dentistry have increased. That is clearly welcome news. But there are now problems with adequate resourcing for these students. There is a need for more teaching staff and more equipment. Adding to the demand is the fact that the progress made in children’s oral health during the early 1990s is now being reversed. In coming years, these children will need more ongoing dental care than the generation who were going through school in the last decade. Since the late 1990s, dental decay in both primary and secondary school children has been increasing in South Australia. As always, it is those on low incomes who are doing it toughest. People on pensions are more likely than the rest of the population to have decay; they are twice as likely to have lost teeth through decay; and 44 per cent of concession card holders aged between 45 and 64 avoid or put off going to the dentist because of the cost. This federal government says that dental care is not its responsibility and that it is up to the states. That is what we hear. Once again, I refer to the Australian Constitution, which clearly states in section 51: The Parliament shall, subject to this Constitution, have power to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth with respect toamongst other thingsdental services ... The Australian Constitution explicitly states that dental care is a federal government responsibility. Yet on 23 June this year this government’s Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Ageing said on Adelaide Radio 5AA, on the Leon Byner program: ... section 51 makes absolutely no mention of dental services at all. So hehe was referring to me; I had been on earlier that daycompletely misled your listeners into believing the Commonwealth had constitutional responsibility for dental services. We simply do not. They were the words of the parliamentary secretary for health. I have the section here. I ask the parliamentary secretary to come and take a look at it. I have even circled the area where it says that it is absolutely the federal government’s responsibility-that dental services are the federal government’s responsibility. I suggest that someone other than me was misleading the South Australian public on that day. We had a Commonwealth Dental Health Program in 1996. In 1996, under this Howard government, that program was ended. The Australian Dental Association says that the program significantly reduced waiting lists. Today there are around 650,000 people in Australia waiting for public dental care. In some areas the waiting times are longer than three years. In South Australia, thanks to increased funding by the state government, that figure has been reduced to around two years. That is still clearly far too long. Throughout Australia, the number of people on the waiting lists has increased by 42 per cent since the Commonwealth Dental Health Program was stopped. I feel like a broken record, but this government just is not listening. There is a clear connection between gum disease and coronary disease. Cardiovascular disease is Australia’s leading cause of death. Ignoring the dental care needs of Australians is a life and death matter. The community is sick of the federal government trying to pass the buck on to the states. MAIN COMMITTEE The situation is already bad enough, but with demand for dentists increasing it is only going to get worse. We need more dentists and therefore more training places for dentists and we need a national dental health program as a matter of urgency. The government has a history of misleading the public as to its responsibility for dental care by stating the opposite of the truth, as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Ageing did on that day on 5AA. Clearly not one person in this country can ever expect this Liberal government to provide dental services. Not one person in this country can vote for the Liberal government and even hope for federal dental services. Not one person in my electorate of Hindmarsh can look to any Liberal party member or candidate and think that that person will ever support in this place federal dental services. There is only going to be one candidate running for Hindmarsh in 2007 that has any intention whatsoever of providing federal dental services, and it will not be the Liberal candidate. I am committed to a federal dental scheme. (Time expired) Victory in the Pacific Medallions ceremonies we have been conducting in the Gilmore electorate have proved a tremendous success. To see the joy on the faces of people receiving the medallions is something in itself. During my ceremonies, each and every recipient tells a little story about their history. Most are positive, a few were sad and some were exceptional, but each and every story was unique and it was truly moving to hear some of them. I must admit that on more than one occasion tears welled in my eyes. Whilst it is such a simple gesture, it meant everything to those elderly Australians who were there on the day. The most moving were the stories of a handful of exPOWs. It is not until you hear them in their own words that you begin to feel the passion of their suffering. Only then do you come to realise just a fraction of what it must have been like to endure the pain and suffering and to finally survive. One of the stories came from Barry Williams, a member of the Huskisson RSL sub-branch. He gave me a little handmade booklet, simple in its presentation, which recounted the horrors of the war from one of our ex-POWs, Roydon Charles Cornford. Roydon is 83 years old and lives in Vincentia on the shores of Jervis Bay. It was a courageous thing of him to write the book and I hope in doing so he let go of some of the demons that possessed him. Mr Cornford starts his story at Tamarkan on the banks of the infamous River Kwai, where he was a prisoner. He describes his journey, first to Indochina, now called south Vietnam, a battleground for Australians 25 years later, where he was imprisoned in Saigon. His journey took him to another familiar place, Cap St Jacques near Vung Tau in Phuoc Tuy province, where Aussie soldiers served for almost 10 years in the Vietnam conflict. He embarked to Cambodia suffering deprivation along with his mates. From there it was down through Malaysia to an island off Singapore. The thread of his tale was the last leg of his trip, which would have taken him to Japan. He and 2,217 other POWs were loaded on two Japanese troop ships, the Rakuyo Maru and the Kachiboki Maru. He tells of how the prisoners were loaded, along with a cargo of rubber and the Japanese comfort girls, all overseen by cruel Korean guards who were armed with sharpened bamboo sticks. They were held on board before sailing two days later as part of a large convoy consisting of oil tankers, armed escorts and other cargo ships. Six days after sailing, the air cover was discontinued and that night 500 of the POWs on his ship were sleeping on deck.

Immediately all hell broke loose as an oil tanker exploded in a brilliant ball of flame, lighting up the surrounding ocean. The light revealed the water littered with Japanese crew from the destroyer and oil tanker. The Japanese escorts zipped everywhere, dropping depth charges as yet another ship was hit. It was at that moment that two torpedoes hit his ship causing panic and flooding the hold that contained the POWs. As the ship stabilised, the panic subsided and arrangements were made to abandon ship. Naturally, the Japanese and Koreans commandeered the lifeboats, leaving whatever flotsam there was, including the rubber, for the rest. He then goes on to describe the events that followed with survivors clinging to anything they could find as yet another escort ship exploded. The next morning two Japanese ships came back and picked up the Japanese survivors, leaving the boats for the POWs who were in the water-350 POWs spread between 11 boats, the rest tying their two rafts together, the only thing they could cling to because everything else had turned oily. Those in the boats drifted off and Mr Cornford later learned that the Japanese returned and machine-gunned them. After the third night they heard the sound of engines, but they could not see any aircraft and suddenly they realised it was a submarine that had surfaced near them and had started taking the survivors. Mr Cornford said: I can remember lifting my hands up, pleading with the sailors not to grab my arms because they were just blisters and sores. They got us on deck and surprisingly, we could walk. Our submarine, the US Pampanito, which rescued us was one of the four American submarine that attacked the convoy. Of the 2,218 POWs that set sail from Cap St Jacques, less than a handful were rescued and the balance of the survivors were lost in a typhoon that had come up. Mr Cornford ends his story with the words ‘God bless America’, adding that the submarine US Pampanito is on display at Pier 45 in San Francisco. My words cannot give justice to his story, for I am constrained by time, but I urge all members to take time to listen to the stories of these people because, unless they are recorded, they will be lost to time. I was moved by many of these stories, brief as they were. They are the crown jewels of our proud heritage and we must make every effort to preserve them for later generations. Child Care age of child care in my electorate, particularly in the city of Port Phillip, which takes in Port Melbourne, South Melbourne, Albert Park, St Kilda and Elwood. After many years of decline these suburbs are now experiencing rapid growth. Families with young children are moving back into the inner suburbs. Many of these families are servicing mortgages in an area where the cost of land and housing is very high. In most families both parents are working. Many of them are paying high fees to give their children the education of their choice. In these areas there is a great demand for child care. I know it is true in similar inner urban areas across Australia. The government like to tell us how much they are spending on child care. The figure of $8.5 billion is quoted. But the people of Port Phillip are wondering where the money is going, because they certainly are not seeing the benefit of it.
