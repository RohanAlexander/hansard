Fanning, of Sydney, for the consent of the Commonwealth Government to intro-* duce Â£2,000,000 of German capital into Australia for the purpose of developing the coal-fields and erecting a coke by-product treatment plant. The prospective German investors asked for a guarantee of protection against possible measures of confiscation and liquidation under the Treaty of Versailles. The right honourable gentleman informed me that the request had been submitted to the Development and Migration Commission for investigation and report. Has he yet received that report? If not, in view of the large amount of distress in the coal-mining districts in consequence of unemployment, will he request the commission to act expeditiously'? the Development and Migration Commission on this matter, and it is now being considered by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. I hope that some conclusion will be reached at an early date, when I shall promptly inform the honourable member of the Government's decision. of Hansard containing the report of the proceedings in Parliament on the 29th March, a short speech I made on the Parliamentary Allowances Bill was incorrectly reported. This, I admit, is unusual. But at the end of a session or when Parliament adjourns for a few weeks and members disperse to go to their tunity to peruse the proofs of their speeches. When I reached my home in TasmaniaI received a proof of my remarks, but the corrections I made on it did not get back to Canberra before the proof number containing the debate in which the speech occurred had been issued. The report had been amended to some extent, but not sufficiently to present my views accurately. I ask you, Mr Speaker, to take steps to ensure that in an adequate opportunity to correct the proofs of their speeches before the 'Hansard number is issued. is always eager to meet the wishes of honourable members, so as to ensure an accurate and satisfactory report of their speeches. When, however, members disperse to go to their respective States the return of revised proofs is often considerably delayed, but I am sure that the Principal Parliamentary Reporter does all that is practicable to meet the convenience of honourable members in these circumstances. I remind the honourable member for Bass that the weekly number of Hansard is only a proof issue, and the, inaccuracy of which he complained has been already corrected for the permanent volume.

I realize, however, that in view of the general interest in this important matter, it may be advisable for me, when I have had an opportunity to read the ful l text of the judgment, to make, by leave of the House, a statement of the law, as I understand it, as expounded in that judgment. Mr ""WEST I have, on the business paper, a notice of motion respecting the deprivation of residents of the Eederal Capital Territory of the right to trial by jury in certain cases. I wish to know when I am to be given an opportunity to move that motion, or whether the Government has decided that the residents of the Territory shall not have the right of trial by jury, which is enjoyed by the residents of all other parts of Australia? me, as Attorney-General, to answer questions respecting the order in which the business of the House will be taken. Minister explain why the Government has decided to approach the Arbitration Court respecting the working of certain machines in the munitions factory at Maribyrnong? If such action is taken, will the union concerned in the case be called upon to defray its own expenses? months ago, a difficulty arose in the Maribyrnong factory. That factory is designed for the mass production of munitions, and the difliculty arose because it was claimed that for the work of the repeating machines only engineers should be employed. To have adopted that course would have made the cost of running the factory prohibitive, and accordingly, after some discussion, it was arranged that the matter should be determined by the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. I am not in touch with any action that may have been taken since, but I shall have inquiries made to ascertain the present position. Prime Minister whether a communication has been received from the Government of the United States of America, regarding the proposed peace pact, and if so what course of action is proposed by the Commonwealth Government, and whether any intended action will be taken in conjunction with the British Government or otherwise ? the proposal to outlaw war had its origin in April of last year when M . Briand made certain suggestions to the United States of America. The matter then lapsed, but in December last the Secretary of State for the United States of America took up the French suggestion; hut whereas the French proposals were for a treaty between France aud the United States of America, the American proposals were for a general treaty among the greater Powers. These proposals have now been submitted to the various Governments concerned, and were transmitted by the British Government to the Commonwealth Government. We are being kept fully informed of all the developments that are taking place, and the whole question as to what action should be taken in regard to the FrancoAmerican proposals is now receiving the consideration of the various governments concerned. ter for Trade and Customsi f, in view of the report of the New South Wales Police Department, that the cocaine habit is increasing at an alarming rate, and that this ding is coming into the Commonwealth in large quantities from eastern countries, he will consider if more effective control cannot be exercised, possibly by a closer co-operation with the police departments of the States?",15,Performing Rights

25,Mr Theodore,"I ask the Minisissued some particulars to the press concerning the regulations in force governing the importation of cocaine, which is prohibited except for medicinal purposes, every penny-weight imported being under the control of the Customs Department. The whole quantity imported for medicinal purposes is policed and watched. No doubt there is some illicit traffic in this drug, owing to the ability of people to carry it concealed about their persons. It is desirable that this should be checked as far as possible, and recently I have been looking into the penalties imposed upon those found guilty of illicitly importing the drug, and I have decided that they shall be made the same as those imposed for the illicit importation of opium, in which case imprisonment is the penalty. I shall take into consideration the possibility of closer co-operation with the police authorities in the various States. New South ""Wales has recently passed an act to control the traffic more effectively, and I am hopeful that the other States will follow the good example which that State has set. Minister whether the committee appointed by the Government in conjunction with the British-Australasian Tobacco Company to investigate the tobacco growing industry in Australia will present an interim report, and, if so, whether that report will be made available to Parliament ? as to the exact position of the committee's investigation, but I shall ascertain it, and let the honourable member know the result.

The money for the necessary works is provided by the Commonwealth and the States concerned, in equal proportions. At a meeting of the Loan. Council held in December of last year, it was agreed by the representatives of the governments attending that there should be a certain definite curtailment of the loan programme. After discussion it was definitely understood that there should be a curtailment of Â£172,000 in the amount to be expended on the Murray waters scheme this year. Provision had been made for the expenditure of Â£1,172,000, but now Â£1,000,000 will be spent. All the governments concerned were in agreement as to the wisdom of the action proposed. meeting of Parliament, and during the absence of the Minister for Trade and Customs in New Zealand, I asked whether it was a fact that 500 petrol pumps were being imported into Australia, and if so, whether action would be taken to have an inquiry made into the petrol pump manufacturing industry in Australia. I should like to know whether the information then sought is available? that the information was sought by the honourable member in the form of a question.

FILM . CENSORSHIP. 1928, the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr. Maloney) asked the following questions:1. What censor or censors passed the "" Callahan and Murphy"" film ? 2. Were some of the alleged "" cuts"" exhibited without permission? 3. Has any action been taken against the exhibitors ? 4. What censor passed the film ""What Price Glory?"" 1 am now able to furnish the honourable member with the following information :1. The film censor, Sydney, passed the film after extensive cuts. Portion of the film was referred to the Chief Censor. 2 and 3. The exhibitors did not commit any wilful act contrary to the censorship. Owing to some misunderstanding, the "" cuts"" intended by the Chief Censor were not fully given effect to. The office was overburdened with work at the time, and steps have since been taken to make the staff more adequate to the important requirements of tbe censorship. 4. The then Chief Censor, Professor Wallace. 1928, the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Forde) asked the following questions:1. What was the total weight of last year's cotton crop in Queensland? 2. To whom was it sold, and at what price? 3. What quantity was used? 4. What quantity is still held by manufacturers ? 5. Is this due to the ineffective tariff on cotton piece goods from other countries? 6. What was the value of importations of cotton piece goods from (a) England, (6) Japan, and (o) other countries, for 1925, 1926, arid 1927? 7. What action is being taken by the Minister to increase the duty on imported piece goods in order to safeguard the Australian manufacturer ? 8. Is it a fact that unless something is done immediately the Queensland cotton industry will be threatened with extinction? I am now able to furnish the honourable member with the following information :1. 7,0G9,312 lb. of seed cotton. 2. The lint produced from this seed cotton, viz., 4,824 bales (each about 485 lb.), was sold to various Australian manufacturers. The average selling price was ll.Od. per lb. 3. Approximately 1,424 bales. 4. Approximately 3,400 bales. 5.

Substantial duties are already imposed on the classes of cotton piece goods commercially made in Australia. 8. The industry has been liberally treated by the Government and Parliament, and yet many pessimistic utterances are made by interested parties regarding its position now. It should be mentioned that owing to floods and pests in the United States of America the price of cotton abroad is high in the world's market. It is the desire of the Government, and I am sure of Parliament, that the industry should prosper, and the position is receiving consideration. 22nd March, 1928, the honourable member for Herbert (Dr. Nott) asked the Minister for Health the following questions:1. Whether he will intimate the total sum of On the 28th March, money that has been allocated by the Government for scientific research in medical subjects, apart from money devoted to the purchase of radium? 2. Whetheri t is the intention of the Government to allocate further sums of money for research in medical subjects? 3. Whether the money already allocated has been divided into definite amounts over fixed periods of time for the investigation of specific subjects ? 4. Whether he will state what subjects are now being or are to be investigated, and at whose instigation? 5. Whether the research investigations are to be confined to the activities of Australian research students?",18,League Of Nations Appointment Of Woman Delegate

In most of these cases it is not possible to say from whom originated the suggestion that the research should be carried out. 5. It is not proposed to subsidize research work outside Australia; a small annual grant of Â£400 is, however, made to the Tropical Diseases Bureau. C. No. A small committee was, however, invited in 1926 to discuss certain questions relating to medical research; no action resulted. A cancel advisory committee is in existence 1 which deals with such questions of research in relation to cancer as are referred to it. 7. See Ko. 6. 8. See No. 6. 9. The Commonwealth Serum Laboratories carry out scientific research as well as the production of biological remedies for sale. 10. By reason of changes of administration it is impossible to state an exact amount, but probably the total sum of Â£100,000 expended during the years 1909-1928 is a reasonably accurate estimate. March, 1928, the honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr Manning) asked me the following questions:1. Will he see that steps are taken to prevent citrus fruit, the importation of which is prohibited under Quarantine Proclamation No. 174, being brought into Australia by passengers ? 2. What quantity of citrus fruit has been imported into Australia since the 1st Julv, 1927? 3. In view of the seriousness of the danger of the possible introduction of ""White Fly,"" will the Minister consider the advisability of totally prohibiting the importation of citrus fruits i. I am now in a position to furnish the following answers:1. A strict watch is kept, and tlie utmost care is taken by officers 'of the Department of Health and of the Department of Trade and Customs at ports of.debarkation to-prevent the illegal importation of citrus fruits by passengers. 2. The total quantity of citrus fruits imported into Australia * from 1st July, 1927, to the end of February, 1928, was as follows:Lemons .. .. 38,505 centals. Oranges 5,059 centals. J. In drafting the quarantine proclamation relating to the importation of citrus fruits, the question of preventing the introduction of "" WhiteF l y "" was borne in mind, and it is considered that the restrictions at present in force will adequately protect the Commonwealth. March, the honourable member for H in d marsh ( Mr Makin) referred to the case of ex-StokerH . M . Jensen, who was discharged invalided from the Royal Australian Navy. I have had inquiries made in this case, and desire to inform the honourable member that ex-Stoker Jensen was invalided from the Service on account of his suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis. The responsible naval medical authorities have decided that the disease in this case is not attributable to naval services, and as compensation is payable only where disease is so attributable exStoker Jensen's claim for compensation cannot be approved. In regard to the question of granting* a compassionate allowance, as suggested by the honourable member, I find that, although sympathy is felt with Jenseni n his unfortunate condition, grounds do not exist that would justify the payment of a compassionate allowance, and if any exception to the usual practice were made in this case, a very undesirable precedent would be formed. I may state, for the honourable member's information, that ex-stoker Jensen w ill receive Â£297 19s. 8d. payment in lieu of extended leave and deferred pay.

55,Mr Pratten (Martin,"Minister forAs honourable members a're aware, the censorship is administered by the Department of Trade and Customs, by reason of the powers contained in the Customs Act relating to the importation and exportation of commodities generally, included in which, of course, are picture films. In view of this position, it will be recognized that the Commonwealth's powers are subject to rigid constitutional limitations. certain powers are exercised, or are exer-* ciseable independently in the State arena; but no power inheres at present in the Commonwealth, except that arising out of its control of importation and exportation. For many years there has been a growing feeling in the Commonwealth synchronizing with the growth of the industry, that a uniformly organized and complete film control is an important social and moral necessity. velopment of the moving picture industry, particularly in the last decade, has been phenomenal. This is indicated by the fact that there are in Australia 1,250 picture theatres, employing over 20,000 persons, in which the amount of capital invested approximates Â£25,000,000, and the annual attendance at the picture shows is estimated to exceed 100,000,000 persons. Picture shows can now be said to provide the principal recreation and reof the restricted powers with which we laxation of the people, and altliough cenwere armed. I think that honourable sorship control has been rigidly exercised by the Commonwealth Government within its powers, these have been found lacking with regard to some very important aspects of the industry. There has also been practically a unanimous desire among honourable members and the public that reasonable and complete control of films should be exercised by the Commonwealth, and, from time to time, questions have been asked in this House as to the measure of such control. As far back as August, 1924, there was a complaint that our own pictures-the ""Know Your Own Country"" serieswere banned by picture exhibitors or corporations. I promised the House at the time to do what I could, and though I had no legal power to compel exhibitors to follow any course of action, I was glad to be of service in influencing, soon after the question arose, the exhibition of world consumption, and. the Australian these pictures throughout Australia through the ordinary trade channels. Many honourable members have from time to time asked questions as to tbe basis and standards of censorship. On this matter I made a full explanation to the House in September, 1924. The basis and standards then set out, within the limits of the constitutional power of the Commonwealth, have remained the same ever since and have, I hazard the opinion, gained the approval of the reBeyond those limitations, cent royal commission. From time to time. I have issued instructions designed to sustain, and, if possible, improve those standards. It has been j>ointed out in this House by many honourable members, and I myself have drawn attention to the fact, that owing to the restricted constitutional powers of the Commonwealth, advertisements and other matter printed in AusThe detralia cannot be censored, because the Federal legislature has not legal power to exercise such control over them. By conference with the importers, however, we have, somewhat materially, perhaps, improved the position. ""When a threat was made to judge the pictures by the advertisements, and advertising matter relating to them, an improvement occurred in the general position; but only moral effort could be made in that direction, because members know that considerable attention has been given to the administration of this difficult branch of the Customs Department. When I took office, the position was not satisfactory. Practically my first administrative act was to establish an efficient censorship, and the standards then prescribed have been adhered to ever since. In pursuance of a policy of publicity I inaugurated the practice of having annual reports by the censorship submitted to this House. These reports have attracted world-wide attention on the part of persons connected with the industry. Although the importers here have now practically accepted the standards laid clown, there still remains much to be done. No real improvement in the standard of the pictures sent to us by producers is as yet apparent, possibly because the films are made for market is not an important factor from the production point of view, although in the financial aggregate it is a market of considerable extent. From time to time many honourable members who have shown a keen interest in this subject have made suggestions for the improvement of the control over the industry in the Commonwealth, and they have drawn attention to the restricted powers under which the present censorship is exercised, but, until the whole position was exhaustively dealt with, the Government could not do much more than exercise a rigorous censorship over imported and exported films and imported advertising matter. Much attention has also been given by the Government to the question of the encouragement of British films. It is pleasing to see that, as compared with the position three years ago, Great Britain administration, under the guidance of the now realizes to a greater extent the importance of the industry. This recognition has perhaps been helped a little by the tariff alterations made by this House in favour of British films, and by the oft-expressed sentiment of the Government and the Parliament in their favour. Undoubtedly the position here with regard to British films to-day, as compared with three years ago, has materially changed for the better. will be seen from the latest censorship report, the importation of American films has diminished from 88.2 per cent, in 1925 to 78.1 per cent, in 1927, while the importation of British films in the Commonwealth has increased from 8.2 per cent, to 12.6 per cent, over the same period. Last year the Government considered that the time was fully ripe for the creation of some body that would be able to conduct an investigation into the whole subject. There were many angles from which it was considered that it should be thoroughly examined, among them being the co-operation of Federal and State authorities, the harmonizing of the present diversified methods, regulations, and powers of the States, the alleged combines, taxation, profits, local production and other matters apart from the censorship. A general desire has been expressed on the part of the women of the Commonwealth that one of their sex should have a part in the censorship, as the matter Mr Pratten. comes very closely home to family and child life. There was also the unsatisfactory position that a mixed Commonwealth and State control was neither one thing nor the other, being incomplete in both arenas. Consequently a Select Committee was appointed by this Parliament to investigate the whole subject. It commenced its inquiries in April of last year, and it was subsequently created a royal commission, armed with the necessary powers to thoroughly investigate all matters relative to the industry. The report, as far as I have considered it, practically endorses the present standards of the Commonwealth censorship, and I hazard the opinion that the royal commission has found that the control and Chief Censor, Professor Wallace, left little to be desired, due regard being paid to the limits of Federal authority. Other important subjects had to have the i l lumination of publicity, and the concentrated attention of the members of the commission, and I venture the opinion that the report of the commission will arouse very great interest not only in Australia, but also throughout the film world. The claim may be made that it should be As regarded as a most important document in regard to this world-wide industry. In placing the report before the HouseI again draw attention to the fact that as the members of the commission were unanimous in their recommendations the matter can in no sense be regarded as a party one. The Government desires the co-operation of the Parliament as a whole. With that co-operation it confidently hopes to achieve, in due course, a result that will serve as an example of what a progressive young democracy can do for the well-being of its citizens, and one that will enable the Commonwealth to continue in the forefront of progress in its handling of a world-wide problem. The Government has carefully examined the report and recommendations of the commission, and, on its behalf, I desire to inform the House of the policy that it proposes to adopt in connection with the recommendations submitted. The report of the commission contains many suggestions to which, it is considered, effect should be given. In particular, the recommendation that there should be uniformit y throughout the Commonwealth in regard to the laws dealing w i th the motion picture industry is cordially endorsed by the Government. This suggestion, it is considered, forms the essential basis of the effective control of the industry, and is the real key to the complete solution of our present difficulties. On many other points, too, the comtion conferring increased legislative mission has made suggestions which may powers upon this Parliament with rebe successfully worked out later. As I ference to the regulation of the film have already mentioned, the fundamental industry in all its aspects would be, from fact at present is that the Commonthe legal and constitutional point of view, wealth's powers of control over the in a more satisfactory procedure than an dustry are limited to importation and endeavour to act under section 51, paraexportation.

On that point I have to say that has, therefore, been adopted by the the existing arrangements, owing to the GovernmentThajt. . . the Commonwealth Governadequate and consequently somewhat unment request the States to meet them in conference for the purpose of arriving at an satisfactory. The leakages referred to by agreement whereby the States would enact the royal commission were entirely due legislation under section 51 (xxxvii) of the to the shortage of staff. When I reviewed Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act, and would * give the Commonwealth power to the position some time ago I found that it control the motion picture industry as indicalled for immediate action, and addicated in this report. Section 51, paragraph xxxvii, provides that the Parliament of the Commonwealth may make laws with respect to "" matters referred to the Parliament of the Commonwealth by the Parliament or Parliaments of any State or States, but so that the law shall extend only to . States by whose Parliament the matter is referred, or which afterwards adopt the law."" The precise meaning and effect of section 51, paragraph xxxvii, of the Constitution has long been a matter of controversy, and opinions have differed as to whether a reference made by a State statute in pursuance of this power is revocable or not. There is no doubt that a direct amendment of the Constituthe advantage, in a matter of this character, of involving a direct consultation of It is proposed by the way the views of the States can be ascerof such larger cided upon by all the parties concerned. Honourable members have in their hands agreement with the the report of the commission. If they W it h the indulgence of the House, I propose to deal seriatim with those recommendations, and to anUniformity of nounce the policy of the Governmeut Recommendagrowth of the work and the responsibility, were found some time ago to be in tional responsible help for the Sydney censor was secured. A suitable person not being available in the Customs Department, I secured the services of Colonel Hurley, on loan from another Governmental activity, unti l more permanent arrangements could be made. Honourable members, I am sure, w ill realize, as I do, that it is difficult to obtain, for the purposes of a reliable censorship, a person of the necessary judgment and breadth of view, coupled with tact, education, and a' knowledge of the World. I am informed that the new arrangement in Sydney, which is controlled by Mr made by the commission, thereby giving W, C. O'Reilly With the assistance of Colonel Hurley, is working, most satisfactorily to all the parties concerned, and the complaints of delays and overwork which were made formerly have ceased. A further strengthening of the censorship is suggested by the royal conxmission. The Government favours ihe commission's recommendation of a censorship of three persons, one of these to be a woman. There is, and has beeii, practically a unanimous desire amongst all the women's organizations throughout the Commonwealth that one of their sex should be associated with the censorship. Picture films, being so popular, affect to a great extent, the character of their children, the well-being of their families, and that social and moral atmosphere that is so very dear to the hearts'of the women of the Commonwealth. The claim which is almost universally made by the women of Australia, that they should have a share in the responsibilitiy for, and in the creation and administration of the standards of censorship, js recognized and agreed to by both the commission and the Government. The censorship in Sydney therefore, will be added to at an early date Government that for the time being the by the appointment of an additional censor from among suitable, capable and experienced women applicants, thus of three persons recommended and decided upon. As to how, and on what conditions, this representative of the women of Australia shall be appointed, has not yet been decided; but I shall endeavour to co-operate with the Public Service Board in this matter and see that without fear or favour a suitable appointment is made. Recommendation 5 is to the effect that Chief Censor now located in Melbourne, the Censorship Board shall have added but with the developments hoped for repowers; but, obviously, this question must garding film production in Australia and await common action by the States of uniform control throughout the Comthe Commonwealth. Recommendatiou 6 is that more comthe board of appeal will be important modious premises should be provided in and far-reaching. Sydney. Mr Pratten. necessary for some time past. Action will be taken by the Government to provide on the forthcoming Estimates the additional amounts necessary for the purpose of carrying out the suggestions greater facilities for efficient and effective administration. As a corollary of the foregoing action, the Government proposes to close the Melbourne office of the censorship. Professor Osborne is at present acting as locum tenens for Professor Wallace, who was granted leave of absence, and has resigned. Professor Osborne has given a good deal of valuable service even during the last two or three months. In view of the fact that 98 per cent, of the films which are imported into Australia are landed in Sydney, the Government considers that if is desirable to concentrate there the whole of the activities of the censorship. This proposal will effect some savings, which will to an extent offset the additional expenditure on larger premises in Sydney. It will also result in much greater convenience to the trade. With recommendations 7, 8, and 9, which relate to the creation of a Censorship Board of Appeal, the Government agrees, and it will in due course appoint such a board, the members of which will be remunerated by fees, and not by way of salary. It is considered by the board should consist of three persons, and not five as suggested by the commission, as the latter number may at present prove completing the censorship unwieldy and unnecessary. The Government will also in this case provide that one of the members of the board shall be a woman. The establishment of the board will be proceeded with by regulation pending the settlement of the larger question of joint Commonwealth and State control. It is obvious that the duties of this board of appeal will 'supersede for the present the functions of the monwealth, the duties of the members of Subject to the This has been considered very approval of the Senate of the University of Sydney, of whicli he is now vicechancellor, the Government proposes inviting Professor Wallace, whose term as Chief Censor in Melbourne covered a period of nearly five years, to accept the appointment of chairman of this board. The Government greatly appreciates the services Professor Wallace has rendered to the community in the creation of suitable and satisfactory standards of censorship. His experience of this subject, which is almost unique, and his excellent service in this difficult branch of administration, together with his high educational standing and independence of political considerations, especially fit him in the opinion of the Government to fill this important position. The period of appointment which the Government proposes is up to three years for each member of the board of appeal. The Government also agrees with the commission's conclusion that there should be no trade representation on the censorship or on the board to be set up in connection therewith. Eecommendation 10 deals with the powers of the proposed Censorship Appeal Board. It is clear that for a while the board would deal principally with appeals from the censorship, and with the development of recommendations 20, 21, and 22 regarding awards of merit. The other suggested functions must, of course, await concerted action by the Commonwealth and States. With regard to the marking of films as suggested in recommendation 11, under an amendment of the Commerce Act which the Government proposes to introduce in connection with other matters, the marking of films imported may be required. imported into the Commonwealth are now marked with the name of the country of origin. The Government is sympathetic with this recommendation, but if it should determine to insist upon the country of origin being exhibited compulsorily, it would require wider powers from the States. The suggestion contained in recommendation 12 regarding control over importers, cannot be legally adopted without additional powers. The Government agrees with the view that some stringent power should be given over those few traders who have in the past bought or imported films without regard to the standards of censorship set up. They arevery few so far as I know. It is proposed to carry into effect the suggestion made as far as the present limited powers of the Commonwealth permit. Recommendations 13, 14 and 15, relating to the distribution of films, and recommendations 16, 17, 18 and 19, dealing with exhibitors and the exhibition of films, must necessarily await the result of the contemplated conference with the personal States. The Government agrees, in principle, with recommendations 20, 21 and 22 regarding film production in Australia, and careful consideration will be 'given to the best means of giving effect to them, as well as to any other similar method by which film production in Australia may be stimulated. I have already given figures showing the large percentage of films imported into this country, and there is no possible doubt that by means of the film, there is an infiltration of ideas that tend to break down rather than build up that distinctive national sentiment which it should be the object of all well-wishers of this young nation to cultivate. Australia, bountifully and beautifully endowed by nature in so many ways, is undoubtedly one of the finest countries in the world for out-ofdoor picture production. With the right direction and leading, which it is the aim of this Government to give, it should b<j possible to foster an industry essentially Australian in sentiment, outlook and character, and one which will further Some of the film? cultivate our national sentiment and ideals, and make Australians a factor of still greater importance in the progress of the British race. Recommendations 23 to 32 deal with the quota system. This has formed the subject of legislation in Britain, and also in the State of Victoria. The Government accepts the recommendation in principle, but the detailed developments of any definite scheme must await the acquisition of wider powers by the Commonwealth. Recommendation 33, regarding "" the film and native races,"" the Government will take up at once, and do whatever if. is possible for it to do within its existing powers pending the co-operation of the States. Communications will be sent to the States with regard to what the Government considers is an important matter, and the views of the Government will be communicated to the administrators of the various territories of the Commonwealth. lieves that this recommendation is important, and is whole heartedly in agreement with the commission, but it may be some time before its effect is discernible owing to the number of films still available for exhibition which have passed the censorship without classification as to their suitability for exhibition to audirecommendation 37 on the subject of ences of natives. This difficulty may to some extent be overcome, but the complete control of this matter can only be effectively exercised"" at the source, that is in the various States which are willing to when films are reviewed by the censor. Inquiries will be made as to what can bn done to carry out some form of immediate control, even if only partial. Recommendations 34, 35 and 36, refer to children in connection with the exhibition of picture films. One of the most frequent causes of complaint regarding the character of certain pictures which are shown on the screen is their unsuitability for the. child mind, and their detrimental effect upon the young people of the community. ""While the evidence as to the directly harmful effect of certain types of films doc3 not seem to have sustained the jeremiads of the extremist, the report of the commission gives prominence to the indirect, but still gravely demoralizing influence, which is exercised over children by films only suitable for the mature adult with a discriminating and balanced mind. On this subject, I direct the attention of honourable members to the weighty words of the commission in paragraphs 136 and 137 of its report. While the compulsory enforcement of these recommendations requires wider powers than the Commonwealth at present possesses, the Government will inaugurate an instalment of reform at the earliest ilr. PratI en. possible date by classifying films in the manner suggested. This, with the cooperation of the distributors and exhibitors, should be a valuable guide to parents and those in loco parentis as to the films that are suitable for universal exhibition. Effective action requires c operation with the States, and the Government will consult with the States and endeavour to arrange co-operation. We have no more important duty to discharge The Government bethan rightly to direct the character of and carefully cultivate high ideals in the childhood of the nation, and the Government welcomes this opportunity of taking immediately a step in bringing about this desirable reform. The Government is also in accord with educational films, and it proposes to instruct the censors to give any assistance necessary to the educational authorities take an interest in the educational films that are available for exhibition. It may be noted that the censors have already done some work in this direction. Recommendation 38 refers to taxation, a matter with which my colleague, the Treasurer, is concerned; but I understand that attention to it is awaiting the conclusion of judicial proceedings. As to recommendations 39 and 40, which refer to British films, I point out that the question of establishing British agencies in Australia has been dealt with at length in the annual reports of the censors, and has had wide publicity. The result of this has been that recently at least two British agencies have been established in the Commonwealth for the distribution of British films. As there is no official censorship in Great Britain it is difficult to make effective representations on the general standard of British films to any voluntary censorship established there, but this Government proposes to make representations on this matter to the British Government. The Government approves of the proposal contained in recommendations 41 and 42, that the present duty of 1-^d. per lineal foot under the General Tariff be increased to 2d. per lineal foot, in order to provide the funds necessary to earry out the recommendations made for improving the administration by obtaining more suitable premises, increasing the staff, and stimulating the production of Australian pictures. British films vyill remain free, and it is hoped that an additional incentive will thus be given to the importation into, and exhibition in, Australia of suitable films of British origin. Recommendations 43 and 44 suggest that reciprocal tariff preference be sought in Great Britain and other parts of the Empire, and with this the Government agrees. A great deal has already been done in this direction, but we will take further steps to endeavour to carry out the suggestion made. The attention of the Development and Migration Commission will be called to recommendations 45, 46 and 47 of the report, which concern the "" Know Tour Own Country"" series of Australian pictures. With the proposals contained in recommendations 48, 49 and 50 the Government entirely agrees, and they have been referred to in the suggestions for a Commonwealth and States conference. The Government proposes to take practical and immediate steps to open up negotiations with the States, and it has invited the chairman of the commission, the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Government agrees also with the reasons Marks) to consult and confer with me and thereafter to assist in conferring with the State Governments as to tbe steps to be taken to give effect to the recommendations made for Commonwealth and State co-operation. I feel sure that the experience that the honourable member now has of the whole subject will be invaluable in such negotiations with the States. The numerous amendments of existing regulations and the gazettal of the new regulations necessary for the immediate adoption of the proposals of the Government, pending the result of negotiations with the States, will, in due course, be framed ancl laid upon the tabic of tbe House iu the usual way. The administration of the censorship will be responsible to Parliament, through the Minister for Trade and Customs, and should the successful co-operation of the States be achieved, as the Government sincerely hopes it may, consideration will be given to legislation on the whole subject. The Government agrees in principle with recommendation 50, that legislation on this matter should be embodied in a separate act of Parliament; but as, apart from present administration, the fundamental objective of the recommendations is the co-operation of the Commonwealth and the States, the introduction of legislation must necessarily be deferred until the whole position has been explored and unanimity ancl co-ordination achieved. Possibly the simplest way of dealing with the matter would be to equip the Commonwealth with complete power under section 51, paragraph xxxvii, of the Constitution, with regard to film control and allied matters. There should be little difficulty in obtaining this constitutional authority, particularly if the States, irrespective of party, are agreeable to the principle contained therein. It is satisfactory to note that very little, if any, exception has been taken by the commission, after a .most exhaustive inquiry, to the standards of the present censorship; neither has there been any criticism of the very fine work of the censors. The given, for the proposal contained in paragraph 49 of the commission's report for the creation of a board of appeal. The commission was appointed for the purpose of a complete investigation of the film industry in the Commonwealth. Nearly all the improvements in control suggested are dependent on the co-operation of the States. The chairman of the commission has been invited to assist me in this matter, and his enthusiasm, ability, and probity, ought to carry us a long way towards the objective desired. I have traversed the whole of the commission's recommendations, numbering 50 in all. Of these, nineteen only can be carried out under the present constitutional powers of the Commonwealth. Some of the matters in question had already received consideration before receipt of the report, and action is being taken to bring about the desired results. The remainder of the nineteen recommendations will be dealt with by the Government along the lines I have indicated. The balance of the recommendations, however, which form the fundamental policy necessary for complete conany tenders that might be received. I trol, must necessarily await co-operation by and with the States. I have given to the House a somewhat lengthy review of the whole position so as to afford honourable members the fullest tunity to debate its action. possible information as to the attitude of the Government upon the question, which is of grave importance to the people of the Commonwealth, and to our race by reason of the powerful and pervasive influence which the film exercises on the idea3 and the ideals of an overwhelming proportion of our community. The importance of this matter justifies the utmost attention being given to all its wide aspects. The work of the commission has been comprehensive, thorough, and exhaustive. None of the recommendations are unreasonable or unfair, and the Government accepts the responsibility of carrying them out to the who submitted proposals for safeguardextent that I have indicated; and will take further steps towards the improvement of the industry while doing its utmost to safeguard what it believes to be the best interests of our citizens journed.

That announcement was made the subject of an unsuccessful motion of censure by the then Leader of the Opposion( Mr Charlton).

The only absolute condition was that the ships should be retained upon the British register, but the Government indicated that it would require the maintenance of a service equivalent to that being given by the "" Bay"" and "" Dale"" steamers, that preference would be given to any tenderer ing shippers to and from Australia, and/or made definite proposals for the expansion of the shipping services available to Australia over and above those given by the Commonwealth Line. I remind the House that tenders for the purchase of the Line were first called in 1925, when the Government laid down certain specific conditions to be complied with by the tenderer. We required a service equivalent to that which was then without reference to and approval by a committee comprising one representative of the purchaser, one representative",21,Moving Picture Industry Report Of Royal Commission Govern

On that occasion no offers of purchase were received, and consequently the Government continued to operate the Line. When the ships were again offered for sale in January of this year, the Government did not stipulate the same onerous conditions; but Avhen the House has heard the terms of the contract that has been made,' honourable members w ill recognize that they practically ensure the observance of all the conditions laid down in 1925. Yet, though we had modified our requirements in regard to the second tenders, we were assured that there was still no possibility of selling the Line, and in many quarters my sincerity in calling for tenders was questioned. The suggestion was freely made that I knew perfectly well that no offer would be received for the ships even upon the easier conditions that the Government had offered. For instance, the Argus of the 5th January said in the course of a leading articleThe condition attached to tlic proposed sale Three tenders have been received, inof tlie Commonwealth steamers, that the purcluding one from the White Star Line. chaser shall conduct a scr'-icc equal to that now provided by the Line for ten years, is so Its original offer was Â£1,850,000, but fantastic that the public may well ask whether that was subsequently increased to the Government is in earnest in its professed Â£1,900,000, under circumstances to which desire to rid itself of the ships.

No relief in this direction is, therefore, to be given by the sale of the of the various conditions that were stipufleet. The Melbourne Age saidLondon, 3rd January. The conditions of tender for the purchase of the Commonwealth Government's steamers have been published in London. The opinion is held in shipping circles that the Government's insistence upon the maintenance of a service equal to the present for ten years may debar possible tenderers, as it is unlikely that they will tie themselves down for such a lengthy period to maintain a service which may result in a loss. The Argus of the 6th January returned to the subject, and after dealing with certain facts with regard to the Line, saidI t would be surprising if any tender were received for the ships. The Commercial, of London, saidIt, is, however, open to question if even the amended conditions sought to be imposed arc not too onerous. The Australian Commonwealth Line is suffering a loss of not less than Â£500,000 a year, and this is clearly not an attractive inducement to its sale as agoing concern. All these gloomy prognostications have been falsified; the Government has been able to effect a sale upon the terms which I shall state to the House. Sir James behalf of the Australian Commonwealth Shipping Company of 1928, a company formed for the acquisition of the Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers, had that tender been accepted. The The difficulties confronting possible lated by the prospective purchasers. In considering these offers, it has been necessary to bring the financial position of the Commonwealth Line absolutely up to-date. The figures that have been compiled are accurate, although they have not yet been examined by the Auditor General. They are truly indicative of the position up to.the 31st March of this year.

The first was from the White Star Line. .Its original offer, as I have said, was Â£1,850,000; but ' was afterwards in creased to Â£1,900,000. reason for that increase. Under the conditions of tender it was provided that delivery of the ships should be at the terminal port of uncompleted voyages finished after the contract had been signed. As the fleet is trading between Australia and Great Britain, that meant that half of the vessels would be delivered in Australia and half in Great Britain. The tender 1927. 1928. Â£ a. d. Â£ s. d.

We cabled to the company pointing out that that stipulation was a departure fro m the terms of the invitaThere is a tion to tender, and, if insisted upon, would involve the Commonwealth Government in the repatriation of all of the crews instead of half of them, as contemplated under the original invitation to tender. We indicated that the repatriation of all the crews would, mean an increased expenditure on the part of the Commonwealth of Â£85,000, and the company, in view of that circumstance, agreed to increase its offer from Â£1,850,000 to Â£1,900,000. It also agreed to assist the Commonwealth in repatriating the crews from Great Britain. undertook to employ as many of the officers and engineers of the Line as practicable, and subsequently, in response to a cable from the Oommonwealth Government, agreed to employ the personnel and seamen who desired to remain on the vessels provided that they were suitable. The papers submitted to the House set out the conditions of tendering, the tenders as they were received from the different tenderers, and the subsequent Correspondence that has taken place, mainly, of course, with the White Star Line. By examining those papers, honourable members will be able to follow the trend of the transactions. Certain cables were exchanged between Mr Larkin, the chairman of the Commonwealth Shipping Board in Australia, and Mr Eva, the London representative of the Line, and they are set out in the papers in their original form. When the communications reached the point at which they were taken up by the Government, they became official, and are therefore shown in the papers in the form of a summary. I give my absolute assurance to the House that that summary expresses the purport of the cables. It is quite impossible for the Government to make public the exact wording of the cables exchanged. They are in the Government official cypher, and if actual copies of them were made public it would necessitate an alteration of the cypher. The offer of the White Star Line is Â£1,900,000, the terms of payment being Â£250,000 cash, in pro rata sums on delivery of each steamer, and the balance in ten equal yearly instalments thereafter, bearing interest at 5Â£ per cent. Whilst the original tender contemplated a cash payment of Â£250,000, it was to be made when the ships had been handed over, which would have meant that the Government would not have received that amount until the whole of the ships had been delivered. We, therefore, asked the White Star Company to agree to a cash payment on a pro rata basis as the ships were handed over, and to this it agreed. It will also be found that in the original tender the rate of interest upon the payments was set down at 5Â£ per cent. We Mr Bruce. suggested that that rate was too low; that the rate should be 5 i It per cent., and that, too, was agreed to. The balance of the purchase money will be secured by debentures as a first floating charge over the ships and over the assets of this particular portion of the White Star Company's business. In addition to the debentures, there is an obligation and liability for the payment of the balance by the White Star Company, some particulars of which I shall give to show that the security is satisfactory. The first suggestion put forward was for debentures over the whole of the assets of the White Star Line, and, while that would have been most satisfactory security, I was a little surprised when I heard tliat such terms were being offere*d. Apparently, however, when the solicitors for the company went into the matter, they pointed out the obvious impossibility of giving such a security, and submitted counter proposals. We accepted floating debentures as a first charge over the assets of this portion of the business of the White Star Line. Honourable members will find in the paper presented the cablegrams exchanged and other information relating to the terms and conditions. The offer by Runciman, London, Limited, that they were prepared to form a company was not an offer from Runciman, the ship-owners, but from them through a firm of ship-brokers which Runciman control. The offer was not for the purchase by an existing company. They were prepared to form a company with a capital of Â£1,500,000, of which Messrs. Runciman and their Australian friends would take up not less than Â£75,000 of 1,000,000 ordinary shares of Â£1 each. Their original offer for the fleet was Â£1,000,000, which was subsequently increased in their letter of the 13th April to Â£1,250,000. This offer contemplated the payment of Â£500,000 in cash and Â£750,000 in 5Â£ per cent, debentures redeemable by a sinking fund of not less than 3 per cent, per annum. Honourable members will see that Runciman's offer was for a larger cash payment than that proposed by the White Star Company, but the period for the redemption of the debentures was longer in their case than in that of the White Star Company. The Runciman payment was to be made on the basis of Â£100,000 cash on signing the agreement, Â£40,000 in cash and Â£80,000 in debentures on taking over the first steamer, and Â£60,000 in cash and Â£70,000 in debentures on taking over each subsequent steamer. Runciman's offer was made subject to the company securing underwriting for ordinary shares and in anticipation of a firm offer of the fleet for 72 hours. The increased amount offered by Runciman Limited is Â£650,000 less than that offered by the ""White Star Company. There are also certain conditions in the Runciman offer to which I shall refer later, which made it quite impossible of acceptance, I suggest, even if the price were right. Another point is that it is only an offer of willingness to form a company. It is not an offer by a company in being, with the necessary capital to acquire the fleet. The third tender was from Sir James Connolly offering Â£1,575,000; Â£75,000 of which would be paid in cash on the ""signing of the contract, and the balance of Â£1,500,000, to be in the form of ordinary shares, or Â£950,000 in ordinary shares and Â£550,000 in 5 per cent, preferred ordinary shares in a company which it was proposed to form. The only cash that the Government would have received under that offer would have been Â£75,000. In addition to these payments there was a contemplated payment of Â£500,000 worth of ordinary shares to the company which was to be responsible for the balance of the ordinary shares. It was contemplated that eventually a company with a capital of Â£2,000,000, or Â£2,500,000, would be formed, and that certain additions to the Line would be made by that company. There were two alternative suggestions. One was that within five years the company should build and put on the Australian service six 22-knot steamers of 24,000 tons, and if that were found impracticable it would, within two years, construct and place in service from three to eight 18-knot steamers. This offer related to future expansion, but there was not sufficient evidence of the possibility of its being carried out to justify its consideration. I think the House will recognize that it would be quite impossible for the Commonwealth to sell the Australian Commonwealth Line of steamers, for which we have received a definite offer of Â£1,900,000, for a cash payment of Â£75,000, the balance to be represented in ordinary shares in a company yet to he formed, with the further proviso that the ordinary shares should not carry any dividends until such time as the enlarged fleet, with 22-knot or 18-knot steamers, had been brought into existence. All the details in connection with this offer are set out in the papers which honourable members have before them. The second condition upon which we insisted was that tenders must be submitted by natural-born British subjects or from companies that would give an assurance that they would remain under British control. The White Star Company has a capital of Â£9,000,000, Â£5,000,000 of which is represented by preference shares, practically all of which are held by British subjects. As honourable members will see, the Government has had the share register searched to ascertain by whom the shares in the company are held. Ordinary shares, representing Â£4,000,000 are held, Â£1,000 each by Lord Abercorn, Lord Kylsant, Mr Sanderson, and Mr Clark. The Union Castle Company, Elder Dempster, and the Royal Mail Company, each hold 1,000,000 and the Pacific Steam Navigation Company and the Nelson Company, approximately 500,000 each. The Government is, therefore, satisfied that the White Star Company is a company which can comply with the condition laid down that the ships shall be sold only to a British company. The Runciman offer did not contain a declaration that the majority of the shares would be held by British subjects, and definitely stated that no guarantee would be given to maintain the ships on the British or a Dominion register. But although there was no definite undertaking, I think the reputation and standing of the Runciman interests are such that, had their offer been acceptable in other respects, the Government would, no doubt, have received an assurance that would have enabled it to accept that offer as complying with this particular condition. The offer from Sir James Connolly undertook that the condition would be complied with. The third condition was in regard to taking over the insurance policies, unbroached stores, fuel oil on board, and other similar matters, and with that the three tenderers were prepared to comply. The fourth condition was in relation to taking over all the unexpired liabilities of the Line, and also the office furniture, fittings, &c. In this respect the offer of the White Star Company was that the matter should remain in abeyance u n t i l the tender had been accepted, when an effort would be made to agree on over all suitable officers and engineers. I indicated earlier that, in the matter of taking over the personnel of the ships, the position has advanced a good deal since the tenders were sent in . The White Star Company has already indicated that it proposes to maintain the organization in Australia, but states that it can retain only the personnel which, in its opinion, is necessary for the efficient running of the service. I think that is a necessary condition. ture, fittings, & c , are all valuable assets, and even if the company does not take them over they can be disposed of elsewhere. The Government is more concerned about the taking over of the organization, so that those men who have served the Line extraordinarily well, shall be given a further opportunity of employment if they desire it . I suggest that, if an arrangement is not made for taking over the officers when the terms are finalized, the Government w ill have to give consideration to the position of those on the administrative staff of the organization. serves the option of taking over all, or any part of, the unexpired rights, titles, leases, contracts, &c. Sir James Connelly's offer provides for compliance with that provision. The next point is in regard to the London. The Government provided that the vessels were to be ferred to the purchaser upon the complehave read it was stated that the requiretion of unloading at their final port of ment that the tenderer should maintain discharge in the United Australia. has sought the right to discharge the agree to it . The White Star Company, crews in Britain, that Hr. Bruce. amount of Â£50,000, which w ill cover the cost of repatriating the crews. Runciman Limited also laid down that delivery should be in London, but no f u r ther negotiations have taken place with them. Sir James Connolly agreed that the provisions would be complied with. The sixth provision in the tender form was as follows:Tenders should include an undertaking to enter into an agreement aud provide satisfactory guarantee or security to(a) Maintain the vessels on the British this point, and also to take or a dominion register for a period of at least ten years. (6) Conduct with the existing fleet and/or other vessels of at least equal size, speed and class and with' at least equal accommodation for passengers, and refrigerated and other cargo for a period of not less than ten years, a minimum service equivalent to that provided by the Line between Australia and Great ""Britain at present, viz., at least eighteen round voyages per annum. In any case, office f u r n i In the original offer of the White Star Company that undertaking was given, but honourable members w ill see that we exchanged a number of cablegrams with them subsequently in which we pressed them to give some undertaking as to an expansion of the service, and as a result of those communications a cablegram was received on the 4th A p r i l , in which the White Star Company statedSubject to prompt acceptance our tender we will as soon as possible after entire fleet at our disposal and we are in a position (to) fix new itinerary say within six nine months and provided trade justifies guarantee inaugurate The Runciman tender refortnightly service from London via. Suez supplementing present fleet . with suitable vessels. That is what the White Star have agreed to in regard to this invitation to tender. They have undertaken to maintain the ships on the British register for a period of ten years, and to maintain an equivadelivery of the vessels in lent service. Honourable members w ill trans remember that in the press comments T Kingdom orthe present service was such an imposAs the White Star Company sible condition that nobody would ever we have arranged however, has agreed to do that, and has they shall pay an additional given a further undertaking in regard to a supplementary service. Limited gave no guarantee to maintain the vessels on the British register, but they stated that it was intended to maintain the service under the British flag. They ofiered to maintain a service for refrigerated and ordinary cargo between Australia and GreatB r it a in equivalent to the In the cablegram of the 7th A p r i l , when present one, and stated that their intention was to improve the service, and to consider re-building and replacement schemes. They would not give a definite undertaking in regard to the maintenance of the ships on the British register, nor would they undertake to maintain the present or an equivalent service; but I have no doubt that if we had been able to accept their tender they would, as efficient shipmasters, regard to those matters. Sir James Connolly agrees to the provision in regard to the maintenance of an equivalent service, and makes a suggestion in regard to a 22-knot service, or, alternatively, an 18-knot service, with additional ships. Condition 7, which really links up board. The Government felt that there with condition 6, asks for detailed prowas no need to determine the personnel posals as to the services which tenderers of the board u n t i l there had been f u l l would provide. Condition 8 statesPreference will be given to offers containing tract says that there can be no general proposals for safeguarding the interests of increase in freight u n t i l the matter has Australian exporters and importers in regard to freight rates. In its original offer the White Star Company said that it was its intention as far as possible to continue the policy of the Australian Commonwealth Line, but there was no definite statement as to how the interests of the Australian shipper would be safeguarded. A number of cablegrams were exchanged on this point; but at the moment I shall deal only with the actual position that was arrived at after the negotiations. In its cablegram of the 4th A p r i l , the White Star Company saidProblem freight has been fully explored by Imperial Shipping Committee formed at the request of Australia and on which .Australia no directly represented. Imperial Shipping Comnext condition, namely, that prefermittee decided that cargo interests on each trade route should form representative comence w ill be given to any proposal supmittee and that shipowners should consult ported by Australian capital. The Runcithese committees before varying rates or conman offer suggests that not less than ditions (stop) Such committee already exist Â£75,000 of the ordinary capital of the outward in Australian trade and is satisfactory (stop) Similarly and in order to meet company to be formed w ill be subscribed your request we agree no general increase by Runciman homeward freights will be made without reference to responsible authority in Australia representative of interests concerned somewhat on the line of Australian Merchants' Association here or the existing Dried Fruits and Dairy Produce Boards in Australia constitution of such authority to be agreed upon here with you later on. the Government indicated the terms on which it would be prepared to accept the tender of the White Star Company, we inserted this conditionBuyers to guarantee to inaugurate a fortnightly service via the Suez Canal supplementing present fleet with suitable vessels, as soon as possible after delivery, say within six months, provided trade justifies it ; the establishment in Australia of a responsible body representing all interests concerned, and no have taken steps in general increase in homeward freights to be made without reference thereto. Such body to be selected by the Government and ""the buyers. The position, therefore, is that, in the contract now signed, a provision of that character w ill appear, and the Government and the purchaser w ill then have to decide on the constitution of the opportunity for discussion, and time to come to a wise decision, because the conbeen referred to this board. It is obvious that it is in the interests of the purchasers of the Line to do nothing to obstruct the constitution of the board, because until it is constituted they have no power to raise freights. The Runciman tender makes no suggestion on the point, but they undertake not to join the conference, but to work with it . Sir James Connolly says that he w ill not enter into any agreement with the present Australian shipping conference; the management is to be in the hands of the company, but the Government is to have the right to nominate two directors. The White Star Company makes suggestion in regard to the them "" and their Australian friends."" Sir James Connolly indicates that it is his intention to afford facilities to induce 50 per cent, of the capital to be subscribed in Australia. In compliance with condition 10, which stipulates that a cash deposit shall be made, the White Star Company lodged a deposit with its tender; none of the other tains this conditiontenderers did so. The only condition which the White Star Company put in was that there should be accorded to it by the Commonwealth Government the same treatment as was received by the Commonwealth Shipping Line. We have agreed to that, and it will be inserted in the contract of sale. The only privilege the Commonwealth Line enjoyed as against other lines was that it was given preference in regard to the carrying of Government goods and cargo provided there was a ship available, and the rates of freight were the best obtainable in the market. That is not a very big concession to give to the White Star Company. The Runciman tender embodied a number of new conditions, one of which was as follows:Tenderers stipulate that the Government should agree to(1) In event all or any steamers heing blacklisted by Australian labour and held up in one or more Australian ports for more than five days in all within three years from delivery of last vessel, vendors to pay a rate of demurrage to cover total cost of upkeep of each vessel, and forgo interest on debentures for a minimum of six months irrespective of time vessels held up. Honourable members will realize that no Government could agree to a condition of that kind being inserted. Such a condition amounts to this-that if during any period of six months a five-days' hold-up occurred, the Commonwealth Government would not only pay all demurrage costs, but would forfeit six months' interest. It seemed to me that this was such an impossible condition that the tender could not be accepted even if the price had been satisfactory. Further conditions required the Government to (2) Guarantee not less than 80 per cent, of capacity of ships in assisted emigrants, not only for "" Bay"" steamers, but any others added to fleet at any time. Mr Bruce. (3) Guarantee in event of Line being improved with faster shipsa contract of carriage of mails from Australia, and endeavour to influence the British Government to give them a proportion of the outward mails. (4) To assist in the form of Commonwealth support, and endeavour to protect the Line against strikes in Australian waters. The tender of Sir James Connolly conGovernment to undertake' to give utmost possible guaranteed support, such as mail contracts, Government cargo and passengers, migrants, and in such other ways as may from time to time suggest themselves. Government to guarantee not less than 50 per cent, of the migrant traffic with a minimum of 22,000 persons per annum for ten years at Â£30 net-thi s contract to commence immediately the existing Line is taken over. Government to grant a guaranteed mail subsidy for ten years when the Line is extended to provide a fortnightly service. Apparently, that would also apply in the event of the increase in the Line being to an 18-knot service, or a 22-knot service. The Government gave the fullest consideration to these tenders, and, as a result, determined to accept the offer of the White Star Company as being incomparably the best of the offers made for the purchase of the Line. But it is not sufficient to show that we are selling for the best offer of three tenders received. We had to consider whether the amount offered was a reasonable price for the Line. The Government gave full consideration to this matter, and came to the conclusion that the price offered was, on the whole, a fair and reasonable one. When the proposal to sell the Line was first under consideration, the chairman of the Commonwealth Shipping Board, Mr Larkin informed me that, working on the basis of voyage results and all factors that would have to be taken into consideration, including the altered circumstances that would be brought about through a reduction of the capital expenditure upon which interest would have to be earned, he had arrived at the conclusion that a genuine offer in the region of Â£2,000,000 would give the purchaser an opportunity to operate the Line with a reasonable chance of success. Of course, there are other factors that have to be taken into consideration. The man in the street may possibly hold the view that, because of the heavy losses that have been incurred in recent years, which the taxpayers of Australia have had to make good, the Line is of no value at all as a commercial proposition. But other considerations suggest that in certain circumstances the vessels of the Line may be of substantial value to a purchaser. In the first place it was not laid down in the conditions of tender that the Line must be kept on the Australian register. That is'important. I shall have a few words to say about this phase of the transaction before I resume my seat. The report of the Public Accounts Committee, which inquired into this matter sometime ago, indicated that, if the vessels of the Line had been on the British instead of on the Australian register, there would have been an annual saving in operating charges of about Â£220,000. On this point the committee statedIt is estimated that the additional cost of running the seven steamers now in commission as compared with a similar number and class of vessels on British articles would approximate Â£220,000 per annum; if, therefore, the Commonwealth Line had operated with British rates of wages and conditions, its anticipated loss of Â£189,905 for the year 1920-27 would have been converted into a profit of Â£30,000. This would be a starting point for any prospective purchasers. The next factor is the price offered. The new purchasers will be called upon to earn interest on a capital expenditure of Â£1,900,000. Even after tliere had been a drastic writing down of approximately Â£8,000,000 in the capital value of the ships in 1923, the Commonwealth Shipping Board still had to find interest upon a capital value of Â£4,725,000. As a governmental activity it would possibly be more expensive to operate. But a tenderer would have to set off against this reduction of capital the fact that if the ships were taken off the Australian register and placed on the British register he would lose revenue from coastal trade, which has been earned by the vessels under Commonwealth control. are becoming older, and the obligations with regard to depreciation in value are constantly increasing as time goes on. Many other factors could be mentioned, but I do not propose to delay the House by referring to them. While some people may hold the view that the Line has no value, we have to remember that if the vessels are placed under British articles by the new purchasers there should be a possibility of a reasonable return on a reasonable capital outlay. The next angle from which I think we must view the position is that of price. What price is being paid to-day for vessels of equivalent tonnage? When we were discussing the future of the Line in 1921, it was easy to make comparisons of costs, because ships then were selling almost every day. The position to-day is different. Not many ships are now being sold, and therefore it is difficult to make any comparison of prices. But taking the offer of the successful tenderer I think we may estimate the price that is being received for the five "" B a y "" liners as Â£300,000 each, and for the two "" D a l e "" ships Â£200,000 each, making the total of Â£1,900,000. The only record of comparative sales which the Shipping Board was able to obtain relates to two Italian vessels that were sold recently, and the Ormuz, one of the vessels of the Orient line. The gross tonnage of the Ormuz -is given as 14,588, and the net tonnage as 8,082. The figures for the "" B a y "" steamers are 13,856 tons gross, and 8,415 tons net. The passenger carrying capacity of the Ormuz is 1,181 persons, as against a passenger carrying capacity of 738 in the case of the "" Bay"" steamers. The speed of the Ormuz when fully laden is from 15 knots to 15^ knots and that of the "" B a y "" steamers 15 knots. The Commonwealth steamers, with one exception, were built in 1921 and 1922 and the Ormuz in 1914; so the Orient Company's vessel is considerably older. The price received for that vessel was Â£257,500, but it included brokerage, which is a fairly heavy charge, whereas the ""''Commonwealth Line vessels are being sold free of brokerage. The two Italian ships which have been sold recently are much smaller. Their gross tonnage is 9,700, Then, every day the ships and their net tonnage 5,900; but their passenger carrying capacity is high. Both have accommodation for 1,265 passengers, as against 738 in the case of the "" Bay"" steamers. Their speed also is greater, 15 to 16 knots, against 15 knots for the Commonwealth vessels. These Italian vessels were built in 1914 and 1915, and they were sold in December last for Â£175,000 each. One other factor which has to be borne in mind when making comparison of prices is, that the passenger-carrying capacity of the three ships referred to is high, and that passenger acliament was about to re-assemble, it commodation is most expensive to provide. Another consideration that should not be overlooked is the fact that the vessels have to be retained in the Austrater to Parliament rather than through lian trade. This was not laid down as a condition of sale by the Government. What the Ministry stipulated for was an equivalent tonnage of similar ships. But these vessels are really suitable only for the Australian trade, and would have little market value for any other trade route. All these facts should venture to suggest that if , bebe considered when comparing the successful tender price for the Commonwealth Line and the prices received for the three other ships to which I referred. The Government, after giving the fullest consideration to the whole of the circumstances, came to the conclusion that the offer was fair and reasonable, and accepted it. We notified the tenderers accordingly, and the contract has been drawn up and signed. An incidental matter is the control of the Cockatoo Island dockyard. Honourable members will recall that when the Shipping Board was constituted, not only was the Commonwealth Line of Steamers placed under its control, but also the Cockatoo Island dockyard and its activities. At the present time this yard is under an act of Parliament controlled by the Shipping Board; but obviously it is unnecessary to keep the board in existence merely to carry out one of the functions for which it was created. The Government has fully considered the matter, and has decided to invite'tenders for the leasing of the dock13th April, because it was published on yard, propei' safeguards having been taken to ensure that it will be available, does not repudiate it ; at all events, I have if necessary, for defence purposes. I have seen various statements in the press concerning the sale of the Line. Many of them emanated from the honourable member ( Mr Scullin), who complained bitterly from the public something the people were entitled to know. The honourable member said that I should Mr Bruce. have made a statement long ago with regard to the sale of the Line. I suggest to the honourable gentleman that even if the sale of the ships had been effected a week ago, in view of the fact that Parwould have been an act of courtesy on the part of the Government to make an important announcement of this characthe press. Unfortunately for the honourable gentieman, the facts do not support his complaints. The Line was not sold last week. The contract was not. signed^ until Saturday night. On SundayI received a cablegram stating that the contract had been completed. I fore the contract had been actually signed, the Government had announced to the world that the Line had been sold, it would have been open to severe censure by Parliament. It would have been wrong to make any statement concerning the transaction until it had been absolutely settled. That is the position. The contract was signed on Saturday last, and the Line has now been sold as a deliberate act of policy, for which the Government is prepared to take the fullest responsibility. As soon as a statement was made in regard to the sale of the Line, several attacks were made upon the Government. One was a very spirited onslaught by the honourable member for Yarra. He suddenly announced that the vessels would not be able to trade round the Australian coast, and he accused me of misleading the people of Australia. I think it is necessary that I should give some of the facts in regard to this matter. A statement was made by the honourable member, apparently on the the 14th April, and I gather that he not seen a correction of the statement in any newspaper. Expressing his indignation because tbe vessels would not still be available for the Australian coastal trade, for Yarra the honourable member saidAccording to Hansard Mr Bruce said that I was keeping back "" The Government, after most exhaustive conwhich sideration, considers that the proper course is to dispose of the Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers, if a reasonable price is offered. Such a step would be subject to the condition that the Line is maintained on an Empire register, and that the purchaser undertakes to maintain, for a period of at least ten years, at least an equivalent service in regard to passenger, cargo and refrigerated space."" Further, the honourable member for Yarra quoted me as having saidI t is much better that the tenderers should be invited to submit to the Government proposals for the service they are prepared to give than that we should stipulate the services we require, but the absolute minimum acceptable is an equivalent to the existing service. He then went on to sayThe"" existing service"" provided by the Commonwealth Line included the carrying of interstate passengers and cargo, and Mr Bruce was endeavouring to get away from a very definite declaration by saying that his remarks did not apply to "" interstate services."" It is clear that the honourable gentleman that, when I made the statement that that sought to give the impression to the pubwas known all along, I misrepresented lic that I had not indicated that if the the position. Let me read what I said Line were sold the vessels could not conon this matter in the House. I point out tinue in the interstate trade. He sugthat the honourable member quoted my gested that I had deceived the House remarks several times, in order to lead when making my statement, and that he had now found me out. He went on to sayMr Bruce's latest statement indicated that quote that part of my speech that would the "" Bay"" boats would be removed from the have shown that he, and everybody else, Australian coastal trade, the object being to knew what I intended. The words which evade Australian conditions of labour, AvhichI used in the House, but were not quoted were laid clown by the Navigation Act. The honourable member proceeded to deal with the effect of the removal of those vessels from the coastal trade; but I shall deal with that matter in a moment. When the honourable member's statement was brought under my notice, I replied through the press in these termsI t was made perfectly clear that there would not be any restriction placed upon the sale of the Line which would compel the purchaser to maintain it in the Australian register. Under the Navigation Act it is necessary that any ships carrying passengers and freight round the coast must comply with the provisions of the act, and it was well-known to everybody that if the Line were purchased and placed upon another register, the ships would be in the same position as other overseas trading vessels. Nobody would be better aware of these facts than Mr Scullin. and it is amazing that he should now suggest that he did not understand, from the statement whicli I made in the House, exactly what the position was. In a rejoinder the honourable member for Yarra further saidConfronted with unanswerable facts, the Prime Minister invariably assumes the role of injured innocence, and complains that he is misrepresented. Will he claim that Hansard misrepresented him in reporting his speech on the conditions laid down for the sale of tlie Commonwealth ships? Hero are his own words, recorded in Hansard No. 10, page 1028:-""That the purchaser undertakes to maintain, for a period of 10 years, at least equivalent services in regard to passenger, cargo and refrigerated. space."" Again at page 1029 Mr Bruce said-""The absolute minimum acceptable is an equivalent of the existing services."" "" Existing services"" include the carrying of interstate passengers and cargo. These services cannot be maintained if they arc abolished. Denials or protestations will not alter that stubborn fact. The honourable member suggested that he did not know that the ships would go out of the coastal trade. He said that I had only now made known that fact, and the people to believe that I had misrepresented the facts; but he did not by the honourable member, wereWe are told that the Commonwealth ships operating under Australian conditions are of tremendous advantage in the interstate trade, There have been one or two instances in which the Commonwealth Line of Steamers have been of assistance in that direction, but they certainly do not offer a solution of the problem presented to us by the interstate trade. That is generally recognized. The Navigation Royal Commission went fully into the subject, and the minority report signed by Senator Duncan and Senator Elliott statedI then set out what that report showed, namely, that the overseas ships did not enter largely into the coastal trade. I then went on to quote a supplementary memorandum by the honourable member for Bourke( Mr Anstey), another member of the commission, showing to what extent those vessels entered into that trade, and what would be the effect of taking them out of the service. I concluded by saying that we could not "" j u s t if y this Line, either for the sake of the Australian mercantile marine, or as a means of solving the interstate shipping problem, which is one of the most difficult we have to face."" Every word that I uttered was clearly directed to meeting the argument that if the ships of the Commonwealth Line were sold and allowed to go on any other register, the vessels would be deprived of their coastal trade. The criticism of the honourable member for Yarra was a gross misrepresentation of what I said, and it was made worse by the quoting of some passages but the leaving out of the particular part of my speech that clearly demonstrated that that position had to be recognized by the House in arriving at its decision. [Extension of time granted.] member for Yarra, on various occasions, dealt with the disastrous results that he thought would accrue to the passenger traffic and the shipping services round the coast if the ships of the Commonwealth Line were put upon another register. Exaggerated made on this subject. One gentleman, writing to the press over the name "" Traveller,"" said that the coastal passengers carried by the vessels of the Commonwealth Line represented 50 per cent, of the total coastal passenger the withdrawal of these vessels, licences trade of Australia, and if the first-class to engage in coastal trading can be passengers were excluded, the "" Bay"" liners carried 80 per cent, of the total coastal passenger traffic. I asked the Government Statistician to inquire into those figures, and I was informed that the interstate arrivals by sea and departures by sea in and from each State and in and from the Northern Territory for the year 1926 totalled 362,148. Those are the latest figures available, and the statistics so far to hand for 1927 indicate a similar position. Of those passengers the "" B a y "" liners carried 12,350, or 3.4 per cent. of the total number. I suggest that the statement by the honourable member for Yarraletter to the press. I know nothing about it. It is scandalous for the Prime Minister to refer to it as though I had written it. ment made by the honourable member for Yarra to the press on the 13th April, drawing a most gloomy picture of the effect on the coastal traffic of Australia if the ships were withdrawn, was grossly inaccurate, and, to say the very least, it misrepresented the position. We were also told that the withdrawal of the ships would have a serious effect on the freightage position round the coast. We were informed that the "" B a y "" liners were carrying a good deal of the freight. The actual position is that, for the year 1927, the Commonwealth Line of Steamers carried 4,283 tons of coastal freight, made up as follows:-Genera l cargo, 1,085 tons; meat, 1,590 tons; butter, 1,513 tons; flour, 50 tons; and The honourable fruit, 45 tons. For the last five years the total tonnage carried by coastal vessels was as follow:Year. Tons. ] 922-23 .. 5,137,051 192324 .. 0,538,191 192425 .. .. 0,413,975 192520 .. 5,735,973 statements have been 192627 .. 6,796,150 the 4,283 tons carried by the "" B a y "" liners represent? Should the necessity arise, as a result of granted to oversea compauies. During the last two years 174 such licences have been issued, and the cargoes carried, consisting principally of meat, amounted to 13,398 tons. It cannot, therefore, be said that we are aiming a fatal or an irreparable blow at the Australian coastal service. There is only one other point with which I need deal, but it is of paramount importance to this Parliament. The Melbourne Argus of the 13th April last contained a statement by Mr O'Neill, the secretary of the Victorian branch of the Australian Seamen's Union, to the effect that, from the time that crews were signed on for these vessels at English rates of pay, the ships would be declared black at all Australian ports, and not a stick of cargo would be handled or a line touched when they were being berthed. Then, yesterday, a newspaper published a paragraph which contained the following threat:It is stated that the Maritime Transport Group in Sydney has decided to declare black all ships of Lord Kylsant's Line that visit",29,Paper Tenders Fob Purchase

That is an aspect of this matter which most seriously affects this Parliament. Once an issue has been placed before the elected representatives of the people of Australia, and a majority of those representatives have decided upon a certain line of action, it does not matter whether an individual member agrees with or dissents from that decision, it is his responsibility to see that the will of the people, as expressed through its representatives, is not thwarted by any outside body possessing no authority from the people. The action which the Government has taken in this matter has been taken with the approval of a majority of honourable members. Any attempt to prevent effect being given to the expressed will of this House is not only a violation of a contract, but an attack by irresponsible persons upon the very basis of our constitutional government. All members of this Parliament, including honourable members opposite, are concerned in this matter because, as representatives of the people, they are under a solemn obligation to maintain and uphold the democratic institutions of this country. I appeal to them to do all in their power to dissuade these persons from taking the action they are said to contemplate. Buti f such an attempt is made the Government, will use every means within its power to ensure that the will of the people is not thwarted. Should we find that we have not sufficient powers, the Government will bring down to the House any necessary measure required to deal with the position. If Tariff Item. 320.

64,Mr Pratten (Martin,"Minister forfrom the increased duty should be utilized to assist in developing the moving picture industry in Australia. Prior to 1914, films were imported into the Commonwealth free of duty, but in that year a tariff of 1-^d. per foot British, and 2d. per foot general, was imposed. In 1917, the rates were revised and fixed at Id. British, and general. In 1920 an intermediate duty of l i d . per foot was adopted, making the rates Id. British, l^d. intermediate, and l i d . general. In the following year the intermediate and general rates were increased to 3d. per foot, whilst the British rate remained at Id. The 1920 rates of Id., lÂ£d., and l^d. were reverted to later on in 1921. The present duties under Tariff Item 320 (c) are-Free, British; Id., intermediate; l^d., general, per lineal foot; but by this amendment the rate.under the general tariff will be increased to 2d. per lineal foot, British still remainpresented 91.7 per cent, of the total numing free, and the intermediate rate at Id. It will be remembered that under the Customs Tariff Act of 1925 some rather important changes were made by this Parliament in the direction of making British films free of duty. and scenic films are also free of duty irrespective of the country of origin, as it was thought by Parliament that the screening of films of this type was of benefit to the community. are not interfered with by the present motion; they will still remain free irrespective of their country of origin. The duty collected on dramatic films during the year 1926-27 was Â£134,310, and on this basis the increase of ^d. per lineal foot under the general tariff should return Â£44,770 additional revenue. But it must be borne in mind that, if this amendment appeals to the House, it will give an increased preference to British films, and if these make progress in the Australian market, the amount estimated to be collected as additional revenue will be proportionately diminished. I have already said that in 1925 this Parliament made alterations to the tariff, and honourable members will remember that, following an inquiry by the Tariff Board, the British duty of Id. per lineal foot on cinematograph films was abolished, whilst the duty under the general tariff was not increased. I pointed out this Mr Pratten afternoon that British producers have taken a little advantage of this encouragement to their industry, aud the effect of the Government's action in this respect has been a slight increase in the importation of British, if not Empire, films with a consequent reduction in the proportion of foreign films into Australia. Another effect has been the recent establishment in the Commonwealth of at least two British agencies for the distribution of British films throughout the Commonwealth. It will interest honourable members to note that in the years 1906 and 1907 the importations of exposed cinematograph films of all descriptions, which were then free of duty, were less than 1,000,000 feet. In 1915-16, and again in 1916-17, over 11,000,000 feet of films were imported, whilst in 1925-26, and 1926-27 the importations had grown to approximately 30,000,000 feet and 36,000,000 feet respectively. In 1925, foreign films reber imported, while the TJnited Kingdom sent us 8.2 per cent. In 1927, the importation of foreign films had declined to 87.3 per cent., while that of British films had increased to 12.6 per cent. Educational ""Whilst the present proposal may be in accord with the unanimous recommendation of the Film Commission, it is a still further extension of the Government's policy of Empire film preference, and it These films is sincerely hoped that the British Government and British producers will appreciate and take advantage of the opportunities now afforded to them. Britain can, and does now, produce films second to none, and that production is increasing. It will also be noticed by honourable members that in the motion the intermediate duty of Id. per lineal foot has not been altered, and as I stated this afternoon, the Government will take steps to endeavour to obtain reciprocal preferences within the Empire, as recommended by the commission. Apart from the encouragement which an increased duty on foreign films will give to British productions, I draw the attention of honourable members to paragraphs 188 and 189 of the Film Commission's report. These suggest that an increased revenue from customs duty should be used for the purpose of(o) Encouraging and stimulating production; (6) Providing for1. The cost of censorship and the appeal board, and accommodation and equipment there for. 2. Awards of merit. 3. Assistance work, if desired. The method by which this assistance may be given has yet to be decided. The Government will pursue the principles of the policy recommended by the Film Commission; but the real reason for the commission's recommendation for an increase in the foreign duty is to encourage and stimulate Australian productions. for the recommendation. derived from the proposed increased duty cannot be specifically appropriated to the objects suggested by the commission, the commission's recommendations are "" in principle the adopted policy of the Government. Better facilities for administration Australian production are such great advantages that they easily outweigh the almost negligible increase in duty that is proposed. It might be argued, however, that the extra duty will be passed on to the public by increased prices of admission. Examination of the figures shows how un justifiable such a contention would be. The ordinary feature or dramatic film averages about 6,000 feet in length, and estimating the average number of screenings at 75, which I think is a very low figure, especially as in suburban theatres the film may be shown three or four times, the extra cost would be 3s. 4d. for each screening, or about one-tenth of a penny per person if 400 were the average attendance. would not be justified in increasing the -rates of admission. no justification for the scare cry that the increased duty would involve higher fees for admission to picture shows. The additional Â£75 of duty for all six copies of a film of 6,000 feet is negligible when compared with the huge sums spent on the average film for exploitation purposes. lected on negative films imported for printing in Australia-? [1C0] that question off-hand, but I think the Minister has administrative power to encourage the creation of work of all sorts with educational within Australia. I submit this motion to the favorable consideration of honourable members, and I hope that it will help to achieve the object we all desire, namely, the distribution and exhibition, on an ever-increasing scale, of British, Australian, and other dominion films throughout the Commonwealth and the Empire, and eventually an export trade in films made in Australia. Progress reported. BILL. Debate resumed from 28th March (vide page 4271), on motion by Dr. and the development of That the bill be now read a second time. original Housing Bill was discussed at considerable length last year, and the purpose of this measure is merely to put a few patches on a statute that has been inoperative for five months. The housing scheme outlined by the Prime Minister in his policy speech two and a half years ago was one of the most illusive proposals that I recollect in many years of political life. The right honourable gentleman definitely promised that Â£20,000,000 would be made available to provide houses for the people, and literature was broadcast stating that any person who wanted a home would be able to gratify his wish under the very liberal scheme that the Federal Government proposed to bring into operation. That was one of the promises upon which the pact parties Avere returned to power; the housing scheme was one of the much vaunted mandates of the Government. But this particular mandate was allowed to rust for two years before the Government introduced a measure which purported to embody a housing scheme, but actually did nothing of the sort. It was accompanied by another bill for the amendment of the Commonwealth Bank Act by dividing the bank into two sections, and appointing three commissioners who would be entrusted with the administration of an",42,Import Duties

71,Mr Scullin (Yarra) [8.21],"Th eonerous house-building scheme which the Treasurer assured us would' be too great a burden for fhe directors of the Commonwealth Bank. ""When the two bills were examined we found that the Govern1 ment was putting forward,not a housing scheme, but merely a proposal that any building authority requiring money for its purposes should be able to borrow from the Commonwealth Savings Bankat whatever rates of interest fhe money was costing that institution. We refused to believe that the directors of the Commonwealth Bank had declared that they could not operate such a simple borrowing and lending scheme, and that the appointment of three new commissioners to control the savings bank branch would be necessary. We asked for the appointment of a selectcommittee to ascertain the views of the directors. The -Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page)' said that we were only trying to waste time; that we did not want houses to be built, or the Government's scheme to be brought into operation. An investigation by a select committee need not have occupied more than a week; but so urgent and insistent was the Treasurer with regard to this scheme that had been allowed to remain dormant for two years, that he begrudged a Week for the purpose of obtaining essential information. However, the directors came to Canberra and made their wishes known so plainly that the Treasurer was obliged to back downin the House, and the three new commissioners who were to control the Commonwealth Savings Bank have not been, and are not likely to be, appointed. I mention this little bit of history in order to show the make-believe that characterizes this scheme. surer considered last year of urgent importance has been on the statute-books for five months, and before one house has been built under its provisions we are asked to consider an amending bill. I believe a government The State Governments are carrying out very good house-building policies, although they might do much more than they are doing. Under the War Service Homes Act the Oommonwealth Government also is operating a housing scheme, and it is a remarkable fact that while the Government submits to the country a proposal for the expenditure of Â£20,000,000 Afr.

In reply to a question asked by the honourable member for Reid( Mr Coleman), the Minister for Works and Railways told the House that on the 1st July, 1927, Â£1,728,000 had been made available by Parliament for the. construction of War Service Homes, but the amount provided in the Estimates had been reduced by Â£19,500. That reduction, we were told, represented only 25 homes; nevertheless, the Government is providing money for 25 homes less than were approved by Parliament.

Until Ave have provided a home for eA'ery person who requires one, Ave should not amend the Commonwealth Housing Act to provide a person Avith two homes or a second home. The honourable member's opinion of a housing scheme is not mine. Clause4 of the b ill omits sub-sections 3 and 4 of section 10 of the act, and not one word of explanation has the Treasurer given for this amendment. In his second-reading speech he saidThe method of repayments by the housing authorities of the State to the Commonwealth Bank, and thence to tlie Treasurer, as set out in the principal act has been found not to suit every State. Accordingly, by clause 4, section 10 of the principal act is amended by omitting sub-sections 3 and 4, and substituting other sub-sections in lieu thereof with a view to providing greater elasticity in the dealings between the Commonwealth Savings Bank and the State housing authorities, and between the Treasurer and the Commonwealtli Savings Bank. There is no information contained in that statement, and I should like to know why sub-sections 3 and 4 of section 10 are to be omitted. I find that they are important provisions. Sub-section 3 providesIn respect of each loan by the Commonwealth Treasurer to tlie Savings Bank, the Savings Bank shall pay-[a ) to the Treasurer, half-yearly, interest on the amount of the loan, the rate of such interest being such rate as is certified by the Auditor-General for the Commonwealtli, as representing the cost of the money to the Commonwealth, after allowing for discounts on the issue of loans and the expenses of flotation. The amendment deliberately does away with the Auditor-General's certification of charged. I wish to knoAv the reason for this alteration. graph of that sub-section is also to be omitted, and I regard it as of still more importance. The act was passed only last year, and it seems strange that it should already require alteration before any attempt has been made to put There may be a good explanation for the deletion of sub-section 3 of section 10, but it is not contained in the second reading speech of the Treasurer. It is essential to establish a sinking f u n d when advancing moneys for the erection of houses, but under this bill that is to be dispensed with. The original provision readsIn respect of each loan by the Commonwealth Treasurer to the Savings Bank, the Savings Bank shall pay (6) to the National Debt Commission, half-yearly, .on the first day of January and the first day of July in each year, such sum as is agreed upon between the Treasurer and the Savings Bank, not being less than 10s. per centum per annum of the amount of the loan.

91,Mr Coleman (Reid) [8.43],"I cangood deal of sham and pretence and humbug about the housing scheme of this Government. As the honourable member for Yarra has said, ou 28th March last, I asked the Minister for Works and Railways how many applications for war ferred. To my astonishment, and also to that of every member who accepts the responsibility of this Parliament to provide homes for soldiers while the War Service Homes Act remains on the statute-book, the Minister replied that 1,041 applications had been deferred until the next financial year. for an answer from the Government. My protest is not an isolated one; the soldiers' organizations throughout Australia are also protesting against the Government's procrastination in this matter. faith and its failure to fulfil its promises are bitterly resented. The newspapers in Sydney and elsewhere contain numerous complaints by deluded persons who have made applications for homes as a result of the propangandist methods of the War Service Homes Commission. In New South Wales the commission conducted an intensive propaganda by means of wireless, the press, and printed pamphlets in which ex-soldiers were invited to come along and obtain the homes which a "" beneficent, kindly disposed, and patriotic "" Government wished to provide for them. As a result of this' propaganda there are in New South Wales alone 536 ex-soldier applicants awaiting advances. At the end of February last in New South Wales there were 118-n o doubt the number since has been materially increased-wh o desired to buy existing properties, 195 who wished to build new homes, and 223 who wanted additional accommodation to meet the housing requirements of large families. Only a year or so ago this Government amended the War Service Homes Act to enable advances to be made to "" diggers "" who wished to provide additional accommodation for their growing families, and it is positively immoral to refuse to grant these advances. In 1919 or 1920, provision was made in the act for an advance of Â£800, but those who received such an advance and built homes at that time have to-day possibly four or five children who are growing' up and have to be accommodated in dwellings of two or three rooms. It is not in the interests of good citizenship to confine these men to such habitations when their families have outgrown the accommodation. The Governservice homes had been dement should not economize at the expense of these men whom they exploit so often at election time. Altogether there are 536 applications awaiting settlement in New South Wales, 203 in Yictoria, 139 in Queensland, 75 in South Australia, 67 in Western Australia, and 21 in Tasmania. There are 276 waiting to purchase existThis calls ing properties, 424 who wish to build houses, and 341 who desire to increase their accommodation to meet the require-, ments of growing families. others who have been discouraged by the The Government's breach of delay in granting applications. sequently have not lodged applications. It is quite likely that at the end of the financial year, if the present increase is maintained, there will be 1,500 or more applications awaiting settlement. not using extravagant language to characterize as mere pretence and humbug a scheme under which Â£20,000,000 is to be spent upon the general housing requirements of the community, when the Government will not carry out its own housing responsibilities to returned soldiers. If it is not prepared to do this it should repeal the War Service Homes Act, instead of liberalizing its provisions and making lavish promises, and then telling the returned men, ""We cannot do anything for you."" This is a matter which concerns every honourable member of the House, and all should join with me in asking the Treasurer for an explanation of why economy proposals propounded by the Government should afreet the building of soldiers' houses. The War Service Homes scheme is operating satisfactorily in New South Wales; the ex-soldiers there appear to be fairly well satisfied with it, and it should not be affected by the position in which the Government finds itself to-day as the result of its extravagance in other directions.

Surely it isonly provides a necessary utility, but is a productive expenditure, and tbe cutting aown of a housing scheme designed to benefit ex-soldiers calls for the strongest We understand that he was largely repossible protest from honourable members on both sides of the House. ""Will advances up to Â£1,800 under the general housing scheme and the further liberalization set out in the bill now before us compare favourably with the meagre advance of Â£800 or possibly Â£950 to meet the requirements of returned soldiers and their families? The curtailment of expenditure necessary to meet the housing requirements of struggling returned soldier workers savours of unwarranted discrimination of the worse kind. As the Acting Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin) has suggested, this measure can be more effectively debated in committee; but I trust the Treasurer will not again talk of lack of funds. When the Minister for Works and Railways( Mr Hill) replied to the question I submitted on the 28th March last, he made many excuses for the delay in providing homes for returned soldiers. Those excuses do not satisfy me. The real trouble is the inability or the refusal scheme. Eveni f this measure is passed of the Treasurer to make the necessary funds available. That is the real 'reason. It was suggested by the Minister that there was difficulty in securing draftsmen, supervising officers, contractors and workappear that the Prime Minister, in outmen. I regard that as so much nonsense. In Sydney at present there is a comparative depression in the building trade, in the different branches of which there are thousands of men unemployed. I challenge the accuracy of the Minister's statement that the Government cannot get contractors or workmen. The real reason for the Government's attitude is obviously the failure of the Treasurer to make funds available. I leave the matter there and trust that before the debate closes the Treasurer will indicate what he proposes to do, particularly if it is seriously suggested that this Â£20,000,000 is to be raised. Some statement should be made showing why the money required to meet the necessities of 1,041 soldiers' claims cannot be met. I trust honourable members will recognize the strong case which has been made out for these applicants. Mr Coleman. The Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page); has made this his own particular scheme. sponsible for its inclusion in the Government's policy speech at the opening of the last election campaign. He claimed a good deal of credit for it when on the hustings. Since then, we are told, he has devoted much attention to the formulation of the scheme, and to the drafting of the necessary legislation, and he has certainly given a lot of time to the piloting of the enabling bills through the House. We cannot, however, congratulate him upon the success of his efforts. He has not yet succeeded in building one house under the scheme, and apparently has not even succeeded in perfecting any legislation to give effect to it. This is about the third attempt which the Treasurer has made to put the statute into acceptable form. Two measures with which we dealt last year were the direct outcome of the Government's housing proposals. Prior to the introduction of this bill one or two amending bills were passed, and this is really the fourth attempt to finalize the legislation to give effect to the Government's housing there will be, so far as we can judge, no finality. I charge the Treasurer first of all, and, indeed, the Government, with lack of candour in this matter. It would lining the policy of his Government prior to the last general elections, was more anxious to make political capital than to satisfy the needs of the people, otherwise he would have shown more earnestness in going on with a really practical scheme. In introducing the original measure last year the Treasurer showed great lack of candour. I do not desire to be too harsh, but obviously the honourable gentleman did not fully report the negotiations that had proceeded between the Commonwealth Bank's directors and himself, and' what had been settled. He got himself into a most unenviable position, with the result that he had to make to the House an explanation somewhat humiliating to himself. During the course of the discussion on the Commonwealth Housing Bill last year the Treasurer, in answer to an inquiry from 'tliis side of the chamber,",48,Eable Page
96,Mr Theodore (Dalley) [8.54],"said that he was acting in co-operation with the State authorities, who had the right to build houses, and that he had consulted with the State Governments. He was not candid. I do not doubt that he had discussed the matter with some State Premiers, although I judge that the discussions were of the most casual character. He did not enter into negotiations with the State Governments to ascertain the extent to which he could rely on their co-operation, or the method of that cooperation; and the fact that he has now to amend the original act to meet the requirements of the State authorities shows that when that measure was passed nothing could have been settled, or even fully discussed. If the original negotiaties, but there is no necessity to duplicate tions had been properly conducted, the present position would not have arisen. In considering the wisdom of the Commonwealth Government entering the field of home building, we touch the important point referred to by the Acting Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin) and the man). We have to consider, first of all, whether the Government has fully discharged its obvious duty to provide homes for returned soldiers, and, secondly, whether the Commonwealth Governmentought to enter the field of providing homes for civilians in which the States are already' operating. If we decide that the Commonwealth should enter this field of activity, we have then to determine whether it should do so by providing the State authorities with better facilities for raising their funds, and in no other way. In every State there is a complete housing scheme. could be amended and extended in certain directions, but the State authorities have been concerned with housing schemes for the last twenty years, and during each succeeding year have been perfecting them. amended their schemes. schemes had operated, and many homes had been built; but that is no reason why the Commonwealth should amend its legislation before the scheme has operated. The States have amended their schemes after experience in building homes; whereas the Commonwealth Government has already amended its scheme not once, but on several occasions, although it has not built a house or spent one pound for this purpose. The State authorities have housing schemes to meet varying circumstances ; in fact, they have schemes of a varying nature to apply to different classes of borrowers. In some cases these are conducted under more than one authority, and they are endeavouring to cover -the whole field. It is true, and we have to recognize, that many, if not all, of the States have been restricted in the carrying out of this work by lack of funds. The Commonwealth could no doubt aid the States in that respect. It may be necessary to assist the State authoriState schemes. anything of the kind? suggestion of the Treasurer when he brought down the scheme last year. said that the State authorities would go on with this scheme, would lay down the exact nature of the conditions, and determine the kind of houses which were to be built.

107,Mr Theodore,"It may be someas this quite impartially. This is a subject which ought to be so considered. The provision of homes is a national matter. The people need homes, and if they have not the financial means to build them for themselves, it is a matter for the intervention of the governing authorities. Every State Government has recogr nized that, Nationalist as well as Labour. There are schemes operating to-day which make the necessary' provision, and thay afford sufficient facilities. the States have not enough money. aud the Commonwealth Government can assist the States by making loans; but that is no justification for the Commonwealth Government bringing in a bill lo settle every detail under which the advances shall be made, to set up machinery for the supervision of the erection of the buildings, or to state the conditions under it will probably still be merely a prowhich the houses shall be built. member disagree with the Acting Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin), with regard to the need for machinery clauses ? gentleman must misunderstand me. of the Opposition blamed us for not going far enough in the provision of machinery clauses. introduced provision was made for sinking funds, and certification by the Audi. tor-General as to the rate of interest to be paid, and now without any adequate explanation, it is proposed to abandon those provisions. That is a matter which the honourable gentleman should explain. The Government apparently found such difficulty in administering the War Service Homes scheme that it asked the State authorities to take over the work, and provide for administering the fund. All the States except Queensland and New South Wales are now administering the provisions of the War Service Homes Act. Is that not an admission that the States have adequate machinery, and probably many facilities which the Commonwealth does not possess for doing this work' and for building dwellings? Tf that is accepted, what is the necessity for the Commonwealth Government to come forward with a gigantic home building scheme involving an ' expenditure of Â£20,000,000? ness. that it is. It may be its business to assist the States to carry on their schemes, but that is all. scheme does not mean anything. is a sham, and I regret that the Treasurer, who has made this his pet project, has contrived nothing better than what appears on its very face to be mere sham and hypocrisy. The thing that was promised to the people in 1925 has not yet been given to them. The gift is only on paper, and mise when the next appeal is made to the people. The Treasurer cannot point to a solitary house which has been built under this scheme. That is a poor record, and one' of which the honourable gentleman cannot be proud. If he can show that the scheme is anything more than a device to catch votes, it is time that he did so. surer) [9.7] -The House has witnessed an extraordinary volte face by the Opposition in this matter. The charge levelled against the Government in November last was that it was not going into the housebuilding business itself, that it was merely asking the States to do work for it by means of their own machinery. That was the chief charge then levelled against the Government, and it was advanced at that time as evidence of our hypocrisy. Now the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Theodore), having forgotten to read up the Hansard report of his own speech, and of those of other honourable members on that side, asks why we do not use the State instrumentalities, which is exactly what this bill proposes to do. Never before have we seen such remarkable lack of memory, or such wonderful inconsistency, as has been displayed by the members of the Opposition over this matter.'

118,Dr. Earle Page (Cowper,"Treabehind this scheme at all We are asking the States to do this work, as Ave always intended they should do it. If honourable members will read even the curtailed statement of the New South Wales budget delivered last Aveek, they will see that it contains a definite provision for the alteration, of legislation to homes enable that State to act in accordance with the provisions of our housing laAV. Discussions have taken place-beginnin g almost from the very day on which this measure was passed by Parliamentbetween the officials of the Commonwealth Savings Bank and the officials of the various State building schemes. Three State housing authorities-Victoria, Soutb Australia, and New South Wales-hav e stated that they are prepared to recommend the alteration of their legislation in the direction desired, to come under this housing scheme. They have stated that if certain alterations were made in the act they Avould be able to carry out the scheme Avith a minimum amount of alteration to their own legistion. In accordance with those representations to the CommonAvealth Savings Bank, the CommonAvealth Government now proposes to make the alterations which are before the House. They are of a very minor character, and do not affect the principle of the act. They are being proposed to ensure that the requirements of the Commonwealth Act shall be, as far as possible, in line with the requirements of the various State acts. Thai is the position, and I may state for the benefit of the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Theodore) that the New South Wales Government proposes to avail itself of the opportunity to obtain money for housing from the Commonwealth Savings Bank before the conclusion of this financial year. Its only regret, I am assured, is that it will not have an opportunity of availing itself to a greater extent of the facilities provided for home building. Nearly every home building authority in Australia agrees that the provisions of the act are desirable, and that it meets cases with which it has not been possible to deal up to the present time. I now come to the charge which has been made that this act is going to do something to defeat the War Service Homes Act. The honourable member for Reid says that we are going to provide Â£20,000,000 under this scheme, yet Ave have cut doAvn the Avar service doing nothing. have already built 1,455 war service homes, and 704 more will be completed. That is a substantial con^ tribution to the home building that is being carried on in Australia. WhatI pointed out before, however, and AvhatI now repeat, is that the money for Avar service homes is obtained from a different source altogether from that for which the money which will be used under this scheme will be obtained. The money for this home building scheme Avill be obtained from the Commonwealth Savings Bank. Only a small percentage of the funds of the savings banks throughout Australia was being used for the purpose of building homes, and an especially small percentage of the funds of the Commonwealth Savings Bank was being used for this purpose. One of the objects of the original bill was to ensure that a greater proportion of those funds should be used for this purpose. The savings of the people Avill be utilized for home building, and the money obtained from that source will be supplemented by other funds raised by the Government. The money used for building war service homes, however, is obtained from the public loans of the Commonwealth. The war service homes authorities do not draAv money from the CommonAvealth Savings Bank, the funds of which are under the control of the directors of that institution. this money come from loans? ment get its Â£20,000,000 ? will not all be spent in one year.

It has been said that we are reducing the total amount of money spent -On war service homes. -amount spent over the last five years on war service homes has been from -Â£1,700,000 to Â£1,800,000. This year it was proposed to spend Â£1,748,000. has been found, as the result of many years' experience by the ""War Service Homes Department, which is operating in certain States through the Government Savings Bank or home building authorities of the States, that there is a certain definite number of homes which can be built with the maximum efficiency, the minimum cost, aud the least dislocation of labour and market conditions. That number is being increased each year. The Minister pointed out the difficulty which was already being experienced in finding draftsmen for this work, and the efforts that were being made to ensure that soldiers should be employed.' Even then it was found necessary to obtain juniors from the technical colleges in order to help out the work. There is no reason for the suggestion that anything is being done which will retard the amount of war service homes building that can be done this year. It is worthwhile examining just what is the exact cause of the delay in the erection of war service homes. First of all, it has been found that it is wise to have three months' work in band in order to make certain that the staff can be kept going, both on the houses themselves, and in the offices charged with the administration of the work. It has been found also that there are a certain number of cases which will have to be carried over for some time, and that makes it impossible for the War Service Homes Department to proceed with the erection of all the homes first applied for before any others are built. The commission considers it necessary always to have under construction in New month, so as to keep its staff engaged to its fullest capacity. present time in New South Wales there are 140 cases under consideration.

This is a complete reply to the statement by the ' honourable member for Yarra. The complaint which the honourable member made with respect to the deletion of sub-sections 3 and 4 of section 10 of the principal act, can, I think, be dealt with more returned satisfactorily in committee.

Labour party wishes to do is to allow the workers to own their own homes. They know that a man who owns his own home is impervious to the pernicious doctrines promulgated ibyi-some honourable members opposite. A basic difference between the Nationalist party and the Labour party is that, while the former desires to enable men to own the freehold of their own homes, the Labour party has always opposed their doing so. Every writer on socialism states that once a man becomes the owner of the freehold of the block of land on which his house is built, he rids himself of his socialistic ideas. The Nationalist party has a legitimate interest in providing homes for the people. The clause before the committee has no objectionable features. reason why a man should not own two houses. If the possession of two homes is something to be deplored, let honourable members opposite say so. If , by the sweat of his brow, or by reason of his brains, a man can secure two houses, let him get them, because the community will be the better for it. I strongly support the clause as it stands.

No guarantee is given that the provisions of the bill will not be used to allow applicants to build two or more houses, provided that those applying for loans have discharged all obligation in respect of previous loans. I take it that this scheme is based on the principle of working-men's homes that are provided on the rent-paying system. If The last thing that the that is not so, the Government is not carrying out the promises that it made to the people at the last election. If the scheme is to be used to enable an applicant to build semi-detached cottages, it is a wonder that the honourable member for Warringah does not advocate the building of terraces of houses. But there are not many semi-detached cottages in Warringah, arid when the honourable member charged the Labour party with not wanting workmen to own their own homes, he was merely indulging in the "" sob stuff"" with which his party wins elections. The honourable member's party has not placed a genuine issue before the people at any election of which I know. I shall certainly vote against the There is no clause, unless it is clearly provided that all applicants for one home will be satisfied before any person is assisted in acquiring a second home.

Clause4 (Power of Commonwealth to borrow moneys to grant to Savings Bank). Br, EARLE PAGE (Cowper-Trea surer) [9.47] -This clause deals with the provision of a sinking fund. Honourable members may remember that when we were considering the original bill I informed them that the State Savings Bank of Victoria desired that any money which wasloaned to them for the purpose of carrying out a housing scheme should be for a fixed term, say twenty years, at the end of which time the f u l l amount would be repaid to the Commonwealth Savings Bank. .Provision was then made for the establishment of a sinking, fund covering a period of twenty years, and for the .loan operations to be conducted in such a manner that when repayments were made to the State authority by borrowers the money could be used afresh in the erection of additional homes in the manner which is adopted by the Commonwealth with respect to War Service Homes repayments, The New South Wales Savings Bank,however, said that it would prefer to make repayments to the Commonwealth Bank as it received them from its clients, and to have a fresh transaction in connection with loans for future building operations. The matter was discussed by theSavings Bank authorities of the .Commonwealth and the States, with a view to making the provision sufficiently elastic to embrace any method of repayment that .might be suggested by the dif* ferent authorities. The Commonwealth desired to retain as much as possible of the Avording of the original act, and asked the Crown Law authorities to suggest a form of words that would meet the position. I must confess that the first result of monAvealth Savings Bank, in anticipation their efforts Avas unintelligible to me and the Treasury officials. We felt that there was a possibility of the language being misconstrued, because Ave could not say that it conveyed the meaning which Avas intended. Eventually the form which has noAv been adopted was suggested, making the matter one of agreement between the Treasurer and the Commonwealth Savings Bank. Accordingly, it is proposed to omit sub-sections 3 and -4 of section 10 of the principal act apd to insert in their stead other snb-seGtions. one of which reads3. Advances made in pursuance of the last preceding sub-section shall bear such rate of interest and be subject to such terms and conditions of repayment as are agreed upon between the Treasurer and the Savings Bank. It -was felt that the relations between the Treasurer and the CommonAveaith Sayings Bank would always be such as would ensure that the bank would receive thg money at the rate at which it was raised, A certain amount of difficulty attaches to the certification of the rate by the Auditor-General, because money might be loaned to the bank .several months prior to its being raised, and considerable feeling or differences of opinion might be engendered if there should be an alteration in the rates and either the Treasury or the bank considered that it was not being treated properly. separate agreement Avith each State? deal only with the Commonwealth Savings Bank. Repayments by that institution Avill be made directly tp the national debt sinking fund, because they come under the head of "" recoArerable moneys."" Consequently, there is no possibility of an avoidance of any obligation. In addition to the provision that I have explained, it is proposed thatPonding the borrowing of money in pursuance of this act, the Treasurer may, from time to time, advance to the Savings Bank, out of any moneys in tlie Commonwealth Public Account,gums not exceeding the moneys which the Treasurer is authorized to borrow in pursuance of this a.ct. The object of that provision is to enable the Treasurer to lend certain revenue moneys, if they are required by the Comof the flotation of a loan. I trust that I have explained the position to the satisfaction of honourable members. Treasurer has explained tbe reason for the proposed change, but I fail to see what justification there is for it.

It was submitted that it was necessary for the State authorities almost at once to know the rate of interest they were to be charged; that as some of the money made available to them would come out of revenue, some from deposits in the savings bank, and some out of loans which might not at the actual moment have been raised, it was necessary to arrive at some means whereby we might closely approximate the position, although we might not in every case get the absolute amount of interest that it cost. After considering the matter very fully, including arguments identical with those used by honourable members to-night, the directors of the Commonwealth Bank, the Treasury, and the law officers of the Crown agreed that the method now proposed would be absolutely the best to adopt; because it would which the Commonwealth and the States give a certain amount of elasticity, while at the same time the position would be amply safeguarded. It would be almost impossible to find forms of words intelligible to honourable members and at the same time not capable of being misconstrued, to cover all the circumstances that might arise. I quite agree with the contention put forevery day, and they are easily settled by ward by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin), but I am prepared to let the matter go because the Auditor General will not be absolutely shut out by the amendment. If the Treasury, or the Commonwealth Savings Bank, makes a mistake, I have not the slightest doubt the Auditor-General will have no hesitation in calling either of them to book for it. I see no reason for the proposed alteration, and I support the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in his attitude; but we have this pleasing feature that in the final analysis the Auditor-General, in his capacity as policeman over the public finances, will come down with the lash if errors are made. I shall not press the matter further; the responsibility rests with the Treasurer. ordinary individual would say that the the services of an unbiased individual like the Auditor-General, who is controlled not by the Government but by Parliament, and whose sole interest it is to see that the assets of the Commonwealth are preserved, and that injustice is done to no one. We have already had instances of money advanced by the Commonwealth to the States for land purchases being lost, and we do not want any repetition of that in connection with the present housing scheme. The proposal in the original bill displayed the aptitude of the Treasurer to deal with, transactions of this character, but now one would imagine that the provision he seeks to amend was inserted in the original measure for amusement. Any one associated with a commercial enterprise will admit that the best means of preventing friction is to. leave the decision of a difficulty to an arbitrator; but the provision for the appointment of an arbitrator in an important matter in are concerned is now to be deleted, and the decision is to be left to the Government of the day, which may deal with it in a way that it thinks will prove of advantage to its own party. Disputes may arise as to what allowance should be made for depreciation. The whole thing is bristling with difficulties. But similar difficulties occur in the commercial world the appointment of an arbitrator. I doubt whether the Government can interfere with the Auditor-General in this matter since it is his duty to audit all Government accounts. I see no reason for this amendment. The Treasurer has been very badly advised. I am sure he will live to regret his present proposal. Clause agreed to. Title agreed to. Bill reported without amendment.
