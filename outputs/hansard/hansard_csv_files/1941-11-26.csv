For the same Anthony) on the 19th November, 1941, regarding an application for an increase of the price of butter was referred to the Commonwealth Prices Commissioner, who has informed me that the decision not to permit an increase at present was reached after a careful examination of particulars assembled by a sub-committee appointed by Commonwealth Dairy Produce Equalization Committee Limited, which sponsored the application. The main argument upon which the mean, however, that some costs of repairs applicants relied was that costs of proand renewals have not increased since the duction of butter have increased since the war, because it is fully recognized that outbreak of war. This argument was they have. supported by evidence purporting to show that the average eost of production of butter during the last five years was by the Commonwealth Dairy Produce higher than the price received for Equalization Committee Limited, which domestic sales.

The Average annual restate of affairs existing in the industry cannot be attributed to circumstances Average avising from the present war. It has existed for years.

Any change of the capital value of herds or equipment as a whole since the outbreak of war would be due only to changes up or down of the profitability of the industry, and it can therefore be assumed that the investment in the industry since the outbreak of war is no different from what it was before the war.

21,Mr Peost,"The answers to the honBren gun carriers, or whether any large contracts had been let to private firms for the purpose of increasing production. On that occasion I gave the honourable member an outline of the position in regard to the manufacture of these carriers. 1 now wish to inform the honourable member that the Commonwealth Government factories are not, and never have been, concerned with the production of this equipment. At the present time there are four assembly contractors, namely, the Victorian Bailways Workshops, Newport, Victoria; the Metropolitan Gas Company, Melbourne, Victoria; the South Australian Railways Workshops, Islington, South Australia; and the Ford Motor Company, Sydney, New South Wales, and these are fed by numerous contractors for component parts in various States of the Commonwealth. With a view to co-ordinating the operations of the assembly contractors and the contractors for component parts, and to facilitate further decentralization, negotiations are proceeding for the appointment of a co-ordinating authority, who will operate under the Armoured Fighting Vehicles Division of my department and through the Boards of Area Management of the various States. In the near future I hope to be able to announce the arrangements made regarding the co-ordinating authority. Air, upon noticej .

If expensive quarters are being rented in Sydney, Melbourne and otlier capitals, does he propose to continue their use? honourable member's questions are a3 follows:I . Nn billeting is arranged by the Royal Australian A i r Force, but numbers of Royal Australian A i r Force personnel serving at such establishments as head-quarters, owing to nonavailability of service accommodation, "" l i v e o u t "" and receive special lodging and ration allowances. As theso arrangements operate in all States, some little delay will ensue in collating f u l l costs, but as soon'as those figures are available, I w ill advise the honourable member. 2. No. Properties have been secured as offices at Point Piper, Sydney, at a rental of £12 a week for No. 2 Training Group Headquarters, and at Toorak, Melbourne, rent free, rates only being payable, for No. 1 Training Group Head-quarters. _ 3 and 4.

If it is regarded as practicable, w ill the Government give effect to those proposals so far as they affect Australia? 4. Is the Australian export of drug plants or of the manufactured product of such plants increasing? 5. What is the present value of such export as compared with the value of such -export in pre-war years? honourable member's questions are as follows:1. Yes. 2 and 3. Investigations have already been initiated into the possibilities of medicinal drug cultivation in Australia. Early in 1040 the Medical Equipment Control Committee directed attention to the importance of drug plants in Australia.

43,Mr Lazzarini,"The Minister for themade in many other places. This sort of talk, which is justified, has more to do with the difficulty of recruiting men for the fighting services than anything else that could be said. Aliens should not be allowed to own one stick of property until they have sworn allegiance to our King. Anj'body who allows them to do so is not acting in the best interests of the nation and the Empire as a whole. Therefore, I hope that this Government will stop their operations, if the State Governments will not do so. [8.6] I wish to make representations to the Minister for the Army( Mr Forde) in-particular, and to the Minister for the Navy( Mr Makin) and the Minister for Air( Mr Drakeford), regarding the notification of fatal casualties to parents of members of the fighting forces. This matter has caused grave dissatisfaction in a number of places, chiefly in country districts. In the cities, it may be easy for notification of deaths on active service to be given directly to the bereaved parents. But the position is calamitous in rural districts where notifications are sometimes delayed for days. I know of an instance at Orroroo in which the telegram notifying a couple of their son's death did not come into their hands until two days after it had been received at the post office. This sort of thing should not be allowed to happen. When a fatal casualty occurs the intimation should go direct to the parents, even if this should involve sending a special messenger into the country. The least that we can do, when a member of our fighting services is killed, is to notify his parents first. 1 brought this matter to the notice of the Minister for the Army on another occasion, and he said that the formation of local committees had been suggested, but that these had failed to operate. That being so, the Government should take a hand in the matter, and remove all causes of delay. I express my thanks to the Prime Minister( Mr Curtin) for the kind reference which he made to myself. T thank honourable members on both sides of the chamber for the generous support. which they have consistently given to the Chair during the twelve months in which I have had the good fortune to occupy the position of Speaker. I am very much indebted to them, because it is due to their good taste that I have been able to maintain order in this House. I also express thanks on behalf of the Chairman of Committees ( Mr Prowse), and on behalf of the Clerk, the Clerk Assistant, and other officers of the chamber, members of tbe Hansard staff and the press. I join with the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Fadden) in the sentiment which he expressed in regard to this occasion. We all can enjoy the sense of expectation which we feel when Christinas is in the offing. My only regret is that our happiness cannot be shared in full measure by our kinsmen who are fighting our battles abroad. Question resolved in the affirmative.

45,Mr Speaker (Hon. W. M. Nairn).,"respect to the employment or unemployment of miners, owing to the acute shortage of man-power. It seems to me that this is purely a fractious strike, and it is no better than blood-sucking, moneydisloyal to the Prime Minister( Mr lending institutions to describe themCurtin), who already has enough burdens on his shoulders without more being piled on top of them. It is also treacherous to the war effort of the Commonwealth. I do not blame the Government, nor do I suggest that it may be able to do anything to alter the position; but it is well known that, in the last war, some of the largest percentages of enlistments were obtained amongst the miners of this country. It is up to the miners themselves to remove from their own trade unions and other organizations those who are responsible for action which is harmful to the Commonwealth in its war effort. The report that I have quoted stated that the majority of the 1,000 men were prepared to go down the mine. The loyal elements in the industry should do nothing that would injure their fellow men among the fighting services overseas. Everybody knows that there is an acute shortage of coal, which is essential in the production of munitions of war, and is also required for our ships. I appeal to the miners, and to the leaders of the trade unions, to stand behind the Government and help it to carry on a maximum war effort. I draw the attention of the House to what has taken place in a purely fractious strike, which was, to repeat the words of the Attorney General, "" utterly bad and utterly mad "". I bring to the notice of the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) what appears to me to be an omission from the National Security (War-time Banking) Regulations issued last night. Recently, I submitted a question in the Hou3e with regard to the limitation of the use of the title ""bank"", and asked the Treasurer whether he would apply such a limitation, but I notice that there is no such provision in the regulations. I referred recently ing for, but I am not going to ask anyto a certain institution which advertises itself as an industrial bank, and claims that it brings personal banking service to the people of Australia. Apparently, according to its own advertisement, it renders this service at low rates of interest, but if one takes the trouble to work out the rate, it amounts to 26 per cent. I believe that it is the duty of the Government to limit the use of the word "" bank"", and not allow bodies which are selves as banking establishments. week or so ago I asked a question in the House regarding the purchase of property by refugees. Some misunderstanding has occurred over the matter, and I have been attacked by certain people on the ground that I have made a discourteous reference to them. I stated that one could pick out the individuals to whom I referred by certain physical characteristics; but the refugees whom I had in mind were not necessarily Jews. Many of them want to purchase property at Point Piper, Rose Bay, Dover Heights and Clovelly. I was thinking of the many persons who are alleged to have left Germany as refugees. Some of them are, I think, the agents of Hitler, and may be found in Sydney and other capital cities of Australia. Certain persons in Sydney are to-day telling women that there will be a new religion in this country before we are much older. This is confirmed by statements made in other parts of the world by men who are not irresponsible. I hope that as soon as possible the Government will investigate this matter. The Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Ward) has certain information that I have placed in his possession, and he probably knows a great deal more about unnaturalized aliens who are buying up property in Sydney. In Sydney last week-end 1 rode on a tramcar on which there was a young returned soldier, who said that he had seen service in the first Libyan campaign, and in Greece and Crete. He was crippled and sent back to Australia. In the tram he was talking so that anybody who wished could listen to him. He said, "" I believe that Australia is worth fightbody to fight for it unless the Government will stop these aliens from buying homes and renting them at exorbitant rates to soldiers' wives whose husbands are overseas "". That is a serious statement for any man to make, particularly a man wearing the King's uniform. Doubtless similar statements are being",19,Papers

Battaglia's solicitors for £10,000. Before the w r it was issued Smith's Weekly published in its Queensland edition a photograph of the Queensland Blackshirts, the central figure of the group being Dr. Battaglia. Smith's Weekly was cited for contempt of court, notwithstanding that publication preceded the service of the writ . The newspaper was fined £25 and it was involved in legal costs amounting to more than £300. I ask the Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt) to imagine what would happen to any Australian subject in It a l y ference. In to-day's Sydney Telegraph who dared to question at the present time the right of an Italian newspaper to charge him with being an enemy alien. Tbe result of such an action would probably be certain death; but, in this country, an enemy alien has moved the courts and obtained a verdict against the proprietors of an Australian newspaper. I contend that a grave injustice has been done. I hope that the Attorney-General will have the matter investigated, particularly as to whether compensation can be paid to the newspaper. While the Prime Minister( Mr Curtin) is inquiring into the matter of Mr W. J. Smith's horse-float, about which the honourable member for M a r t in ( Mr McCall) has waxed eloquent, will he also arrange with the Minister for Munitions ( MrM a k in ) for the appointment of an officer in his department to inquire as to whether Defence job No. P.420 at Australian Consolidated Industries Limited, at Waterloo, Sydney, concerning the making of a rotary swaging machine to be used in manufacturing shells, was held up on Thursday of last week because a blacksmith was too busy making fittings for horse-boxes to take Reading and other racehorses to America? If the facts are found to be as stated, w ill the Prime Minister insist that defence jobs in the annexe of Australian Consolidated In dustries Limited shall be given priority over the making of horse-boxes ? On the 25th November, 1 asked the M i nister for Labour and National Service( Mr Ward) whether his attention had been drawn to a statement published in the Maitland Mercury, of the 22nd SepThis tember, to the effect that more than 2,000 miners were expected to retire next January under the miners' pensions scheme of New South Wales, and whether, in view of the shortage of coal and the serious lack of rnan-power, the Minister thought that the continued employment of those miners would be of greater assistance to the war effort than their compulsory retirement. I asked him to discuss the matter with the Minister for Minesi n New South Wales. He said that he would be pleased to do so, and would advise me of the result of the conappears the following report:1,000 MEN STOP WORK. Cessnock, Wednesday. Nearly 1,000 mine workers were idle to-day wlien stoppages occurred at Aberdare and Abcrdare Central collieries. The stoppage at Aberdare Central colliery followed a protest against the statement made by Mr Abbott, M.H.R. (CP., N.S.W.), that the 2,000 mine workers due for retirement under the miners' pension scheme should be kept on iu view of the shortage of coal and of man-power. After discussing the position at the pit-head the men decided to go to work. There was a move towards the shaft-head, but the men who had advocated the declaration of a protest stoppage banded in their lamps, indicating they did not intend to go below. As they left the pit, others were compelled to follow. Tbe Aberdare stoppage followed a dispute over payment for breaking up top coal. A conference has been arranged to deal with tlie dispute. Recently, the Attorney-General( D r . Evatt) described the sit-down strike at the Wallarah colliery, south of Newcastle, as "" u t t e r l y bad and utterly mad"" . Referring to the strike at the Aberdare Central colliery I did not suggest in my question that the 2,000 miners should be prevented from retiring next January, but I asked the Minister for Labour and National Servicef o r his opinion with regard to the matter.

48,Mr Abbott (New England) [7.57],"letter from Mr W. E . 'Curie, of Belmoreroad, Punchbowl, to The Century newspaper :Sir, I have read in the newspapers a question by Mr Calwell, asking the Prime Minister who paid for the telegram which was sent to bim ou the question of the horse float which was built for Mr W. J. Smith. As one of the men who did a lot of work on this job, I wish to state that the telegram was prepared in the shop by the men themselves, who had a meeting to discuss the matter, and was signed by 47 of the men who worked on the float. 1 send you for proof the original signed copy, which has the signatures of the men themselves. 1 can also state that a collection was taken up amongst us to pay the cost of the telegram to Mr Curtin. I ask you to publish this letter in order that our case may be made public, as we have no other way of getting ourselves heard on the matter. The men concerned are very resentful at the suggestion that the wire they sent in defence of themselves was paid for by the management. tn view of that letter, the authenticity of the telegram cannot be questioned. My only reason for directing the attention of the Prime Minister to that telegram was to show that the publicity which has been given to the building of the horse float for Mr Smith did him an injustice. The inference from the original question asked by the honourable member for Watson( Mr Fal.stein) was that the horse float, which was built by those 47 men, was comparable with a pleasure yacht, and that men had been taken off defence work in order to construct it , whereas the purpose for which the horse-float was built was to assist in the development of a primary industry which will bring to this country thousands of pounds worth of dollar exchange, namely, the export of thoroughbred horses to the United States of America. In view of the fact that, owing to the necessity to conserve our supply of dollars, we have had to ration the public and private use of petrol and to prohibit altogether the importation of certain articles from the United States of America, an industry which, through the sale of our thoroughbred stock to the United States of America, dollar exchange, is a national asset. Before the thoroughbreds from Mr W. J . Smith's stud at Scone can be shipped overseas, they have to bo brought to Sydney, a distance of 200 miles, ancl, for that purpose, a vehicle for transportation is necessary. Hence the construction of a horse float at the works of Australian Consolidated Industries Limited. The stir which followed the question asked by the honourable member for Watson has cau -ed consternation amongst other manufacturers in Australia because many of them engage in manufacture of two kinds, one the manufacture of munitions and other defence requirements, and the other the manufacture of luxury or semi-luxury lines, for example, refrigerators and washing machines. Some firms engaged in the manufacture of that sort of equipment have had annexes erected for the manufacture of armaments because they have the machinery and skilled artisans with which to build articles of war which the Commonwealth needs. Of the total production of one firm 44 per cent, consists of goods required for war purposes; about the same ratio would apply to a large number of other firms. Once the skilled men have finished what they have to do in the manufacture of the specific articles of munitions which the employing firm is manufacturing, they are transferred to the production of articles which it normally would be producing for the whole of the time, namely goods of a luxury or a semi-luxury character. That firm is f u l filling 100 per cent, of the defence orders which have been given to it . If the skilled fitters and turners were not provided with work of a civil character after they had finished all that they could possibly do on the defence work they would have nothing to do. I next direct the attention of the Government to an injustice which has been done to Smith's Weekly, Australia's national newspaper. The case of D r . Battaglia must be unprecedented in legal annals. This is a case of British justice stretched in a one-sided way to extraordinary lengths. In its anxiety to be fair to a plaintiff of enemy origin, Smith's Weekly suffered injustice in a previously increases our supply of unheard of way. The facts are that D r . Battaglia, head of the Fascist organization in Queensland, was interned i m mediately upon Italy's making war on France, and automatically on B r it a in . by no means friendly review of Dr. Jauncey's book, be saysThe soldiers were right. I voted for conscription, but I doubt whether I should do so again. No issues except defence against invasion will ever be clear enough to enable us to compel people to fight. That review is published in Pacific Affairs for 193C, page 594. These statements tend to show that in the opinion of the soldiers, whatever attitude was taken by the men in troop transports and in camps, and those who, although enlisted men, were doing civilian duty in England, the men who were doing the actual fighting voted against conscription. has cited only three authorities. only three authorities because my time is limited. In any case, I do not think that the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr believed that a majority of the troops actually Fadden) was at the front, and I cannot see that he is competent to express an opinion. On the 3rd November, 1916, the Government promulfrated a regulation forbidding anyone to say how the soldiers voted. That was actually after the effect of the soldiers' vote was known in this country. The regulation was Statutory Rule' 1916, No. 213, and the relevant provision wasNo person shall publicly announce, publish, or exhibit any figures or alleged facts as to the results of the voting by(a) members of the forces serving beyond Australia or having returned from such service: or (6) members of the crews of Australian transport vessels employed in the conveyance of members of the forces to or from Australia, at the referendum held under <the Military Service Referendum Act 1010. Under that regulation, prosecutions were launched against a Mr Holland and a Miss Cecilia John, in Melbourne. Mr about a telegram forwarded by 47 emH . E. Starke, of the Victorian bar-no w Mr Justice Starke defended Mr dustries Limited in which they gave their Holland and Miss John, and examined the then Commonwealth Electoral Officer for Victoria, Mr Lawson. From Mr facture a horse float for Mr W. J. Smith. Lawson it was elicited that persons doing civilian duties abroad had been entitled to vote because they had actually enlisted for active service. Greater precautions were taken at the 1917 referendum, when the soldiers overseas recorded a majority of 1,622. My authority is a statement made by the Commonwealth Chief Electoral Officer of that time, Mr Oldham, and published on the l l t h January, 1918, in the Melbourne Argus, and, I presume, in other metropolitan papers. that statement. my unsupported word against that of the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes), who was Prime Minister at the time. Al l I say is that my statements were taken from official figures. [Extension of time granted.] I quote from volume 5, page 22, of Dr. Bean's Official History of Australia in the War of 1914-1S' The soldiers' vote taken about the l l t h December under arrangements made by administrative head-quarters in London was slightly more favorable than in 1910; it is iu the front was against the measure, but that the vote from the camps and the transports turned the scale and produced a slight majority of soldiers in favour. In a statement made by the then Chief Electoral Officer, Mr Oldham, on the 10th January, 1918, and published in the Argus, and, I presume, other daily newspapers, on the l l t h January, the figures showed that, of the soldiers actually overseas, which would include every member of the Forces overseas, whether at the time on active service or not, there was a majority of 1,622 for conscription. Of the soldiers on transports, tbere was a small majority against conscription, and of the soldiers who had not left Australia, there was a majority of about three to one in favour of conscription.

The Minister replied that he had no truth in what the honourable gentleman information, and addedI t is quite obvious that the publication of this information is entirely a matter for the unimpeachable testimony of Dr. C. E. W. Commonwealth Government and not a matter Bean. Dr. Bean was a supporter of confor the Government here. Incidentally that occurred before the in his references to the campaign, he gives Prime Minister of Australia had given an objective account of what occurred. the answer that I have read earlier. In volume 3 at page S92 he saysAgain, on the 20th December, the day after the Prime Minister had replied to part of the force, including practically all the Mr Joseph Cook, Mr King asked the ofliccrs, most of the non-commissioned ollicrrs, Secretary of State for the ColoniesWhether he will ask the Australian Government to publish as soon as possible the actual numbers of soldiers voting for and against conscription ? The Secretary of State( Mr Long) repliedNo, sir; this is entirely a matter for the discretion of tlie Commonwealth Government. That is at page 1423 of the volume of the Parliamentary DebatesI have just quoted from. Although the referendum was completed on the 28th October, 1916, it was not until the 27th March, 1917, the day after Parliament had been dissolved and an election campaign had been commenced, that the figures were published. When they were announced it appeared that a majority of the soldiers had voted for conscription. I shall deal with that later. Had there been a majority for conscription, it would not have been very remarkable in view of the way in which the referendum was taken. The Commonwealth Electoral Office was not in charge of the referendum in 1916. The persons who had control of it were appointed by the Government of the day and no provision was made for the scrutiny of the votes by independent scrutineers at the poll. In 1917, the poll was taken under the direction of the Commonwealth Electoral Office, and on that occasion provision was made for scrutineers appointed by each party to examine the votes. Again it has been made to appear that the result favoured conscription. I come now to the opinion that was expressed by people who knew the facts at the time. It indicates that the votes of the soldiers actually on active service says. scription, and, although he reveals that As a matter of fact the more responsible and at least half of the men, was iu favour of conscription. But the hope of securing the desired resolutions vanished. The polling, which had begun on the Kith October as the units reached the villages behind the limvi, was quickly completed. The vote of the Australian Imperial Force was found to he in favour of conscription, but only by 72,;ifl9 against 5S.S94; and it was understood that it was tlie men on transports and in camps rather than those actually at the front, who were responsible for the excess of the "" Yes"" vote. That opinion has been supported by other authorities, to some of which I shall refer. It was supported in the British Australasian, a well-known journal published in England, and circulating amongst Australians in England as well as in this country. Reference to that naper is made in Dr. L. C. Jauncey's book, The Story of Conscription in Australia. Dr. Jauncey holds an American degree, but he is a South Australian. He was in Australia at the time of the conscription campaign, and wrote his book in Australia. The book quotes at, page 239 the following passage from the British Australasian:It is too soon yet to say whether the voice of Australia has said a final "" Xo"" to conscription, but it will be surprising if the votes yet to come counterbalance the adverse majority. Certainly the votes of Australian soldiers abroad will not do it. That was the opinion of an Australian writing in England. Among the Australians who were overseas at the time of the campaign was our present Minister to China, Sir Frederic Eggleston, who enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force as a private. He was definitely a conscriptionist at that time, and in a",23,Papers

Without victory, our democratic institutions will perish. As a vigilant and its allies and the cause of liberty, and to virile Opposition, we shall expound constructive views. Every observer will have noted in recent weeks what can be accomplished by compromise. Anomalies which have been exposed in legislation during the debate have been referred to special committees upon which all parties were represented, and those unsatisfactory provisions were suitably amended. The country should be grateful for what has been accomplished in this respect. I join with the Prime Minister in extending to you, Mr Speaker, our best wishes for a restful recess; and on behalf no definite statement about the result of the Opposition, I thank members of the parliamentary staffs for their services to us.

To-night, I feel like a schoolboy who has waited long and eagerly for the vacation. I hope to enjoy the respite from parliamentary duty and to resume in the new year my humble contribution to the conduct of the affair.; of the country. I regret that I have to ask the House to grant me indulgence to speak of a controversial matter which does not usually arise when Parliament is about to adjourn for the Christmas recess. A controversy took place recently upon the soldiers' vote in the conscription campaigns of 1916 and 1917. As their decision then is being now treated as relerepliedvant to the question, and as the decision of the soldiers is relied upon by the conMilitary Authorities preclude me from doing scriptionists and the anti-conscriptionists so. of to-day, I shall outline to the House, as concisely as I can, what appear to me to be valid reasons for believing that the soldiers actually on active service in the last war voted on both occasions against conscription. The first referendum was taken in Australia on the 2Sth October, 1916, but voting began overseas on the 16th October. Before the poll in this country, a manifesto issued by the Prime Minister called upon the soldiers to l if t up their voices and send one mighty shout across the leagues of ocean, bidding their fellow citizens to do their duty to the Empire, vote "" yes"". Notwithstanding that, so soon as the 28th October had passed there was a general belief in Australia that the soldiers overseas had voted against conscription, and that belief was confirmed by statements of persons in authority who should have known the facts, that "" the ANZACs had turned them down "". This opinion was further confirmed by the curious reluctance of the Government of the day to make any statement on the matter. Although the poll closed on the 2Sth October, 1916, both in Australia and abroad, could be obtained from the Government. Both in the Parliament of the Commonwealth and in the House of Commons, questions seeking information on the subject were directed to Ministers. The he was precluded by instructions from England from divulging the result of the soldiers' vote. appear to have been correct. On the 19th December, 1916, I quote from LTansard, volume LXXX . , page 10216, Mr Joseph Cook askedIs the Prime Minister aware that conflicting statements have been made concerning the way in which the soldiers at the front voted on the compulsory service referendum, and is it nol possible to set the matter at rest by making public the details of the voting? The Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) I should be very glad to make such a return public did not a request from the Imperial Both before and after that date the Secretary of State for the Colonies in the House of Commons was asked similar questions.

As this session has been devoted predominantly to financial matters, the House will not mind my paying a special tribute to the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) for the way in which he has handled his very important and complicated work. that the very great labour falling to the Treasurer would have been too great a task for one man.

We have no sense now of defeatism. The spirit of victory pulses strongly through all the democratic countries, and is as vibrant in the Commonwealth as it is in any other part of the Empire, because the issues that are at stake have appealed to the men and women of this country from the day that the conflict commenced. They will remain clearly before our eyes until the war is ended; and it will not be ended until the cause of free men and free women is recognized the world over. Leader of the Opposition) [7.24],I support the remarks just made by the Prime Minister( Mr Curtin). The Opposition appreciates the difficulties that confront the Government to-day. I did not have an opportunity to congratulate the Minister for External Affairs (Dr. Evatt) upon his review of the international situation, which I consider he placed very admirably and clearly before this chamber to-day. I now congratulate him upon that fact, and express the hope that we shall have greater opportunities in the future to discuss the international affairs. Australians must realize that we cannot look at this matter wholly through our own glasses. We must appreciate not only that we are part and parcel of the British Empire but also that we stand as a nation in our own right. I realize and, I am sure, every honourable member realizes that even today a certain section of the Australian community lacks a sense of responsibility as to just what this war means. Nothing else counts except the winning of the war. If we can come out of this conflict with our title deeds intact, and unencumbered by obligations to a foreign power, we shall be very fortunate. Members of the Opposition have criticized the budget proposals, but as responsible members, and as trustees of the Australian people, we realize that the war method which the Government has chosen for distributing those sacrifices. We consider that a more equitable distribution of our inevitable burdens should be made; but our conviction in that respect must that we are a united people. In this House we have one objective, and that is to win the war. The ways and means decided upon by the Government to achieve that objective may be open to debate; but only one thing counts, and that is to maintain our system of democratic parliamentary government.",25,Papers

Minister) [7.16] in reply Having regard to the position abroad, it is not easy at this stage to indicate the date on which Parliament will be called together. I have in mind the fact that the work of Parliament will be facilitated if the joint committees are enabled to conclude their inquiries so that their reports can be considered by Cabinet and, if necessary, made the basis of proposed legislation. I have reason to believe that the work of those committees has been considerably handicapped recently by the irregularity of the sittings of Parliament. They have not been able to make a continuous investigation of their respective subjects. I expect that in the ordinary course of events we may come together somewhere about the middle of March.

72,Mr Curtin (Fremantle,"Prim eI t was proposed to discontinue the practice of allowing as deductions in arriving at taxable income calls paid on shares in mining companies. This proposal was examined by a special committee, which recommendedThat a deduction for calls in raining companies should not be allowed as a deduction .in arriving at taxable income, but that a rebate of tax on the amount of calls paid should be allowed in the taxpayer's assessment calculated at one-third of the rate of tax imposed for the financial year on tlie taxable income. This recommendation was adopted by the Government, and the law has been accordingly amended by Parliament. This means that the value of the tax concession on mining calls will be approximately the same as the concession which was enjoyed before the war. Owing to these amendments, the budget estimate of revenue from income tax must be reduced by £1,000,000. The loss of revenue for a full assessment year would also be about £1,000,000. The Government had proposed that the war-time company tax should be amended to provide for a statutory percentage of 4 per cent., and that the commencing rate of tax should be 6 per cent., increasing by steps of 6 per cent, until a maximum rate of 78 per cent, is reached on the taxable profit in excess of 16 per cent, on capital employed. The Government accepted an amendment submitted by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Fadden) that the statutory percentage should be 5 per cent, in lieu of 4 per cent. This amendment was approved by Parliament. Accordingly, the commencing rate of tax will now be 6 per cent., progressing by 6 per cent, steps for every 1 per cent, on capital employed by which profits are in excess of the statutory percentage of 5 per cent, on capital employed until a maximum rate of 7S per cent, is reached on the taxable profit in excess of 17 per cent, on capital employed. This amendment will reduce the revenue which it was expected to gain in 1941-42 from the war-time company tax by £S00,000. The loss of revenue in a full assessment year will be £950,000. The estimated total revenue from wartime company tax for 1941-42 will now be £4,600,000 in lieu of £5,400,000. The effect of these alterations is to reduce the estimated revenue for 1941-42 by £1,800,000, viz.:Estimate ot 2Uth Revised October, Reduction.

The cause of shortages in all cases is the enormous and urgent demands on Australia for defence purposes. I u these circumstances, it is impossible to allow merchants or manufacturers to buy for stock. Supplies to the trade are, in fact, rationed, with allowances for normal seasonal fluctuations. This season, the normal requirements for hay baling wire were exceeded, and special action had to be taken to increase supplies iu some States. Fencing wire is in short supply also, and longer notice than is usually needed may have to be given to merchants for unusual supplies. The practice with nail wire is to furnish manufacturers with quantities based on their pre-war usage, and to supplement those quantities when there is justification, but it is impossible for manufacturers to fulfil merchant orders for stocks. Defence contractors have priority rights over the nails available, and some inconvenience is inevitable on occasion when builders and others cannot obtain nails on demand, as in peacetime. In some localities, owing to very heavy local demands, there have been temporary shortages of some of these products for an essential purpose, but the department, through its officers in each State, endeavours to fill such gaps as quickly as possible. I should like to add that what I have that the Government was prepared to said in respect of the articles mentioned set up a small committee to devise a applies generally throughout the whole formula to mitigate any hardship that field of controlled materials, including might arise from double taxation.

Certain amendments to the proposals relating to taxation have been made by Parliament. I shall briefly summarize these amendments, and show their effect on the budget for 1941-42. It was proposed that the taxable incomes of husbands and wives should be aggregated in orider to determine the rate of tax to be paid by both husband and wife on their taxable incomes. This proposal was considerably modified as the result of a conference between party leaders and, under the amendment as finally adopted by Parliament, the new principle of aggregation for rating purposes will operate only in respect of income from assets transferred after the 29th October, 1941, by a husband to his wife if the taxable income of the wife exceeds £200. No revenue will be received in the current year from this source. The Government had proposed to remove the. present exemption so as to provide that dividends received by Australian residents from companies, the profits of which are derived wholly or partly from outside Australia, should be taxable in the hands of the recipients. When submitting this proposal, I stated",27,Aberdare Central Colliery Refugee Purchasers Of Property Australian Fighting Services Noti Fication Of Casualties

These materials, together with all metals, timber, and industrial chemicals in short supply, are controlled by my department because they are essential munitions materials in which my department has a predominant interest. This control necessarily extends to the details of all metal fabrication to the point of supply to manufacturers and merchants, and to all export and import of such commodities. Honourable members will realise that there is a world shortage of these materials, and that imports are not available. Before the war, Australia itself imported many kinds of steel and steel products. The position is now reversed. The local industry is expected [30] to supply not only our new and enormous munitions demand, and the scarcely smaller demands for war purposes in all neighbouring countries which formerly obtained steel from Europe or America, but also civil needs. New Zealand, for example, is dependent for essential supplies on Australian products to replace goods formerly imported from England, and we are endeavouring to keep the sister dominion going on a parity with our own industries. The demand comes from all quarters, from Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands, and the defence demands from these quarters and the Middle East are prodigious. It is possible to supply only a portion of these demands, but it is essential that the department should do everything possible to meet them. The most difficult metal to obtain at present is zinc, which is, of course, used for galvanizing. The munitions effort of the whole Empire is concerned with Australian zinc, which is required for the making of brass, and for direct use in many items of armament. Cartridge cases and fuses are made of brass, and Australian consumption for such items is rapidly increasing. The production of zinc is being expanded as much as is practicable, but there is no alternative to the most ruthless restriction of the civil use of this metal in the interests of war production. In consequence, there is no galvanized iron or wire available for civil use, except where galvanized iron is actually required for the making of containers of water or other liquids. It has become necessary either to use black iron or wire, or to use substitutes such as asbestos cement sheets or iron coated with a mixture of lead and tin, known as terne sheets. The civil population in Australia must use these substitutes, and the armed forces in the Middle East have also to be denied the use of zinc for such purposes. The same general principle applies to water piping. The problem in respect of nails and wire of all kinds is of a different nature. There is no shortage of the raw material, but the basic fabricating capacity cannot be increased. All wire, including nail wire, is first produced as steel rod. For many months past, the rod mills have been working at full capacity. The output",29,Supplementary Financi Al Statement 1941 42

[5.20] -On behalf of the committee I bring up the following reasons:1. The proposal of the House contained substantially the tax concession at pre-war rates. 2. Deducting calls on shares in mining companies up to £50, irrespective of the income of the investor, would have the effect in some cases of subsidizing the investment up to £50 by 83 per cent. 3. The increased rate of tax is purely for war purposes and should not be used to give in war-time approximately three times the rate of concession that was granted in peace-time. 4. W i th f u l l sense of responsibility of the importance of conducting a successful war, this House cannot accept the amendment whicn involves a serious loss of revenue. 5. The excessive concession which (having regard to war taxation) the Senate amendment would involve is illustrated by the attached table. Statement Showing Tax Benefits-Personal Exertion Income.

All these factors were taken into consideration when the Government was making up its mind whether or not to allow the enterprise to lapse, or to make a further advance. Eventually, the Government decided that it should advance at least the amount of £20,000 which had been promised by the previous Government, but which had not been paid over. more does the company want? problem. The Commonwealth geologist has reported that £55,000 should be sufficient. The Government considers that companies of this kind should not be encouraged to believe that they have only to apply to the Commonwealth in order to receive large sums of money. way would be, not to hand over £20,000 in one sum, but to make monthly advances of £3,000 or £4,000 each. In order to safeguard the expenditure of the money it has been decided to place a representative of the Commonwealth Treasury on the company's board of directors. As the company is unable to find £1 for £1 for the advance, we are asking Parliament to agree to the granting of £20,000 without this condition. It has to remembered that the Commonwealth has already advanced £30,000, and has plant valued' at £25,000 on the spot. further advance it might be said that, when the company was within 100 feet of striking oil, the enterprise had to be abandoned for lack of funds. the cost of searches conducted by other companies in those territories? company has expended very considerable amounts. I ask honourable members to consider this case on its merits. The bill provides that if the Minister uses his discretion to make advances for the purposes stipulated, a notice of his intention shall be published in the Gazette. It was originally provided that the money should be advanced free of interest, that it should be repayable only when profits were earned, and then at the rate of 50 per cent, of the profits earned. It is now proposed that on money advanced interest shall be paid at the rate of 5 per cent, when the enterprise becomes profit-earning, also that the Commonwealth shall receive a share of the profits in proportion to its share of the capital for ten years after the liquidation of the Commonwealth's advance. These are the special circumstances that have arisen in connection with the searches that have been made. The Government considered that it was desirable to effect the alteration by an amendment of the act rather than by means of regulations under the National Security Act. In my opinion, the matter should be dealt with by Parliament, so that honourable members may have precise information about the efforts which We believe that the best are being made to discover flow oil in those areas and dealt with in such a way as to allow opportunity to exploit to the full these projects, particularly the one in which, the Commonwealth has already expended £30,000.

The proposed amendment of section 3 of the principal act may restrict If we decline to make a slightly the power of the Minister or of the Commonwealth to make agreements, since they must relate to advances.

This is really a drafting amendment for the purpose of clarifyin g the powers of the Minister. It merely does what I have no doubt was originally intended when the bill was drawn. connection with Lakes Entrance development ? alteration is contained in clause 6, and has a much wider significance. This is the clause which proposes to confer on the Minister power to vary the conditions governing the making of advances under the act so as to give greater flexibility. The amending provision is in these wordsSection6 of the principal act is amended by ' inserting after the word "" not"" wherever occurring, the words "" unless in any particular case the Minister, by notice published in the Gazette, otherwise directs"". The special case which decided the Government to take this action is that of the Apanapi Petroleum Company, whicli was searching for oil in Papua. The previous Administration agreed to advance £50,000 to this company, on a £1 for £1 basis. However, although the arrangement was for £50,000, tbe amount actually advanced was only £30,000, leaving a balauce of £20,000, which has not yet been paid over. The company has now used all the money advanced by the previous Government, plus what it was able to raise itself, and it is now unable to continue its operations. We had to decide whether boring was to be continued, having regard to the very real need at this time for discovering oil. The Commonwealth geological adviser, who had all along been advising the company, and had directed The sub-section it where to sink the bores, has informed the Government that prospects are favorable, and that boring operations should be continued. He has recommended that the Government should advance a furvernment hired to the company a drilling plant worth £25,000. The plant weighs 500 tons, and even when dismantled, parts of it weigh as much as 12 tons. There is no wharf or crane to handle it , ancl it had to be floated into position on pontoons.

95,Mr Beasley,"No. The otherthe scheme was different from that of the vast majority of the fruit-growers. Before the war, they had in Melbourne their own means for the marketing of their products. They grew their own varieties of fruit, which suited the section of the trade with which they dealt, and expended quite a lot of labor and time in marketing operations. Profits were derived by them from not only the growing but also the sale of their fruit. The introduction of the acquisition scheme destroyed the possibility of the individual marketing ancl selling of fruit, and they were forced into the same position as the larger growers in country districts whose activities did not embrace marketing operations. I know them well, and have visited their orchards. They have been harshly treated compared with other growers in country districts, and I trust that when the details of the new scheme are being considered an adjustment may 'be made which will meet their position. I do not envy the Minister the task of drawing up a scheme. The present scheme has operated for two years, and has been the subject of more controversy than any other scheme regulating primary production in this country. There are two further points to which I wish to direct attention. The first relates to costs, which are as important to the fruit-grower as to all other primary producers. Costs of production have risen very considerably in the last year or two, and represent a large proportion of the total out-of-pocket expenses connected with work on the orchard, such as spraying and picking, and finally the collection of the fruit at the close of the season. All of these costs have risen in connection with not only material but also labour, which is difficult available, those who have put their life's to obtain except at a much higher price than that which formerly ruled. There is consequently justification for consideration of an increase of the payments made by the Government in respect of the fruit. My final point relates to distribution. The last scheme failed ibecause of the methods of distribution adopted. The Apple and Pear Committee, in its report, proposed that distribution should be extended, 'by the establishment of kiosks, sales by hawkers, and the adoption of other means for enabling purchases by the public to be made more readily. The proposal should be developed as far as possible, for two reasons. Following up the idea expressed by the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan), if the scheme were properly worked the public would he enabled to .obtain fruit at a reduced cost. In the second place, larger consumption of apples and pears would be made possible throughout the country. The more easily purchases may 'be made, the greater will he the quantity sold. This is one of the most important points that the Government should consider when drawing up the new scheme. I request it to make an early decision, in order that the apple-growers as a whole may know where they stand. support the bill. The loss on the last scheme was greater than it might have been. The idea underlying the scheme was excellent, but management and distribution may have been at fault. The honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) has made a special plea on behalf of a few growers at Doncaster who supply the market daily. Their rights are no greater than are those of growers who are not so close to a market. In assisting the industry, the Commonwealth cannot pick out a few growers for special treatment. Tbe war has made it necessary fov the Commonwealth to legislate with a view to saving this industry, the development of which has cost millions of pounds. The export of fresh fruit from Australia has returned large sums, which have helped to establish the overseas credit of this country. As shipping space is not now savings into orchards must be assisted to maintain their properties. The Minister has stated that an early pronouncement will be made of the Government's intentions. That pronouncement will be welcomed by apple and pear growers throughout Australia. It should be possible to evolve a scheme which would be of greater advantage to both the public and the growers, and reduce the extent of the loss. Question resolved, in the affirmative.",35,Second Reading
96,Mr Prowse (Forrest) [4.42],"Isome of the orchardists who are growing worthless varieties of apples that should not be marketed. When I was in England in 193S I saw, on Charing Cross railway station, Australian apples which were a disgrace to the Commonwealth and to the people who exported them. Some of the orchardists who grow this class of fruit could be subsidized, over a period, while they replanted their properties with better varieties of fruit. I suggest this because, although the acquisition scheme certainly gives something to growers, it offers no solutions to to feed the poor than to give the fruit the problems. I sympathize with the Minister, who has to deal with this and many other problems. However, I hope that he will investigate the suggestions which I have made. this debate many references have been made to the wastage of apples and pears. The speech of the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) dealt almost entirely with fruit littering the ground underneath the trees. Anybody who knows anything about the apple industry must realize that this is no now phenomenon. I have spoken to growers who have had long experience of the industry, and they have told me that, in years of bounty, of which there have been many, tbe wastage of apples has not been much greater than it was during the last season. The export market was reduced by 50 per cent, last year, and, as the crops were unusually good, obviously, the entire production of the industry could not be consumed. The honourable member for Batman suggested that the wastage which occurred was, in the main, the fault of the last Government. I deny that. I cannot see how any government could have provided for the distribution and consumption of the vast quantity of fruit which was produced. The honourable gentleman did not state all of the facts of the situation. I object to waste as much as anybody. But how, in the present circumstances, is it possible to eliminate all waste in connection with apples and pears? It is true that consumption can be increased, but we could not prevent waste in one year of bounteous return when we were unable to export normal quantities. When the honourable member for Batman was asked to propose a remedy for the position, he suggested that the Government should distribute the fruit to the poor. But I point out that the cost of distribution would be high, and would have to be borne by the Government or by the consumers. I assume that it is not the honourable gentleman's intention that the cost should be borne by the individual. Therefore, he suggests that the Government should distribute surplus fruit at its own expense. to the pigs? to pigs. Most of it goes to waste under the trees. I am appalled at the amount of the bounty; it is no less than -During £1,400,000. That is a large sum to expend in one year on one industry, important though it may be. It should be possible, by administrative means, to reduce the bounty to a reasonable amount. I realize that some form of bounty is necessary in order to enable the industry to remain in existence in these difficult days. But the amount to be expended this year is excessive. I trust that the Government will find a means of carrying on the industry, and, at the same time, reducing the burden of the industry on the country. I hope that it will make its decision regarding the future of the acquisition scheme at an early date, because all growers are anxiously awaiting an announcement. They would be helped materially if they knew the details of the scheme. I believe that, if the industry is to be preserved during the war, some system of control similar to the present scheme will be necessary. I agree, in the main, with the recommendations of the Apple and Pear Committee, although I consider that some of the proposals should be reviewed by the Government before it puts them into effect. Any scheme which is introduced must apply to the country as a whole, and must be as fair as possible to the great majority of those engaged in the industry. At the same time, a minority of growers oppose the scheme, because they do not benefit as much from it as do their fellow growers. They are members of the Metropolitan and Peninsula Fruit-growers organization. In the main, their situation at the initiation of",36,Second Reading

99,Mr Ryan,"Very little fruit is givenBoth typos of stamps can be used for food iu any grocery store in tlic area in which the plan is operating. . . . The blue surplus stamps represent a 50 per cent, increase in food purchases by relief families. Tlie stamp plan was inaugurated in Rochester, New York, after which the programme was put into operation on an experimental basis in five other cities during the summer of 1939. The report stated thatBy the end of the summer preliminary studies showed that the mechanical operation of the plan was satisfactory and that the results accomplished were encouraging enough to warrant gradual expansion of the plan to other cities throughout the country. . . . Actual purchases made witli the blue surplus stamps up to this time indicate that lowincome consumers, given increased buying power, will amounts of dairy and poultry products, and fruits and vegetables, as well as otlier agricultural commodities. I submit that to the Minister as a method of assisting lower-range income earners to obtain the beautiful apples and pears that are produced in this country, as well as of assisting the growers. On the subject of hail insurance for growers, the Apple and Pear Committee made the following recommendation:That there sliould be a hail insurance scheme to be financed by a percentage levy being made by the board on the assessed value of the crop in' each State for the purpose of compensating growers for loss sustained by hail damage. I entirely disagree with the contention of some honourable members that it would be impossible for the Commonwealth to undertake a hail insurance scheme. On the advice of the highest legal authority available to the Commonwealth Government the Solicitor-GeneralI believe that the Government could inaugurate a hail insurance scheme, and that it would not matter one rap if one or more of the States remained aloof from it. I have been advised by the Solicitor-General that the power to introduce such a scheme could be derived from an original power of the Constitution relating to insurance, and. .that the Commonwealth would not be liable to the restrictive condition, applicable to taxation measures, that there must not be discrimination between States or between parts of States. The Government could implement a scheme, and any States which wished to remain aloof from it could be allowed to do so. The. growers in the other States at any rate would benefit. The 27th recommendation of the committee was:That the Government should not only urge but encourage and assist by every practicable means the extension of the manufacture of by-products of apples in the Commonwealth: and if such encouragement is given, processing should be carried out in the districts where the f r u it is grown. T agree e n t i r e l y w it h t h a t proposal. On page 9 of its report, the C o m m it t ee statedI n the United States of America the volume of . . . by-products has been increased to such an extent that a considerable portion of the surplus of apples over marketing has been consumed with great benefit to the industry. purchase sharply increased The Government was very unwise to impose heavy rates of sales tax upon the by-products of the apple and pear industry, such as cider and pure fruit juices. Whilst these impositions may increase revenue from sales tax, they will certainly damp down the consumption of the by-products, and that will necessitate heavier subsidization of the industry. I suggest that the Minister appoint a research committee of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research to investigate further uses for apples and pears and their by-products. On the worn-out Mississippi cotton-lands in the United States of America, the Departments of Agriculture suggested to the suffering growers that they should plant peanut crops. The growers did so, but they produced such quantities of peanuts that the market was glutted and they were faced with ruin as the result of excess production of peanuts, just as they had been faced with ruin as the result of poor cotton crops. The Bureau of Agricultural Economics of the United States of America employed a negro professor of the University of Mississippi to investigate the problem. As the result of careful research, he discovered 300 additional products that could be made from peanuts, and to-day the peanut industry in that area is one of the most flourishing primary industries in the United States of America. Similar research in Australia might solve many of the problems of the apple and pear industry. The Minister might also investigate the possibility of subsidizing know whether the honourable member is a beer drinker, cider drinker, or nondrinker. vant. Apples could not be sent through tropical seas to London in holds similar to those in which beer can be shipped. Unless exported in refrigerated holds, the choicest apples which we sent abroad would, on their arrival, be a fermenting mass of vinegary cider. The honourable member knows probably as well as I do that apples cannot be shipped in ordinary holds as can cases of beer. The honourable member's criticism in this regard was absurd. The report of the Apple and Pear Committee indicates that there has been the grossest mismanagement of the marketing of apples by the State committees. Lf the people on those committees are the best in the industry, God help the fruit industry. On page 4 of its report the committee statedEvidence given before the committee revealed an unsatisfactory position in many centres so far as tlic payment oi advances and final settlements were concerned. In some cases long delays have occurred and incorrect payments have been made. En its first progress report the committee was more specific and pointed outNEW Various witnesses at Orange, Armidalc and Kentucky South expressed dissatisfaction with the State committee's administration with regard to incorrect accounts and payments. At Orange one grower was said to have been paid three times for the same consignment, and many men were overpaid. A t Armidale arid Kentucky South the committee was informed that delays in payments up to a period of three months took place. One orchardist received a cheque for £17 10s. for f r u it which these needed foodstuffs. he had not sent, but received £1 13s. 3d. for a consignment of pears for which he should have been paid £21 3s. 3d. Similar instances came to my notice. One grower entitled to £21 received a cheque for £1 3s., and another grower received two cheques on the same day, one for 6d. and the other for 9d., and, since the State committee had made his initial "" N "" on one cheque and "" M "" on the other, he had to pay Gd. exchange on each. The Minister for Commerce( Mr Scully) must put these State committees in order. They have been guilty of shockingly bad administration. The fourth recommendation of the committee wasThat the Auditor-General should be asked to conduct a f u l l inquiry into the nnancial arrangement and accounts of the officers of the board and the committees iu the various States. That is a very good suggestion. The ninth recommendation of the committee wasThat during the intake .period a free distribution of apples should be made in the schools, both State and registered, and also to charitable institutions. When I asked the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) to suggest a means of disposing of the surplus fruit, he made a proposal along those lines. But that would not overcome the difficulties of the Government or of the growers. Unless the growers were paid for their fruit, they would be in queer street, and unless the Government could obtain some return from the public for the fruit for which it had paid the growers, it would be in queer street also. However, I make a suggestion to the Government, based on the 1939 report of the Secretary of Agriculture in the United States of America, on the subject of that country's Food Order Stamp Plan. The report stated:Thu food-order stamp plan, which was inaugurated on 10th May, 1930, was developed by still more effective ways of increasing the home market for tlic American farmer. Tlie greatest opportunity to increase the domestic consumption of food lies in the field of farm products for which there is an clastic demand. The consumption of dairy and poultry products and of fruits and vegetables goes up and down with consumer income. When income is low the consumer is likely to go short on these commodities even though his diet and health may suffer. The stamp plan gives lowincome consumers the buying power to secure Such a scheme would overcome many of the difficulties which the honourable member for Batman raised. The report continued :Under tlie stamp plan, which is entirely voluntary, relief families may purchase orange-coloured stamps at the rate of $1 a week for each member of the family as a minimum, or at the rate of $1.50 a week for each member of the family as a maximum. For each dollar's worth of orange-coloured stamps purchased, 50 cents' worth of blue surplus stamps are given free to the family.",37,Second Reading

101,Mr Abbott,"No, it is most relepersuaded that fruit, regarded properly, is not a luxury but a necessity, especially to the rising generation, whose health is benefited and whose pleasure in life is tremendously augmented by access to the great profusion of good fruit with which Australia is blessed. It is a terrible thing that good fruit, grown in such tremendous quantities, should be obtained with such difficulty by working-class people, I charge the late Government with having done nothing to facilitate the contact of the consuming public with the fruit produced. Richmond has scorned as extravagant charges that fruit has been allowed to rot on the ground, but that charge cannot be .refuted, because I myself have seen ithe frui t rotting on the their custom of hawking and marketing ground in many of the areas represented by tlie honourable member for Ballarat( Mr Pollard), who has done so much as a member of the Apple and Pear Committee and as a primary producer to safeguard the interests of the consumers as well as those of the growers. The late Government did little or nothing to enhance the local market and make it possible for tbe working classes to acquire the fruit. I know that the late Government's policy was applauded by many large orchardists who as the result of that policy received large sums of money from the Government, but the ordinary consumer has suffered because he has not been able to obtain fruit. able member suggest should be done by the present Minister for Commerce? ister is new in office, but I suggest to him that, if the apple and pear acquisiacquisition scheme, but in order that that tion scheme is to be continued, wholesome fruit, perhaps not up to export standard, should be made readily available to the thousands of people who want that fruit, but cannot afford to buy it. Pruit should not be allowed to rot or be fed to pigs when thousands of people are forced by economic circumstances to do without fruit. We have been told by the Minister that in the last season unprecedented quantities of apples and pears were harvested, 'but one will not find fruit on the dining tables of the workers, because they cannot afford to buy it. Bountiful harvests are of no use to Australia if, owing to the fancy prices charged, the people cannot benefit from them. One aspect of this matter which arouses my curiosity is the fact that whilst the ingenuity of the Government has not been equal to shipping a single bushel of apples abroad it has been equal to exporting unlimited quantities of beer. I do not object to the predilection of some people for beer rather than apples, but I do objeot to the suggestion that hundreds of thousands of cases of beer can be shipped but not a The honourable member for single case of apples. It is true that many growers near to the metropolitan areas of Victoria are in a comparatively small way, but it is equally true that had they been free last season to follow their own fruit they would have been able to convert their crops into cash. The apple and pear acquisition scheme has taken their livelihood from them. -The difficulties which confronted apple and pear growers when, almost overnight, as tlie result of the war, they lost about 50 per cent, of their market, need no emphasis. It was a wonderful performance on the part of the Apple and Pear Board to dispose of 8,000,000 cases of apples in Australia last year, but that left an unsold surplus of 7,000,000. It is not my ipurpose to whdtewash the apple and pear acquisition scheme; on the contrary, I shall say plainly what I think about certain aspects of it. No scheme for the marketing of primary products has been more criticized or damned in the press or in .the minds of the people than the apple and pear scheme may be improved, I propose to make some constructive suggestions, not suggestions such as those in the mind of the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan). The theme of the honourable member's speech was what the last Government did or failed to do. Recrimination is useless, and I am concerned with the future, not with the dead past.

Even the statement which the Ministerf o r Commerce( Mr Scully) submitted to the House this afternoon upon the activities of the board does not enable honourable members to estimate the value to Australia of the apple and pear industry. Sof a r as I can gather, its value is approximately £3,000,000 a year. If my estimate be accurate, honourable members should note that the appropriation which Parliament is now asked to make represents 50 per cent, of the value of the industry.

If it had been possible to obtain Is. or 2s. a case more for apples during the harvesting period, this appropriation would be many hundreds of thousands of pounds less. Certain newspapers published matter which was detrimental to the scheme, stich as statements that millions of bushels of apples were heing ploughed under the ground. I do not say that they set out deliberately to sabotage the scheme, hut they undoubtedly did much harm to it. In New South Wales very little fruit went to waste, except certain unscheduled varieties, and fruit that was hail marked. Even in normal times there was no market for such fruit except in. times of scarcity, and in areas close to the point of cation of the importance that the previous production. had better not tell that to the Kentucky srrowcrs. to waste in .Kentucky had been damaged by hail. New iSouth Wales is an importing State, whereas Tasmania, Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia rely upon exporting a part of their crop. Normally, New iSouth Wales used to import over a million cases of apples from the other States. It is unreason ahle, therefore, to ask us to believe that any considerable quantity of sound fruit was ploughed under in New South Wales. T admit that there was probably a considerable loss of hail-marked fruit for which, in other years, the growers would have found a market. I agree that the growers suffered a considerable hardship on that account. fact that the committee presented an interim report recommending that compensation be paid to growers whose fruit bad been damaged by hail, the honourable member's Government took no action. sought, to institute a hail insurance .scheme to protect growers against loss from bail, but it 'broke down because of opposition from certain States. tbe Commonwealth of responsibility. M.r. ANTHONY I think that it does. If the Commonwealth Government were to compensate growers for haildamaged apples, there would be no reason why it should not accept similar responsibility in regard to every other kind of fruit, and, indeed, in regard to crops of all kinds. Sitting suspended from 3.21 to S.52 p.m. matter for regret that the Parliament is obliged to provide such a huge sum at present for the apple and pear industry, existing circumstances make this appropriation inevitable. Probably the Government will, be compelled in future to grant financial assistance to other primary industries, if lack of shipping space prevents the export of their products. The assistance which has been given to the growers of apples and pears is an indiGovernment and the present Administration attach to the necessity for maintaining on the land primary producers who, because of the loss of their export markets, would otherwise be deprived of their livelihood. One could speak at great length upon the apple and pear industry. Since the introduction of the acquisition scheme, the subject has been canvassed throughout the bind, but mere words do not conceal the fact that the Commonwealth must make good a deficiency of £1,400,000. That appropriation has to be made in conformity with the undertaking that the previous Government gave to the Commonwealth Bank, but the experience gained during the last acquisition season will prove to be of great value to the Minister. Whilst, I do not envy him, and those to whom he delegates the responsibility of managing the scheme, their task, our experience of a number of problems related to tbe apple and pear acquisition scheme will enable us to ma.ke substantial improvements during the coming vear. do not oppose the bill, I regret that honourable members have not been supplied with a complete statement of the financial transactions of the Apple and Pear Board.

The loss of £900,000, the higher price paid to the growers, and the record crop, combined to produce tlie result which has made it necessary to seek an appropriation of £1,4.00,000 in order to meet the losses on the pool. That section of the f r u it industry whicli is represented by the apple and pear growers is one of the most difficult sections to deal with and organize. I had the responsibility of administering the acquisition scheme for a considerable period. Upon assuming that responsibility, I found that there was little or no organization within the industry itself. There are very few men of sufficient business experience combined with a knowledge of the industry, whom one can approach for advice and help. gentleman went outside the ranks of the apple and pear growers in order to find the manager whom he appointed? gentleman who had charge of the administration in New South Wales. WhenE undertook the organization of the scheme last year, I gave to the chairman of the board, Mr Mills, as the managing director of the business, f u l l executive powers, with complete authority to select his own staff. When he approached me with tbe suggestion that Mr Stevenson, of New South Wales, would be a proper person to appoint to the position, If u l l y concurred, because I have an intimate knowledge of the f r u it industry, and knew from experience that Mr Stevenson was probably the only man in New South Wales who could be said to represent the growers and to have a knowledge of marketing problems. By virtue of hishaving been chairman for three years of the only fruit-growers' marketing organization which had ever come into existence in New South Wales, I considered that he should have had tbe necessary experience to carry out the duties which the chairman of the board proposed to entrust to him. In the fruit-growing industry generally, there is not a sufficient number of men of wide experience to deal with these particular problems. Western Australia. fruit-marketing problems is probably as wide as that of any honourable member. I have also a close knowledge of the leading figures in the f r u it industry of Australia, ancl know what qualifications they possess for different kinds of jobs. The time is overdue for a pronouncement as to what the Minister proposes to do in the coming season. Taking over early in last November, as I did, I was at a great disadvantage in trying to put into operation a scheme which had to commence functioning about the end of the year. If the Minister is not careful, he will find himself in similar difficulty. The first supplies of apples will probably reach the Sydney market within a few weeks. The honourable gentleman hias very little time to lose if he proposes to establish an effective organization to deal with the apple and pear crop for the ensuing year. The Apple and Pear Board made a great effort to increase the consumption of apples and pears, but, as the Minister has pointed out, consumption was detrimentally affected by certain propaganda, some of it 'by the growers themselves. In the districts around Melbourne some growers, in pursuance of what they thought to be their rights, wrote to the press stating that apples were going to waste in great quantities, that the growers were being crucified, and that the prices charged by the board were too high. would necessarily go to waste under any system when you had to put 15,000,000 bushels of f r u it on a market which normally absorbed only 7,000,000 bushels. The trouble was that the growers, in their eagerness to insist upon their individual rights, destroyed the desire of the public to buy apples. Tbe public got the idea that apples ought to be practically given",42,South Walesaitleanu Peak The Department In Response To The Need For

134,* Mr Anthony,"Yes, and theySouth Australia particularly, favorable seasonal conditions resulted in crops which were exceptionally clean and free from disease. As a consequence, a greater proportion than normally of the total crop in those States has qualified for advances. Although a market was found for approximately 8,000,000 bushels of fruit, there was no outlet for the remainspace, there was no market for the quaning 7,000,000 bushels in respect of which the growers received compensation. should also be noted that the rates of advances to the growers were higher than were paid in 1940. Secondly, in 1940 we were fortunate in securing space for the shipment to the United Kingdom of about 2,000,000 cases of apples and pears, for which very remunerative returns were received. This year, however, it has not been possible to there was a loss of over £600,000. It has ship one case of fresh fruit to England. Thirdly, the marketing results of the board were not so successful as had been originally anticipated, due to the nature of the propaganda directed ngainst the scheme by certain interests. During the year, the board has taken full advantage of available interstate transport and cool storage accommodation, and has arranged to hold record quantities of apples in cool store. A subUnited Kingdom, and in that respect stantial increase of the production of dried apples, from a normal 470 tons to 1,250 tons, equivalent to 500,000 bushels of fresh apples, was made possible because of the action taken by the board. This additional tonnage was required in order to meet the large demands of the defence services. However, it is not possible to market in Australia, or to process, the whole of the surplus normally exported overseas. Honourable members must realize that the loss of our main export market for fresh frui t is a serious matter for the apple and pear industry. Until these remunerative outlets are restored, obviously some measure of assistance must be afforded to the industry, ancl some control respect of ithe different varieties in the must he exercised over the marketing activities. With the approach of the new season, the Government will make an early pronouncement regarding future policy. I commend the bill to the favorable consideration of honourable members. This bill is the almost inevitable result of the apple and pear acquisition scheme. Prior to the war, approximately one-half of the Australian production of apples and pears, which averaged 11,000,000 or 12,000,000 cases, was exported, and the remainder found a market in Australia. With the outbreak of war, and because of lack of shipping tity usually exported, and had the GoIt vernment not taken action the effect on the growers would have been disastrous indeed, because so much fruit would have been thrown on the Australian market that the price received would not have covered the cost of marketing. The Government was, therefore, compelled to inaugurate a scheme for the relief of those engaged in the industry. In the first year in which the scheme operated, to be remembered that in that first year a limited quantity of shipping was still available, and, as the Minister for Commerce( Mr Scully) has stated, 2,000,000 cases of apples was exported and returned to the pool approximately £900,000. Therefore, in considering the loss made this year, three factors have to be taken into account. The first is, that not a single case of apples was exported to the alone we are £900,000 worse off than in the preceding season. In the second place, a record crop was produced last year all over Australia, particularly in Tasmania and South Australia, and to a, lesser extent in Victoria, although I am under the impression that it approached record figures in that State also. Consequently, we have to deal with several million bushels more than had previously been handled. In addition, the Government, realizing that in the preceding season the remuneration of the growei'3 had not been sufficient to enable them to carry on their industry, increased the amount payable per case, and made variations of the prices to be paid in various States. In the first year of the pool, a flat rate was paid to producers in all of the States, but in the year under review the growers of particular varieties of apples in Queensland and New South Wales .received special considerationproperly, because fruit which they produced realized a higher price than did",43,South Walesaitleanu Peak The Department In Response To The Need For

Resolution reported. .Standing; Orders suspended; resolution adopted. OrderedThat Mr Scully and Mr Beasley do prepare administer the acquisition and marketing and bring iu a bill to carry out the foregoing resolution. Bill brought up by Mr .SCULLY, and read a first time. Commerce) [2.57] I move That the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this bill is to grant and apply out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund a sum of £1,400,000 for the repayment to the Commonwealth Bank of advances made by the bank for the purposes of the acquisition and marketing of the 1940-41 crop of apples and pears under the National Security (Apple and Pear Acquisition) Regulations. Because of the unfavorable outlook for any improvement of the export position for fresh fruit in 1941, the Commonwealth Government convened a conference of State Ministers of Agriculture and accredited representatives of the apple and pear industry in order to consider ways and means of dealing with the new season's crop. Following several further discussions with the States, the Commonwealth Government finally agreed to proposals for a continuation of an acquisition scheme for the following season. The arrangements for 1941, however, differed in the following important respects from those of the previous year:(i) Acauisition was effected on the 1st January, instead of the 1st March; (ii) Instead of making advances to growers at flat rates, a unit system was adopted, which provided for differential rates as between States and as between varieties of apples and pears produced in each State; (iii) Fruit had to be actually delivered before qualifying for advances, except where delivery was not required for marketing. In these cases qualifications for advances were established on the basis of an official tree measurement of the crop at the time of maturity. Certain changes were made in the organization of the scheme, and the Apple and Pear Marketing Board was constituted under the regulations to arrangements. In accordance with regulation 25 of the National Security (Apple and Pear Acquisition) Regulations, arrangements were made with the Commonwealth Bank to advance the amounts necessary to meet the payment of advances to growers, packing and marketing costs, and administrative and publicity expenses. Sums totalling £3,901,779 were advanced by the bank for the foregoing purposes, subject to the following conditions:(1) A guarantee in pursuance of the regulations to be furnished for the full amount of the advances made by the bank; (2) The clearance of outstanding indebtedness before the 31st March, 1942; and (3) Interest on advances to be charged at the ruling rate for rural credit advances. Application has been made to the bank for a further sum of £255,000, which would make the aggregate of the advances £4,156,779. So far as it is possible to estimate at this stage, the acquisition and marketing of the 1941 crop will result in a substantial loss of between £1,500,000 and £1,600,000. Last year, an amount of £750,000 was appropriated by Parliament to meet the probable deficiency on the 1940 acquisition scheme. The actual loss on that year, however, will be approximately £605,000, leaving a balance of parliamentary appropriation amounting to £145,000. Honourable members are now asked to approve of the appropriation of a further £1,400,000 in order to meet the estimated deficiency. In comparing the increased loss on the 1941 season with that of the previous year, a number of factors must be taken into consideration. First, the 1940-41 crop for Australia was of record size, aggregating 15,000,000 bushels of apples and pears. In most of the States the crops were heavy, and in some instances abnormally heavy.

136,Mr Scully (Gwydir,"Minister forof Austi'alia, depends largely upon the supply of superphosphate. I should like the Minister, when he replies to the debate, to inform the House, if it be possible for him to do so, of the prospects for future supplies of superphosphate from Nauru and Ocean Islands. A large part of the increase of the cost of phosphatic rock is the result of enemy action which destroyed the cantilever machinery that was used for loading ships at those islands. I have heard it said publiclyand I was not in a position to denj' the statement, although I expressed doubt of its accuracy-that the increase was due largely to the fact that the British Phosphate Commission had raised the price for the purpose of financing the installation of new machinery. I should like to know whether the machinery is, in fact, being replaced. The present method of loading involves the use of baskets and barges, with the result that the cost has increased and the process has become slower. There are no sheltered ports at those islands, and, in bad weather, ships cannot be loaded by the present method. I urge the Minister to infonn the House of the prospects regarding supplies from those sources. Farmers want to know the facts, because the rationing of superphosphate and the increase of price affects their plans. Commerce) [2.48].'-in reply-The honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Therefore, I shall do everything possible Paterson) has suggested that the bounty should be paid upon manufacture. The bill contemplates that it will be paid upon sale to consumers. The honourable member contended that payment on manufacture would obviate the necessity for co-operative companies to pay interest on overdrafts. I shall investigate that suggestion, and if it be possible to accede to it, I shall give favorable consideration to it. The honourable member for Wannon charges. I realize that the rationing of superphosphate supplies has indirectly affected the rates of railway freight charged to consumers. I know of many landowners who normally would buy a 10-ton truckload of superphosphate. Under rationing, however, they are able to purchase only 7 tons. Nevertheless, the railway freight systems of the various States make it necessary for them.to pay freight, for a full 10-ton truckload. This relative increase of the freight charges is of serious importance to consumers. 1 shall discuss the matter with the railways authorities of the different States in order to see whether the situation can be relieved. The honourable member for New England( Mr Abbott) and the honourable member for Flinders( Mr Ryan) questioned the wisdom of fixing 1939-40 as the base year for the computation of ration allowances. The honourable gentleman said that many producers had undertaken pastoral improvement only recently, so that the allocation of supplies according to sales in the year 1939-40 might react unfavorably to them. I do not know whether it will be possible to select a different basis of calculation, but if individual applications be made to me in regard to unfair treatment under this system, I shall discuss them with the representatives of the States and endeavour to overcome any disabilities. Both the honourable member for Swan( Mr Marwick) and the honourable member for Darwin (. Sir George Bell) referred to the possibility of increasing supplies. I assure them that the Government is doing everything within its power to increase production, and it will not relax its efforts until every reasonable prospect of obtaining new stocks has been exhausted. As a country man I realize the importance of superphosphate to primary production. to increase the supply, which at present, is definitely inadequate to meet reasonable demands.

WhilstI congratulate the Government upon having endorsed the decision made by the previous Government to subsidize the manufacture of superj)hosphate, I cannot agree with the satisfaction expressed by the honourable member for New England( Mr Abbott) with the amount of bounty provided. Ninety-five per cent-, of the wool-growers of Australia produce 50 per cent, of the wool grown; the other 50 per cent, is produced by 5 per cent, of the wool-growers, the squatters. In Western Australia, I had the honour, a3 first chairman of the Discharged Soldiers Land Settlement Board, of placing a number of returned soldiers on blocks of land which were capable of carrying enough sheep to provide them with a decent living at prevailing wool prices. When this war broke out, however, the Commonwealth Government entered into an arrangement whereby the whole of the Australian wool clip, was sold to the Government of the United Kingdom on a basis which would presumably provide a fair living to the wool growers. The trouble is that the wool agreement is static, whereas the cost of producing wool is certainly not static. For instance, the price of superphosphate has increased by about £3 5s. a ton in Western Australia, imposing a heavy burden on the small wool-growers who either have to find the wherewithal to buy necessary quantities of superphosphate or allow their stock to deteriorate. The small wool-growers are doubly suffering; they have to contend with increased costs and cannot afford to buy sufficient superphosphate to maintain the quality of their stock. Consequently, their yield of wool seriously declines. The Government must either ensure that growers receive an increased return, or, as the New Zealand Government has done, meet the growers' increased costs. As a private member, the Minister for Commerce( Mr Scully) himself urged the then Government to do what I now urge him to do. welcome the assurance given to me by the Minister for Commerce( Mr Scully) that all possible sources of superphosphate and other fertilizers within Australia and at places near to Australia would be investigated with a view to their exploitation. I am pleased that the Joint Committee on Rural Industries intends to investigate the whole of the factors associated with the manufacture and distribution of superphosphate in Australia. It is most likely that substantial quantities of fertilizers can be obtained locally. For instance, I refer to vast quantities of live and dead guano. Dead guano can very successfully be mixed with superphosphate, but not, I think, live guano. At least 250,000 tons of guano has already been removed from Western Australia, and I think that many more tons is available. From 1916 to 1918 about 100,000 tons of phosphatic rock was mined in South Australia. The phosphatic rock is fairly well scattered throughout South Australia, and it is within the realms of possibility that mining operations could be extended in areas where the rock is high grade. Phosphatic rock is also to be found in Victoria and in New South Wales. In the last war New South Wales produced 60,000 tons of superphosphate from local phosphatic rock. It is imperative that supplies of superphosphate be available to protect the pastures which have been created as the result of encouragement given by this Parliament by way of the fertilizer subsidy. Guano would be quite suitable for the top-dressing of pastures, although i i would not be of much use in wheat-growing because its action is slow. I hope that the Minister will instruct his officers to commence immediately the investigation of local resources. I appreciate the provisions of this measure and, although its introduction was contemplated by the previous Government, I congratulate the Minister for _ Commerce( Mr Scully); upon having brought it down. It will relieve the primary producers of the obligation to bear at least some of the excessive cost of superphosphate. The importance of this commodity need not be stressed, because it is well known that the stability of primary production, and, in fact, the stability of the whole economy",46,Apple And Pear

This is not a big matter, and I feel confident that if the Minister discusses it with the department, means can be found for adopting the proposal. I was pleased to notice that the Minisand, when the flax has been cropped, ter intends to establish a reserve so as to enable special crops, such as flax and vegetables for canning, to receive special attention. Anxiety has been expressed by growers of beans for canning, in the northern areas of New South Wales, that the system of rationing might inflict hardship upon them, but I know that the Minister, during the last two or three weeks, has allayed their fears. The new special crops which we are growing may play an important part in Australia's future agricultural development. The more we diversify our crops the greater will be the safety of our primary producers. Hitherto we have worked within a very narrow orbit. The reserve of 5 per cent, of manufacturers' stocks of superphosphate will do much to enable the continued production of those special crops. I congratulate the Minister upon having introduced this bill. The Government could not be expected to carry the whole of the burden of the increased cost of superphosphate, but I hope that it will accept the burden of further rises because the position of the user is becoming increasingly difficult. The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research should be asked to make a thorough investigation of any available supplies of phosphatic rock in Australia, or in neighbouring islands, especially the Abrolhos islands off the north-west coast. In the past a great deal of superphosphate has been manufactured from phosphatic rock taken from those, islands. It would be much better to exploit Australian resources to the full than to send to the Red Sea and other distant places for supplies. I hope that this bill will go through quickly and that the primary producers will not receive less superphosphate than it envisages that they will receive next year. to support the suggestion made by the honourable member for New England( Mr Abbott) that the basic year be changed from 1939-40 to 1940-4L I do so because under the flax production scheme large areas of former pasture land have been sown with flax, which requires 1 owt. of superphosphate to the acre. Probably 60,000 acres of pastures have been converted to flax-growing, the land must again be sown with grass, which will require additional applications of superphosphate in order to make it produce good turf. There is every reason, therefore, to make the basic year the year subsequent to that proposed. The future of the primary industries is, as was said by the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Paterson), bound up with the proper application of superphosphate, and it is essential that, as far as possible, .supplies shall be available during war-time, because pastures rapidly deteriorate if not treated with fertilizers, which are also necessary to keep the new crops in production. I , therefore, urge the Government to exploit all known sources of phosphatic rock and to search for other sources in order that essential supplies shall be maintained. As a primary producer representing other primary producers in this Parliament I join with other similarly placed honourable members in commending the Government for having brought down this bill. congratulate the Minister for Commerce( Mr Scully) upon having introduced this measure in order to ratify a decision made by his predecessor, the right honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page). Supplies' of superphosphate are vital to the development of the land. The right honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) yesterday described how the imposition of a land tax had resulted in the breaking up of large holdings of land, with consequent closer settlement. However much the land tax may have done in that respect, the most important contribution .to closer settlement in this country has been the application of superphosphate to the land, as the result of which men who formerly needed large areas of land in order to make a living found that they could make a much greater income from smaller areas. The amount of the bounty is acceptable, but I hope that the Government will give",47,Apple And Pear

The honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Paterson) has brought to the notice of the Minister, a suggestion that deserves serious consideration. Even if economies be effected only in interest payments, the result will be reflected in the reduction of the price of the fertilizer. wisdom teeth. Ministers experience the Since the outbreak of war, the price of superphosphate has increased from 28s. to 100s. a ton. I do not know whether the inquiries of the Prices Commissioner begin with the landed cost of the fertilizer, but in my opinion, this extraordinary thoroughly investigated. The first rise of 10s. a ton occurred on the 1st January, 1940, only a few months after the outbreak of war, and so far as I am able to ascertain, a big proportion of that increase was due to higher shipping charges. If that be correct, freights are excessive. They are higher than the pre-war cost of the rock. Por twelve months after the outbreak of war, shipping in these waters was not subject to interference by enemy raiders, but the shipping companies increased their freights abnormally. On appearances at least, one is justified in concluding that profiteering has occurred there. ' In future, supplies of superphosphate will be rationed. Each purchaser will receive only 65 per cent, of the quantity that he used in 1939-40. This will deprive the primary producer of a freight concession that he hitherto enjoyed. Previously, he purchased consignments of ten tons or twenty tons, and those large orders enabled him to obtain truck rates. The bill will assist, in some degree, to lighten the burden on the primary producer, but the Government, by vigorous measures, should effect a reduction, of costs. If not, the nation will have to hear the added cost. That may be an incentive to the Government to take action against shipping companies for the purpose of securing a reduction of freights. I see in this bill an old friend, because in happier circumstances I might have introduced it. The Government has done a fair thing in fixing the bounty on superphosphate at 25s. a ton. I am fully aware that the Government of New Zealand bears the whole of the increased cost, but I expect that the troubles of the Minister for Commerce( Mr Scully) were similar to my own. All Treasurers, regardless of the party to which they belong, cling as tenaciously to money as some people cling to their utmost difficulty in prevailing upon them to make money available for various purposes. The bounty of 25s. a ton is the best that we can hope for at the present time. Like other honourable members who increase should be have spoken on this bill, I desire to emphasize the absolute dependence of Australian soils upon the application of adequate supplies of superphosphate. During the last 40 years the fertility of the eastern soils of New South Wales has decreased by from 40 per cent, to 50 per cent. Now, that fertility is being restored -by the use of superphosphate. If the fertilizer be not made available in adequate quantities, the soils will begin to deteriorate. The Minister mentioned, as a matter of interest to honourable members, that the recent meeting of the Australian Agricultural Oouncil unanimously adopted a scheme submitted hy the Department of Commerce for rationing supplies of superphosphate. The plan is based upon -the use by each prodncer of 65 per cent, of the quantity of superphosphate used during the year 1939-40. In my opinion, it would be more equitable if the ration were determined on the base year 1940-41. Many settlers have been carrying on a continuous programme of pasture, improvement and the laying clown of pastures, and their requirements of superphosphate have progressively increased. If their requirements be reduced upon the basis of the year 1939-40, they will suffer a substantially heavier rationing pro rata than other people who put down their pastures years ago. Eveni f the alteration of the base year entails a decrease of the 65 per cent, by a decimal, the suggestion is worthy of adoption. In addition to being appreciated by users of superphosphate, it would enable areas which were laid down in that year to be",48,Apple And Pear
145,,"Mr ABBOTT (New England) [2.25].it is sold, and they are able to claim the bounty. It would be simpler, and in all respects more desirable, to pay the .bounty on manufacture, and not on sale. The benefit would then be passed on to tbe primary producer when the fertilizer was sold. This would remove some of the difficulties under which the manufacturing companies, particularly the co-operative companies, are at present labouring. It would also benefit the primary producers, because the price which they pay is largely determined, at any rate in Victoria, the Riverina and Tasmania, by the operations of the Phosphate Cooperative Company, which returns to its shareholders the whole of its profits in the shape of rebates. A major rebate is paid in accordance with the quantity of superphosphate purchased, and the number of shares which the purchaser owns, but there is also a minor rebate on the price charged, and this compels the proprietary companies, which are in competition with the co-operative companies, to give a similar rebate. Thus, anything done by the Government to reduce the expenses of the co-operative fertilizing company w ill be reflected in the rebate which it gives to its shareholders, and this, in turn, will govern the price at which the proprietary companies supply fertilizer.

The reason underlying the proposal is that the price of rock has increased from 28s. a ton delivered in Australia before the outbreak of the war, to 100s. a ton, and it does not require much imagination to appreciate how much additional capital is required to pay for the rock; and how much larger the seasonal overdraf t must be during the period between the time when the rock is purchased and the sale of the fertilizer. I ask the Minister to give sympathetic consideration to this constructive suggestion which I make with the object, not so much of assisting the .manufacturer, although it will do that, as of helping primary producers. Anything that we can do to reduce the cost of production, even if it be only the amount of interest paid on the seasonal overdraft, will be reflected in the price to the producer. There is a safeguard that that w ill happen because the practice of the great co-operative company which I mentioned earlier has been, and will be, to return to primary producers the whole of its profits in the form of rebates. That competition will compel proprietary manufacturers to follow suit, and the reduced price w ill be of considerable benefit to the man on the land.

This measure is introduced for the purpose of granting and applying out of the Consolidated Revenue fund moneys sufficient to provide for the payment of a bounty of 25s. a ton on superphosphate produced in Australia and sold by manufacturers on and after the 1st July, 1941. Honourable members are probably aware that superphosphate is manufactured from raw rock phosphate and that Australia, is dependent on outside sources for its supplies of this rock. Since the outbreak of the war, freight and other charges incurred in importing rock phosphate from Nauru, Ocean Island and, following damage by enemy action at Nauru, other sources of supply, have consistently risen, and the British Phosphate Commission has from time to time found it necessary considerably to increase the landed price of the rock to superphosphate manufacturers. wealth Prices Commissioner, who has been in close touch with the superphosphate position throughout, has approved on three separate occasions of increases of the prices chargeable by manufacturers of superphosphate to users of this fertilizer. The first increase of 10s. a ton, which took effect from the 1st January, 1940, applied to all of the States. The second increase, which operated from the 1st July, 1940, varied among the States. In New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland and South Australia, excepting Eyre Peninsula, it was 14s. a ton; in Western Australia and Eyre Peninsula, 16s.; and in Tasmania, 9s. The latest rise of 32s. a ton in all of the States has been in operation since the 1st July, 1941. Our primary producers bore the cost of the first two increases. It was obvious that, unless action were taken to cushion the impact of the further rise of 32s. a ton, the use of this fertilizer in Australia would be curtailed to a minimum, important part in the agricultural and economy of our country, this would have constituted a serious menace to the efficiency of our farming industries. Tho Government of the day decided to grant a bounty of 25s. a ton as from the 1st July, 1941, which meant that the net increase of price to the consumer from that date would be 7s. a ton instead of the full 32s. a ton approved by the Prices Commissioner. This is now operating, although the enabling legislation was not passed by the previous Government. The bounty is payable to manufacturers of superphosphate, who are required so to adjust their prices that the consumers will receive the full benefit of the bounty. The bill provides means for imposing an adequate check on all transactions. Honourable members will appreciate that it is not possible to say exactly what amount will be involved in the payment of the bounty. The quantity of superphosphate that can be produced in Australia is dependent upon the quantity of rock phosphate available, and on the phosphate content of the rock. Imports of rock phosphate cannot be predicted with any certainty; but if they should continue at the present rate, probably 400,000 tons of rock will be imported during the twelve months ending the 30th June, The Common1942. In terms of superphosphate, this should represent about 600,000 tons, which, if taken by consumers, would involve bounty payments totalling about £750,000. The Australian Agricultural Council, at its recent meeting, adopted unanimously a scheme for the rationing of superphosphate, submitted by the Department of Commerce. That scheme was the result of a consultation with the British Phosphate Commission and the manufacturers, and is based on the use by each producer of 65 per cent, of the quantity of superphosphate used in the year 1939-40. Despite the reduced production of superphosphate, consequent upon the reduction of imports of rock phosphate, this allocation to each producer will leave a reserve sufficient to enable crops of flax, vegetables for canning, &c, to receive special attention.

154,Motion (By Mr Scully) Agreed To,"Pacific countries as an augury of a long period of peace. Tliis Government's objective is to preserve the peace of the Pacific, if that can be done without sacrifice of principle, without prejudice to national security, and without endangering the solidarity of the democratic powers. Within the limits of this broad objective, there are many difficult problems as to the manner and form of approach. In all of these respects the Commonwealth is ready and willing to co-operate to the limit of its powers. It is essential to bear in mind that our attitude takes account, not only of our own interests, but also of those of other Pacific countries, such as the Netherlands East Indies, Thailand, and the far eastern provinces of Russia. There is solid basis for the dictum that the peace of the Pacific must be indivisible. In all these matters we arc in daily contact with our diplomatic representatives in Washington ancl Tokyo, and we have had the assistance of Sir Earle Page, ancl especially that of Mr Bruce, the High Commissioner in Great Britain, who has given us valuable advice. In these very difficult times, I consider it to be my duty to pay tribute to the frank and friendly attitude of the Japanese Minister in this country. I desire now to make several shorter references. Pirst, there is Portuguese Timor. The Commonwealth Government has a very direct concern in the preservation of the complete political independence of Portuguese Timor. Indeed, Portuguese Timor may fairly be regarded as one of the main points of entrance to the Commonwealth. The capital town, Dilli, has been made a regular stopping place on the Empire Airways route from Darwin to Singapore. At Dilli we have now an official representative of the Commonwealth Government. It if. proposed to confer full consular rank upon him, just as Japan has been represented at the same town for the last few weeks by a career consul. It, is obvious that Australia cannot regard with equanimity any development which threatens the integrity of this portion of the Portuguese empire. I am certain that Portugal, as Britain's "" ancient ally"", shares this view. In recent months our relationship with the Netherlands East Indies has become closer because of the obvious need for consultation and collaboration in the problems of mutual defence. The Netherlands East Indies Administration immediately came into line with Great Britain and the TJnited States of America in imposing economic restrictions upon Japan, and the Netherlands Minister in Washington is being kept informed of the progress of the American talks with Japan. We have had visits from several important delegations from Batavia, and the value of these visits is appreciated by the Commonwealth. There has been unavoidable delay in completing the arrangements for an exchange of Ministers between the Netherlands Government and the Government of the Commonwealth, but an agreement has been readied in principle. This agreement will ensure adequate representation of Australia in the Netherlands East Indies, ancl the appointment of a Dutch Minister at Canberra. Australia has a supreme and special interest in preventing forcible aggression in the Pacific. Tlie Commonwealth Government has recently, had valuablediscussions with Mr Duff Cooper, a member of the Churchill Ministry, who was specially appointed to Singapore. In consultation with members of the Advisory War Council, the War Cabinet discussed with Mr Duff Cooper ways and means for improving the political organization of the defence effort which is centred at .Singapore. Experience shows that the Commonwealth has a great and increasing interest in that organization, and that it is entitled to join, on a footing of equality, with the United Kingdom in any body which is constituted to deal with political matters of Pacific concern. We were impressed with Mr Duff Cooper's appreciation of the nature of the problems of Pacific defence. His recommendations will shortly be considered by His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom, and will subsequently be considered by the Commonwealth Government. The increase of inter-dominion consultation on matters of war policy has brought the Commonwealth into closer armistice agreement. This was, said the President, "" the least that could be expected of a Prance which demanded respect for its in t e g r it y "" . The attitude of the United States of America towards France has governed not only by its deep sympathy with the sufferings of the French people, hut also by the primary American policy of protecting the western hemisphere against any Axis aggression, whether direct or indirect. As late as the 27th May last, the French Ambassador assured the Under Secretary for State in Washington that the French fleet would never be surrendered, and that France would not allow Germany or It a l y to occupy any French base in NorthA f r i c a or on the Atlantic seaboard. It now seems possible that some of these solemn undertakings will be broken. The post of Delegate-General, occupied in No r t h Africa by General Weygand, has been abolished by Marshal Petain. action is the result of the threat that German forces w ill march into the French possessions of North Africa. Weygand seems to have done his best to keep to the letter and spirit of the undertakings of the Vichy Government, but the pressure on that government has been powerful and unscrupulous. It is p it if u l to reflect upon the pass to which the great people of France has been temporarily reduced. In truth, history has no parallel to this sort of defection on the part of a great and long-standing ally which has been defeated by the common enemy. The increased burden thus imposed upon B r it a in has been incalculable. I need nol stress the significance of the present Libyan offensive in relation to the French and Spanish possessions in North A'frica. I now turn to recent events in the Pacific. into formal association with the Axis powers, proclaiming its national as the establishment of a sphere "" in greater East Asia.. Early in the present year it signed a. non-aggression pact with Russia. fateful military Indc-'China. America and the British nations regarded Dr. Evatt. this incursion as an unequivocal act of aggression which directly menaced their vital interests. They at once took counter measures against Japan in the for m of stringent economic and financial restricbeen tions. Next came the intervention of President Roosevelt after his return from his Atlantic talks with Mr Churchill. It was then proposed that both Indo China and Thailand should be neutralized under the joint guarantee of the Pacific powers, provided that Japan withdrew forces from Indo-China. What was called a "" moratorium "" period then commenced, and preliminary conversations between Japan and the United States of America took place. They have been continued at Washington, and are now known as the Hull-Kurusu talks. It should be emphasized that the talks are confined to the United States of America and Japan, although, of course, they are of very great concern to the British, Australian. Netherlands and Chinese Governments. We are content to allow the leadership It seems certain that this and initiative in this matter to be retained by the United States of America, which is very directly affected by any armed aggression in the south-east corner of the Asiatic continent. A t the same time, I must express the hope that the talks will result in an agreement. If so. a new chapter might commence in the history of the relations between the leading Pacific powers. It is to be remembered that the occasion of the imposition of the economic restrictions upon Japan was that nation's military advance into French Indo-China at a time when the Government of France was under the direct domination of the Axis. I do not see why it should be impossible for Japan to retrace its steps and make possible the easing of the present economic restrictions, while Japan restores the status quo by withdrawing its fighting forces and equipment from French Indo-China. ButA year ago Japan entered all this would be of no avail if aggression in one particular quarter were to be policy abandoned only to be succeeded by aggres""co-prosperity sion elsewhere. Obviously, Great Britain could not look on with equanimity if Japanese forces attacked Russiai n the In July it made a north-west Pacific, or if the pressure incursion into French against China were to be redoubled in Both the United States of intensity. But an honourable arrangement with Japan might be of value to all courageous .resistance, the campaign succeeded in a little over a month. As the result, the military situation in the southof that resistance should have .some effect east of the Mediterranean littoral immediately improved. guarantees have been given by Great Britain as to the future independence of Syria and Lebanon, together with a declaration that we 'have no wish to detract from France's predominant position as against other European countries. The third example of drastic, but timely, preventive action has occurred in relation to Persia. A large number of Germans had entered this country in the guise of technicians. Without a doubt, their real purpose was fifth column action. In July, the Governments of the United Kingdom and Russia jointly requested a drastic reduction of the number of these so-called "" technicians "". Diplomatic pressure did not succeed. The United Kingdom and Russia immediately concentrated forces on.the Persian frontiers and entered the country in AugustIn September, the Anglo-Soviet terms were accepted. Subsequently there was a deliberate breach of the terms. Teheran was at once occupied, the Shah abdicated, and the Crown Prince succeeded him. All that was done was in substantial accordance with the firm treaty obligations of Persia to Russia. It is expected that an Anglo-Soviet-Persian treaty of full alliance will shortly be signed. Had it not been for this bold but necessary action the situation in Persia would have become out of hand. As it is, we are now .at liberty to organize measures to counteract the serious dangers likely to result from German penetration of the Caucasus. The consolidation of the position in Persia will be of incalculable value if Germany violates the neutrality of Turkey. Further, the clearing up of the Persian position has opened tbe way to the passage of essential supplies into Russia itself. The great political line of the Middle East includes not only Persia, Syria and Iraq, but also Turkey and Egypt. Axis pressure upon Turkey has become stronger since the beginning of the year. German military successes provided the requisite backing for subsequent diplomatic pressure in the Turkish capital. However, it is clear that Turkey did not .expect that Russia could resist Germany for any length of time, and the spirit in encouraging Turkey's determination to Satisfactory defend its territories against any German invasion. Something should now be said about the position of France. Nearly eighteen months have elapsed since Germany dictated the conditions of the 'German and French armistices. On the evening of the signing of the armistice, Mr Churchill said that His Majesty's Government had heard ""with grief and amazement"" that the terms dictated by the Germans had been accepted by the French Government, then at Bordeaux. ""They cannot feel"",, he added, ""that such or similar terms could have been submitted to by any French Government which possessed freedom, independence and constitutional authority."" None the less, the very obscure and difficult international position created by the Bordeaux Government, which subsequently became the Vichy Government, has been faced by the British people with forbearance and patience. Similarly the policy of the United States of America towards France has been based on its special and traditional sympathy with the French people. Indeed, .the United States of America has done everything possible to demonstrate its practical friendship with the French people. Food and medical supplies have been sent to unoccupied France, and to the North African colonies which were administered by General Weygand, who refused to become a willing tool of the Axis. Point by point, however, the French Government has yielded, or been compelled to yield., to the insatiable demands of Germany. French industries and commerce have been regimented into the German economy, and many Vichy administrators have connived at the importation into France, from the French colonial territories, of commodities known to be destined for Germany, thereby helping Germany to evade tbe British blockade. In May last President Roosevelt pointed out that Marshal Petain had assured the United States of America that it was not intended by Vichy to agree to any collaboration with Germany extending beyond the requirements of the resistance in the future as they have maintained it during the past five months and more. Stalin has declared his belief that Russia will resist at any rate right throughout the winter until the months of spring. Let us hope that he is right. A duty devolves upon our country and upon us all to do all we can to assist our ally. ""With our own heavy commitments there are many difficulties in the way, but we are doing our best to overcome them. We are providing certain medical equipment, and permission has been given to raise funds for Russian relief. Our predecessors contemplated an exchange of consuls with Russia, and the present Government has had under consideration the advisability of despatching a small delegation to Russia. Inquiries were made as to the feasibility of the proposal, but advice has recently been received from the British Ambassador in Moscow which recommends that, owing to the intense concentration of Russia in its fight to the death against Hitler, the despatch of a mission from this country might better be deferred for the time being. However, I place this on record as evidence of the great importance which we attach to our alliance with Russia in the present struggle. Russia is also at war with Finland, Hungary and Rumania. It is now established that, on the northern front, Finnish troops have gone far beyond the frontiers as they existed between Finland and Russia prior to 1939. In short, Finland is helping the Germans in operations, the object of which is a complete severance of the supply line which runs into Russia through Murmansk. The strongest representations were made to Finland both from the United Kingdom and the United States of America, urging that country to make a separate peace -with Russia upon the basis of the frontiers of 1939. These representations have been treated with something like contempt, and indicate that the large concentration of German forces in Finland before Germany invaded Russia in June last was part of a joint plan of attack. The subservience of Hungary and Roumania to Germany in the war against Russia has been even more complete. Hungary and Roumania are not only fighting against Russia, but for months before the present Dr. Evatt. war, allowed a free passage through their territories to German troops, giving the bland explanation that they were partners in Germany's "" new order "" in Europe. It is a strange feature of the present struggle that, while we are allies of Russia in the fight against Germany, we are still at peace with these three eager satellites and accomplices of Germany. Illustrations from other quarters support the opinion that, under certain conditions, strong and decisive action is the only common-sense method of preventing deterioration of diplomatic and political relations. FirstI take Iraq. Over a year ago the Prime Minister of that country, while continuing to pay lip-service to the British connection, embarked on a policy fundamentally opposed to British interests. He continued to intrigue with the Axis. He refused to break off diplomatic relations with Italy, and was about to resume diplomatic relations with Germany. German gold was freely spent by German agents and, finally, Rashid Ali seized power .by a coup d'etat, while still impudently professing loyalty to the alliance embodied in the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty. The usurper finally ordered his troops to attack the British forces. Fortunately, the strongest action was taken, the deposed Regent was reinstated, and the new Prime Minister and his Government are faithfully carrying out the treaty with Britain, having severed all diplomatic relations with governments whose loyalty to Great Britain he suspects. Syria is another illustration of the success of a firm policy. The local French authorities increasingly complied with Germany's wishes. There was marked evidence of German infiltration into the country. Its aerodromes were used by Germans to assist Rashid Ali's revolt in Iraq. Attempts to convey Great Britain's protests to Marshal Petain through diplomatic channels had no result. Finally, it was evident that the French in Syria were ready to acquiesce in the use of Syrian territory by the Germans for the purpose of their Middle East campaign, in this impossible situation, the only satisfactory course for the protection of our own fighting forces was to occupy Syrian territory. Despite is now exercised by us not occasionally, but from day to day and every day. When the history of this 'war conies to be written, it will show that recent interventions by this Commonwealth in international matters have played an important part in decisive phases of the struggle. Whatever it may be in point of legal form, the British Commonwealth is in fact an association of free nations possessing equal status in every aspect of their internal and external affairs. So much has been declared iby authoritative imperial conferences. But the recognition of status is one thing. The practical problem, of effective co-operation is another. Even in peace-time, when .connnon action is required, difficulties arise because of the constitutional status of the Dominions. In peace such difficulties are occasional, and time is seldom of the essence of the contract. In wartime all is changed. Decisions have to be made quickly. Without personal consultation, or even with personal consultation, occasions must arise when it is not possible to give effect to the wishes of all of the Dominions. But there is no short-cut solution of these difficulties. Similar difficulties arose during the war of 1914-18 and were gradually overcome. To-day, also, the administrative problems must be solved as we go along. Fortunately, there is no rigid formula which controls or limits the extent of our cooperation in the common cause. If things are not going so well as they should, we can and shall make changes in the method of consultation. In the supreme essential G-reat Britain and her Dominions are as one. We are all pledged to secure victory in the present war. Every step in diplomacy should be applied and is being applied to achieve that pnd. Without doubt, the outstanding feature of the war in 1941 was Germany's sudden attack on Soviet Russia in June last. This act of aggression merely added Russia to the long list of European victims. But serious miscalculations as to Russia's power of resistance were made, not only by Germany, but also by so-called experts throughout the world who forecast that the Panzer divisions would occupy Moscow within two, or capacity of the Russians to maintain their perhaps three, weeks. Mr 'Churchill did not share the opinions of the apostles of gloom. He immediately offered military and economic assistance to Russia. Shortly after, Britain made an agreement with Russia by which the two countries became allies for the purpose of prosecuting the war against Germany. It was a further condition of the alliance that neither side should make peace without the consent of the other. Mr Churchill's refusal to accept Germany's opinion as to Russia's power of resistance has been borne out by subsequent events. Russia has been pushed farther ancl farther back, but the resistance of the Russian armies and the Russian people will prove to be one of the epics of modern history. One of the chief features of the defence of the country has been the adoption of what is called the "" scorched earth policy "". In principle, such a. policy is self-explanatory. Its application, however, depends upon whether a. nation, is prepared to prefer its liberty to its property, and to sacrifice for liberty all the material possessions within its territories. One of the most striking features of the battle of France was the decision of the vacillating French Government to declare Paris an open city. This meant, in effect, that a great bastion of freedom, a great centre of industrial production was to be surrendered to the enemy without a blow. The people of England refused to follow this example. Similarly, the Russian policy has been the exact reverse of that of France. Its policy is based upon the postulate that nothing whatever matters if an alien dictator is to be at liberty to impose slavery and serfdom. As was well stated by Dr. W. G. Goddard at Brisbane on Armistice DayWc sec in this ""scorched e a r t h "" policy the sign of the determinedwill and spirit of the Russians. Cities can be rebuilt, gardens can be remade. But this spirit rises trium phant over all, and like a hero facing material ruin, defies the threat of the invader. This defiance is a voice that will ring down the ages, and brave men will hear its echo in the time to conic, and hearing it will take fresh courage. . . . It is not any "" is m "" that inspires this courage, but an essential human will to be free. . . It is humanity aflame and alive. I make no attempt to forecast the ternal Affairs) --by leave-It is by no means easy to present a picture of tbe international situation which will be fair, accurate and valuable. Tliere are almost daily changes of some kind on the diplomatic as well as the military front. Even while I speak fierce fighting in Russia and in Libya may turn the balance of decisive battles. In time of war strategy and diplomacy necessarily go hand in hand. In both fields we have sustained setbacks and reverses. But the great thing is to destroy the spirit of complacency and over-confidence, to learn from our setbacks, to be resolute until we achieve our final objective. It would be interesting to indulge in speculative debate on the war in general and on our relations with this country and with that-interesting , but unsafe. I do not intend to suggest any inferences where the knowledge that is necessary is incomplete. All I attempt to do is to refer to significant features of the intercome to see our own dangers far more national position, especially those in which Australia has a direct concern. At the outset I take the opportunity to state that the recent change of government in this country does not imply any vital change in Australia's foreign policy. bility than was possible twelve months Indeed, through the instrumentality of the Advisory War Council, continuity of external policy is assured to a substantial degree. All political parties in this country, every member of this Parliament, all of our citizens, are determined to resist Germany's mad ambition, which is nothing less than that of governing the entire world by either force or the threat of force. Those who have read Hitler's Mem Kampf will be strikingly aware of the fact that its author has finally abandoned the deceptive modesty of his claim for a revision of the Treaty of Versailles and for a reasonable amount of living space for all those of German blood. His present ambitions parallel the desperate attempt of Napoleon to bestride both Europe and Africa. His plan, as Mr here by distinguished Ministers from Sumner Welles has said., is one "" for universal conquest, for the cruel and brutal enslavement of all peoples, and for the ultimate destruction of the remaining free democracies"". That this is Germany's objective has become clearer as the theatres of war have extended. We are far better able to form a just judgment to-day than we were a year ago. Even then Hitler seemed to have subjugated a large part of Europe. British strategy was almost entirely on the defensive. The first air battle for Britain had gone well, but almost everywhere else the strategic initiative seemed to lie with the enemy. On the political and diplomatic side also there was much uncertainty, much ambiguity. Pew then appreciated the extent of the resolve of the people of the United States of America to defend the western hemisphere against Nazi aggression, either direct or indirect. The countries of the Middle East were doubtful in their sympathies. The Pacific situation had not crystallized. Above all, the intentions of Russia were shrouded in the mystery of propaganda and counterpropaganda. We are far more certain to-day of the intentions of the countries which doubted and which hesitated. I think we have clearly; we know far better where our enemies are; we are more certain of our friends. As a result, we are able to handle our external relations with a greater degree of assurance and responsiago. What are Australia's responsibilities? They are measured by its powers. Of recent years there has been a far greater understanding and appreciation of the status which the self-governing British dominions have attained, not only in their internal affairs but also in all their external relations. Most other countries have recognized that status to the full. Perhaps its most striking public recognition has been the exercise of the right of legation, which is a mark of sovereignty in international law. Within thepast two years this country has been accorded full diplomatic representation in the United States of America, in Japan and in China, with reciprocal representation all three countries. In this way the Commonwealth has attained the means of intervening directly in all matters affecting our contacts with the powers concerned. This right of direct intervention",53,Joint Committee On

I would be pleased if you would take this matter up with the Federal Cabinet and advise me if something cannot be done to protect these people, as suggested, for the duration of the war, and at least twelve months after the war, as, no doubt, you will agree with me, that something along these lines should be done immediately if we arc going to see that our people, particularly in country districts, are going to receive fair and reasonable treatment. I might mention that it is in the country districts that the small business man and farmers are suffering more than those in the city areas, due to the fact that a great number of enlistments and military call-ups are affecting small country towns more than they are the city, and I would be very much obliged if you would treat this matter as very urgent, and deal with it as soon as possible, as I can assure you that I have, as stated previously, seen many cases which I consider have not been fairly treated by the financial institutions. Hoping to hear from you on this matter after you have discussed same with the Federal Cabinet. I shall not give the name of the -writer of that letter for fear that he may be victimized should he have an overdraft at his bank. The matter has been placed before the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley), who is now dealing with it. In normal times bank managers endeavour to induce property owners to mortgage their holdings, and as an inducement terest are offered. interest rate is raised gradually, and then should difficult times arise as the result of drought, floods, wars or other calamities, the overdrafts are called in, bringing ruin to the borrowers. opinion, are the Hitlers industry and commerce. quiring the right to direct and control the credit and financial resources of the country and obtaining possession porarily of the savings of the people, the trading banks exercise a virtual ship over the economic life and welfare of the people. A small number of persons draw tribute from every district, township and hamlet. the control of the credit of the community they are able to determine what things shall be produced, and in what Sir. Baker. The trading banks, through the quantity of money they issue, exert a decided in fluence upon the value or purchasing power of currency, whether it be gold, silver, copper or paper. On the outbreak of war, following their usual technique, the financial institutions began to call in overdrafts, because new opportunities for investment offered higher rates of interest. When the Fadden Government was defeated, the financial institutions increased their technique fourfold, in order to prove to the people of Australia what happens with the advent of a Labour government. I make an appeal on behalf of persons who are hard-pressed by the financial institutions. Relief can be given to them only in one way, namely, by a moratorium.

163,B I L L Brought Up By Mr Chifley And,"to pay adult skilled labour, or a technical trainee, most of the large firms have adopted the attitude that the lower the wage, the greater the margin of profit. Over and above the 5s. an hour, they receive an extra payment of Is. an hour according to the value of the machine, and above that again they receive administrative costs. A lot of the work is semi-repetitive, and if a lad can be used at a shilling an hour, the margin of profit will be 4s. 6d. an hour gross, which allows the firm a profit of £9 I83. a week of 44 hours out of the work of one boy. This is a serious matter. I have made inquiries from people who are working under the scheme, and I am informed that the firms are paid an extra shilling an hour on machines owned by the Government. I have made inquiries from inside the Munitions Department itself, and this information appears to be correct. If this kind of thing is going on, it could be stopped within five minutes by a telephone communication to the department. It is true that the matter is to be inquired into, but in the meantime hundreds of thousands of pounds will probably be paid unnecessarily to these racketeers. For the sake of the Treasury, I hope that the information which I have conveyed to the committee is wrong, but I have checked the information to the best of my ability, and the only reason that I have not given names is my fear that my informants will be victimized. apply generally, or is it confined to cerrelief to deserving sections of the comtain favoured firms? that, whereas in the early days of the war these people were willing to pay almost any price for machines, they now prefer to lease them from the Government. [Extension of time granted.] After a machine has worked for 40 hours, the rent is covered and for the rest of the time that the machine works-and it may be in use for three eight-hour shifts or two twelve-hour shifts a day-the firm makes a profit on a machine which belongs to the Government During recent years numbers of refugee doctors, some of them highly skilled, have [35] taken sanctuary in Australia. Aa many Australian doctors have been called up for military service, there is a scarcity of medical men in this country, and I suggest that, subject to proper safeguards, the refugee doctors be allowed to practise. Some weeks ago I received a telegram from the clerk of the local shire council urging that a refugee doctor be appointed to Quilpie, which is west of Charleville, in Queensland. I brought the matter before the Minister for Social Services( Mr Holloway), who said that he would see what could be done in the matter. Many of these doctors came here to escape dictatorship; they should not be treated as enemies merely because they have German names. I remind the committee that in the last war many men with German names fought on our side, and that in the present war also that is happening. I ask that something be done in this matter promptly. The honourable member for Boothby (Dr. Price) referred to the work of aborigines and half-castes on cattle stations, but there is another side to this question. In my opinion, no coloured man is the equal of a white man. About 40 years ago we were told that white men could not work in the canefields. It is true that they were not prepared to work there for black man's wages, but when paid a proper wage they proved to be better workers than the Kanakas. The Government is to be commended on its intention to establish a mortgage bank, which should afford much needed munity. I hope that loans will be made available on easy terms, and that mortgagors will be given sympathetio treatment. In the meantime, a moratorium should be brought in. In this connection I bring before the committee the following letter:During the past few weeks I have had many requests from business people, farmers and small graziers to put before you and the federal authorities, a proposal to bring in a moratorium so that small business men, farmers and graziers will be protected, as, no doubt, you are aware that at the present time due to the effects of the war and droughty conditions, many people are being persecuted by the banks and other nnancial institutions. I have had many cases put before me just recently where farmers and small business men are being forced out of business due to unfair treatment by the bank and business",61,Estimates 1941 42 Revised Additions New Works Buildings Et C

166,Mr Baker (Maranoa) [2.12 A.m.],"Prices Commissioner he would have us believe that the reason for the reappearance on the market of the doublestriker matchboxes was that new stocks had been stacked in the warehouses in front of the old stocks, and that only when the new stocks had been got rid of did the supply of the old stocks come to light. But it seems remarkable that the new stocks became exhausted and the double-striker boxes appeared on the market immediately the match combine struck the people for an extra 2d. a dozen boxes. If the Prices Commissioner is going to fall down on his job, as he did with regard to tobacco and other commodities that are essential to the public, the operafor ten years that machine will tions of his department should be overhauled, and searching inquiries should be made before manufacturers are allowed to exploit the public, as they did with regard to the price of matches. I now draw attention to questions asked by me regarding the leasing of machine tools and the conduct of the Director of Machine Tools in the matter of controlling their sale. Colonel Thorpe, I notice, has repudiated all suggestions that any influence has been exerted by him in that direction. I admit that it is difficult to get people to make statements because they fear victimization at the hands of those interests which control the Munitions Department. However, I have sufficient proof that this "" racket"" is going on. I challenge Colonel Thorpe to deny that what I have said in regard to certain tools applies to some in which his firm is interested, tools machine. Whatever justification 'there which it manufactures on licence from overseas countries. The fact that the tools are not available is not due to a shortage of dollar exchange, because tools of that kind are manufactured in Great Britain. Firms requiring them have obtained quotations for deliveries from Great Britain at a date in advance of that on which Australian manufacturers have been able to promise them. Australian firms should not be allowed to put their private interests before the war effort. I have asked in this House, but have received no satisfactory reply to my question, whether it is a fact that certain firms working on a cost-plus basis are being paid an extra Is. an hour Mr Rosevear. of machine time for machines which they have rented from the Commonwealth. If this racket is going on the Commonwealth is being fleeced for perhaps hundreds of thousands of pounds every month. Early in the war, engineering shops were anxious to get machines of any kind. They were prepared to buy old machines and renovate them, and to pay any price for new ones. Now, the majority of those who want machines prefer to lease them from the Government at .10 per cent, of the price per annum, which amounts to f l 18s. 6d. a week for a machine costing £1,000. Unless the war lasts never be paid off. In my opinion, the firms are 'pretending for their own benefit that it is not desirable for them to buy the machines. They know that, when the war is over, the Government will have no use for the machines, and will sell them as junk to those in whose shops they are. Under the cost-plus system firms are allowed 5s. an hour of machine time irrespective of the value of the machine. Then they are allowed an extra Is. an hour for every £1,000 value of the machine, provided it is under ten years of age, whilst on those over ten years of age they are allowed an extra 6d. an hour. Thus, for a machine worth £1,000, they receive 6s. an hour if it is less than ten years old, and 5s. 6d. an hour if it is more than ten years old, regardless of the amount of wages paid for tending the may be for paying a firm Is. an hour over and above the ordinary 5s. an hour for working its own machine, there is certainly no justification for doing so if the machine is leased from the Government. Here is how it works out: The rent for a machine which cost £1.000 is about £1 18s. 6d. a week. If it is worked two long shifts, the firm charges for 133 hours at Is. an hour a total of £5 13s., thus making a profit of £3 14s. 6d. a week after paying the lease instalment on a machine that does not belong to it. Next comes the profit which it makes on the operator. The firm is paid 5s. an hour, plus 10 per cent., a total of 5s. 6d. an hour for the operator. Although this would be ample MacDonald. There was a conflict between the two services. Before MacDonald came into the field, there was a fortnightly service in the Peninsula, but since his advent the service has been somewhat improved. It was said, that if he presisted in running a service, the work would be made unprofitable. Air Lines of Australia is subsidized, whereas MacDonald is able to make his service pay without any subsidy. It was said that he had contravened regulation No. 79 by carrying on an ait' service. The general complaint was that he was operating his planes over the routes of subsidized services, but the Civil Aviation Department would not supply him with a licence. Had he obtained such a licence be would have been prepared to carry on an air service. From August, 1939, to August, 1940, his business grew enormously, because of the confidence of the people in him as a pilot, and because of the service which he rendered to them. In the wet season, in the early part of the year, it happened that Air Lines of Australia was not able to get through to the mining settlements, whereas MacDonald succeeded, and landed certain foodstuffs and mining machinery that were urgently required on the fields. He had purchased two aircraft for the purpose of carrying on his charter work, in order to give to the people the service to whicli they were entitled, but, since the promulgation of the amended regulation. No. 79, his planes have been grounded except on rare occasions. He has made application for permission to provide a service from Cairns to Port Moresby via Thursday Island. At the present time, W. B. Carpenter and Company Limited operate a service from Sydney to New G-uinea by way of various towns in Queensland, and carry passengers, freights and mails for these towns in Queensland as well as New Guinea. MacDonald seeks permission to do the same. ""When the. Minister for Civil Aviation gives consideration to this application, I hope that he will allow MacDonald to carry passengers, freights and mails to the Peninsula as well as to New Guinea. Tlie people in the north are complaining of the curtailment of the air services. They might only be utilized when stocks do not enjoy the rail and steamship services that are available to people in the southern portion of Australia, and, as they are almost entirely dependent on air services, 1 urge the Minister to give favorable consideration to MacDonald's application. I have not received complete replies to several questions that I have asked regarding price fixation and munitions. I shall refer first to the methods adopted by the Prices Commissioner and to the manner in which commodities used freely by the public are being cornered for the deliberate purpose of securing increases of prices. On the 5th November, and again on the 14th November, I drew attention to the fact that an artificial scarcity of matches had been created in the suburbs of Sydney. Since then I have received communications from other parts of New South Wales, and from other States, which indicate that the shortage was Commonwealth-wide until the Prices Commissioner saw fit to increase the price of matches. In the reply furnished to me I was informed that the rationing of matches had been voluntarily undertaken by the Federal Match Company, of Sydney, and by Bryant and May Proprietary Limited, of Melbourne, on account of the shortage of raw materials, principally potassium chlorate; but it is remarkable that the shortage of chemicals ceased at the time when the price of matches was increased. I was informed by the Minister for Trade and Customs (Senator Keane) that the Prices Commissioner had made inquiries into the supply of matches in order to ascertain whether traders were withholding supplies with a view to building up stocks in the event of an increase of the price, but that no instance had been disclosed of traders having withheld stocks with a view to obtaining unjustifiable profits. Any housewife knows that, whilst supplies of matches were rationed before the increase of the price, no rationing of that commodity occurs to-day. This fact seems to indicate that hoarding has taken place. The Prices Commissioner also reported that new stock was generally stacked in front of old stock, and that, as a few gross of boxes of matches were generally held on hand, old double-striker stock were almost exhausted.

168,"Mr Riordan (Kennedy) [1.40 A.m.]. Cairns., High Up I N The Peninsula.","so badly treated for a century and a half, and in respect of wbich Australia, in recent years, has been pilloried at the Assembly of the League of Nations. We cannot run away from the problems associated with aborigines and half-castes, even if we desired to do so. Tbe pure aboriginal population is declining in numbers and only about 50,000 are left; hut the half-caste population is increasing at the rate of 1,000 a year and now numbers about 25,000. In less than a century we may well have over 100,000 half-castes in Central and Northern Australia, who, like the present generation of aboriginals and half-castes in the area may become magnificent cattle workers, even allowing for the fact that they may be the offspring of the worse type of white fathers and degraded and detribalized native mothers. Great difficulty is being experienced in dealing with the problem of miscegenation in outback and remote Australia. Tor an authoritative statement on this subject. I refer honourable members to the Blakeley report on the Northern Territory, which was made only a few years ago. Briefly, we have three main needs. First, we require a federal policy for the control of the aboriginal aud half-caste population, similar to that which has been applied in the TJnited States of America. During the last six years President Roosevelt has instituted ""a new deal "" for Indians and has achieved excellent results. I was working on this problem in the United States just prior to tlte outbreak of tbe war. Many of our Australian tribes are migratory and require federal supervision. The State Governments, however, are somewhat nervous of Commonwealth control, for they rightly consider that the handling of the native population problem by the Commonwealth has not been inspiring. In the second place, we need an up-to-date and scientific policy for our aborigines, similar to the American policy for Indians. At present there is a conflict of cattle men, some of whom desire still further to detribalize and exploit the natives; the missionaries, who emphasize religious motives and who, in many places, have done fine work; and the scientists who, in some instances, would make the natives museum specimens in isolated reservations. Recent work in the United States of America shows that the best results in dealing with natives are obtained by training them iu industries which they like, and which are suitable to the environment that they need. The government of the United States of America tried to train Mescalero Apache Indians to work on sheep stations. The policy succeeded with the Navaho Indians, who are now the most rapidly increasing racial group of the United States of America, but it totally failed with the Mescalero Apaches, who become dole-supported hangers-on in the reservations. The Government then tried to train the Mescalero Apaches to work on cattle stations and that policy is succeeding. From what I have heard in Australia, particularly of successful aboriginal cattle stations in Western Australia, I have formed the opinon that a final and successful solution of aboriginal problems may be achieved in this direction. Our third need is a continuous and long-term policy. This applies, not only to the aboriginal problem, but also to almost all of tbe problems of the Northern Territory. How can we expect any real and T:ontinuous success, when each Minister for the Interior merely visits the Northern Territory, proclaims that he will introduce a. progressive policy which will be the salvation of the area, and then, within a few weeks, relinquishes his portfolio? The new Minister for the Interior (Senator Collings) has proclaimed a "" new deal"" for the unfortunate aborigines, but it will not be carried through on the basis of the vote proposed in this Appropriation Bill. I trust that the honourable gentleman will make a thorough investigation of the methods that have been developed for dealing with native peoples in the United States of America, Canada and New Zealand, and -in some of the Australian States. I hope, also, that he will learn something from these methods which will be applicable to the aboriginal and half-caste population of Australia. Successful reforms may not prove expensive, but may result in a real "" new deal"" for these unfortunate people, and remedy a state of affairs which has been a scandal through 150 years of Australian history, and which not contribute to a material degree to the death of the member shall lie upon the commission.

I come now to the main report of the Eepatriation Commission, which shows that applications for service pensions, that is, applithe hca.riug of appeals, be bound by any rules cations by returned soldiers who become unemployable before reaching the age of 65, at which age they would become entitled in the ordinary course to the old-age pension, are constantly increasing. The total payments in respect of service pensions increased from £111,840 in 1936, to £533,622 in 1941, the amounts for the intervening years being: 1937, £263,279; 393S, £360,815; 1939, £439,55'2; 1940, £4S4,4S2. Whilst applications for service pensions, that is, just given it would appear that this prinapplications by men who suffered no actual disability during the war, are increasing, payments to men who actually sustained disabilities, or injuries, during the war are decreasing. The only conclusion"" to be drawn from that fact is t.hajt the repatriation authorities are entirely unsympathetic towards this class of applicant. The total amount paid in respect of war pensions to ex-soldiers and their dependants totalled £7,440,901 in 1936, and increased to £7,599,599 in 1937, reaching the peak of £7,725,963 in 1938, after which they declined to £7.534,677 in 1940, and to £7,346,265 in 1941. These figures show that the treatment meted out to the ex-soldiers who actually sustained injuries during the war and their dependants is not so sympathetic as that given to ex-soldiers merely on tbe ground that they are unemployable. The latter have only to prove that they served in a theatre of war, and that they have become unemployable. Medical evidence that they are unemployable is sufficient proof. One wonders whether the unsympathetic treatment meted out to applicants for pensions on the ground of injury received during the Avar is due simply Repatriation Commission or to lack of evidence in support of the claims of applicants. Obviously, much of the evidence which would have been available to the ex-soldier some years ago had he then decided to apply for a pension, has since been lost; bis claim is further weakened by the fact that many witnesses have died. Section 45w (2) of the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act readsSubject to tliis net an Appeal Tribunal and an Assessment Appeal Tribunal shall not. iu of evidence but shall act according to substantial justice and the merits of the case aud shall give to an appellant the benefit of tlie doubt: Provided tliat if the appellant or a representative of the appellant shall make out a prima facie case in support of his claim that the incapacity from whicli he is suffering or from which he has died was caused or aggravated by war service, the onus of_ proof that such incapacity was not in fact so caused or aggravated shall lie with the commission. Judging from the figures which I have ciple has not been applied. Certainly, that fact is clear from the cases which have been brought to my personal notice. I submit that the principle should be applied in respect of not only appeal tribunals but also the commission itself in the first instance. We know, of course, that an appeal tribunal is naturally inclined to lean towards the opinion of the body from which the appeal is made. The section continuesProvided further that in the case of the death caused by an accident of a member oi the forces, who is wholly or partially incapacitated as the result of war services, th» burden of proving that such incapacity did sergeant in tlie Australian Imperial Foroe called up for the duration of the war receives the following daily rates of pay and allowances: Pay, l is . ; wife's allowance, 4s. 6d.; allowances for three children, 5s.; and subsistence allowance, if not messing with, the regiment, 3s. 5d.; total, £ 1 2s. l i d . That represents £16 Os. lOd. a fortnight. A sergeant in. the Permanent Forces receives as pay £11 13s. 6d. a fortnight, from which is deducted 16s. a fortnight for superannuation, which leaves hi m £10 17s. 6d. compared with £16 Os. lOd. for a sergeant in the M i l it i a . Oommonwealth child endowment scheme has been in force, the sergeant in the Permanent Forces has lost the child allowances which he formerly received from the Department of the Army in respect of which he used to pay to the A r m y £12 a year and receive in return from the department 5s. a week in respect of each child under the age of sixteen. He now retains that £12 a year, but it is included in the figures which I have cited. He receives child endowment bnt. so does the man in the M i l it i a , who also receives an allowance for dependent children. A difference of nearly £5 fortnightly between the wages of two sergeants doing similar work can hardly be regarded as just. The sergeant in the Permanent Forces is one of the nuclei of the M i l it a r y Forces of this country. sergeants with permanent, employment, whereas sergeants in the M i l it i a are employed merely for the duration of the war. Mr BY AN -Yes, but the discrepancy is too great. I concede that the sergeant in the Permanent Forces does receive advantages which are not received by Militia sergeants. For instance, his wife and family receive medical attention. benefit of cost of living adjustments. for reducing the difference between the two rates of pay. The number of married men in the permanent forces cannot be large and therefore the burden involved in increasing their rates of pay could not be great. The Government should look into the matter, and see whether some small increase should not be made in order to bring the pay of the sergeants and other married men in the Permanent Forces more into line with that of similar ranks in tlie Militia... Perusal of the last annual report of the War Pensions Entitlement AppealT r i bunal more than bears out ""my contention during; the debate on tbe amending repatriation legislation that the tribunal interprets the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act to the disadvantage of returned soldiers and their dependants. When I spoke on the bill I said that Since the 90 per cent, of the appeals to that tribunal which had come to my notice had been, rejected. I did not exaggerate the position because the only case in which the appeal was upheld resulted in the War Pensions Assessment Tribunal reducing the amount to which the applicant was entitled. Afte r having fought his case before the tribunal for two years this returned soldier found, after winning his appeal, that his pension had actually been reduced. Therefore, to say that 95 per cent, of the cases were decided against the returned soldiers was an understatement of the facts. The figure should have been 100 per cent. All of the cases with which I was concerned involved constituents of mine, and, although I suspected that their experiences with the tribunal were common to ex-service men all over Australia. I had no means at my disposal of proving that to be the case. As a member of the Printing Committee, I came across the typewritten report of the WaaPensions Entitlement Tribunal, which does not form a part of the report of the Repatriation Commission. As I have already said, the figures in that report bear out the truth of my contention about the way in which the War Pensions Appeal Tribunal treats returned soldiers and their dependants. Of 502 appeals by dependants of deceased ex-soldiers, 450 were disallowed, and only 52 allowed. Approximately nine out of ten applications are rejected. The figures for the respective States are as follows: Queensland, disallowed 65, allowed 6; New South Wales, 155, 19; Victoria, 155, 15; South Australia, 27, 5; Western Australia, 45, 4; Tasmania, .1.2, 3.

Resolution reported and adopted. OrderedThat Mr Chifley and Mr Lazzarini do prepare and bring in a bill to carry out the foregoing resolution. read a first and second time. In committee: The bill. On Tuesday last I asked the Minister for Health( Mr Holloway) if , in view of the report iu the daily press that a deputation of refugee alien doctors asked him to be allowed to practise medicine in Australia., would the Minister take adequate steps to ensure that their credentials would be examined so that the people of this country would be safeguarded from being exploited by incompetent or unskilled medical practitioners. I now ask the honourable gentleman to give to the committee an assurance that before any decision is made in connection with this matter he will afford an opportunity for those who oppose the granting of permission to refugee doctors to practise in Australia to place their views before him. Many millions of pounds have been expended in this country in students are trained for the professions. that some of the most eminent medical men in the world were trained in Australian universities. During the last few years we have given sanctuary to many alien refugees. Because of the treatment to which they were subjected in their native lands we were glad to be able to welcome them to a country where they would be permitted to live in comfort and security; but we did not think, that those of them who had been trained in the science of medicine would be permitted to compete w it h our own medical men. The qualifications of a large number are open to doubt. I have met some of them. A few weeks ago, one arrogant fellow came to me and' said that he demanded the r i g h t to practise his profession in this country. "" I was brought here"", he said, "" and the practice of my profession is the only way in which I can earn my l i v in g "" . I asked him, "" What would happen to an Australian doctor in Germany? Would he be allowed to practise his profession there ? "" To his affirmative reply, I gave the rejoinder, "" Yes-in a concentration camp"". Many of these people in and tlie larger cities of Australia are putting up namejilates advertising themselves as consultants. An injustice would be done to Australian medical men who, at considerable sacrifice, financial and otherwise, have gone overseas with the fighting forces, if these men were allowed to take their livelihood from them. For that reason, I hope that the Minister will seriously weigh the consequences before allowing these men to practise. A t all events, he should consult the British Medical Association about the matter. Many of these refugee doctors have been before our courts for having illegally practised their profession. If I had my way, those who have found sanctuary in our country, but are not prepared to abide by our laws, would be put into a concentration camp until the war ended, when I would send them back to the countries whence they came. I protest against any move that might be made to endanger the position of Australian doctors in the fighting forces, and I also impress upon the Minister the necessity to safeguard erecting universities at which the health of the. people by ensuring thai only men whose qualifications are as high It is our proud boast a."" those demanded from doctors trained in Australia shall be allowed to practise. I believe that in Australia we train the lwst doctors in the world. direct the attention of the Minister for the Army( Mr Forde) to the disadvantage of married men in the Permanent Forces as compared with married men in the M i l it i a Forces.

If it were right to adopt that in every way better fitted than he course in one case, I cannot understand why the honourable member has failed to secure a similar suspension in respect of Western Australia. The solution is to be found in the re-establishment of an Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers to serve distant parts of Australia. In this country, there are two economic centres, one in Sydney and the other in Melbourne. Until the power of the rings that control economic centres is broken, the distant parts of the Comwill be equally efficient. I can see no monwealth will never develop as they should. --Order! The honourable member's remarks are not related to the bill. to the subject by discussing the position part I , too, disown it. of the less populous States, and the matter of grants. I have supported the remarks of the honourable member for Richmond generally, and there is not a great deal more that can be said, except that so long as we allow the present position to remain, we shall have to provide annual grants of this nature. The solution that the honourable member for Richmond suggested is the correct one. I do not agree with the action of the Government in reappointing Sir George Pearce to the Commonwealth Grants Commission. In my most charitable mood, I think that it was an outrageous blunder to appoint a man who has so antagonized the workers of this country that hardly -a trade unionist in any part of Australia has a good word to say for him. When the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) half-redeemed his fame by destroying the Bruce-Page Government, Sir George Pearce supported Mr Bruce's attempt to abolish the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. to Sir George Pearce do not come within the scope of the bill. Pearce was recently reappointed ' a member of the Commonwealtli Grants Commission. When can I speak my mind about him. if I am prevented from doing so on this bill? I repeat that 1 strongly disagree with the appointment. There are hundreds of men who are to serve on the commission. In fact, any one of hundreds of good supporters of the Labour party should have been preferred to Sir Georgt Pearee. However, he will remain a member of the commission for a period of three years, and the principal work of that body will continue to be done by the chairman, as it was done in the past. In that capacity, Sir Frederic Eggleston rendered excellent service, as did his predecessor; and probably Professor Mills virtue in the reappointment of Sir George Pearce, and I deeply regret that the Government acted as it did. The reappointment of the right honourable gentleman will be repudiated by many thousands of Labour people, and for my Question resolved in the affirmative.

If we had in operation the Canadian system, or that of SouthA f r i c a , we could truly say that we were a unified nation; but although we are unified in the sense that we have one flag, one language, and one destiny, we have, in time of peace, six sovereign States, frustrating the Commonwealth, and, in time of war, six sovereign States, which are a nuisance aud may be a danger. have the States separate taxing powers, which are exercised differently, making it extremely difficult for the Commonwealth to achieve uniformit y in anything, but they also have a different outlook on almost every question of public importance. Commonwealth Government to do the best for the nation is not assisted by the existence of separate sovereign States. Until such time as we get a unified nation, Parliament will have to pass a Oommonwealth grants bill every year. There is inherent in the Constitution a power which if properly exercised would bring us nearer to u n if o r m it y ; I refer to the financial power. would exercise that power to a greater degree, it would eventually reduce the States to the point at which they would all be the recipients of assistance from the Commonwealth, and we should probably have to tax at the rate of £.1 3s. 6d. in the £1 and then give back to the States, in consequence of the recommendations of the Commonwealtli Grants Commission, what Parliament thought was f a i r in order to enable them to carry on certain services. Concurrently, we should have to take over some of their responsibilities for social services. Tn that way, this Parliament would become more and more important, and the States less important. The desire of tlie honourable member to iiiicrease the membership of this Parliament finds support on all sides. In 1933, the Drakeford) made a great contribution to the literature upon the subject. Mr Oalieell. discussed this matter with members of all parties, and it seems to me that it should be easy to pass a bill to increase the membership of the Senate to 72, and to double the number of members of this House. A House of, say, 150 members would be none too large for the responsibilities that it has to discharge both in peace and in war. Part of the argument against greater powers being given to Parliament is that there are only 75 members in. this House. People say: ""Fancy governing Australia from one centre by that small number of members!"" I can understand some of the objections of the le3s populous No t only States to being governed by so few members. If this Parliament contained sufficient mem hers to be really representative of the nation, a lot of that feeling would disappear and ptiblic opinion would force a reduction of the number of The desire of the members in State parliaments, and that would eventually result in the elimination of overlapping as well as in considerable savings.

Unfortunately, the Commonwealth Parliament does not control tbe whole of the economic lif e of the community. Its powers are limited in a number of directions.

They know that they are in a hopeless minority, but they also know that they are of greater value to the Commonwealth than any similar number of people in Australia. They are as loyal as are the people of any other part, of Australia. It is all very well for honourable members to say that, after the war, room can be made for our returned men in the factories. If we are to produce goods iu the factories to sell abroad so as to bring new money to the country we shall be doing something that, we have never been able to do before. Let us manufacture, if we can, but let us do it off our own bat as do the primary producers. Just after this war broke out, the Commonwealth Government negotiated the sale of an enormous quantity of primary product? to the United Kingdom. In what position would Australia have been if that sale bad nor been made if we were without tbe credits with which it is providing us? remember that it was only primary products that we were able to sell. Why did we not sell clothing, boots, nails or galvanized iron? I am sure that this new order cannot be attained by any tinkering with our present ffccal policy.

Taxation in Victoria is low largely because of the trade which that State does with Western Australia. Australia's exports, which in reality produce Australia's income, aiv valued at. £'!6 per head of population, but Western Australia exports goods to the value of £3S per head. Therefore, the people of Western Australia, are doing a great deal move than those of any other part of Australia to maintain Australia's credit abroad. Melbourne and suburbs have ten members in this chamber, yet. rhe people whom they represent do not produce 6d. worth of goods per head for export. Nevertheless, they have in this chamber twice the voting power of the representatives of Western Australia. Mr CAr.wE-tx -The people whom they represent consume more than do the I do not expect any people of Western Australia. the world's markets to absorb our products. It. can bo shown that Western Australia purchases each year approximately £10,000,000 worth of goods from the eastern States, principally Under the from Victoria. In return, the people of the eastern States buy £1,000,000 worth of goods from us, leaving us with an adverse trade balance of £9,000,000. If Western Australia were Nor can we provide for free to develop in its own way, and could expend that £10.000,000 hi the world's market purchasing goods that it required, it would save £3,000,000 in the process, and establish friendly relations with other nations in. the course of that trade and receive better reciprocity. I have heard much talk about a new order after the war, but I have never heard a reasonable proposition as to how it is to be brought to achieve a better order, to develop this wonderful continent and to occupy it effectively, is to develop our trade with other countries. Western Australia is ( Mr as far away from the eastern States as is New Zealand. It costs as much to ship goods to Western Australia by sea as to ship them to New York or London. In fact, the freight from Melbourne to Fremantle is higher than from Melbourne to London.

202,Mr Cat.wbiyl,"Western Australia is£6 14s. 6d., and in New South Wales, £8 13s. 3d. After attempting to compare the social sendees of the different States, the commission struck an average of the per capita taxation in the three eastern States, in order to arrive at what ought to be paid to the three claimant States. Thus Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania relatively get the benefit of the average of New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland, which amounts to approximately £7 17s. 3d. per capita. Therefore,, by reason of the system axlopted, there is retained all over Australia the implementation of very high taxation; because the taxation imposed by Queensland and New South Wales is automatically repeated in Tasmania, South Australia and Western Australia. Since the last war the taxation per capita, Commonwealth and State, as revealed by the figures quoted in the report, has more than doubled. In 3918-19, the combined Commonwealth and State taxation was £8 14s. 6d. per capita. The report reveals that for the year 1939-40 it was £20 12s. per capita. It is rapidly rising, and I cannot conceive what the present figures would reveal. In suggesting that steps be taken with a view to securing a unified system of government to replace the federation, I do not wish to convey the idea that the entire difference between State and Federal taxation would necessarily be saved to the taxpayer. Every one realizes that the services performed by the States have to be carried on by means of the money provided. Hospitals, police, education, justice, agriculture, irrigation, public works, and sundry other functions would have to be continued, and the money for them would have to be raised. But I believe that if one Parliament imposed taxation there would be greater hesitancy on the part of that single authority to levy crippling taxes in any particular direction. Under the present system of double taxation, neither the Federal nor the State authority realizes the disastrous effects of the taxes imposed. Some relief must be granted to the taxpayers, and one of the greatest measures of relief, apart from reductions of taxes, would be tbe simplification of taxation returns, which at present, present a problem to almost every individual whose income is more than a few pounds a week. If we are to solve our problems of the future, we must improve our system of government, and when we are considering a-report of the Commonwealth Grants Commission is a fitting occasion to express our ideas on this subject. I believe that the members of this Parliament are too few. The House of Representatives consists of only 74 members with a vote, although the parliaments of countries with comparable populations have several hundred members The Parliament of the Union of South Africa has over 150 members, who represent a population of about 2,000,000. If the Commonwealth Parliament had a larger number of members than at present, many of our political problems could be solved, because the voting on important public questions would not be so close as it has been in the last few years. -The honourable member should not go deeply into the subject of constitutional reform, but sliould confine his remarks to the bill. a measure providing for the payment of large grants to certain States by constitutional means. If I cannot speak on. this matter now, no other opportunity may be provided. appropriate time for a discussion on constitutional reform. The question is whether tlie payments provided for in the bill shall be made to tlie claimant States. to show that the very fact that those payments are to be made to those States in such a generous measure is a barrier to constitutional reform. I emphasize the necessity for such reform, even in the interests of the States to which the payments will be made, because, after all, our destiny is interwoven as Australians rather than as residents of States. For the benefit of Australia it is necessary to have a system of government that will meet the changing needs of the times. We are living under an",75,Prime Minister S Department

206,Mr Anthony,"I have endeavouredCommonwealth and State company taxes. Commonwealth and Stateg if t duties. Customs and excise duties, inspection fees of various kinds. Licence-fees in respect of wireless, motor appropriate during the consideration of vehicles, dogs and other matters. The history of Commonwealth taxation is interesting. It would appear that it was not intended at the inception of federation that the Commonwealth should duplicate fields of taxation to any great degree by the States. For the first ten years of federation the Commonwealth collected only customs and excise duties; then the land tax was added. In 1914, estate duties were imposed by the Commonwealth, and in 1915 income taxes were levied. The Commonwealth entertainments tax followed in 1916, and the war-time profits tax in 1917. I do not believe that the framers of the Commonwealth constitution nor those who voted for it3 adoption, contemplated that the Commonwealth would ever enter so many fields of taxation whioh circumstances have compelled it to do, or that the duplication of taxation would occur to the degree it has. It is frequently beyond the physical and accounting capacity of many taxpayers to prepare their returns, let alone submit them within the prescribed times, and failure to do so brings upon them fresh additional penalties. gentleman's solution of these difficulties? increasing number of people in Australia are coming to the conclusion that a revision of the constitution is essential in order to eliminate overlapping in Commonwealth and State administrations. This conclusion has been forced upon them because so many demands are being made upon the same purse. Circumstances over which we have little control -the circumstances of war-ar e leading us steadily to the conclusion that the days of absolute sovereignty of the States must come to an end if the people of Australia are to fashion for themselves an effective organization of government necessary to meet the changing needs of society, rapidly being revolutionized by war. I am speaking straight for a unified system of government for Australia; I am taking advantage of the fact that many members of the present Government, and T believe the policy of the party to which they belong, favour unification. A number of members on this side of the House hold the same view. The time is a. States Grants Bill to call attention to this particular matter. In order to revise the Constitution, a new federal convention may be necessary to formulate definite proposals for a referendum of the people, and to secure a majority of the electors voting in a majority of the States. Attempts to secure constitutional revision on previous occasions failed because it was made a party question. I hoped that might be avoided. Although there might be a majority of electors voting in favour of any proposals submitted, there might not be a majority iu a majority of the States. Eveni f an overwhelming majority of the electors of, for example, the States of New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria, voted in favour of unification, if the support of one of the other States could not be secured, the road would be barred. always be relied on to do that. my next point. The grants recommended by the Commonwealth Grants Commission, based as .they are on the principle that the higher the taxation in the eastern States, the higher should be the grant paid to the claimant States. It has been such easy money that the claimants will have little incentive to favour revision of the Constitution. So long as heavy automatic grants are made to Tasmania, South Australia and Western Australia, those States will stand in the way of a unified Australia, despite all the reasons that may be advanced in favour of it ; and the report of the commission contains some very good ones. The people of Australia may have been complacent in past years in regard to the inefficiency and expense of governmental machinery, but the mounting burden, of taxation and the pressure on private purses must compel everyone to try to seek a way out of the mire. Tlie grants for which this bill makes provision have a per capita basis, which is calculated according to the rate of expenditure in the most extravagant States. For example, the taxation per capita in Queensland, which is a highlytaxed State, is £8 4s. In Victoria, it is",76,Prime Minister S Department

210,Mr Anthony,"That leads me toStatesconcerned. The report contains a wealth of information and reveals certain facts wlych should be brought to the notice of Parliament ancl of the country generally^.' A tahle in the report shows that for the financial year 1939-40 an amount of £54,386,000 was collected in State taxation. In addition, out of the £90,000,000 revenue which the Commonwealth received the States received £.1.8,691,000. Therefore, out of Commonwealth and State revenue from taxation in that year totalling £144,000,000 the States received over £73,000,000, or more than half of the total collections by the Commonwealth and the States. The report of the commission reveals that in the period from 1930-31 to 1.939-40, the Commonwealth Government paid to the various States, from its revenue, no less a sum. than £167,417,000. Payments to the States by the Commonwealth began, of course, at the inception of Federation ; but since the appointment of the Commonwealth Grants Commission in 1933, the claims of the States of ""Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania have been placed on a more scientific ]?a.sis. In the seven-year oppressive degree that it must ultimately period 192S-1934, before any of the commission's recommendations became operative, Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania received £9,388,000 in Commonwealth grants, whereas in the following seven-year period under the Commonwealth Grants Commission they received £16,020,000. The annual average in the first seven-year period was £1,335,000 and in the second sevenyear period £2,288,000. I mention this not because I am opposed to the payment of grants by the Commonwealth to the States mentioned, but because I am anxious to bring the situation into proper perspective. the time has arrived for a reexamination of the functions, responsibilities and burdens of the States and of those of the Comanonwealth, particularly since the beginning of the war. In my view it is necessary in the interests of the whole community, that the relations of the Commonwealth and the States should be re-examined. I offer two reasons in support of this contention. First, the Commonwealth is now exercising, under the National Security Act, so many functions which cut across the peace-time interpretations of the Constitution, and has invaded so many fields formerly occupied exclusively by the States, specially in relation to primary products, that it will probably be impossible to revert to pre-war conditions after the war ends, especially in respect of marketing. Unless some decisive move is made during the war period to revise the Commonwealth Constitution, it is likely that people engaged in primary industries will find themselves facing almost insuperable constitutional difficulties in relation to their marketing organizations after the war. We should therefore consider the substitution of our present constitutional machinery, by some other machinery which will permit of the preservation after the war of the marketing organizations established under national security regulations. My second reason for suggesting that we should, at this juncture re-examine our Constitution is that the duplication of taxation by Commonwealth and State Governments has developed to such an retard the progress and prosperity of the people of the Commonwealth as a whole. The burden of taxation, must be considered not only in relation to its complexity in varieties, but also in relation to its difficulties in respect of the preparation of returns. Nowadays, it is almost impossible for an ordinary individual to prepare, in proper form, all the returns he is expected to submit to the taxing authorities. Confusion is added to confusion because different methods of assessment in respect of income tax and other forms of taxation are employed by the Commonwealth and I believe that the States. The list of the variety of taxes is impressive. It includesCommonwealth and State income tax. Special income tax. Unemployment relief taxes. State development taxes. Wage taxes in one form or another. Commonwealth and State land taxes. Sales tax. Commonwealth and State probate and estate duties. Entertainments taxes. Gold taxes. Flour tax. Payroll tax. country districts by means of the mail order system ancl mailed advertising. The legislation may in that way help to develop secondary industries in country districts. Tlie honourable member for Wentworth deprecated the use of essential services as taxing mediums. The honourable gentleman was a Minister in a government which taxed the most essential of all commodities, the people's food. It also taxed clothing, another essential, and conveyances, which provide another essential service. orable member is not discussing the question before the Chair, which is the continuance of this measure for a given period. The schedule has been passed. ber for Wentworth objected to the principle of taxing essential services. I repeat that this measure represents no departure in that respect from our past practice. I have already mentioned several services which are already subject to tax. Even the furniture in tlte homes of our people is subject to tax. Consequently, no reason exists why a tax of this kind should he restricted on the grounds advanced by the honourable member. I hope that the committee will agree to the bill in its present form ancl regard it as an essential war measure, in order to enable the Government to obtain a portion of the revenue which it requires so urgently.

214,Mr Anthony (Richmond) [11.34].,"stultify the Government's efforts to raise additional revenue. the honourable member has been a member of a government which brought down severe increases of taxation, yet he seeks to impose on the present Government a restriction to which he when .a Minister would never have agreed. sarily follow that if a former government failed to realize its responsibilities ])ast only from budget to budget, and from the -present Government should also do so. Opposition members may have thought that the principle was wrong, and may think now that, as Government supporters are the champions of Government-controlled essential services, they should not seek to continue to impose the maximum of taxes on the people who use those services. This proposed new clause has not been drafted in order to restrict the Government in the future to further expand its revenues, but thei'e must be a limit. If the purpose of the Government is to prevent the people whom it professes to represent from enjoying the amenities offered by essential services, it should say so. Otherwise the Government should accept the proposed new clause. Had the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Harrison) spoken any longer, he would have convinced himself of his sincerity in moving the proposed new clause, but not us, and, I should say, not his own colleagues. honourable member had ample opportunity as a Minister to limit the duration of taxation bills which were introduced by the Government of which he was a member to the period of the war and six months thereafter, which is what he wants this Government to do with this bill. We may find it necessary to meet a post-war collapse by imposing even heavier taxation than is now contemplated. Government officials estimate that after the war at least 600,000 men and women, will be searching for work. They will not be earning money whicli can be taxed, ancl will have to be provided tion after the war will substantially for in some way. Whatever be the way, taxes will have to be levied in order to provide for them. After the war the Government will be faced with the necessity to find huge sums of money with which to pay deferred pay to returned soldiers. Had the Fadden budget been accepted further huge sums would have had to be raised in order to repay the compulsory loans for which it provided. No one can predict what conditions will operate after the war ends, and the Government is justified, therefore, in seeking to obtain revenue in this way. Taxation measures of any kind year to year. In the next budget the postage rate may be increased or reduced-n o one can tell-and to gay, with the semblance of sincerity, that the operation of this measure should be limited in the way intended in the proposed new clause is ridiculous, and I hope that the Government will stand its ground and refuse to accept the proposal. limitation aimed at in the proposed new clause moved by the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Harrison) is pointless, because no government would be bound by it. Immediately the legislation on which the limitation was based expired it could be re-enacted. I stress the point made by the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Rosevear) that post-war problems may make it necessary to impose even heavier taxation than is now contemplated. One of the great problems which will confront the Government after the end of the war will be the rehabilitation of country districts, which have been The depopulated by thousands of people going to the cities to work in the munitions industry and other industries owing to their inability to find work in country towns. Some of the new postage rates on advertising pamphlets, catalogues and articles of that description with which rural areas are flooded by big metropolitan stores member will not be permitted to refer any further to the rates. The committee has already disposed of the schedule. the continued operation of this legislaassist in rehabilitating country districts if it prevents metropolitan wholesale and retail houses from exploiting the",79,Chatrman Mb Pbowse Th E Presentation Of The Report Of The

221,Mr Clark,"I am pointing out thatcharges for all places located in areas up to 25 'miles from the centre of the network, and a reduction of Id. in the intermediate and night rates for places beyond 25 and 30 miles. In respect of Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth and Hobart, somewhat similar reductions were made in the call charges to places up to 25 miles distant from the centre of the network. The reason for differential treatment in the capital city networks is the fact that the network boundaries in .Sydney and Melbourne are fixed at 15 miles, and in tbe other capital cities at 10 miles, from the general post office. The reduced rates are fully justified ancl have, to some degree, removed the anomaly which existed, particularly in Sydney and Melbourne, that subscribers situated immediately beyond the boundaries of the network were required to pay 4d. plus tlie relevant unit fee charge for calls to places within the metropolitan network boundaries, whereas those a short distance away, but within the boundaries of the network, obtained service at the unit fee rate of lid. The lionorable members for Lang( Mr Mulcahy), Griffith( Mr a result of the proposed amendments of Conelan) and Porrest( Mr Prowse) complained about the remuneration of non-official postmasters mistresses. When the party of which I am a member was in Opposition I persistently advocated the payment of these people on the basis of the value of the service they rendered. I am pleased that the members of the present Opposition have continued the fight for ihe amelioration of the conditions under which these people are employed. I am not in a position to add to what I said in answer to questions addressed to me on this subject, namely, tliat the Government has set up a committee to investigate the remuneration paid to these officers, and that I am satisfied that when the committee has completed its investigations they will be paid a remuneration commensurate with the work which they are called upon to perform. The honourable member for Cook( Mr .Sheehan) referred to the proposed increase of tbe postage rate on Hansard by a halfpenny, ft. is the opinion of the department that if Hansard were deleted from the schedule as suggested by the honourable member, it Would mean that the publicaMr George Lawson. tions of other governments and of semi-government instrumentalities would also have to be deleted. It is unnecessary for me to point out that that would involve a considerable loss of revenue. Amendment negatived. Original question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time.

This act shall continue in operation until a date to be fixed by proclamation and no longer, but, in any event, not longer than six months after His Majesty ceases to be engaged in war."". As honourable members opposite have stated frequently this is a war measure and as such it should be allowed to operate only for the duration of the war. I understand that the Government expects to get approximately £2,000,000 as postal, telegraphic and telephone rates. If it be necessary to increase those rates and postin order to secure additional revenue to carry on the war to a successful conclusion, the Government should be given an opportunity to do so, but only for the duration of the war. As I pointed out in my second-reading speech, unfortunately it is becoming customary for governments to use these essential services as a means to raise taxes. The essential services of this country should be controlled by the Government for the welfare of the people. If honourable members opposite are in accord with that principle surely they should not seek to impose the maximum rates for the services rendered. If the revenues from these essential services were low I could understand the Government making every effort to increase them, but when the yield is high there is no need for the continuance of additional impositions after the war is over. The amendments proposed in this bill have been designed to enable the Government to increase the rates still further, if it so desires. operate only until the next budget has been implemented.",80,Chatrman Mb Pbowse Th E Presentation Of The Report Of The

The Governor General may make regulations not inconsistent w it h this act prescribed on ilia tiers whicli are necessary or convenient to lie prescribed for carrying out or giving eifect to this act, and in particular may make regulations for all or any of the following purposes. The section proceeds to set out in detail the matters which may be covered by regulation. Paragraph m, which indicates the authority for fixing telephone rates by regulation, reads as follows:Prescribing the fees, rates ami dues lu be received for(1) any conversation ou any telegraph Iiin.' or on any telephone exchange or private telephone line; (2) rent or hire for the use of any such exchange or private telephone line: and generally for the management working and maintenance of any or all such telegraph lines. 'Che debate has satisfied me that the honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron) who was at one period Postmaster-General, and the honourable member for Swan( Mr Marwick) were unaware that the regulations and tbe bill are separate matters. The regulations are issued, not under the Post and Telegraph Bates Act, but under the Post and Telegraph Act. that. agree with the honorahle member. When I discussed the matter with him last night, I drew attention to this fact, and he remarked that he was not aware of it . exclusion of the telephone rates from the Post and Telegraph RatesB ill . orable member protested against the regulations, which were issued under a different act. tice of fixing charges for postal, telegraph, and telephone services has operated since the inception of the Commonwealth. the House does not vary the accepted form of fixing rates for all classes of postal, telephone, and telegraph facilities. ment does not. propose, at this stage, to make any variation of what has been, for many years, the established procedure. The honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron) referred to postal charges for the transmission of newspapers. I emphasize that no change is contemplated, in the basic principle embodied in the existing act for computing the rates for various postal articles. The proposal is to increase by one halfpenny the rates applicable to the various articles enumerated in the schedule. It is not proposed, at this juncture, to review the conditions which have applied in the past to the computation of charges, particularly regarding bulk postage rates. In other words, the conditions respecting postal charges for newspapers and other articles submitted to the post office in bulk will be continued., with the important exception that an increase of one halfpenny will apply to the unit of weight. In the course of his remarks, the honourable member for Swan commented on the recent, amendments of the telephone regulations that, apply to all call charges to places situated adjacent to the capital cities but outside the boundaries, in each case, of the metropolitan telephone network. During recent, years, there has been continual and marked development We were aware of in many districts just outside the metropolitan telephone networks. This proI disgress has been most, noticeable in Sydney and Melbourne. As a consequence, many thriving communities, which arc located between the metropolitan network boundaries for telephone rate purposes, are completely urban in character. InvestiI protested against the gations indicate that approximately 75 per cent, of the total calls originated by subscribers connected to fhe exchanges concerned arc for places within the boundaries of the prescribed metropolitan networks, and that the. bulk of the incoming calls to these outer metropolitan exchanges are originated by city subscribers. Por technical and other reasons, it is not practicable to include these outer metropolitan districts in the capital city network boundaries for telephone tariff The bill now before purposes.

I cannot allow to pass unchallenged some of the remarks of the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Rosevear). do not wish to indulge in personalities, but, in my opinion, the Opposition has a responsibility to examine all of the proposals introduced by the Government. Tbat was a duty of the Opposition to which the present Prime Minister( Mr Curtin) when Leader of the Opposition drew attention from time to time. Members np/w j n opposition have a right to rise in ""defence of particular interests, or in furtherance of their views, and it is most improper that when they do so they should be charged with deliberately stone-walling.

Any person possessing a knowledge of country conditions and a genuine sympathy for the man on the land will appreciate that members of the Country party who have participated in the debate are well-informed upon rural subjects. They are gravely concerned about the depopulation of country districts. The exodus to the big cities, which is the result of economic conditions and the lack of adequate water supplies and electrical and telephonic facilities, is alarming. member blame for that? Government with being responsible; but I take strong exception to tbe remarks of the lionorable member for Dalley. who accused members of the Country party of stone-walling when they attempted to explain to rhe House the disabilities under which people in the country live. Having delivered his abusive tirade, the honourable member stalked out of the chamber without deigning to listen to a reply. That the speeches which the members of the Opposition have delivered upon various measures to-day have contained constructive criticism is demonstrated by the Government's adoption of a number of their I proposals. In those circumstances, the criticism in which the honourable member for Dalley indulged was unjustified and unfair. Minister assisting the Postmaster General) [10.55] -in reply-The increased postal and telephone charges proposed by the Government are precisely the same as those which were contemplated by the previous Government. The former Treasurer ( Mr. Fadden) referred to them in his budget speech on the 25th September last.

I support the amendment, and, notwithstanding the fact that additional revenue is required for war purposes, I hope that much of the revenue of the department will be used in increasing its efficiency. I agree with those honourable members who contend that officers in charge of non-official post offices should receive more remuneration than they have .had in the past. The volume of the work of some of them may be small, but their services are necessary. Although the salary paid to the officers is regarded by some people as sufficient in view of the actual services rendered, it is a mere pittance and should be increased. can imagine the uproar that would have arisen amongst honourable members opposite had their party been in power, and we had adopted an attitude similar to that which they are adopting now. I have never known a. worse example of stonewalling, nor heard such paltry and meaningless amendments. First, there is the amendment of the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Harrison) to limit the period during which this provision shall come before the House. Mi-. ROSEVEAR -The honourable ald) movedThat all words after "" bill "" be omitted with a view to inserting the following words in place thereof:"" be withdrawn temporarily and re-introduced with the provisions of Statutory Rules 1941, No. 261 incorporated therein."" This amendment was moved for no other purpose than to give to certain Country party members an opportunity to indulge in. their annual ""winge"" regarding telephone communications and postal matters generally. Statutory Rule 261 is already in force, yet the honourable member proposes to delay the business of the House so that it might be incorporated in the bill. This is a war measure designed to raise revenue. It proposes to increase the postal rate by one halfpenny, but to hear honourable members opposite one would think that a very heavy increase was proposed. £2,000,000 is involved. proposed to do no more than increase the postal rate by one halfpenny. Honourable members opposite are now playing the role of repentant sinners, because they have themselves been responsible for doing the very thing which they are now condemning. Governments of the kind which they supported were responsible for every increase of postal rates that has taken plaGe, but never on any occasion did they follow the virtuous course suggested by the honourable member for Wentworth -neve r did they repeal the provision when the necessitous times had passed. Before the last war we had penny postage.

I hope that honourable members opposite will stop their stone-walling tactics, and allow the House to get on with the business of the country.

252,Mr Rosevear,"The honora bita long time, I have held the view that the post office should he a service, and should not be used as a taxing machine. It should not be so heavily bled for the benefit of Consolidated Revenue that the efficiency of the service is impaired. However, this is not the occasion on which to press that view. If honourable members w ill look at the schedule to the bill they w ill see that it is loaded against the country districts. As the honourable member Cameron) pointed out last night, the services provided by the Postmaster General's Department in country districts are of great value to the cities. Although telephone lines are erected for long distances in order to provide a service to the homes of the settlers who produce the wealth that, creates the credit of this country, those facilities are not entirely in the interests of the men on the land. Merchants and others who batten on the farmers benefit from that service as much as, if not more than, the farmers themselves. Therefore the proposed increase of the rates will have an adverse effect upon the farming community. Only this month I addressed to Ashley) a communication relating to the Lower G-reat Southern Inter-district. Conference, held in Western Australia on the 31st August and the 25th October last. At botli those conferences the following motion was carried :That this conference requests that tlie Commonwealth Government be asked to place all trunk line calls on a more equitable and fair basis, and with that object in view, the following scheme is recommended for adoption by tlie Postmaster-General:AU telephone subscribers to be able to phone by ordinary or trunk line a distance of 25 miles from his telephone or nearest post office. The rate thereafter to be on the basis of Id. extra for every ten miles. The following observations were offered with regard to the decision of the conference :Concerning trunk line calls you will realize that the metropolitan area is in a much better IKiRition than tlie country district. For oxample, one can telephone from the outskirts of Midland Junction to the outskirts of Fremantle, a distance of, say, 25 miles, for l i d . or 2d. ait a public telephone. If one wishes to ring, for example, from Kntanning to Badgebnp. a distance of only twenty miles, one pays the trunk line charge, and such instances as this could be multiplied without number. ""The proposal is not an unreasonable one, particularly in regard to the first 25 miles, when one bears distances iu mind. If the primary producer is to be helped over his present financial difficulties, every saving-n o matter how small -as of importance, especially when one takes into consideration the cumulative effect of a number of savings. The conference carried a further motion in these termsThat the Commonwealth Postmaster-General be requested to extend the facilities for letterf or Barker( Mr Archie grams to all full-time post offices instead of this convenience being available only at Perth and Kalgoorlie in this State, and at a few post offices only in other States. I have always been puzzled to know why such conveniences can only be made available over telegraph lines for the benefit of those sections of the people who reside in areas in which the population is centralized. It seems unreasonable that country people cannot enjoy the right to send lettergrams. If they were given permission to use that service, I have no fear that the revenue of the department would be reduced one whit. The effect would be rather to increase the revenue and improve the service provided for the community. Western Australia comprises one-third, of the continent of Australia, the Postmastei^General (Senator yet there are only two places in the whole of that State where the lettergram service is 'available. The observation of the conference on this matter was as follows :The lettergram i.s an inexpensive way of sending a lengthy telegram. In Western Australia it is of no value at all. So far as the Western Australian people are concerned it is only of use to them if they wish to communicate with Kalgoorlie from' Perth, or with the eastern Sta.te capitals. There surely is no objection to its being extended to all, or, at least, a substantial number of full-time post oflices. where delivery could be effected the same way as that of other telegrams is effected, and the convenience that would be afforded to the public would be considerable. I hope that the Postmaster-General w ill not give merely cursory attention to the extension of the lettergram service, but w ill realize that benefit would be derived from it . Here he has an opportunity, as a new Minister, to leave his mark on a great institution, the Post Office, which has proved itself to be an efficient organization. I hope that he w ill give greater consideration than has been given in the past to the claims of country people,",85,Chatrman Mb Pbowse Th E Presentation Of The Report Of The

I am in. agreement wth the increase of the rates, and merely ask that, justice be done in this matter. endorse some of the remarks of the honorahle member for New England( Mr A.bbott), but with others I entirely disagree.

I am confident that the Minister in charge of the bill ( Mr Lawson) and the Postmaster-General Ashley), will see that these officers receive f a i r treatment when their case is heard by the Public Service Arbitrator. The worse feature of the matter has been left unmentioned by the honourable member for New England; it relates to messenger boys employed at non-official post offices, who have to work 44 hours a week in the delivery of telegrams. If a telegram were lodged at a minute to 3 o'clock or a few minutes before 6 p.m., it would have to be delivered, even though the boy had to travel miles in order to deliver it . Holidays throughout the year also have to be worked, and the remuneration is only 4s. a week. If that is not child slavery, I do not know what it is.

If , however, the rent equipment were reduced, more people would install telephones and even if the husband or wife of the home did not initiate many calls, it is more than likely that they wO'iild receive a good many, and' so the revenue would benefit. The honourable member for Lang made a gibe at the Opposition because telephone services had not been extended more widely while the previous Government was in office. I have been endeavouring for the last twenty years to encourage a more general vise of the telephone services. During the nine years that I was Speaker, I spoke from the floor of the House on only three occasions, and on each of them. I emphasized the need to develop our postal, telephonic and telegraphic services to country districts. I hope that the errors of policy in this connection which have persisted for so long will be corrected in the not distant future. If honorahle members opposite who represent country constituencies would join with honourable members on this side"" of the chamber who also represent such areas, in making united representations to the Government, I am sure that effective action would be h: ken quickly. \. desire to say a few words concerning n L>n-official postal officers. On many occadiscourage letter writing. This, in turn, sions, honourable members opposite have expressed' themselves emphatically on the desirability of ensuring that every body in the community shall enjoy at least the basic wage. In my view, the most sweated people in the Australian community are the non-official postmasters, some of whom receive only 15s. a week for daily attendance at their offices from. 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Our old-age pensioners will shortly be receiving £1 3s. 6d. a week and, in my opinion, it is absurd and unfair for us tocall upon non-official postmasters, who render such an imporTnnt service in country districts, to work fi>r the small wages they nowreceive. Of course, they would not do so unless they had the interests of their various districts at heart. I stress, as I have done on many previous occasions, the need to improve the conditions of these non-official employees. I regard some of the increased charges provided for in this bill as unjust, especially to people living in eountry districts. I do not consider that the new imposts are wise, even from the point of view of the Postmaster-General's Department. It would not be in order for honourable gentlemen on this side of the chamber to move to reduce the charges, but I sincerely trust that the Minister assisting the Postmaster General( Mrj George Lawson) will use his influence to secure a rectification of the grave injustices under which residents of country districts will suffer in having to pay increased charges, thus being adversely affected in comparison with the more favoured people who live in the larger centres of population. I realize that the Government must find means to increase the revenue in order to maintain and enlarge our war effort. For that reason, I support the proposals of the bill for increases of the postal rate on letters, periodicals and other mail matter referred to in the schedule. At the same time, I point out that, by increasing postal rates, the Government is taking a risk of reducing the business of the Postmaster-General's Department and thus of diminishing the revenue obtainable from that source. No doubt these increased charges will tend to will be reflected in the saving of papeT. I consider that it would be wiser for the Government to adopt measures to encourage the nse of the various services provided by tbe Postmaster-General's Department. The increases of postal -charges will not lead to increased purchases of stamps, letter-cards, postcards and other articles used in correspondence. These facilities will not be operated to the best advantage so long as those who are in charge of them are (paid starvation wages. I was very pleased to hear the honourable member for Lang( Mr Mulcaby) mention non-official post offices. Those who are conducting such offices have been underpaid for years;, and in addition have been saddled from time to time with extra duties, such a? the collection of statistics and the making of various statutory payments.

267,"Mr Abbott (New England) [10.14],","was to. move an amendment in order to give to the House an opportunity to debate matters that did not come within the scope of the measure. :-The honourable member's remark was only a matter of opinion. there was no justification for delaying the passage of this measure. The amendment submitted by the honourable member for Corangamite will not help in any way to increase the Government's resources for -the prosecution of the war. I am pleased that the Government saw fit to bring down a measure of tliis sort. It prosuch places would lead to an increase of poses to increase revenue without increasing the costs usually associated with such a process. I wish to bring to the attention of the Postmaster-General some suggestions that might improve the service rendered by the Postal Department and, at the same time, increase its income. I should like to see telephones installed in every home in Austi'alia, although I realize that, at the present time, this is not possible owing to the scarcity of telephone cables. In some other countries telephones are installed free of rent, and the only charges levied are for calls made by the subscriber. If this system were introduced in Australia, a considerable amount of additional revenue would be received by the department, and a valuable service would be extended to the public. Many utilities operating in the United States of America supply without, charge the electrical equipment necessary for the use of their current, and also maintain globes and units in repair. Only the current actually consumed is charged for. I consider that it would be a good thing for the Government to provide, as soon as practicable, for the free installatelephone charges and services if the hontion of telephones in all homes where the service is desired. .Ample supplies of copper cable and other equipment for this purpose, which is in short supply at the moment because of war conditions, were available during the long period for which the previous Government was in offiee. I direct the attention of the Government to the necessity to increase the allowances provided for non-official postmasters. In my opinion, an improvement of the conditions relating to these offices would undoubtedly lead to an increase of revenue from those sources. I also direct the attention of the Government to the desirability of appointing permanent officials to post offices in such localities as Islington, Cardiff, The Junction, Morisset, Swansea, Sans Souci, Stanmore, Bellevue Hill, Spit Junction, Dee Why, Terrigal and ""Wickham. "" sacking"" of the present non-official officers ? appointment of permanent officials to revenue, ancl I therefore advocate such action. I have made many applications for the establishment of public telephones in places in my electorate, but until the Labour Government came into office very little result was achieved. I ""have been glad to observe indications of a movement to improve the telephone service in these localities since the change of government. I am. firmly of the opinion that the free installation of telephones in private homes would lead to a substantial increase of revenue. I trust that the bill A'ill have a speedy passage. I support the amendment of the honourable member for Corangamite ( Mr .McDonald), the object of which was to provide means for a discussion of telephone charges ancl services.

In the main I am in agreement with the remarks made by the honourable member for Lang concerning the telephone services. Increases of telephone rentals and call charges were brought into effect recently under Statutory Rules 1941 No. 261 'which will adversely affect telephone users in country districts.

I realize that the Government is willing to investigate this matter, but this unjust imposition has been operating since May of last year. Now the Treasurer has suggested that it should continue in operation until March, .1.942. The provision was brought into operation months after many men had volunteered for service and gone abroad. It is not a very fine reward for them that afterwards tbe act, which then gave them full exemption, should be amended in order to reduce the exemption to estates under £5,000. I do not wish to be obstructive, and I content myself now with urging the Treasurer to investigate the proposal. It should be decided upon the general feeling of the House, and not by partisan action. The committee should report progress, so that the Treasurer may consider the matter and make a decision before Parliamentgoes into recess. find out cannot move to amend this bill. proposed to move for the insertion of a clause which would make an exception in the case of soldiers who are killed. The Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) should support his assurance on this matter with a further promise that he will take action under the National Security Act in order to cover the case of soldiers, pending a decision by the House. If the lionorable gentleman's assurance is worth anything, remedial action should be taken now; it has been delayed since May of last year, and there is no excuse for delaying it for another three months.

Nevertheless, I heartily agree with the suggestion made by the honorHughes) that special consideration should be given to a relaxation of the duty on the estates of soldiers who lose their lives as the result of war. Not the slightest doubt exists that when the principal act was amended in 1940 the question was not thoroughly thrashed out, but, if the Government can see its way clear to amend this measure so that the obvious intention of Parliament on the last occasion shall be expressed, I think it will be, not rectifying what we call an anomaly, but removing from those people who voluntarily enlist what is now an injustice. The bill is purely a bill to amend the rates of tax, and it will be accepted by the House as being necessary to the war finance.

The honourable member for Fawkner ("" Mr Holt) handled this question very reasonably. He pointed out things which the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) and Other members of the Ministry agree must be considered, but it was the height of nonsense for other honourable members opposite to try to pillory this Government for something which is not in this hill. The facts are that this bill does not propose to touch the duty on estates valued at less than £20,000. There is no provision to raise the estate duty by one penny if the value of the estate is less than £20,000.

I suggest that tlie bill be accepted as it stands.

The honourable member for Ballarat contended that a man who volunteers in this country, in which the voluntary system is almost an article of faith for some people, and loses his life overseas, should have his estate contribute to the Consolidated Revenue before his beneficiaries have any part of it. Neither this Government, nor any other can go on to the recruiting platform and say, "" If you volunteer for active service and your life is taken, we shall take your money.

I agree that, unfortunately, many men on active service have no great estates. Some of them will come back to this country "" stony broke "". That is not the ideal to which we look forward. The Government, on reflection, will not accept the view expressed by the honourable member for Watson that this legislation was designed to bring about a more equitable distribution of wealth in this country. That is not the objective of the taxation proposals. The real objective is to raise revenues with which to finance the war. The Treasurer said that when the Labour Government introduced all of those measures, which will be necessary to reconstruct the earth according to its ideals, it would not do so by subterfuge. The Labour party will say, "" This is the millennium; take it or leave it "" . I think that the honourable member for Watson was quite out of harmony with that pronouncement. The House can well afford to adopt the suggestion made by the honourable member for Wakefield, and, if he moves an amendment in committee, to support it. This is not the kind of legislation ""which has to be looked at from a party point of view.

For a complete year the tax which the bill imposes would raise approximately £650,000. The honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender), when Treasurer, introduced in May, 1940, an amending bill which would have increased the proceeds from this tax to £850,000 a year. At that period, honourable members opposite sat on this side of the chamber and according to their story they were satisfied with the amendment. debated in this chamber.

In my opinion, the bill will effect substantial progress in the implementation of the policy of the Labour party.

The increase of estate duty, such as is proposed in this bill, is one distribution of the national wealth among all who, by virtue of their citizenships, are entitled to participate in it. My only regret is that the measure does not provide for a steeper increase of the rates of estate duty.

One man may become rich ing because of their absence. Such men are entitled to consideration. Why should we seek to obtain revenue because men are exposing their lives to peril on our behalf? Those men would have had a greater expectation of life if they had remained behind. Any insurance company would have recognized the probability of their living for 30, 40 or even 50 years more. The Treasurer must realize the imperative need to amend this provision, and I hope that he will take action accordingly -Tim e after time supporters of the Gocannot allow to go unchallenged the arguments of the honourable member for Wakehonorable member for Richmond( Mr income groups and do not include, to any Anthony), that in respect of men in possession of considerable estates who lose their lives in the war, rights should be created which are not granted to other citizens. The argument implies that a hardship is heing inflicted on the men themselves. affected; the duties would fall only on the 'beneficiaries of their estates. It is asserted, in effect, that the children of such men should enjoy privileges denied to the children of those who were unable to enlist, or who were not disposed to do so. have an additional expectation of life. we investigate the conditions of enlistment, we find that expectation of life was not taken into account by the last Government, nor is it taken into account by this one. The terms of enlistment are that a man volunteers to serve his country overseas or in Australia at so much a day, and that, in the event of the death, his dependants shall enjoy the benefits of the Repatriation Act. The honourable member for Wakefield and the honourable member for Richmond have argued that the dependants of the rich man shall, over and above their rights under the Repatriation Act, enjoy certain advantages not enjoyed by the children of the poor man. That is an untenable argument. As a matter of fact, I believe that the concessions now proposed are very generous. How do men become rich? Is the rich man a more worthy citizen than by inheritance, another by hard work and close application to business, another by gambling. The fact that a man is rich does not always imply the possession of personal merit. Therefore, I cannot accept the argument that the children of a rich solider who loses his life overseas deserve a better deal than the children of the man who, before his enlistment, earned only the basic wage, or was, pei'hap3, on the dole. vernment have told honourable members on this side of the chamber that those who are pulling their weight in this war are drawn principally from the lowermarked degree, persons in the higher ranges of income or those whom they choose to describe as "" capitalists "". We have just heard an extraordinary speech by the honourable member for Ballarat( Mr Pollard). Stating the case Actually they are not on behalf of the rich man who remains in Australia, he asked, in an impassioned address, "" Do you think that the children of a soldier who has lost his life should be placed at an advantage compared with the children of the man on the dole ?"" The children of a soldier who is killed in action will lose not only a portion of the estate, but also the care, love and guidance of their father. But the people for whom the honourable member spoke are really the rich men who stay at home. They will derive advantage from the estate for years, and the children will have the benefit of paternal guidance. From time to time supporters of the Government speak glibly of the advantages of the voluntary form of enlistment, and contend that conscription is not necessary. Under conscription, this provision would be eminently fair, because every person would be placed upon the same basis.

Such an estate should make a fair and equitable contribution. appears to suggest that no distinction should be drawn between the man who dies on active service and the man who does not. I dissociate myself entirely from that view. We are carrying on, mistakenly I think, under the voluntary system. Some of those who go to the other side of the world are either killed outright or eventually die of wounds or illness. Should that occur, their estates should either be exempt from duty-that would not be too much -o r 'be given concessional treatment, for the benefit of those left behind. I do not think that the view expressed by the honourable member is held by many persons. It might be better if this matter were reconsidered, and the Government were to introduce an amending bill. We have not before us the Estate Duty Assessment Act, section 9 of which deals with the matter, but only a bill to amend the Estate Duty Act. I would cheerfully vote for the exemption from duty of the estates of deceased members of the fighting services, of whatever size they might be; but the Government may not bo prepared to go to that length. It is not for rae to dictate what a Labour not. If it were possible to move an government should do; but I have thought the matter out, and discussed it with others, in an attempt to work out what would be equitable, and the general opinion seems to be that all estates should have an exemption of £5,000, and that only half the rates specified in respect of estates above that figure should I regret that the act did not make it be applicable to the estates of soldiers, sailors or airmen who lose their lives as the result of active service iu the field or disease contracted while on service. I should like to hear what other honourable members think of this. I have prepared an amendment which I am inclined to move in committee in order to test the feeling of honourable members so that there shall be no question of leaving the question to the discretion of the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley). Parliament should settle the question, the more so because, when it was before Parliament last year, it was apparently not understood fully, and the measure went through both Houses with practically no debate. propose to direct my remarks to the provision for the exemption of deceased soldiers' estates of a value of not more than £5,000. This matter came before me when I held some responsibility in the Treasury, ancl I felt that an injustice had been done. I am confident that had the last Government remained in office it, would have been rectified. ber said nothing about it before. that it ought to have been done. If the Assistant, Treasurer ( Mr Lazzarini) does not agree that what I propose is just he will, no doubt, reject it. The exemption of £5,000 ought to apply irrespective of the value of the estate. Under this provision, if the estate be worth more than £5,000, even if it be worth only £5,001, no exemption is granted at all. It is very much as if exemption were granted from tax on income up to £200, but if the income exceeded £200, no exemption was granted at all, even on the first £200. In New South Wales, an exemption of £5,000 is allowed for estate duty purposes, irrespective of whether the total value of the estate is more than £5,000 or amendment, I should do so, but I understand that there are some difficulties in the way. If it cannot be done, then I appeal to the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) to recognize this elementary principle of justice. I freely admit that the last Government was in some measure at fault. clear that the exemption of £5,000 should apply, no matter how large the estate. I thought it did, but apparently, owing to some accident of drafting, the point was not properly defined. However, the time is ripe, now that thousands of our soldiers on the other side of the world are in grave danger of their lives, to put this matter right. It would be most unfair if the wives or relatives of soldiers still overseas had to pay duty on the full amount of estates over £5,000. on the dole before they went away are not likely to be affected.",96,Honourable Members Hear Hear

352,Mr Mulcahy,"Thos e men who werealthough attention may have been drawn to them last year when legislation was brought down to increase the rates. The proposed levy will be made upon the higher estates-abov e £20,000-conse quently it cannot be said that the Government is imposing any greater hardship than is caused at present. [8.48] I should like to have more than the mere undertaking from the Treasurer that that the matter will be examined. It is of first-class importance. Immediately the estate duty was introduced, I began to wonder what would be the position in relation to the estates of men serving in the war who lost their lives as the result through injury or disease. The honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Holt) has excellently stated the position, and his remarks ought to be carefuly studied. During the last war. the estate of any man who lost his life as the result of the war was not subestate may operate to the advantage of ject to any assessment. That provision continued until last year, when, another war having started, it was altered to the effect that estates under £5,000 should not be subject to duty'; but nothing was said in regard to estates above £5,000, with the result that an estate valued at £5,500 immediately became assessable for the full amount of duty, and thus was in exactly the same position as the estate of any other member of the community who had not gone to the war. I regard that as extremely hard, and doubt very much whether the Parliament so intended. As the matter has now been raised, it ought to be considered by the House, in order that it might decide whether the estates of deceased soldiers, sailors and airmen should be completely free of duty, whether some compromise should be effected, or whether the duty should be the same as that chargeable against the estates of other persons. The British rule at present is practically which can quite well afford to pay it. identical with that which operated there during the last war. It is not so liberal as was ours at that time, but. it is very much more generous than the provision we are now considering. because the rates rise to a very high figure. The honourable member for Fawkner has quite properly pointed out that the rapid rise of rates has made .the matter more important. He has also emphasized the provisions which operate in England, where all estates up to £5,000 are free of duty, after which there is a rather elaborate provision, based on the expectation of life, which results in a great difference between their results and ours, according to the figures given by the honourable member. £5,000 continuously exempt? a straight-out exemption of £5,000 to begin with, after which tliere is a further exemption which, on figures the honourable member for Fawkner has; results in the amount being six or eight times as much as in Australia. A third provision enables the more liberal of two different, acts to be applied in England in order that the calculation of the duty on an the estate of a deceased soldier, sailor, or airman. There is a fourth provision, that if more than one member of a family is killed, and tbe same property passes, it is assessable only on the first occasion. Tliere is a. most elaborate and thorough method of calculating the succession duty to be paid. What does the House think would be proper in regard to men who have volunteered for active service abroad? Does it think that, in addition to losing their lives, their estates ought to be assessed at the same rate as the estates of other members of the community; or should not have to pay any duty; or should there be a compromise between complete exemption and full payment? I feel perfectly sure that neither side of the House would say that the estates of soldiers, sailors, or airmen who lose their lives overseas, should be severely raxed. This is a severe tax. It may be said tliat it will apply only to big estates, According to the figures that we have, an estate of £120,000 would pay something like £40,000 in estate duty to Federal and State authorities. lionorable member say that the estate' of a man who gives his life for his country should have to pay one-third of its value?",97,Honourable Members Hear Hear

Several other points arise in relation to estate duties leviable on the estates of men killed on active service. One pointthat should be considered is the effect of quick succession. There is no provision in the Commonwealth law to vary the estate duty when there is a quick succession in an estate. It happens, at times, that two persons may succeed to the same estate in quick succession, in which case, as the law is, estate duty would be payable in both instances. The diminution of the value of an estate so affected is considerable, and it will become greater uuder the heavier imposts now being provided. Steps have been taken in Great Britain, and also, I believe, in Tasmania, to mitigate such hardships. It is provided in the British law that when the Commissioners of Inland Revenue are satisfied that estate duty has become payable on any land or business passing on the death of any person, and that subsequently within five years estate duty has again become payable on the same property, or any part thereof, passing on the death of the person to whom the property passed on the first death, the duty payable on the second death shall be reduced as follows:Per cent. Where the second death occursWithin one year of the first death.. 50 Within two years of the first death.. 40 Within three years of the first death.. 30 Within four years of the first death.. 20 3 per 6 per 12 per Within five years of the first death.. 10 cent. cent. Nil £300 £1,200 £6,000 I suggest that the Government consider Nil £40 £239 £1,435 the desirability of incorporating a similar £4,565 provision in the Commonwealth law on the subject. It may happen that two brothers on active service may be killed in quick succession, and property which has passed from one to the other after the first death, and subsequently passes to other relatives on the second death, will be greatly diminished in value because of the estate duties levied upon it. I do not think that any of us would desire to embarrass beneficiaries unduly in such circumstances. In respect of this measure generally, I . remind the Government that the new and heavier rates are being imposed in order to provide money for war purposes, and should therefore be regarded as emergency war-time imposts and not an enduring feature of our estate duty legislation. As the effects of these iurw provisions are likely to be severe in many cases, I aak that this measure be reviewed as soon as circumstances permit. Should death occur during the period of the war, those who derive an interest as beneficiaries are to be taxed in comparatively greater measure. The Opposition, whilst not opposing the passage of the measure, asks that the particular points to which I have directed attention shall be sympathetically examined by the Government. I suggest that, in the interval before the next sessional period, when a supplementary budget is likely to be introduced, the Treasurer have a thorough overhaul of the law relating to estate duty, and bring 'before Parliament provisions adopting principles which apparently are operating satisfactorily in Great Britain.

364,Mr Chifley (Macquarie,"Treasurer )At the committee stage of the bill, the following provision was inserted to meet the point:Nothing in this act shall apply to tlie estate of any person who, during the present war or within one year after its termination, dies on active service or as a result of injuries received or disease contracted on active service witli the Military or Naval Forces of the Commonwealth or any part of the King's Dominions. That provision operated during the period of the last war and it remained in the act until it was replaced in the act passed last year by a section which is intended to operate during the period of this war. The effect of the new provision is that an estate of a person killed on active service is exempt from duty if its value is not more than £5,000. The anomaly exists, however, that an estate valued at £5,001 would be liable to the full amount of estate duty. Thus, the beneficiaries of such an estate would be in a much less favorable position than the beneficiaries of an estate of slightly less than £5,000 in value. I trust that the necessary steps will be taken to overcome this anomaly. When the Government considers the subject, I ask it to consider also the system operating in Great Britain in relation to similar circumstances, for I consider that the British method is much more scientific than the system that we have adopted. I think it only fair to state that the relevant provision in our aot was hastily drafted and introduced, and was not given the consideration by the House that its importance deserved. In. moving the second reading of the bill, the then Treasurer, tbe honourable member for Warringah ( Mr and British laws respectively on the Spender), made passing reference to it, and the then Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin) merely noted the observation that had been made. The subject was not debated. The relevant provision in the British act provides for the remission of estate duties in respect of property passing to the widow or lineal descendants, or lineal ancestors, including brothers and sisters, and descendants of brothers and sisters, of the deceased, under the following conditions:(a.) Where the value of the property does not exceed £5,000-the whole of the death duties leviable in respect of that property. (6) Where the value exceeds £5,000(i) in respect of the first £5,000-the whole of the death duties; and (ii) so much of the duties leviable in respect of the remainder as exceeds the sum which, if accumulated at compound interest at the rate of 3 per cent, per annum from the date of death with half-yearly rests would, at the expiration of the period of the normal expectation of life of a person of the age of the deceased at the time of death (calculated in accordance with Tables of Mortality of Government Life Annuitants, 1912), amount to the whole of the duties so leviable. I do not expect honourable members to follow the meaning of that involved verbiage. Stated in simple terms, the position in Great Britain is that estates of persons killed in action are exempt from duty up to a value of £5,000, and that estates in excess of that value are exempt in respect of the first £5,000 and on the balance are leviable in accordance with a calculation based on the expectation of life of the deceased person at the time of death. The theory, apparently, is that because a person comes to an untimely end on active service it would not be proper for the Government to receive, much earlier than would normally be the case, the estate duty that would apply to such a deceased person's property. I suggest that the Government might consider the propriety of including such a provision in the Commonwealth law on this subject. I asked the officers of the Taxation Department to be kind enough to prepare a statement comparing the duties that would be payable under Commonwealth, estates of persons dying while on active service. I was provided with the following table:Comparison of amounts of duty payable on estates of a taxable balance of £5,000, £10,000 £20,000 and £50,000 in the case of a single man, aged 25 years, at date of death, dying as a result of wounds contracted on active service(a) under the existing provisions of the law and at the proposed rates of duty; and (6) if sections 1 and 2 of the British Death Duties (Killed in War) Act were of more than £20,000. Having regard to the long interval of time which elapsed between the imposition of the first rate of estate duty and its revision in 1940, when the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender) was Treasurer, it is appropriate that some investigation be made of the conditions under which this tax was imposed, and of the considerations which have led to the introduction of this bill. The honourable member for Warringah, and the officials of the Taxation Department, will admit that the revised rates which were introduced last year were drafted rather hurriedly, so that there was little opportunity for honourable members to investigate in detail the history of the operation of the estate duty. The original Estate Duty Act was passed during the war of 1914-18. Mr in Australia. In Great Britain an Fisher, who was then Prime Minister, said, in introducing the billWe all admit that the proposal means the super-imposition of a heavy tax on State taxation but it is a class of taxation to which no one can object, because one doubts whether the accumulation of large estatesisbeneficial Britain the collections from an estate to a country, or even to the people who inherit them. Mr Joseph Cook had this to say about the b ill In my opinion this proposal is penal and almost predatory . . . There is no need for this orgy of taxation. It means that we are systematically penalizing success, which cannot be good for a young country like this. Nevertheless, the act was passed and it remained on the statute-book without any alteration being made to the rate of duty until 1940. In that year the then Treasurer revised the rates in order to raise funds for war purposes, and also placed the method of imposing the duty upon a more scientific basis. That basis is not affected by this measure, except for the fact that the rate on estates of more than £20,000 is increased until a maximum levy of 27.9 per cent, is reached by progression, as the value of the estate rises to £500,000. The average revenue from this duty in past years has been £1,500,000. The alterations effected last year were designed to add another £850,000 to that sum, and the variation which is now proposed will produce, in a full financial year, an extra amount of £650,000. Therefore, the amount of revenue collected will be twice what it was two years ago. Honourable members must bear in mind the fact that estate duty levied by the Commonwealth' is in addition to taxes imposed upon estates of deceased persons by State governments. It is interesting to note, from the table which has been circulated by the Treasurer, that taxes upon estates in Australia at the present time, both Commonwealth and State, are much more severe, except in the case of very large estates, than those which operate in Great Britain. No doubt that will surprise honourable members who have held the belief that the rates of estate duty in Great Britain are particularly onerous. In order to give point to this fact, I direct . attention to the total collections that would be made from an estate of £30,000 in Great Britain and a similar estate amount of £3,900 would be taken from the estate by way of duty. In Australia, the combined Commonwealth and State duties, in the highest taxing State, would be £5,522. In Great of £100,000 would be £25,700. In Australia the combined Commonwealth and State levy would be £38,980. It will be seen that the levies are considerably higher than those imposed in Great Britain. Only when an estate reaches a value of £1,000,000, which is a rare occurrence in this country, is the British impost higher than the Australian. I emphasize these points, because we are doubling the Australian impost within a two-year period. It becomes of the utmost importance, in these circumstances, that the incidence of the tax shall be closely examined in order to avoid anomalies or to correct any that may have revealed themselves. In this connection, I refer to the position in respect of the estates of persons who may be killed on active service. In introducing the original Estate Duty Bill in 1914, the then Treasurer, Mr Andrew Fisher, saidWe might reasonably consider the point as to whether the estates of persons who are fighting the battles of this country should be taxed. I think that they should be exempted. They are taking exceptional risks on the battlefield while we are stopping at home. Whereas those who remain at home should he called upon to bear the full tax, those who are at the front should, in my opinion, be exempted. had been increasing from year to year, with tbe result that many farmers, who in any case had very little equity in their properties, were being forced into bankruptcy by the operation of the act. In order to show tbe unfairness of the tax, I refer to the statement by the Treasurer tliat the Government expects this surcharge to produce additional revenue in this nnancial year amounting to about £500,000. which the honourable member supported took an extra £1,500,000 from this source. The budget for 1940-41 proposed almost to double the existing rate of land tax. But there is a point beyond which the rate should not be increased. That point has been reached. From how many individuals is this extra £500,000 to be extracted? I have read the 22nd annual report of the Taxation Commissioner, which discloses that 2,370 land-tax.payers own land of a taxable value in excess of £20,000. Therefore, that number of individuals and concerns will be called upon to make this additional contribution to the Commonwealth's revenue. Honourable members should bear in mind that many of these individuals and companies are subject to the highest rates of income tax. The culmination of the Government's policy must be the extinction of the large corporations. Has the Goverument considered the economic consequences of its actions? I do not mean the consequences to the big companies, such as the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited, the pastoral concerns and the big shipping companies, but the consequences to the thousands of men aud women who depend for their livelihood upon the prosperity of the companies. A company which is unable to continue making profits must reach a stage at which it has to discharge employees. No company can continue to operate normally if its profits and its chances of future development are taken away from it. By striking directly at the big .pastoral companies and city concerns, the Government will ultimately find itself unable to replace the structure which it is now destroying and upon the security of which thousands of men and women depend for their livelihood. Does the [33] Goyerninent propose to establish a government-controlled concern directed by the workers? If it does not wish to lead this country into communism, socialism or some other political "" is m it must abandon its present policy. Otherwise, our democratic system of government can not survive. I believe that the Government and its supporters have not given sufficient thought to the probable effects of its actions. I ask them to do some serious thinking now. Most of them are capable of intelligent thought and have a real desire to promote the welfare of the people who vote for them at the elections and who expect them to safeguard the interests of the community. They will betray their trust if they, allow their actions eventually to destroy the source of the people's livelihood. Question resolved in the affirmative.

370,Mr Holt (Fawkner) [8.25],"Th ehave to do something about it. After the last war a great many returned soldiers, city-bred men as well as farmers' sons, who wanted to go on the land, could not procure allotments because the land was locked. Vast stretches of country are still in the same condition, and the owners will have to be forced, either by means of a land tax or by some other means, to subdivide their properties in order that the closer settlement which we need so much shall be achieved. There is, therefore, every justification for tbe land tax. The anxiety which honourable members opposite displayed when they were in power to reduce the land tax, even in times of financial stringency, showed that they are more concerned in the preservation of the interests of the squatters than in the interests of the country at large. Honourable member? opposite jeered when I said that the squatters had never been of any real use to the country. It is true that they have grown wool, but wool could have been grown in Australia without their aid. Honourable members opposite may jeer as they like, but constitutional, industrial and social reforms have been won in this country despite the intransigent attitude of the squatters. The memorable events of the Eureka Stockade resulted from the actions of a squatterridden Legislative Council in Victoria. The reactionary and stultifying upper houses of Australian parliaments were, until several decades ago, dominated by squatters. The progress achieved by Queensland has been due to the fact that it abolished its upper house, whereas Victoria's progress has been retarded by the fact that it. has not been able to destroy its second chamber elected on a restricted franchise. At one time one had to possess £3,000 worth of equity in an unalienated freehold property in order to be elected to that house. Honourable members opposite who are the political heirs of the people who put the land to ill use in the past do not like to be reminded of the evils that those people perpetrated. Having delivered a well-deserved lesson to lionorable members opposite, I leave the House to resolve the question. Question resolved in the affirmative. Mr Gahotill. .Bill read a second time, and reported from committee without amendment or debate; report adopted. posedThat the bill be now read a third time. The opinion of honourable members opposite, especially the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell), appears to be that any company, firm, organization, or individual that has developed in a big way deserves, by virtue of that development, to be slated. The honourable member for Melbourne said that the "" squattooracy"", whatever that may mean, deserved all the penalties that could be imposed upon it. -Order!

If .this policy of slating the big companies continues, it must eventually react to the detriment of all those individuals who depend for their livelihoodon the successful management of those concerns. I draw attention to the inequity of the land tax. It was the first tax, apart from excise and customs duties, to be levied by the Commonwealth Parliament. It was imposed, in 1910, for the purpose of breaking up large estates, but it did not succeed in doing so. It imposed very heavy levies on city properties, but it also did much to weaken the financial position of many farmers whose circumstances were already bad. The report of the committee which inquired into the conditions of the wool industry in 1932 states that, in that year, uncollected land tax totalled about £700,000, due to the fact that those upon whom the tax had been levied were not in a position to meet their assessments.

The Government had conferences with the representatives of the trading banks and the Commonwealth Bank before the details of the regulations were finally settled. An exemption from the regulations is being granted for two months to all institutions, other than the private banks specified in the regulations, which are or may appear to be carrying on in Australia the business of banking. This exemption will cover the Launceston and Hobart Savings Banks, also pastoral companies and other institutions which carry on some banking functions. This temporary exemption will give time for inquiry and consideration as to whether any of these institutions should be brought within the regulations. LAN DTAXBILL 1941. -SECOND READING. Debate resumed. The honourable member for Barker( Mr hopelessly in debt to the financial instituArchie Cameron) said that the Labour party did not seem to know just where it stood on the subject of the land tax, and he attacked the submissions of the honourable member for Watson( Mr generation or so is an agrarian revoluFalstein) and the honourable member for Reid( Mr Morgan). He also made, what was for him, a startling discovery, that the stock exchanges can sometimes be rigged. He said that the prices of brewery shares, tobacco shares and even Commonwealth bonds rise and fall. Had the honourable gentleman had the honour to be associated with the Labour party he would have learned a lot about the stock exchanges, those modern temples of high finance. He would have discovered that price fluctuations are not accidental or fortuitous, but are rigged in order to suit the needs of whoever is bulling or bearing in order to make money at the expense of the people outpressed by fluctuations on the stock exchange than it is by the sham fights which occur in the ranks of the United Australia party. Possibly the present row in that party is designed to delude the Labour party into the belief thai honourable members opposite are fighting amongst themselves, whereas, in fact, they are composing their differences with a view to emerging as a unified party under a new name. -Orde r 1 The subject which the honourable member is now discussing has nothing to do with the Land Tax Bill. germane to the arguments of the honourable member for Barker, whose remarks were applauded by honourable members opposite.

The honourable member for Barker( Mr and dreamt a little less of Karl Marx. Archie Cameron) delivered a dissertation upon his meaning of ""unearned increment"". The right honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) Avas perfectly correct when he spoke of the interest that accrues annually from the unearned increment created by community settlement. pocketed by those who own the land. For the information of honourable members, I cite the classic case of the Howey estate in Melbourne. In the 1830's a block of land was purchased at a sale for less than £200. A few months later the original buyer departed and never again saw the land. His immediate descendants never saw it at all. It waa not until nearly 100 years after the purchase of the land by Howey that some of his collateral relatives, probably great-grand-nephews, eventually visited Melbourne in order to view the property from which the family in England were deriving solid benefits every year. The unimproved value of the land in 1900 was approximately £600,000. If all of it still remained in the hands of the estate, it would be worth £1,000,000. The Howey family contrigrowth of the city of Melbourne. The able to live upon the values created by the pioneers who braved the elements to develop this country. Now, the honourable member for Barker complains because overseas investors who put their money into the country have to pay a double rate of tax. I shall supply to the honourable member a pamphlet upon land values in Melbourne. The author, Mr E. Craigie, is o e of his former colleagues, n and was, until the last election, a member of the South Australian House of Assembly. When the honourable member reads the pamphlet, he will be better informed than he is at present upon matters of land values and land taxation. South Australia has been the home of Henry George-ism in this country. Most of the great apostles of the theory of the taxation of land values have come from that State. I wonder how the honourable member for Barker has escaped its influence. Certainly he would be better informed about our political economy if he had read a little more of Henry George George lost his seat. fate of the reformer. A prophet is not without honour, save in his own country. This unearned increment is Sitting suspended from 6.15 to 8 p.m. the Government desires that some other business shall intervene.

391,Mr Calwell,"I understand thatpioneering in Australia have passed, he has much to learn. A big discrepancy exists between the ways and methods of life in the country and in the city. Whilst recent inventions have assisted to reduce that margin, the discrepancy still remains. Grit ancl pluck are still required of a man who ventures into the outback areas for the purpose of engaging in mining, pastoral or agricultural pursuits. The application of the tax to tbe metropolitan areas is justified only by considerations of defence, because the buildings, not the land, will be damaged by enemy action. Incidentally, the buildings are not affected by this tax, which is an imposition upon the value of the land. tbe honourable member for Melbourne realize that an aerial or naval bombardment will damage, not the land, but the buildings? The only justification for this tax, as applied to tbe metropolitan area, is to provide special protection for the owners of buildings. One other item affects the oversea investor. It has been fashionable in the Parliament of the Commonwealth since I. became a memberI do not know what happened before then, but I have no doubt that the same policy was pursuedto talk about the necessity for inviting overseas capital to come to Australia. In fact, overseas capital was not only invited but conditions were also made attractive to persons to invest their money in the Commonwealth. But we shall induce no big manufacturing enterprises to establish factories in Australia unless the ownership of the land is held out as the attraction. Under the land tax laws of Australia, any property the value of which exceeds £3,000, and which is owned by an investor living abroad, is subject to a double rate of tax. duced it at the moment when it imposed has been a curse in most countries. viously, the honourable member lives in the past, whereas his eye should be fixed upon the future. If we persist with the policy of attracting overseas capital to Australia, the double penal rate will deprive the invitation of much of its hospitable nature. The invitation will not be accepted, even by investors in Great Britain and the United States of America. I do not propose to vote against the bill, because the Government has the requisite numbers to ensure the passage of the measure, and in addition, the time is not ripe to offer active hostility to it. But the hour of reckoning is coming. If federal land tax is to find a place in our taxation economy, the subject will have to be reviewed presently, in order to ensure that justice is clone as between landholder and landholder, and city and country. should like to know bow many farmers in Australia possess an equity in their land, apart from the value of the buildings, exceeding £20,000. to equities. Australia, even the title holders of .landed property, are in that position. The plea which has been made on behalf of the poor farmer is spurious; small farmers are not affected by this legislation. The honourable member for Deakin( Mr Hutchinson) gave a capable exposition of the difficulties of the man on the land. The average settler is suffering great hardships, because costs are rising whilst the prices of his commodities are determined largely by world values. The remedy for this evil state of affairs is a proper system of price fixation, and measures and methods other than the rejection of a proposal to raise revenue by ensuring that the unearned increment on land and most of it city land shall pay its fair share towards the protection of the country in war-time. The Labour party has always been keen on the land tax; but an anti-Labour government, prior to the formation of the Menzies Government, reon the workers a flour tax for the purpose of paying a subsidy to farmers.

398,Mr Calwell,"Very few people inclip. Manufacturers experience difficulties to-day that were not encountered during the last war, and the transport risks are greater now than they were previously. I have a strong suspicion that if Australia pressed too hard for an increase of the price of wool, it might be told that it could store its clip for a considerable period. The United Kingdom will adhere to the agreement entered into with Australia, but I arn not enthusiastic over the idea that by soma government action Australia could secure up to an average price of 15d. per l'b. for its clip. Every primary industry is complaining of increasing costs of production, and that increase is experienced by the wool-grower in common with otlier primary producers. The right honourable lncm'bcr for Yarra said that the land tax bad been responsible for 'breaking up many large estates, and had en aided young men to go on land of their own and become good farmers. I should like to hear the views on that matter of the honourable member arn not quite in agreement with the right honourable member for i'a.rra. In practically every State, not only on account of the operation of the Commonwealth land tax, but often owing to the repurchase system adopted hy State Governments, perfectly good sheep stations have been broken up in order to make very poor farms. To-day, four out of the six States of Australia are actually engaged, with Commonwealth money, not in subdividing land to bring ahout closer settlement, but in aggregating holdings in certain areas so that settlement will be less close than it is to-day. Canberra was a perfectly good, sheep station before the Federal Capital was established here, and I think that, every South Australian will agree that it is a great pity that it, ever became anything else. In the Mount Gambler district of South land has been sold at £S0 an acre, and in the Mount Barker district £40 an acre is not regarded as a high price to pay for land. At those prices, one does not need to own many acres before being liable to pay Commonwealth land tax. This tax imposes two kinds of discrimination. One form of discrimination is always bad, but, when a second is put into if r . Archie Cameron. operation, the position is infinitely worse. The first is the granting of exemption from the payment of tax on land, the value of which does not amount to £5.000. That provision immediately creates anomalies. Whilst the value of one property may slightly exceed £5,000, the value of an adjoining property, of similar area, may come just under that figure. The owner of the first will pay federal land tax; his neighbour will not. This line of demarcation forms a ""noman's land "" in administration. The second discrimination arises from tbe imposition of a penal tax upon an estate, the value of which exceeds a certain figure. The inference to be drawn from this practice by a visitor to Australia is that it is a bad thing, in this young country, to have men who are prepared to invest large sums of money in big areas of land, and to work them. Mr C.W.WKLI. -The original "" squattocracy "" did not invest very much money in the land. honourable member for Melbourne to refrain from interjecting. discussing this matter from tbe agricultural and pastoral standpoint. If it were not for some of the big holdings in each State during the last 100 years, our great wool industry would not have reached its present dimensions. In any new country, somebody must be a pioneer and bear all of the risks that are inherent in pioneering. To designate the pioneers of Australia as the ""squattocracy "" is to ignore their magnificent work in developing our agricultural industry. bers opposite describe it as ""unearned increment"". the persons who criticize this unearned Australia, increment would not be prepared, even in return for the daily payment of three or four times the equivalent of the basic wage, to bear the hardships that the pioneers bore. are now dead.

Last year, the Government was compelled to increase the land tax, and prior to that there was another increase of the tax. Both war expenditure and the land tax are progressively increasing, but we have not increased the land tax to the same degree as in the last war in respect of lands below the unimproved value of £20,000. Australia received 15d. per lb. for its wool. which the honourable member supported, had looked after the interests of the growers, they would have received lod. per lb. for their wool during this war. Whilst this impost may be classed as a capital tax, it is a tax on capital value of a distinct nature, because the value represents the unearned increment, not of the farmers, who are doing the real work of Australia, but of the wealthy city property-owners. intend to oppose the bill, because I realize become accustomed to sitting on the that in the circumstances the increase of the land tax is unavoidable. I have always contended tliat the taxation of land should be left to the local governing authorities. Owing to the increased obligations of the local governing authorities, they have not been able to finance their operations entirely by means of the revenue which they derive from rates. Therefore, they are obliged to look to the State Governments for financial assistance, whilst the State Governments, in turn, have had to appeal to the Commonwealth Government for help. [5.51] -The right honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) mentioned points that were even more interesting than those raised by the honourable member for Reid( Mr Morgan) and the honourable member for Watson( Mr Falstein). orable member, we had an entirely new interpretation of economics, for he talked of rent from land as being income. He ought to burn his books on Karl Marx, or give them to the Left Book Club, and take a course in Henry George, in order to learn something about the relative importance of land, capital and labour in production. The honourable member for Watson presented a very confused case, and did not throw any light on the subject at all. The right honourable member for Yarra stepped into the breach and spoke of unearned increment. I should like to know from him what he means by unearned increment. I know what I mean when I use that term, but I am not sure that the right honourable gentleman said exactly what he meant. I cannot understand how we could have an annual unearned increment. iVly interpretation of the term is that it represents the increase that accrues in the sale price of a piece of land due to the expenditure of government money and the natural increase of the land values in the district. That increase is not an annual value, Ibut a total value, and it varies from time to time, according to the value of land and the facilities that happen to be provided. 1 should be interested to hear some members who support the Government dealing with other kinds of unearned increment. I realize that they have not yet ministerial side of the House. Some of them, particularly those at the Siberian end, are inclined to think that they are still in opposition. I have never heard them talking of the unearned increment on shares. Brewery shares and gold shares increase in value from time to time, and I have known government bonds to do so; but those increases occur quite apart from anything that the individual owner may do. I am forced to conclude that there is a singular idea in tbe minds of the Labour party on the subject of land and land valueSj and what is sometimes loosely termed unearned increment. The honourable member for Deakin( Mr Hutchinson) got right on to the mark when he referred to the wool industry. This is still the most important export industry that Australia possesses, From the latter honbut the Government of the United Kingdom is not so keen as it was during the last war on purchasing Australia's wool",107,Nation Al Security War Timebanking Control Regulations

No less Harrison) when he was trying to get into the Government. This has always been regarded as a tax on unearned increment. It has been described.as a sectional tax, and so it is. It is a tax on those who own land. Every -body does not own land: every body cannot own land, because there is a limit to the area of land available in Australia. Those people who are privileged to own landof high value, a value which has been created by the efforts of the whole community, are called on to pay tax, and that is right. I sat behind the first Government which .imposed the land tax, and I supported it with pleasure. It was designed to break up big land monopolies, and to give to the sons of farmers an opportunity to settle on the land of their birth. It did not succeed 100 per cent, in achieving its purpose, but it broke up many large estates. I could point to many holdings in the Western District of Victoria which were only a sheep run before this tax was imposed. Now, on that same land, tbere are homes and crops, and a greatly increased population. The honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Holt) boasts that his Government reduced the land tax. That is nothing to boast of; that was an offence against progress. The action of the Government which imposed this tax gave to the sons of farmers an opportunity to settle on tlie land alongside where their fathers had reared them. birth right. sometimes asked why the people are crowding into the cities. They are being driven from the country by landlordism and land monopolies. The degree to which the land tax has failed to meet that evil may be laid at the door of anti-Labour governments which have successively reduced the land tax. Under this proposal an additional £500,000 will be obtained in land tax, yet when the preceding Government raised an additional £1,500,000 last year by means of an increase of this tax no objection was raised by honourable members opposite. We have heard about the struggling farmer, and also about the "" b i g "" farmer, but a farmer will need to be engaged in a very big way to be affected by this measure, those whose taxable balance exceeds the than 75 per cent, of the tax will fall on the owners of city property, and 75 per cent, of country landholders will be exempt from the tax.

423,Mr Harrison (Wentworth) [5.34]. Frequently Heard Lionorable Members,"mid three-quitrters of the taxpayers who will have to meet this imposition are city landowners. No doubt an endeavour will be made to pass it on in some way or other. When a large concern or a wealthy individual has to pay taxation in any form, an endeavour is usually made to pass on as .much of it as possible. Like country property, most city holdings are practically unsaleable at present, and it is rather hard that a man who cannot sell his land should he desire to do so, except at a great sacrifice, should have to pay a tax assessed on a figure which is much more than the true value of the property. The position in the country is very much worse. It is true that a relatively small number of people will be hit by this tax, but to some degree they are the same people who will be hit by the recent heavy forms of taxation, such as the company tax, income tax, &c. I realize that that is the deliberate intention of the Government, and is not something which is merely accidental. I represent, a country electorate which is larger than Italy, and nearly as largo as Erance. I have travelled extensively through my electorate, and I know of few men in it who are making great profits out of their land. There may be a few score, but the number is not very great. The point I wish to make is that few apparently wealthy land-owners are making their money out of their land. They are drawing their incomes from dividends on industrial shares, and so on, and are putting much of that money into their holdings. That is the true position, and it may be verified by any honourable member who chooses to make inquiries. Eor many years past it has been a popular impression among lionorable members opposite that landholders, large or small, derive great wealth from their holdings, and it must come as a surprise to them to learn that many property-owners depend upon income which they derive from other sources. Around such places as Marree, in the north of my electorate, there are many capable farmers who opened up that district years ago and who., it is said, have never been well enough off since to get away from it. And so it goes on from the salt bush country, through the marginal areas to the wheat Sir. Dwican-Hugliea. areas, and beyond. As the honourable member for Deakin quite rightly said earlier to-day, the impact of high costs of production is making the position of the man on the land an impossible one, even although he may have a large property. That is partly the effect of war conditions. The honourable member instanced the case of wool. Since the war began our wool clip has been compulsorily acquired for sale to the British Government, and in contrast to what several honourable members opposite have said, I venture to say that our wool growers are profoundly fortunate to be able to dispose of their product so easily as they are doing at present. Undoubtedly they will not make huge profits out of the present contract, but they are fortunate to have some return for their products at all. Very fow countries could possibly take it, though Germany would be pleased to do so. The land-owners have been referred to as the section of the community which has the most to lose in this war, but I do not agree with that. Bather would I say that the poorer sections of the community had most to lose, particularly people living in the cities. I cannot understand why the attitude of the Labour party towards our defence has not been more active in the past, because the people who live in the capital cities, particularly on the sea-front, are obviously those who are in the greatest danger. It may well be that, although men are flowing into the cities in increasing numbers, and the country is becoming denuded of population, so that fencing and other improvements are being neglected, the time may come-w e hope it will notwhen the people of the city will, 1 as tlie result of an attack, stream out into the country, and be very glad to find themselves there once more. Honourable members opposite may take pride in our land and fiscal policies since 1910, but I maintain that they have created an entirely artificial and lopsided structure. If those policies are continued there will be nothing to look forward to but a constant and increasing drift of the people from the land because, what with pests and bad seasons, even capable men have the very greatest difficulty in making a success of farming, and honourable member for Fawkner( Mr also to other property. According to a Holt), as a capital levy. The rate of tax is altogether too small for that. However, it is a step in the right direction. If anything, the Treasurer ( Mr and £600,000. Apparently he is "" getting Chifley) has been too generous in framing this measure. He could have been a lot harder. The tax is, as the bill specifies, a super tax at the rate of "" 20 per centum of the amount of land tax payable under the preceding provisions of this act in respect of that land; or 1 per centum of the amount of the excess of the taxable value of the land over £20,000, whichever is the lesser amount"". This bill will not raise a very great sum of money. Even taxpayers whose land is valued at £50,000 or £100,000 will contribute only a few hundreds of pounds. I agree with the honourable member for Fawkner that the provisions of this measure should be reviewed at a later stage, but iu my opinion the review should be with the idea of increasing the rate of tax and reducing the exemption. In tbe present circumstances, au exemption of £20,000 is far too generous. The amount of additional tax will be very small indeed, and I suggest that a reduction of the exemption to £10,000 would be reasonable. That might have the effect of skimming some fat, off wealthy land accumulators who have built up huge reserves in good times. The real effects of this measure will be felt in the post-war period, when, undoubtedly, there will be a loosening of large holdings. On the journey from Canberra to Sydney one passes through what may be described as one of the most land-locked areas in the Commonwealth, namely, the Bungendore district, where the Falkiners and other wealthy landowners hold thousands and thousands of acres of land which is in a comparatively unproductive state. Those people have been treated generously in the past, and now that our soldiers, sailors and airmen are fighting overseas and possibly sacrificing everything in order to win this war, it is little enough to ask the wealthy landholders to contribute substantially to war funds. After all, such contributions are in the nature of insurance premiums on their properties. I hope also that the bill will be extended not only to land property but newspaper report, Sir Joynton Smith recently sold his Imperial Arcade property in Sydney for between £500,000 out from under "". A capital tax should be imposed to catch these people. I hope that the Treasurer will consider extending the provisions of this bill at a later stage. [5.19] -The honourable member for Reid( Mr Morgan) apparently disagrees with the honourable member for Watson( Mr Falstein), because he refers to this tax as being a capital tax, whereas the honourable member for Watson said that it was not. capital tax. I suggest that the rate should be increased iu order to make it a real capital tax. It is a step in the right direction. not be denied that this is a capital tax. It must be paid regardless of whether or not the taxpayer makes a profit from his land. I listened with appreciation to what the honourable member for Deakin( Mr Hutchinson) said, and he accurately described the position of the man on the land. I repeat that this tax has to be paid regardless of whether or not income is received from the land. A farmer is still liable under this measure even although he makes no profit he has to pay federal land tax, state land tax, district rates, Federal and State income tax, and other dues. For that reason this tax is a bad one. I realize, of course, that we are at war and that it is up to everybody to make the best possible effort. We all have a stake in this land, and I should not cavil even at an unjust tax so long as everybody had to pay a share of it. But this tax will affect only the relatively few people who have land valued at more than £25,000. It is some consolation to know that the tax will produce some revenue for war purposes. In addition, I regard the imposition as so undesirable that it gives me some satisfaction to know that it will apply to relatively few people. However, I shall have a word or two to say about that aspect, of the matter later. The tax affects both state and country property,",110,Nation Al Security War Timebanking Control Regulations

I am mainly concerned at the probable effect on primary industries. The land tax is levied, in respect of country properties, almost solely on the wool industry, which is of first-rate national importance. Since the outbreak of the war, an average price of 13-M. per lb. has been received for our wool. In 1932, the Government of the day ordered the very closest investigation to he made of the cost of producing wool in Australia. The findings of the investigating body disclosed that, allowing for a reasonable return on capital invested, the cost was I4d. per lb. As costs are greater to-day, with wool at 13$d. per lb. the industry is not in a flourishing condition. certain favoured localities, in which rainfall is fairly assured, or where dairyeconomy, and that consequently tlie right ing or fat lamb raising is carried on in conjunction with wool-growing, the position of the producer is somewhat better. Costs to-day are tending ever upwards. Por example, the cost of shearing sheep by contract has increased by approximately Ss. 4d. a hundred during the last twelve months, and undoubtedly will go still higher. All other wage costs have the same tendency. ments can be made with Britain, the price of wool will remain constant. should not be levied on certain properties, even for emergency purposes, particularly as much better means could be adopted in order to obtain the amount required. The land tax is graduated. found that on some properties, owing to graduation, the tax amounted to no less than 2s. 6d. per sheep per annum. This huge tax is paid mainly by the great stud properties of Australia, which have built up the standard of Australian wool lo the highest point it has ever reached, and thus have undoubtedly assisted to establish the splendid standard of living which . is enjoyed in Australia to-day. The position is well exemplified by one of the leading studs of Australia, which will be in a much worse position when the additional tax is levied. Over a ten year period, the income of this company Mr Hutchinson. has shrunk by £50,000, and it has suffered accumulated losses amounting to £17,000; yet it has paid in land tax no less than £80,000! It is no good sayiug that the property could be sub-divided, because there are no people waiting to take up land at this time. It is most difficult for production to be maintained even in existing circumstances, bui the position will be made definitely worse for our leading studs when the increase is applied.. I fail to understand why, in such circumstances, any honourable member should regard as acceptable this means of raising money. The Government cotuld quite easily exploit a more legitimate field. I hope that what I have said is sufficient to make honourable members realize that an additional In burden is to be imposed on an industry which is the mainstay ""of Australia's way to raise the revenue is not being adopted. The report published in 1932 estimated that 45,000,000 of the 108,000,000 sheep in Australia' were grazed on properties on which land tax was paid; therefore, a great bulk of the wool production comes from laud which pays tbe tax. A levy which is imposed without any regard to income earned is Unless arrangebased unsoundly and should, not in any Great circumstances be tolerated. With rising costs and a set price for its product, the Therefore, this tax wool industry will shortly have to be seriously considered by this Parliament. Unless a higher price can be obtained, for this, our greatest product, considerable damage may be done to the entire Australian economy. There is another line of In 1932, the committee government action which runs somewhat parallel to this. Prom time to time, the Taxation Department reviews the valuations of country properties, and in most instances the valuations are subsequently raised. I do not pay land tax, therefore I have no axe to grind; but many taxpayers will have to pay the higher rate on increased valuations, despite the fact that their incomes are fixed and their other costs are rising. The Government might very well withdraw the bill, and adopt other means to raise the additional amount required.

I from that of the lionorable member for Fawkner in regard to this tax. I consider that it is a tax obtained from income resulting from the unearned increment in the value of land. I do not regard it, as a capital tax. The tax is imposed on income derived from properties owned by individuals and companies many of which have done nothing whatever to give to them their enhanced value. We are well aware that inariv hig banking and financial companies hold properties which have steadily increased although the owners of thorn have donf nothing to bring about that result. Therefore, 1 coii -'idcr that the land tax is a proper impost, whicli should not be regard ed by the honourable, member for Fawkner mid his colleagues ns a capital levy. I commend the bill to the House. I am sorry that a higher rate of tax has not been proposed. find it very difficult to work up enthusiasm for this particular tax, whether as an emergency measure or otherwise. As the honourable member for Fawkner( MrH o l t ) has said, it was in troduced many years ago in order to effect the subdivision of many of the larger properties in Australia. Throughout its history, it has not succeeded in doing that, but has been maintained purely for the raising of revenue. If it ever had any value in compelling the .subdivision of estates, an increase for that purpose to-day would prove disasimmediately our prevailing trous to this country, because the problem, at present is not to find land for rhose who wish to cultivate it but to prevent: those who are on the land from leaving their holdings; consequently, anything which may tend to accelerate the d r if t from the T h a t , is so. He country to the city should not be encouraged. The Government expects to obtain from this tax additional revenue 1 remind him and other amounting to . approximately £459,000. That, is not, a very great amount. Although the income tax is not, to be raised in respect of many persons who are earning reasonably high incomes, the Government proposes to increase the land tax, which is directly a capital tax. profit is earned or not. whether any profit is made. We have the peculiar situation that persons with incomes ranging between £500 and £1,500 a year are to be exempt from additional tax, yet the tax of others is to be raised, whether income is earned by them or not. Very little additional tax would need to be imposed on persons receiving between £500 and £1,500 a year in order to raise an extra £459,000. The largest part of the land tax is collected in respect, of in valueover the years, city properties. Much of the tax is passed on in the charges that are made for goods and services. Where prices are not controlled and rents are not pegged, the tendency will be still further to increase costs in those directions. An investor in city property will either have",113,Nation Al Security War Timebanking Control Regulations

That the bill be now read a se<:ond time. purpose of this bill is to impose a super tax of 20 per cent, on the present rates of land tax on estates with an unimproved capital value of more than £20,000. Our land tax legislation has had a fluctuating history. The tax was first introduced in 1910 by the Fisher Government for the avowed purpose of breaking up large estates. Since that time it has become an admittedly revenue-producing measure. The basic rates were fixed in 1914, and they remained in force until 191S-19, when a super tax of 20 per cent, was imposed on the then existing rates. The super tax was removed by the Bruce-Page Government in .1922-23. ""Between 1927-28 and 1940-41 substantia] reductions of the tax wore effected from time to time. In 1940-41.. owing to the exigencies of the war and to the need to raise additional money, the then Treasurer ( Mr Spender) introduced a. measure which doubled the rates then in force. This had the effect of restoring the tax to the rates applicable in 1.914-15. An impression may have got abroad that the rates now proposed are considerably in advance of any hind tax operating in the past, but this is not, the case. I may compare tbe fluctuation? in the land tax to the letter "" N "". posed in 1940-41, and the super tax now Taking the beginning of the letter as the proposed are regarded by the Opposition starting point, there followed a. steep in as emergency measures which should crease of rates, then came a suhstantial be reviewed at the earliest possible reduction, and later again came fur moment. I shall therefore welcome ther heavy increases. The latest increases an assurance from the Government have been made owing to the pressure of that it , too, regards these taxes in war needs. Even with the proposed super that light, and therefore subject to tax of 20 per cent, the rates will be lower review when the present emergency than those operating between 191S-19 and ends. However, in the meantime, we 1922-23. The Opposition recognizes the urgency of the Government's need to raise additional money for war purposes, and it. therefore will offer no objection to the passage of the bill. I desire, however, to make some general observations on the measure. Taxing bills already passed by the House since the introduction of tbe budget have been regarded by members of the Opposition as applying emergency rates due to war conditions. I emphasize that the Opposition regards the rates of land tax now proposed as falling definitely and it considers that these rates should be reviewed as early as practicable after the emergency conditions have passed. There are some serious objections to the principle of land taxation, which have been recognized since this form of tax was first imposed in 1910. We consider, in rhe first place, that, in effect, the land tax is a capital levy which discriminates arbitrarily and unjustly between differenr sections of. the community. The land tax is, in effect, a tax on one form of property, and is. not imposed upon other forms of property. Further, when profits obtained from the land are subject to rhis tax as well as to other taxes tbe land tax becomes a double tax. This measure pays no regard to the ordinary and generally accepted principle of ability to pay. When the land is mortgaged and the business arising from it is carried on at a loss the effect of the tax is particularly harsh. Unfortunately, the burden of the tax does not always rest upon the owner of the land. In respect of big city properties the burden is frequently carried by tenants in a small way of business who are called upon to pay higher rents in order to enable the landlord to meet, the land tax. Both the increase of the land tax i m recognize the need of the Government to",114,Nation Al Security War Timebanking Control Regulations

There is sufficient room for doubt to justify the inclusion of this provision in the bill. In new clause 3S.B the Government has conceded the principle that there should not be double taxation in instances where legislation similar to this operates in other countries The only other country in which such legislation operates, to my knowledge^ is New Zealandj and the Treasurer informed the special committee that he would discuss the matter with the New Zealand Government with the intention of securing, if possible, the passage of reciprocal legislation so that a person making, in Australia, a gift of assets in New Zealand, will not be subject to duty both in Australia and in New Zealand, and vice versa. If the Treasurer can arrange for the New Zealand Government to insert,, in its .legislation, a clause similar to this new clause, one-half of the duty will bo paid to each Government in respect of all transactions, whether the donor is domiciled in this country or in New Zealand. clause 3SB proposes to grant a rebate in the event of gift duty being imposed, in respect of one transaction, both in Australia and in another country. But what will be the position of people within Australia who will be subject to Commonwealth gift duty and State gift duty? Queensland is the only State which imposes a gift tax. Persons who become subject to the Queensland tax, as well as the Commonwealth duty, should receive the same consideration as those who become liable to Commonwealth gift duty and the duty imposed by another country. very modest rate of 3 per cent. is another example of double taxation.

Proposed new clause 32A provides machinery for reference to the Board of Review. The Government has acted wisely in providing that persons subject to g if t tax shall have the right of appeal to the Board of Review, and, on questions of law, to a Supreme Court. This principle is recognized in income tax law because, under this involved legislation, the Taxation Commissioner must be given wide discretionary powers in regard to many matters. The Commissioner does not desire, and should not be required, to accept f u l l responsibility, and the Government has recognized this by providing that taxpayers shall have the right of appeal. The bill also provides, in another clause, that the taxpayer shall have the right of appeal to the Land Valuation Boardi n respect of the valuation of real and personal property.

The sub-clause as contained in the bill provides that g if t duty shall constitute a first charge on all property, other than money or negotiable instruments, comprised in the g if t , but it is considered that such charge should not extend to and affect the title of a bona fide purchaser for value without notice of the charge, and the amendment achieves this object. This bill introduces a principle which could be dangerous and unfair, unless its provisions were administered with great care. If a donor makes a g if t to a donee, both the donor and the donee are liable to make a return, and are jointly and severally liable to pay duty. The donor is primaril y liable and I suppose that in actual practice and experience, ithe donor in 99 cases out of 100 will pay the duty and that w ill be the deliberately or inadvertently, the donee will be liable to pay the duty. As the Minister has said, the liability for the duty becomes the first charge on the subject of the g if t , unless it be money or a negotiable instrument. The public must be made aware of that. A man could quite innocently be holding an asset which is surcharged with g if t duty and not be I aware that it carries this automatic charge. Tbe Government has agreed, and the Minister has moved an amendment, to minimize that provision in an important respect. Where this asset, whatever it may be, has passed into the hands of a third person who has acquired it, without notice of the fact that there is a charge attaching to it , he is not liable for the duty. I think that that is the fairest way in which this provision can be administered. If a person buys something without means of knowing that there is a surcharge upon it , surely he should not be liable for the payment of duty. The amendment w ill give suhstantial relief from harsh operation of the law. Amendment agreed to. assisting the Treasurer) [4.29] I move That the following sub-clause be added to the clause:"" (7.)

The purpose of the amendment is to afford relief to these genuine transactions by inserting in the bill ft provision that where the disponee pays any amounts to the disponor in reduction of the mortgage within five years of the disposition such amounts w ill be taken into account by the commissioner who w ill re-assess the duty and refund the amount of duty applicable to such payment. support the amendment. This clause is evidence of the difficulties that are brought upon the community by comparatively few people who seek loopholes by which they may evade the spirit of the law of the country. them. tliere are many of them. I shall go so far as to say that there may be more than there should be. I realize, from what the Minister assisting the Treasurer ( Mr Lazzarini) has told us about the administration of similar legislation elsewhere, that it is necessary tliat there should be some means of preventing a man from selling property to a relative and taking as security, which will in due course be repaid, moneys given by the mortgagee to the mortgagor. The amendment provides that, if within five years, the mortgage, or a portion of the mortgage, is repaid, the donor, who becomes the mortgagee under the transaction, will receive a refund of a part or the whole of the g if t duty which he originally paid. But in regard to transactions which are perfectly bona fide-and I venture to think that there are great numbers of them-in which a man does in truth actually sell the property to the relative and receives a mortgage for the unpaid purchase money, ancl where there is no attempt at evasion, it is unfortunate that he should be penalized because of the misdeeds of other people who are not so honourable.

To a l i m it of £100 per annum, tliat will not be regarded as a g if t to the wife. One of the amendments whicli the Opposition will accept but concerning which I express a certain amount of regret, is the new provision relating to the aggregation period. In the original measure, the aggregation period was five years. I understand that in Queensland it is two years. I have heard the case upon which the Government has been advised to extend the period, and I know that it is a substantial one. The contentions which have been put forward in favour of expanding the aggregation period, are founded upon good information. But I am afraid that the aggregation period of three years will bring a good deal of administrative trouble. 1 can only express regret that the period should be so long. My own opinion is that twelve months would have been an improvement, if the Government bad been able, by some other means, to tighten up those anomalies which necessitarp rhe introduction of a three-year period. The Government will improve the measure considerably in future if , by the consideration of other means of fcieing up those returns, it, is able to reduce the aggregation period to twelve months, on the basis of six months before each g if t , and six months after it . The three-year neriod was approved by the committee, because there appeared to be no alternative in tbe light of known circumstances. I hope that the administration of the measure in future will make itpossible for the Government to find a means of overcoming this difficulty. I ask the Minister assisting the Treasurer ( Mr Lazzarini) to explain the amendment relating to H is Majesty's Armed Forces. Does it, mean the Australian Military Forces, and the Australian I m perial Force, or only the Australian Imperial Force? Doesi t comprehend all of the forces which are being, or which may be, raised for the defence of Australia as well as those forces designed for participation in the Avar overseas. them. have that assurance on record, because a number of governmental and semi governmental instrumentalities are making up the difference between the service pay and civil pay of their employees who have enlisted. Those bodies should be protected, in view of the fact that the Government is granting protection to sporting clubs and associations. L notice that the Country Women's Association is instanced as a charitable or philanthropic organization. I assume that that body is distinct from any Country Women's Party Association, aud that it comprises ladies who, in the country districts, perform useful public service. Honourable members on this side of the chamber desire an assurance from the Minister that the activities of these bodies are non-political and that they do not adopt a partisan attitude upon matters of public moment. If it were possible, under cover of this provision, for a country women's party association to obtain exemption in respect of gifts, tbe Government would miss a considerable amount of revenue. As you, Mr Chairman, are aware, the Country party is now owned and controlled by the big grazing organizations of Australia. Tbe CHAIRMAN ( Mr Prowse) Order! This clause contains no reference to the Country party. graziers who own the Country party and who, by making those gifts to it, may escape their taxation obligations to the Commonwealth. For once, 1 join with the honourable member for Barker( Mr. Archie Cameron), who declared that the exemption which has been granted to sporting clubs and associations is a farcical provision in a measure the express purpose of which is to raise additional revenue in order to supplement war finance. I see no reason in the world to justify that exemption. effect of the exemptions w ill be to divert considerable wealth which is now in the",121,Chmvlet

In my opinion, the Government has adopted a correct principle.

They depend, to a large degree, upon the amount of voluntary financial assistance that they receive from people who, believing in their aims and objects, make contributions to them.

Payments made on account of illness of the employee are also exempt. Bonuses or gratuities paid in recognition of special or faithful service, where the commissioner is satisfied that the payment is bona fide, are exempt. The proviso in the bill excluding from exemption., pensions, gratuities and incorporated company bonuses paid by an employer to an employee connected by ties of blood or marriage with the employer is being omitted. The question of whether the payment is bona fide has to be. .proved to the satisfaction of the commissioner, as I have already stated.

These are cases in which the equitable title in a property has passed, but the matter was not ripe for lodgement on the prescribed date.

I have not had time to study the Queensland act or the New Zealand act, but I understand that the latter provides that no real property, except that situate in New Zealand, shall be levied upon. I suggest that this point should be considered and, if necessary, an appropriate amendment made.

That, in sub-clause ( 3 ) , the word ""registered "" be omitted with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words "" lodged for registration "". I support the amendments, but I desire to make an observation on the clause as it will be amended. The clause provides for taxing certain gifts that may have been made prior to the commencement of the act, though the gift has not been formally completed. The amendment will minimize the risk that will arise from the incompletion of the transaction, but I believe that the scope of the amendment would need to be enlarged in order to give full protection. The principle that should be adopted is that, wliere. the equitable title in the subject of tbe gift had passed from the donor to the donee, there should not be any possibility of gift duty being payable merely because of the incompletion of some formality which may be delayed for months after the vesting of the property in the donee. The Minister has provided that, where the instrument under which a gift is made is lodged for registration, no duty shall be levied, but I am informed that, that will not cover all tbe circumstances. However, I am obliged for the concession made in this amendment. It is an improvement on tlie original bill, but I suggest that next year the Governview to amending it in the direction I have indicated.

Such calculations will have to be made later. Exemptions having been begun, it is very difficult to call a halt. not publish a schedule, the number of gifts cannot be estimated. which Santa Claus intends to bestow this year will be exempt. Persons who are compelled to make returns might be assisted if the Government were to address itself to the matter of taking over the whole of the taxation offices of the States, and running them as Commonwealth instrumentalities. It might then be possible to make one set of forms do what several sets are required to do to-day, and that would, in addition, make for unification, which is the desire of every one. The work of tbe department would be simplified, and relief would be given to those unfortunate persons who have a nightmare as the result of the enormity of the task that confronts them when taxation returns have to he filled in. It is bad enough if one is only an ordinary printed ancl introduced by the Treasurer, and. working person, and has to fill in only one set of forms, but when one has to fill in weekly, monthly, and yearly forms, giving to the departments all the information they require, it is becoming an art. Simplification of forms is desirable. I hope that the committee will meet during the recess, in order to see what it may do to make considerably easier the lot of those who have to fill in forms. [3.38] -There is no doubt that the objective of this legislation is to secure revenue by a cold, calculating method. I do not know why gifts to sporting clubs and associations should be exempt. If I cared to do so, I could name quite a lot of associations which have not been established for the purpose of making a profit. Some of those that are fairly big property owners have a very doubtful record. To my knowledge, a flaw in the Income Tax Act has enabled a number of them to evade taxation for years. It is quite possible that they will become the recipients of gifts under this legislation. That should not be permitted. The members of the committee have shown considerable lack of knowledge of the subject with which they dealt, and also weakness. The provisions of the measure should again be examined microscopically. Gifts made to charitable, benevolent or religious institutions should be exempt; but there are many other institutions which are not entitled to any consideration. I have no doubt that the bill will be accepted by this House. Being in a Christmas mood, it will pass anything nlaced before it, without considering the implications. After two or three years have elapsed, and a return of the exemptions is sought, some very illuminating examples will be disclosed. [3.41] I ask leave of tbe House to have the report of the special committee of members incorporated in Mansard, for record purposes. [Leave granted.] The report is as follows:2fitli November, .1941.

It was indicated in sections of the press that adequate provision had not been made in the bill to cover certain important and necessary transactions i u relation to alimony payable by an order of the court or by agreement, and that therefore such payments might become subject, to g if t duty. Honourable members may rest assured that these dangers have been removed. Under the original provisions of the bill, money paid by an employer to an employee on active service, in order to make up the difference between his military and civil pay, might have been regarded as subject to tax. 1 understand that an amendment will be moved which will ensure that such payments shall not be taxable. There will also be removed any doubt, as to whether n taxpayer may insure his life for the benefit of his wife, ancl pay a premium up to £100 per annum without that payment being made the subject of g if t duty. I have instanced some of the improvements which will appear in the measure, according to the memorandum already circulated to lionorable members. There are others; probably a number of them may more suitably be mentioned in committee. Those to which I have directed attention give to the House the assurance that after the amendments have been made the bill will be one which can be administered safely and efficiently in the light of present-day conditions. The Opposition w ill have pleasure in supporting the Government on the motion for the second reading of the bill, as well as in respect of the amendments recommended hy the committee which the Government has declared that it will accept. This measure is a step in the right direction. I have never been able to understand why governments have not stopped the evasion of estate duty, particularly as the methods adopted are perfectly well-known and could easily be prevented. I do not consider that the Commonwealth should issue such negotiable documents, transferable by hand, as debentures or bonds. It is notorious that many wealthy persons purchase debentures ancl place them in safe deposits, making the arrangement that, in the event of their death, they will be claimed by the surviving members of their families. By this means, estate duty is evaded. The bill proposes to tax gifts and donations made openly in the light of day, not surreptitiously, and in defiance of the law. It has much to commend it. Buti t would be more to the point if the Ministry were to agree to recall all Commonwealth bonds, ancl to issue only inscribed stock, the owner of whicli could be traced and taxed on the interest he bad received from the investment. With such securities as bonds and debentures, it is impossible to prevent evasion. Not. all persons who own these Government pieces of paper are dishonest; but the dishonest can always escape taxation if they want to do so. There is another f r u it f u l source of evasion in the transfer of company shares. Quite a number of persons sign undated transfers of shares to members of their families or others. Upon the death of the owner, an antecedent date is placed on the transfer, with the result that estate duty is evaded, [ f the Government really wishes to stop evasion of taxation, it need only promulgate regulations under the National Security Act, first in order to cover the last/ position that I have mentioned, ancl secondly in order to prevent the issue of debentures in connection with any of the huge loans that are to be floated from now until the end of the war. The country would be the gainer by such action. The value of the bill is somewhat discounted by tbe number of its exemptions, many of which, doubtless, are well warranted. Added to that list is another page containing the exemptions recommended by the committee which investigated the matter.

The Opposition will vote for this measure, but I desire to make a few observations upon it . [During question time, the Treasurer informed the House that a committee of honourable members appointed to give consideration to the details of the bill had made a number of recommendations which would result in the introduction of a schedule of amendments by the Government. That committee was representative of both sides of the Hoitse, and it thoroughly examined tbe measure, as the Treasurer, who was a member of it , is aware. However, there' will still remain some provisions of the bill which will not completely satisfy everybody. I do not desire to anticipate the amendments to be introduced, and 1 arn therefore in some difficulty in discussing certain points to which I desire to devote some attention. I may, therefore, be forgiven if , in the course of my remarks, 1 indicate the effect likely to follow the adoption of some of the major recommendations of the committee. SinceI am in entire this bill was introduced some weeks ago copies of it have travelled f a r ancl wide, ancl its provisions have caused a good deal of misunderstanding and fear as to their probable effects. Some of the amendments to be introduced will have important results in respect of gifts to relatives by blood or by marriage. The Treasurer has also agreed to release from the ambit of the measure as originally introduced quite a number of persons other than relatives by blood or by marriage, and also some organizations in respect of which g if t duty could not reasonably be charged In the framin g of these amendments, care has been taken, I believe, to ensure that in giving exemption to donees other than relatives by blood or by marriage, evasion by subtle means shall not be possible by the making of gifts through agencies, and private or proprietary companies. The position in this regard, has been amply protected. In its original form the b ill did not, in my view and in that of a number of other persons, provide for the normal procedure of writing off debts. I understand that the Government's amendments will cover that point. Provision is made in the measure for what is known as an ""aggregation period "". This was fixed at five years in the measure as drafted. It was provided that gifts were to be grouped with similar gifts made during the last two and a half years, and gifts that may be made in tihe next two and a half years, for the purpose of calculating the rate of duty to be applied. I am glad that the Treasurer has agreed to reduce the aggregation period from five years to three years; but I wish that it had been reduced to two years. Even the three-year period will cause some administrative difficulties that could be avoided w i th a shorter period. Provision is being made, also, for appeals.

This bill will be another addition to the already long list of taxation laAvs which are in force in Australia to-day. It is the first all-Australian measure designed to impose a tax on gifts. However, similar legislation is in operation in the State of Queensland and the Dominion of New Zealand. In certain respects this bill follows the lines of such legislation, hut it makes departures in other respects. Some of the departures are necessitated by the conditions which must govern the application of such a tax throughout the Common weal th.

To-day, when the rates of income tax and estate duty are very high, it is important that people should be prevented from so rearranging their affairs as to reduce their financial responsibility to the Commonwealth. The bill is important to the taxpayers as well as to the Government because, in these -days, everybody is expected to pay large sums of money to the Crown for the prosecution of the war, and it is advisable that individuals should be prevented from creating distinctions in their own favour. Por this reason, the Opposition agrees that the passage of this legislation is desirable at. the present time. Under normal conditions, however, the Government could achieve its objects more effectively and more efficiently by means of amendments to the income tax laws or other laws, and by introducing new forms of administration; these would probably produce the same amount of revenue and the bill will not be a great revenue raiser, it will, have the effect of compelling people, who transfer their estates, to compensate the Crown for the revenue which otherwise they would avoid contributing. So far as I am aware, nothing in the bill prevents anybody from transferring assets, or dispossessing estate, by means of transfers to third parties. But anybody who does so will be obliged to pay the appropriate rates of tax set out on the graduated scale in the schedule to the bill. I have nothing more to say concerning the principle of the bill, but I believe that its administration will make one more addition to the cost of government. It cannot be administered easily; it will necessitate the establishment of another branch of an already overworked department; it will require another set of returns to be furnished by taxpayers; and it will provide an extra",131,Chmvlet

He also asked what additional penalty, if any, had been imposed on such firms. The Minister for Trade and Customs (Senator Keane) has now advised me that early in the history of price control the Commonwealth Prices Commissioner issued a general order setting out the procedure under which increased costs of a certain list of declared goods could be passed on in prices. Considerable publicity was given to this formula and traders were advised to apply the same principle to undeclared goods. Later a systematic check of the operations of traders was undertaken for the purpose of ascertaining whether the principles of price control were being observed. A feature of the general instruction was that gross profit margins were not to be increased without the approval of the Commissioner. Investigations disclosed that in many instances this principle had not been followed; in some cases the increased gross profit margins did not return to traders a net profit that could be regarded as unduly high; in other cases the net profit was higher than would have been allowed by the Commissioner if applications had been made for permission to increase gross profit margins. Nevertheless, in those cases for Dalley( Mr where there was evidence that the traders concerned had not observed this important requirement of price control all goods sold by those traders were declared and brought under strict price control. The procedure then followed by the Commissioner was(a) to determine a reasonable gross profit margin for the trader concerned ; (£>) to ascertain the excess gross profit obtained over the margin so determined;",133,Bills Returned Prom Th E Senate

The honourable member may rest assured that the Government will do everything within its power to bring to Canberra the central staffs of as many departments as possible, subject to funds being available for the purpose. urgent advice from Tasmania that many grounds of great hardship may be made primary producers are unable to carry to the area officer, or in the case of a on harvesting operations owing to the serving soldier, to the commanding officer acute shortage of labour. When application is made for the temporary release of men who are undergoing compulsory military training, the applicant is told that in each case information must be supplied in respect of the name of the trainee, the unit to which he is attached, and the location of the camp in whicli he is being trained. The farmers have pointed out that it is absolutely impossible for them to have this information. Hay is rotting, and cannot be pressed. I know of one farmer who has had 500 tons of hay destroyed by caterpillars, the necessary labour to harvest it. Will the Minister for the Army investigate the position, ancl arrange that men engaged in farming occupations shall not be called up during harvesting operations? Will he also inquire as to tbe possibility of releasing temporarily from training, men who are already in camp, in order that harvesting operations may be continued? with the farmers who are experiencing these difficulties. The matter has been considered by me and by the Military also received the sympathetic consideration of my predecessor in office. A recent amendment to the list of reserved occupations provides that rural military service at 21 years of age and upwards, instead of 25 years as they formerly were, and leading hands in charge of three or more men at 25 years. Fai-m hands who are not seasonal workers are exempt at 30 years of age. Now that camps have been extended for new recruits to a duration of six months, the Military Board is giving consideration to regulating the attendance of rural workers in camps in two periods, at times of the year when the least inconvenience will be caused to the particular industries concerned. For those men whose occupations do not come within the provisions of the list of reserved occupations and whose calling up for",137,Commonwealth Bank Staff

529,Mr Forde,"I have every sympathyso high as the increase of 25 per cent, of total returns to the industry. The dairying industry did not enter the war with low nrices, as was the case with some other primary products. Tbe following table of domestic prices will show a steady increase over the five years prior to tbe commencement of hostilities:_ Butter. Per owt. s. d. d. 1934-35 1935-36 1936-37 I937-3S 1938-39 If there were any assurance that the present favorable position would remain unaltered, the Prices Commissioner would see no reason for a further review of the industry for some time. Material changes are, however, taking place in the industry this year, owing to the necessity for transferring a considerable volume of production from butter to cheese. An enhanced price for cheese is assured, but tbe butter position is uncertain. The Prices Commissioner, therefore, had undertaken to make another survey of the industry in six months' time, when it was anticipated that matters now in doubt would be resolved. I have, bowever, requested tbe Minister for Trade and Customs to arrange for the review to be made by the Prices Commissioner within three months from now. in reply to a question, upon notice, by quiries made following tbe Abbco comthe honourable member for Biverina( Mr pany's conviction were not adequate to Langtry), I indicated that inquiries would the occasion.
