Still further, the House was assured that, although a preference might not have been given, the practice of giving it had been established by tKe last Government, and that all the present Minister had done was to refuse to discontinue, or continue, It is a piece of audaa practice that might or might not be in force.

55,Mr Speaker,"The honourable memOrders is rapidly passing away, I hope that he will not be subjected to further interruption. the honourable and learned member for Corio was a simple one, and such that any candid Minister who had no ulterior object to serve could have answered by a simple "" Yes"" or "" No"" after five minutes' consideration. Yet this so-called restorer of responsible Government took nearly two months to make up his mind whether he would or would not give increased protection to local manufactures. {His answer was not an explicit avowal such as was demanded by the question. The honourable and learned member for Corio asked whether a preference clause would be inserted in each contract. That question called for a simple ""Yes"" or "" No . "" gentleman, however, distinctly evaded the point. He said that the present practice would be adhered to. What is the present practice ? Honourable members do not know whether a preference is granted to the extent of 15 per cent, or 50 per cent. Unless my information is incorrect, the preference given in some cases considerably exceeded the smaller percentage mentioned. Brief as was the right honourable gentleman's answer, it throws into lurid relief the pitiable gyraallies-. tions to which he resorts to maintain his present precarious balance.

He shrank from no exercise of national power which had as its object the encouragement of the individual enterprise of the community.. I have never heard a finer exposition of protectionist sentiment. For what is protection but the application of the ""national power""' to the ""encouragement of the individual enterprise of the community "" ? That is the essence of the doctrine preached here and elsewhere by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports and others.

Do they abet this project of using the national power to bolster up the speculative enterprises of private individuals ? able member's version. avowal places these honourable members upon the horns of a dilemma, and their wriggling when they face their constituents will be an interesting spectacle for both gods and men. The honourable member for Parramatta is very anxious to know my opinion upon the matter of giving preference to local contractors. Personally, I have always given a preference to Australian goods when spending my own money; but not when spending public money. I believe that every man benefits more or less by the prosperity of the community of which he is a unit. If a certain condition be fulfilled, preference to local producers is perfectly legitimate. That condition is, prior authorization of the preference by Parliament. But it is little short of a fraud upon the people for the Minister, without the sanction of Parliament, to dip his hand into the public purse to pay artificial prices for local products. This would still be true if the Minister who did it were a protectionist. But as the Minister is a free-trader, I say that this transaction covers him and his free trade colleagues with ineffaceable infamy. When I was explaining what I had done in connection with this matter a few davs ago, the Prime Minister interjected"" Oh, yours is a sham preference."" In opposition to his opinion, I place that of the honourable member for New England, whose judgment is riot warped by personal interests, nor tinctured by the sweets of office. it. member for New England say ? He has not fifteen hundred golden reasons for swallowing his principles. Speaking upon 22nd September last, he is reported, on page 4827 of Hansard, to have saidConcerning the explanation which has been made burdens in this way, we shall have abdiby the honourable member for Coolgardie, I desire to say that I have every sympathy with the position taken up by him. As a free-trader I insist that no preference should be given to any manufacturer. No administrative act should be in the direction of altering the policy of the country. That should be altered by jparliament alone. The position taken up by the honourable member for Coolgardie is the correct one, and I am fair enough to commend him for it. Let us examine this incident a little more closely. When this Parliament enacted a Tariff, the duties then imposed represented the full preference which the Legislature decreed should be given to articles produced in Australia. Yet here we find an alleged free-trade Minister granting a preference in secret, behind the back of Parliament, and will not even inform us whether his colleagues approve of his action. Only a few months ago, the Prime Minister and the Postmaster-General repeatedly denounced these duties as a hideous robbery of the people. Yet now they are not merely parties to this hideous robbery, but they have actually agreed to add another 15 per cent, to these cruel imposts. This is done, not in the open light of day by legislative enactment, but by the secret fiat of a Minister. However viewed, it is an audacious thing for a Government, and still more audacious for a single Minister, to squander public money in this fashion, without first seeking the approval of the trustees of the people in this House. I regret very much the absence from fhe Chamber of the Minister of Home Affairs, because I should like to learn whether he approves of this proceeding. If he does, many of us will lose what little faith we retain in the rectitude and consistency of public men. Hitherto that honourable gentleman has maintained a very high character in this House. His record is unsullied, and I am -merely voicing the general 1 opinion when I say that he stands upon an altogether higher plane than does !the Prime Minister or the Postmaster-General. I should like to know whether, having regard to his great career., he is going to share the society of these worthies in the deepest pit of political apostasy yet reached by politicians in any British Legislature. I say that the action of the Postmaster-General is an affront to this House, whose prerogatives have been invaded by him, and I trust that honourable members will resent it. Parliament is the sole authority in the land which is entitled to increase the public burdens, and if we con-' nive at allowing a"" Minister to add to those cated one of the most important functions committed to our care by the electors of Australia. have listened with some interest and amusement to the outburst of righteous indignation on the part of the honourable member for Coolgardie.",16,Adjournment Preference To Local Tenderers

Then perhaps when we have nothing better to do, we shall be able to find an answer to it. In the meantime, I wish to say a few words relative to the question which has been raised by the honourable member for Coolgardie. action of the Postmaster-General in this connection, and I hope that we have seen the last of the granting of any preference by administrative act. viously expressed the opinion upon the floor of this House, that whatever is done in that respect ought to be done statutorily, and by a majority opinion of Parliament expressed in the proper way. At the same time, I would point out that so far nothing has been done which need cause any grave alarm. been done which seems to portend any great menace to the Commonwealth consequent upon the action of the Postmaster-General. His action is to be regretted, but at the same time it is quite a small, matter. would suggest that before the honourable member for Coolgardie rises to play the part of a hard taskmaster, in this connection, he should look a little nearer home. _ It strikes me as a very peculiar proceeding that the very honourable member, who the other day insisted that this preference must be given, who asked the Minister time and again if he intended to grant it I refer to the honourable member for Bourke-shoul d to-day have supported the honourable member for Coolgardie, who complains of that preference. member for Bourke support the honourable reading from this session's Hansard. member for Coolgardie?

So far, the motion has been received most flippantly by both the Prime Minister and the Postmaster-General, though no more important honourable question could be brought before us than that submitted by the honourable member for Coolgardie. Neither the Prime Minister nor the Postmaster-General appear to have learned what responsible government means, and it is our duty to instil into them a little knowledge on the subject. The present Government boast of very high aims, and, according to their The honourable member for Coolshowing, are about to set an example to all cast several taunts and the Governments of the world. Purity of administration is essential where we have a Ministry responsible to the House, and the House responsible to the country; and in the past we have always accepted as statements of fact replies given by Ministers to questions put either with or without notice. This is the only way in which honourable members can obtain information as to the administration of the Departments, and the honourable member for Coolgardie justly complains that neither the Prime and support Minister nor the Postmaster-General will reply to these questions.

As to the charge that the Government has refused to give information, I do not think that it was levelled seriously by the honourable member who made it, or taken seriously by the House.

The duty of a Government towards its supporters is often greater than that which it owes to its opponents. natural that the supporters of a Government should be jealous of any reprehensible departure from a policy which they aie supposed to favour, and on the strength of which they are prepared to follow them.

As I have already said, I think that the discussion has done good. A coalition Government is always in a very difficult position, since those who support it are liable at any moment to be misunderstood by their constituents, because of their acquiescence in certain acts in the nature of a compromise between the two parties. For that reason I gave notice of my three questions, in order to obtain a denial or a justification which I could, if necessary, pass on to my constituents. I have now gone to the Prime Minister, failing to obtain a reply from the Postmaster-General, as one goes to the High Court from a Supreme Court. The discussion has laid down the principle that legislation is the test of whether, a Minister should do this or that in connection with the work of his Department. The Postmaster General has stated that the matter was only a small one, because in one instance only 6s. '8d. was involved. That excuse reminds me of Marryat's famous story of the nursemaid who excused herself on the ground that "" It was only a little one.""

I wish to show to the honourable and learned member for Parkes why I made the interjection of which he has complained.

The Postmaster-General is not, like the honourable and learned member, a constitutional authority, and there is, furthermore, a constitutional objection to questions of law being stated in Ministerial replies.

I think that the honourable and learned member's criticism is not quite fair; though I know that there was no intention to be unfair, because no one is fairer than he. I do not see the honourable and learned member's point as to the constitutional position. I consider that every Department, in administering its affairs, in calling for tenders and transacting business, has a perfect right to consider matters affecting each tender. us suppose that one tenderer is well known to the Department, and has done his work well-that he has been in every respect a satisfactory contractor,' and has supplied the very thing that the Department has required-and suppose, further, that a stranger tenders at a slightly higher price; surely in such a case the Department would have just the same right as a private business man would have to distinguish between the tenderer whom they knew and the one they did not know.

I wish, however, to emphasize one or two points. A certain amount of feeling has been engendered with regard to the method by which this Bill has been placed before us; but I hope that honourable members will be able to decide this question apart from any feeling that may have been betrayed, and upon the absolute merits of the Bill itself. Some misconception seems to have arisen as to what will be the effect of passing the Bill. I only mention this matter because I gather from the questions which have been addressed to me that the . idea prevails that if the Bill were passed in its present form it would have the effect of immediately imposing duties upon certain imports. That, however, is a mistake. The provision made in Division VI . A of the Tariff is fairly explicit. It reads as follows :To come into operation' on dates to be fixed by 1'ioclamation, and exempt from duty in the meantime, except as to iron galvanized, plate and sheet. Proclamation to issue, so soon as it is certified by the Minister, that the manufacture, to which the . Pioclamation refers, has been sufficiently estabI belished in the Commonwealth according to the provisions of any law relating to bonuses for the encouragement of manufactures, or to the establishment of manufactures under the direct control of the Commonwealth or State Governments, hut >\o Proclamation to issue, except in pursuance of a joint add -ess passed on the motion of members by both Houses of Parliament, stating that such manufacture is sufficiently established. Inasmuch as it was not desirable at first to impose import duties upon raw materials used in other industries, it was enacted that during the currency of the bonus that should be the only encouragement given to the iron industry. If , after the expiry of the period mentioned in the Bill, it is proved desirable to the satisfaction, not of this House, but of both Houses, we can, by means of a joint address of both Houses, impose the duties here mentioned. Before that, however, we should require to fully and freely discuss the matter. Honourable members would demand evidence that the industry had been established in the Commonwealth to such an extent that any import duty upon iron products would not unduly hamper any other industry, of wdiich pig iron is the raw material. I look upon this measure as ! designed to give us the first instalment of a bonus system which will apply throughout Australia for fhe encouragement of primary production in all branches. I hope that this is the beginning of a system which will enable us to establish the cotton industry in Queensland. carried on by means pf white labour? earlier days showed that cotton could be grown in Queensland by white labour.

IfI were of opinion that the great pow ers which r we possess as a Commonwealth could not be exercised for the encouragement of manufactures, and for giving assistance 1 to those engaged in primary ind stries, I should see no advantage in the Commonwealth Constitution. The people of Australia were impelled to establish a Commonwealth in order that the Parliament might assist in building up a real nation. That object cannot be achieved by merely passing uniform franchise or postal laws. We are called upon to exercise all those powers that really belong to us-to build up our industries, to establish our citizenship upon the best iron ore""? Beyond all doubt we a sound basis, and to perfect our defences. We can best render effective assistance to the great Empire to which we belong by showing that we are able to stand absolutely alone in time of stress. I regard this matter from the standpoint of national defence. cupy a peculiar position with regard to. the British Empire. A great deal of interest is now being centered round the great Eastern question, and we know that Great Britain is looking to Australia as a base of supply. If by encouraging our Industries, we can show her that we have great supplies of coal and iron for the purposes of manufacturing munitions of war, and that we have skilled artisans engaged in the iron industry, we shall have fulfilled a great Imperial duty. Therefore, it is a matter of national importance that the iron industry should flourish upon this Continent. My support of the measure is not based upon fiscalism, but upon the necessity of our being independent in regard to the supply of munitions of war. Under the arrangement into which we have entered with Great Britain, we have agreed to contribute to the support of a Navy which shall be at the absolute disposal of the Empire. I do not propose to criticise that arrangement, Mr Groom. although I do not agree with it. If we can ' expedite the establishment of a small-arms factory, and also the manufacture of munitions of war, we shall render great service to the Empire. To establish the merits of this particular proposal it seems to me that we require to demonstrate several propositions. In the first place, we must prove beyond doubt that in Australia we have all the materials which are essential to the manufacture of the best steel. The second proposition which we must demonstrate is that we possess a market of sufficient magnitude to justify us in establishing the iron industry. In the third place, we must show that there is some need for holding out an inducement to persons-by means of, the granting of bonuses-to embark upon this enterprise, and that it is impossible to achieve that end by any other means. Lastly, we must be in a position to prove that, by the establishment of the iron industry, we shall confer a great national benefit. I propose to address myself to these four propositions. In. the first place, let me ask, "" Have we in Australia all the natural means essential to the production of have. Incidentally, I shall refer to a few of our iron deposits, so as to place upon record what our resources really are. The fact has been conclusively established that we possess large supplies of limestone, of iron ore, and of coal suitable for coking We ocpurposes. When we come to examine the matter, it will be found that we have an abundant supply of other substances, such as wolfram, which are essential to the manufacture of the best steel. From the evidence given before the Commission which investigated this matter, I learn that in New South Wales alone there is, roughly speaking, no less than 59,317,000 tons of ore available. Of course it is not all to be found in one deposit-it is scattered' about-and is of varying qualities. But the Government Geologist himself is of opinion that there is enough natural ore in New South Wales alone to supply the requirements of the Commonwealth for the next sixty years. Then, if we pass to Tasmania, where at the present time the most practical deposit exists, we know that at the Blythe River, there is a deposit which the Government Geologist of that State estimates at 25,000,000 tons of marketable ore. He adds that that estimate represents only the surface measurement, and that it is quite possible-whe n the resources of the island are opened up-that the experience of the United States will be repeated, and that his calculation will be considerably exceeded . 1 -He considers that that deposit in itself will produce 15,000,000 tons of metal. South Australia, at the Iron Knob, there is a deposit which is estimated at 1,000,000 tons of ore, and at the Iron Monarch, another, which contains 20,000,000 tons. Some of this South Australian ore is already being used by the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company for purposes of its own. of tons. Moreover, the Angaston district contains the finest ore to be found in Australia. self ,to the deposits mentioned by various witnesses who were examined by the Commission. In Western Australia deposits are certainly to be found, but according to t h j evidence, it is open to doubt whether they possess a commercial value. mous quantity of iron ore in that State. plicable to Victoria. Undoubtedly, there are deposits in this State, but the evidence tendered by the various witnesses does not enable us to speak definitely as to the quantity of the ore. land, there is one mountain Mount Leviathan which is estimated to contain 11,500,000 tons of ore, and according to the report of the Government Geologist, it consists of the purest possible ironstone. Unfortunately, its position is somewhat its resources could not be immediately availed of. another deposit of about 2,500,000 tons of ore. to exist all over the northern State. Since the Commission investigated-this matter, the Queensland Government Geologist has caused an inquiry to be conducted into the iron deposits of that State. is still proceeding, and I am in receipt of a telegram from the officer in question, in which he says that these deposits are of a very substantial nature indeed. vious, therefore, that throughout the length and breadth of the Continent there are enormous deposits of iron ore, which only need the quickening touch of capital to be converted into a very useful asset. The evidence taken by the Commission shows that our coal deposits, as far as at present appears, are chiefly to be found in Queensland and New South Wales. South Wales coke has been shown to be of a very high-class character. The evidence of various witnesses revealed the fact that there is practically an unlimitedsupply of In coal in Queensland. At the Styx River there is an area of 150 square miles of coalbearing country, situated twenty-two miles from the coast, which contains good steaming coal, and the coal makes very fine coke. At the Dawson River there is a deposit of semi-anthracite coal, which is situated 120 miles from port. It outcrops for a mile, and the seam is 9ft. 6in. thick. At the Mackenzie River, which is eighty miles from Broadsound, and 140 miles from Rockhampton, there is a deposit of good coking coal. The seam is 20 feet thick, is proved by outcrop to be ten miles in length, and is estimated to contain 200.000,000 tons of coal. An Honorable MEMBER -Whos e estimate is that? land Government Geologist. As the result of recent investigation, it has been discovered that the Dawson River and Mackenzie River coal deposits are very much larger than was previously anticipated. In the Callide field, which is situated fifty-three miles from Gladstone, it is estimated that In Queensthere are considerably more than 50,000,000 tons of coal. It is a non-coking coal, but is, nevertheless, considered a good steam coal. In the Burrum mine, which is some thirteen miles distant from Maryborough, coking coal exists in four seams, aggregating 16 feet thick. This coke is being used inaccessible, and therefore at the Aldershot and Mount Perry furnaces for smelting purposes. A plant has reAt Iron Island there is cently been erected at Howard, which is said in the Mines Department report to be Indeed, large supplies are reported superior to any other in Queensland.

I think I have shown clearly that Australia possesses enormous deposits of coking coal, which are fit for consumption, It is obin any iron works which may be established. Then, again, we possess almost unlimited limestone supplies all over Australia. The other metals of value in the manufacture of steel are manganese, wolfram, and molybdenite.

240,Mr Groom,"It is that of the Queensextraordinary condition of affairs. We are actually sending away from this continent the very metals which we require 'o manufacture the highest class of guns required for defence purposes. Moreover, there exists in Queensland tremendous deposits of wolfram. I would further point out that manganese is to be found in various parts of Australia-for example, in the north and south of Queensland-and so also is molybdenite. From what I have stated, it is apparent that in Australia we possess great natural resources, which are lying idle and merely awaiting development. Seeing that we have these natural resources, is there any market in the Commonwealth which would justify us in establishing the iron industry? Paragraph 8 of the majority report of the Commissionwhich is not dissented from by the minority, and which is based upon the Customs evidence-read s as follows :The following are particulars of the annual a^erage of iron and steel imported into the Commrnwealth during the fwe years ending 3rst December, 1902 :I think it is fair to estimate the value of our imports by the imports of the five years immediately preceding the appointment of the Commission. The paragraph cqntinuesPig iron, 32,046 tons, valued at £120,963. Bar and rod, 59,849 tons, valued at £525,965. Scrap, 8,431 tons, valued at £30,130. Galvanized iron, 45,295 tons, valued at £773,666. Plate and sheet, valued at £151,947. Rails, valued at £401,675. Wire (plain), valued at £3t2>755Wire (barbed), valued at £60,449. Wire netting, valued at £70,610. Pipes, valued at £304,935. The annual average value of iron and steel machinery imported during the same period was £1,764,044. It is clear, therefore, that Australia is importing enormous quantities of material which could be produced locally. We might perhapsomit machinery, which represents £1,764,000, because some of it might be covered by patent rights. It is undeniable, however, that an enormous quantity of imports in the shape of machinery could be manufactured locally. Consequently, it appears to me that I have established the second proposition, namely, that in Australia there is a large consumption of articles which are the products of native ore,' and the manufacture of which would keep large works employed here. Our third consideration should be, "" Is there any reason why we should grant Mr Groom. bonuses in order to encourage the establishment of the iron industry""? I maintain, upon the evidence before us, that there is an absolute necessity for us to do so. To my mind it is clear that we must guarantee those who are prepared to invest their capital in this enterprize against loss during the initial stages of their operations. They; require a guarantee that there will be some return, from the investment, which they are asked to make in the Commonwealth. They need these bonuses, because in the initial stages of every great industry a certain degree of loss occurs, owing to the facts of its being established in a new country, under new conditions, and possibly under new management. Early experiments frequently result in loss. In many industries it is the pioneer who suffers, and others who subsequently take them up are able to profit by his experience. All that is asked is that a bonus shall be given as a certain security to those who are invited to invest in the industry during its initial stages Another reason for the proposal is that a bonus is necessary to attract capital to Australia. The capital which is available for this purpose is usually drawn to old-established centres, where iron works are in operation. In support of this view of the question, I shall read a statement from the evidence given before the Royal Commission by Captain Richards, of Rockhampton. I should like every honourable member, who has the time to spare, to read the evidence given by this gentleman, who is a mining expert, employed at the Mount Morgan mine. He was trained in the first instance at the Ballarat School of Mines, and ultimately went to Queensland, where he has proved himself to be an expert of very high authority. Some time ago he went to the United States of America, and whilst there spent a considerable time in investigating 'the iron industries of that country. He had seen deposits of iron in Australia, and desired to ascertain whether it was not possible to utilize these great sources of wealth for the national good. Captain Richards directed his special attention to this matter, and placed the results of his investigation before the Royal Commission at Brisbane. The following is an extract from the report of his examination:. W ill ypu tell the Commission how you arrive at the conclusion that capitalists will want a bonus when the selling price, according to your figures, is £ 4 13s. ?-On e reason is that in the United States there are more millionaires, and they have vetted interests in pDperty, railways, factories, and so on, and the development of the iron and steel industry adds to the value of these properties. Similar conditions prevail in England and Germany, and, in addition to this, the people of those countries prefer to see their own industries go on; they prefer to put their money in their own country rather than in a country far away. It will thus be seen that Captain Richards indicated that capital is attracted to those places in which confidence is, to a certain extent, inspired by the fact that good results are being achieved. It is therefore necessary, if we wish to induce the investment of capital in this industry in Australia, to give encouragement in the way proposed in .this Bill. The giving of a bonus would appeal to the capitalists in another way. It would lead them to say, "" If the great people of Australia are prepared to give a certain bonus, in order to induce us to establish this industry in the Commonwealth, it is an indication that they have confidence in .their own resources. It shows that they are prepared to guarantee the extent of their resources, knowing very well that these stores of wealth are in existence, and that by the establishment of the industry, the Commonwealth, as a whole, will be materially benefited."" While on this point, I would also refer to the evidence given by Mr Jamieson when before the Commission. At page 33 of the report, the following statement, which was made by him, appears:Do you attach much importance to the bonus? -Of course I do. To some extent it assures any works which may be established and which produce a good article against initial loss. It must b; remembered lhat the establishment of large iron works in a new country is, after all, a very experimental undertaking, and that very often mistakes are made which cannot be foreseen. Mr It has been suggested that we are proposing Darby at first proposed that we should erect furnaces capable of treating 500 tons per day. In this connection it is well to remember that it would never do to depend upon one furnace alone. Two furnaces are absolutely necessary. It would be fearfully expensive to have to allow the only furnace which a mine possessed to run down. These furnaces are very often 80 or 90 feet high, and are brick-lined inside. At any time an accident might happen, and to repair it would cost an immense turn. Very frequently mistakes do occur in the initial stages of the operation of big works. Consequently, it has been the custom all over the world to grant a bonus and impose Customs duties i i connection with the creation of the iron industry. He emphasized the point which I have mentioned, that it is absolutely necessary for the Government to grant a certain bonus as an insurance, so to speak, against loss during the experimental stages in the establishment of the industry. At page 54 of the report of the Commission, honourable members will find the following statement, which was made by Mr Sandford, in answer to a question by the Chairman: Vou have seen the proposals of the Government as embodied in the Bonuses for Manufactures B ill . Do you think that the proposals for granting bonuses on the terms mentioned would assist the establishment of the industry by inducing the investment of capital in these works?-Certainly ; and we should never get capital for the industry without some such encouragement. I can ask members of the Commission whether, if they were in a position to put £100,000 into this industry, they would be prepared to do so without any encouragement? People are the same all over the world, and before they put money into a thing they want to know how their capital will be secured. every industry ? many. The. iron industry is one of great national importance, and one which, irrespective of fiscal theories, we must endeavour to establish in the interest of the Commonwealth as a whole. I have given the Teasons why it is essential that we should grant these bonuses, and they may be readily summarized. They must be given in the first place, because capital needs some return, and will not come here unless we guarantee a return; in the second placet they must be given, because this is an experimental movement, and bonuses are, therefore, very necessary by way of insurance; thirdly, the granting of bonuses is a guarantee to the people across the seas that we have confidence in our own resources; and, fourthly, by granting them we shall conserve our own interests, because they will be given only upon the absolute production of the article within the Commonwealth. to vote an enormous sum of money, and that, if we do so, we shall interfere with the finances of the States. That is a contingency which is not likely to arise. The bonuses will not interfere with the finances of the States for at least twelve months, and they will not be granted in one lump sum. As the experience of Canada has shown, thej' will extend over a certain number of years. Let me give the Housesome figures showing how the system has worked there. In 1884 the bonuses paid by Canada amounted to 44,090 dollars; in 1885, to 38,655 dollars; 1886, 39,270 dollars; 1887, 59,576 dollars; 1888, 33,314 dollars; 1889, 37,234 dollars; 1890, 25,697 dollars; 1891, 20,153 dollars; and in 1892, 30,294 dollars.",33,Manufactures Encouragement Bill Second Reading
241,Mr Johnson,Does not that apply to,35,Manufactures Encouragement Bill Second Reading
242,Mr Groom,"It may apply to a greatamounted to 670,340 dollars. The system will expire aftei a certain time. elapsed since the bonus was first given by Canada, and still the manufacturers want it. are still justified in accepting the bonus. I 45,248,000 tons; 1901, 45,256,960 tons; believe that, by reason of the great distance and in 1902, 49,072,065 tons. These which separates us from other centres of competition, the experience of Canada will not be repeated in Australia. We have to remember that the Dominion is in close contact with the United States of America, one of the greatest iron-producing countries in the world; that the cost of carriage from the iron centres in the United States to Canada is very slight, and that Canada is not separated by any great distance from the old country. In Australia we certainly enjoy a natural protection in the shape of the distance which separates us from other centres of iron production, and that is one reason why I hope, as many of the witnesses examined by the Commission predicted, that in the long run the industry, minion. The total production of pig iron if established in Australia, will be able to carry on without the bonus system. I strongly urge that it is necessary at the present time made from local ore. In Australia we proto grant bonuses in order to induce the establishment of the industry. Once it has been started, I believe that its own results will be sufficient to enable it to carry on. One rather important feature of the consumption of iron yet remains to be stated. Having regard to the population of the world and the way in which civilization and its influences are beginning to extend, it seems that the consumption of iron in the future will be almost unlimited. There appears every probability that the great eastern namines to the place of manufacture, to astions will -consume very large quantities, and we have therefore to look to the future. We see that the consumption of iron all over the world is expanding. There is an extension of invention. We have, for example, the expansion of the railway system, with a consequent extension of the use of steel, and labour-saving plant and appliances, requiring the manufacture of machinery, are coming into use all over the world. iron age. tainly passed the stone age. I have some figures showing the expansion which has taken place during the last few years in the production of iron, and they should give some indication of the extent to which the consumption of that article is likely to increase. At page 204 of the Statistical Year-Book of Canada, there is a table showing that the world's production of pig iron in 1894, was 28,672,000 tons; in 1895, 32,120,450 tons; 1896, 32,724,414 tons; 1897, 36,631,437 tons; 1898, 39,580,031 tons; 1899, 44,519,682 tons; 1900, figures show that the use of pig iron is steadily growing. In that lies our hope, because, so far as the United States and other iron-producing countries are concerned, the question is how long their deposits of iron ore will last. In Australia, however, we have tremendous deposits, and I believe that in a few years, if we can successfully establish the industry, we shall be able to take up the task of catering for a considerable proportion of the world's consumption of this great and useful product. In Canada and other countries, a continuous system of bonuses has been followed, and that system undoubtedly led to the manufacture of pig iron in the Domade from foreign ores in Canada in 1903,. was 274,740 tons, while 46,450 tons were pose to give encouragement only in respect of the manufacture of pig iron from Australian native ore. I have shown already that we have enormous deposits of ore, and we ask . for no bonus on the manufacture of pig iron from foreign ore. What we want to do is to assist the miners in the various States by opening up and developing our large deposits of ore, to assist our shipping companies by giving them the business of carrying ore from the sist our coal miners by increasing the demand for coal by using it for the manufacture of iron, and to assist all who. are engaged in producing the accessory minerals which are required for smelting. I believe that by providing local supplies of pig iron, we shall also largely assist manufacturers of various kinds. Manufacturers who use iron do not wish for fhe imposition of a duty upon their raw material until it has been clearly demonstrated that we can supply the market with locally manufactured iron, because, otherwise, the price of their raw material would be increased. It would, however, be of great advantage to them to be able to obtain supplies locally, because that would",35,Manufactures Encouragement Bill Second Reading

248,Mr Groom,"Quite so. We have ceravoid the necessity for .keeping in stock large quantities of pig iron, and thus of havreturn upon the capital invested, and I ing so much dead capital. Furthermore, they would be sure of their supplies if they could fall back upon the local furnaces for all that they needed. From all these points of view, the establishment of the iron industry here should be of great advantage to our people. In Australia we ought to have a great manufacturing population, and the study of industrial occupations shows that the greatest amount of inventive genius and artisan skill is brought to play in the manufacture of iron and steel. I think that we are not wanting in natural resources of that kind. Our young people have proved themselves capable of undertaking the duties imposed upon them by various kinds of industry, and if the iron industry were established here, I am satisfied that they would soon show their skill in connection with it too. young fellows whose talents have a bent in that direction are prevented from properly employing them. It is, however, a waste of material, and almost a crime to the country, when men who have great inventive genius are compelled to perform comparatively servile duties. If industries are not established in the Commonwealth, our young people cannot engage in them. Once they are established, however, they will bring into play the njatural talent which honourable members, whatever their fiscal beliefs, will admit exists among young Australians. When the possibilities of the iron industry in Australia are considered, the arguments iff favour of granting a bonus for the production of iron becomes still stronger. We must look to a great expansion of our telephone and telegraph systems, and the need for wire and iron that that will bring about; to irrigation, and the need for iron pipes for conveying the lifegiving power to our arid soils; to the need for more railways to open up otherwise unavailable lanJ, and the rails and other material which will be required to make them. The States Governments will for manv years to come use large quantities of iron,"" and this could be produced from the native ores of Australia. If some guarantee could be obtained from the Governments of the States that they would use only locally produced iron, it would be of great assistance in starting the industry ; but we know that Governments change, and political opinions alter, and therefore I think it would be better not to rely solely upon such assistance. What is needed is security for a think that that can best be given by a bonus. Then the agricultural development of the country will require the use of immense quantities of iron for the manufacture of harvesting and other machinery, while in every other direction there will be an unlimited demand for it. Therefore we who support the measure ask that an exceedingly moderate bonus shall be offered to give an inducement for the starting of the iron industry. Our national life is only just beginning; but ' let us show that we have confidence in the Commonwealth which we are here to govern. Let us tell those who are now being trained in our technical colleges and schools that there will be openings for the employment of their talent. Let us give At the present time, similar encouragement to the young fellows in our mining schools. I think that the establishment of the industry, and the natural expansion of trade which will follow, will induce, the investment of further capital. But, above all, it is essential, in the interests of the defence of Australia, that the industry should be established. So eager am I for its establishment that I am willing to bow to the opinion of the House as to whether it should be carried on by the Commonwealth, by the States, or by private individuals. I should like to see the Bill carried as it stands, leaving it open to any one of those parties to establish the industry, and to secure the bonus. I am prepared to grant the bonus to any State which is ready to pass the requisite legislation, and to undertake the -work, and I am also ready to consider the question of leaving it open to the States for a period of two years to accept the Commonwealth offer. But, at the end of that time, if none of the States have come forward, private enterprise should be given an opportunity, so that there may be some finality. I do not think that there is any likelihood of the Commonwealth being able to undertake the work. The Attorney-General of the Barton Ministry, the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, gave the following opinion on the subject-it will be found in appendix E to the Commission's report:In my opinion no such power is included in the express g if t of legislative power to the Federal Parliament. The trade and commerce power, vast though it is, does not appear to extend to production aud manufacture-whic h are not commerce. Commerce only begins where production and manufacture end. US., 1, 20. . Moreover, the fact that the trade and commerce power is limited to external and Inter-State trade and commerce indicates that the power which the States undoubtedly possess to undertake Government industries within their own limits is not shared by the Commonwealth under this sub-section. Under sub-section I . , II . , and III . , taken to that they should be utilized, if it is practicgether (trade and commerce, taxation, and bounties), the authority of the Commonwealth over industrial development is of the largest; but, though it allows of control, regulation, and guidance, it in no respect points to direct establishment or management of any industries. Nor can I find in any other part of the Constitution any express authority for the course suggested. implied powers of legislation remain to be determined, but include (under sub-section xxxix., of section 51), matters "" incidental"" to the exercise of the express powers. If , for instance, we thought it necessary to establish a small arms factory as an auxiliary to our defence power, or to build a railway for the purposes of defence, we have the power to manufacture the iron or steel required for those purposes. But there is great force in the opinion which I have read, that we have not the power to enter upon the general business of producing' iron and steelmore on this subject. embodied in the report of the Commission, to which my name is appended. I hope that the proposal will be discussed on its merits, and that even honourable members who feel strongly on the question of free-trade will, in this instance, allow the national welfare to take first place. does the honourable and learned member make such insinuations ? any improper insinuation. Adam Smith, who was opposed to restrictions on liberty, nevertheless favoured the English navigation laws, because he considered them necessary in the national interests. In the same way, I think that free-traders would consider the national interests of Australia by voting for the proposed bounty. Smith as an authority.' orable member does not recognise any one's authority, except his own. ance must be considered. that. I ask if it is not advisable that we should establish the iron industry here for the defence of Australia, and.to give a basis of supply for the old country; because the greatest service that we can render See Kidd v. Pearson, 128 to the Empire is to build up our industries so strongly that if we are ever isolated, we shall be able to stand alone. deny that there are practically unlimited deposits of iron ore throughout Australia, and able to utilize them. But there are differences of opinion as to the best methods to adopt to bring about their utilization. Like every other project that has for its object the diversion of the proceeds of taxation' from its legitimate 'purpose, that of The ministering to public needs, into the pockets of certain persons for purposes of private gain, this is based mainly upon the plea rhat it will afford a large amount of employment. We do not hear anything as to the large extent to which the dividends of the lucky shareholders will be swollen. I have no objection to the establishment of the iron industry on a legitimate basis, but I recognise that we are now being asked to put our hands into the public purse, and to apply moneys contributed by the taxpayers, not to some public purI do not desire to say anything pose, but in such a manner as to swell the My views are dividends of investors in a private enterprise. I have a strong objection to that kind of thing. I am averse to the proceeds of taxation being diverted from legitimate public purposes at any time. It may, perhaps, be advisable in some cases to offer bonuses with a view to promoting national interests, but I do not regard this proposal as coming within the category of such cases. I believe that the honourable member for Eden-Monaro is actuated by the worthiest motives -1 believe that he has not any personal ends to serve, but is prompted by a spirit of patriotism. But in my opinion his point of view is a mistaken one. He stated that the bonus was intended merely to give the industry a start, and that when it was fairly placed upon its legs, the Australian iron would, no doubt, be sold at a cheaper rate than the imported article. He said further that the bonus was required to protect the Australian wage-earners. Just so. Against what are the wages of the Australian worker to be protected. Against competition. What competition? Continental competition chiefly. What need is there for us to protect our workmen against continental competition when we know that the wages paid to continental workmen are much lower than those prevailing in Australia?

How could these two objects be simultaneously achieved by such a means? How could it raise the wages of the workmen, and at the same time cheapen the local product ? A great measure of protection is already afforded to the iron industry naturally by the cost of conveying iron from Europe and America to Australia. . That should be sufficient. I am satisfied from independent inquiries I have made that the iron industry could be profitably engaged in without any protective duty, or bonus, or other artificial aid. Why should the public be called upon to contribute to an enterprise in which they are not to be partners? denied that the whole of the profits derived from the industry will be absorbed by those who invest their capital in it. If they are going to take all the profits, let them also accept all the risk of loss. If we are to bolster up the iron industry by means of a bonus, which, according to several experts, will be ineffective unless folorable gentleman agree that protective duties ' lowed by the imposition qf protective duties, why should we not give the.same support to every other, industry ? Where are we to draw the line? It has been pleaded that this is a national industry, but I would point out that all industries are more or less national .in character, because they all represent some elements of wealth production, afford employment to the people, and yield a return upon the capital invested in them. Thereby they contribute not only to the profit of the individual, but to that of the nation at large. Therefore, if we aie to grant a bonus to the iron industry, why should we not extend the same consideration to others. Our wool growers, coal-miners, and stock-breeders, and others, would have quite as' strong a claim upon us. It has already been indicated that this proposal is to be only the beginning of a system of , granting bonuses. The honourable and learned member for Darling Downs made that sufficiently clear, and expressed a hope that we would recognise the propriety of offering a bonus for. the encouragement of the cotton growing industry in Queensland. If this kind of thing is to go on, the time may come when it will be regarded as perfectly legitimate to devote, the greater portion of the money raised by taxation to the purpose of increasing the gains of private individuals. I know that both protectionists and free-traders may conscientiously support the granting of certain kinds of bonuses. There are, however, bonuses and bonuses, and some of them are distinctly protective in their incidence. I.grant that bonuses possess one advantage over protective duties, inasmuch as we can ascertain the exact extent to which the public are asked to contribute under them. Under a system of protective duties we can never tell how much the public are required to pay. It has been, admitted that the bonus itself will not be sufficient to establish the iron industry. At the end of the bonus period, it is proposed to levy protective duties, ranging from 12 to .20 1 per cent. So that those who believe in the doctrine of free-trade are being asked to commit themselves to the payment of It has never been bonuses, with the full knowledge that such bonuses are to be followed by protective 1 duties. agree with that view? the honourable member has said. must be imposed after the bonus period has expired ? from the statements of honourable members and from the evidence given before the Bonus Commission, that protective duties are expected to be imposed after the bonus period expires. I believe that the whole proposal is unnecessary, and that the iron industry could stand by itself without artificial aid of any kind. I say, further, that if investors do not find sufficient inducement to carry on the industry upon ordinary commercial lines, we should not permit the Commonwealth Treasury to be used to bolster it up. I have never heard of. any protective system, or of any system of bonuses that has resulted in permanently raising the wages paid to the workmen in any industry. The honourable member for Southern Melbourne told us that the proposed bonuses and protective duties were intended, primarily to bring about an increase in the wages of the men employed in the industries affected, and he claimed, further, that the establishment of the iron industry would solve the unemployed problem. This is the same old story that has been told from time immemorial, and proved since the beginning to be an utter delusion and a snare.

I would ask honourable members, who has ever heard of any industry started under such conditions reaching a stage at which it could afford to dispense with State assistance ? No such case has come within .my knowledge. Therefore, I am justified in supposing that we shall be called upon to grant more and more assistance as time goes on. We cannot take up a newspaper in Victoria to-day without seeing some reference to the languishing industries of that State. These industries are said to be languishing after upwards of thirty years of ""coddling"" by the imposition of artificial restrictions upon trade. Wherever such restrictions are imposed the same thing occurs. sist any State, it will assist New South Wales. system in Victoria was established for the avowed ing industries a ""start."" dically, during more than thirty years of its operation, pleas have been advanced for increasing the duties upon the ground that industries were tottering. The more State assistance was extended tb them, the more they tottered. As a result, we have seen the flower of the manhood of Victoria leaving this State for other lands for a period extending over a number of years. That is the strongest possible condemnation of this proposal. this character had been operative, those persons might have remained here. legislation not only was powerless to prevent it, but was directly responsible for a large proportion of the exodus. T t was in Victoria that we first heard of the appointment of Wages Boards and Sweating Commissions. We have merely to look to any protectionist country in the world to find paragraph b of section 20, from which I disthat the unsatisfactory conditions which sursent."" The paragraph in question reads round the worker in lands where a low Tariff prevails, are accentuated in countries where a high Tariff is operative. The last census returns of the United States contain a declaration that in New York city alone there are tens of thousands of unemployed and destitute persons. Moreover, out of every twenty persons employed in American factories, seventeen are foreigners. The artificial method of raising wages by dipping into the public Treasury for the purpose of enriching certain manufacturers, has had, the effect of driving American workmen out of the most highly protected industries in that country, and of putting foreigners in their places. It is in the free-trade industries that the greatest number of Americans are employed. those ? natural primary industries. In this connection, it must be remembere3 that there is absolute free-trade between the whole of the States of the Union. I wish now to refer to the report of the Royal Commission, which recently investigated this matter. We have heard a good deal from the honourable arid learned member for Darling Downs concerning certain paragraphs, inwhat he chooses to term protective the ""majority"" report of the Royal Com. mission.

Yet, perioThe Commission consisted of twelve members, six of whom reported in favour of the bonus and an equal numbei against it. The only way in which it can be' claimed that a majority were in favour of the proposed bonus is by counting the casting vote of the Chairman, in addition to his deliberative vote. The report of the six members who are opposed to the granting of the proposed bonus is unanimous, whereas that of those who favour it is not absolutely unanimous. bonus wished the industry to be controlled by the State. the report.

268,Sir William Lyne,"That provision is now with the Commission's report. I repeat that the six members of the Commission who reported against the payment of a bonus were absolutely unanimous. Consequently, if it can be urged that there was a majority either way, it seems to me that those who were opposed to the granting of a' bonus constituted that majority. I now propose to read one or two extracts from their report-extract s which speak for themselves) .and which occasion surprise in my mind that this matter should have been again brought forward at the present time. members of the Commission who object to the granting of the proposed.bonus statesThe Bill provides for the payment of £324,000 of the people's money to private individuals engaged in an enterprise for their private gain. There is no ambiguity about that statement. It continues. There can be no guarantee that the bonus, as proposed, would permanently establish the industry, though it is probable the inducements offered might be instrumental in forming speculative companies. Paragraph 4 readsOne of the witnesses, Mr Sandford, managing director of the Eskbank Iron Works, New South Wales, stated that he had made an agreement with an English syndicate to spend £250,000 in extending the Lithgow works if the Bil l passed. In answer to another question, Mr Mr Sandford said he could produce pig iron at Sandford said that to make pig iron he wanted a plant involving an expenditure of from £100,000 to £125,000. This estimate is less than half the sum proposed to be paid in bonuses. I should like honourable members to ponder over that statement, and to realise its full significance. It is a case of greasing the fat pig all the time. It is not a question of providing work for the unemployed. That cry is raised merely for the purpose of playing upon the sympathies of honourable members. The unemployed are being used as a shield to cover the real design of those who are in a position to make large dividends by investing in an enterprise of this character without any State aid whatever. The honourable and learned member for Darling Downs has spoken, in eulogistic terms of the experience of Canada. I have looked tip. that experience, and I find that it is far from encouraging. Instead, it is of a character that should make us very chary about attempting to follow the example of that country. The report of the Commission also refers to the experience of Canada. Paragraph 5 statesThe Canadian experience is not encouraging. The bonus system for iron production was first instituted there in 1883. Subsequently a B ill was passed in 1897 further continuing the system. The bonus there was granted for the purpose of starting the iron industry, and yet we find that after it had been in operation for fourteen years, it had to be extended for a further term. The paragraph continuesAnother Bill was carried in 1899, providing for the diminution of the bounties Dy a sliding scale expiring in 1907. In July of this .year the Dominion Government decided to postpone the operation of this sliding scale for one year, which practically means a further increase in the bounties paid. So this process continues. Where, I ask, Paragraph 3 of the report of the will this system of propping up industries end? The practice of diverting 'public money into the pockets of private individuals is absolutely wrong. Paragraph 6 statesNearly ail the witnesses examined before the Commission agreed that the payment of bonuses would be useless unless followed by a duty. Ex-' perience shows that if the payment of bonuses be commenced the liability of the Commonwealth will not be limited to the sum proposed under the B ill , but that further Government aid will be sought. That confirms my statement as to the want of finality in regard to proposals of this character. Paragraph 7 saysThe evidence failed to show that there was any commercial necessity for the bonuses proposed. Lithgow under 35s. a ton. Allowing for freight to Sydney, Melbourne, and other ports of the Commonwealth, he could, on this showing, compete favourably with any imported pig iron. Other witnesses, who, however, had less experience than Mr Sandford, doubted the correctness of his estimate of cost. But, on the supposition of his having made an under estimate, he would still, even without a bonus, be in an excellent position as compared with the imported commodity. Those statements are based upon the evidence tendered before the Commission. Paragraph 8 readsNo effort was made to bring forward witnesses against the B ill . Notwithstanding that fact, the evidence given failed to establish a case in its favour. Several witnesses thought the establishment of iron works in the Commonwealth premature, and much of the evidence was strongly against any attempt by the Government to establish the iron industry by the payment of bonuses. In the light of this report, which is fairly strongly worded, and speaks for itself, I fail to see how honourable members can with their eyes wide open conscientiously give their adherence to a principle of this character. There is another point to which I should like to call attention, as it is one of verygrave importance. I refer to the principle involved in a private member bringing forward a measure of this kind.",40,Manufactures Encouragement Bill Second Reading
269,Mr Johnson,"But I am dealingthe Government. the fault of the present Government, for the practice was not initiated by them. But whatever Government may be responsible, the fact remains that the principle is unwise, and should not be persevered in. In expressing this opinion, I desire it to be disCommonwealth is being asked under this tinctly understood that I do not wish in the slightest degree to reflect on the integrity of the honourable member, who is in charge of this measure. There is not even the faintest suggestion of suspicion attaching to the action of any honoiable member in connection with this Bill, and we may discuss it free from any suggestion of the kind. It must be patent, however, to any one who gives even a few moments' consideration to the question, that, sooner or later, serious consequences may Tesult from a system which permits measures involving large expenditure of public money tofoeintroduced by a private member of the House, under the aegis of the Government of the day. Rightly or wrongly the adoption of such a practice may give rise to the suspicion in the public mind that there is something more than mere patriotism in the background. It is undesirable that any action on the part of the Parliament should give rise to such a feeling. I am happy to say that, so far as this Bill is concerned, no such suspicion exists. mention it because of the feeling that if the practice be adopted it may in future cases give rise to such a suspicion. I would point out the desirableness of avoiding such a possibility. I know, of course, that the present Government occupied a peculiar position in regard to this Bill, and were bound, as a matter of personal honour, to adopt the course which they have pursued. honour to do wrong? they have done anything intrinsically wrong in this case; but 1 hope that their action in allowing a private member to take up this measure will not be regarded as a precedent. I would repeat that there is no suggestion of suspicion attaching to the action of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro in bringing forward this Bill. My sole reason for urging that such a practice should not be followed is the belief that we should avoid giving rise to even the suggestion of is the fault of suspicion in the public mind. Every honourable member has the fullest confidence in the integrity ot the honourable membei in charge of the B ill ; but it occurred to me at the outset that this was a matter that certainly deserved very serious consideration. The final point which I wish to emphasize is that we have to recognise that whilst the Bill to pay a large sum of money into the pockets of a private syndicate, that syndicate will reap all the profits of the transaction, without being exposed to any of the risks which men who embark in other undertakings have to incur. If the profits will be as large as have been represented in some quarters, then those who desire to enter upon the industry should consider it quite good enough to take the risk. They should be able to make their calculations as to the probable profits, on the same basis as do other men who ordinarily embark upon other industries for their own private gain. If we are to assist the iron industry in the way proposed, why should we not also assist a widow who desires to start a laundry, or a man who wishes to open a shop, or is about to undertake any other business ? If the principle be right in this case, it must be capable of application in every direction. We cannot draw any hard-and-fast line. The principle involved is either good or bad, and I assert that with certain limitations, it is bad. There may be certain special cases in which it might be desirable to grant a bonus, but this case, in my opinion, is not one of them. The Bill deals after all with what is a purely commercial speculation, and should be treated as such. Let those who desire to engage in the industry secure the benefit of any profit they may be able to derive, and take the risk of any loss that may attach to it. We have no right to dip our hands into the public Treasury, and to say to any syndicate, "" We give you this sum, which is not ours to give, for your own personal good, and desire nothing in return. We hand it to you, simply as a. guarantee against possible loss in the first instance, and if you do not incur any loss, it will go to swell your already assured profits."" That is a principle to whicli I have a strong and deep-rooted objection, and in view of the facts which I have put before the House, I have only to say that, whilst I give the honourable member in charge of the Bill every credit for",41,Manufactures Encouragement Bill Second Reading

275,Mr Johnson,"I do not say thatpurity of motive, I hold that the principle of the Bill is a most pernicious one, and must therefore oppose it . to say at the outset that, although, when it was announced some days ago that the honourable member for Eden-Monaro would take charge of the B ill, I , in common with a number of others, felt somewhat annoyed . that the honourable member for Hume should not have been allowed to remain in charge of it, I realize that the question involved is so important that it will not permit of our being swayed by any personal considerations. I should have' preferred to see the honourable member for Hume continue in charge of the measure; but any little feeling which I had at first has been removed. There is one point on which I agree with the honourable member for Lang, who has just resumed his seat, and that is that it is unwise to hand over such a measure to a private member of the House. Government acted in this respect in the same way as have the present Administration. I understand that the leader of the Opposition, when Prime Minister, was prepared to grant the 'honourable member for Hume the same facilities to expedite the passage of the Bill as have been accorded the honourable member for Eden-Monaro. That, however, does not do away with the question of whether it is right or wrong to allow a private member to take charge of such a B ill , and I certainly think that by means of our Standing Orders, or in some other way, we should take action' to prevent the repetition of such an occurrence. A system which allows a private member to deal with a Bill of this character may not only expose honourable members to a suspicion of corrupt motives, but place a Government having only a small majority at its back in a very peculiar position. A Government with a large majority is practically able to do what it pleases in regard to any matter of this kind, and, although in this case I am not referring to either the present or to any previous Administration, I hold that any Government which happens to possess but a small majority might find itself forced to do something in this direction which it othetwise might desire to avoid. If it were made impossible for a private member to take charge of a Bill of this character, Governments would be safeguarded. Some honourable members believe that those who oppose this Bill have no sympathy with the number of men who are out of employment. 9P honourable member say "" hear, hear."" There is not one honourable member in this House, whether he be free-trader or protectionist, a Socialist or an anti-Socialist, who desires to see even one member of the community unemployed. Although our views as to the methods to be adopted to secure employment for the people may differ, we ali are anxious to see every one fully employed. I am opposed to the Bill as it stands; but shall vote for the second reading in the hope that in Committee it will be so amended as to meet with my approval. The question of whether I shall vote for the third reading, if it be not so amended, is another matter. AlthoughI am opposed to the granting of bonuses for the development of the iron industry by private enterprise, I am strongly in favour of it being taken up by one of the States. The late If none of the States will take it up, then I am prepared to allow our efforts in this direction to remain in abeyance until one of themis ready to do so. One of my ' reasons for objecting to private enterprise being, subsidized is that I recognise from the report placed before us by the Commission that the bonuses would not be sufficient in themselves to place the industry on a permanent basis. Something more than a bonus will he required if the industry cannot stand on its own merits.. Mr Jamieson, when before the Commission,, expressed the opinion that it would be absolutely necessary to impose Customs duties^, after the expiration of the bonuses. Mr Sandford somewhat questioned that statement, but Mr Jamieson urged that it would be absolutelv necessary to have a-, protective Tariff in force, so far as the: manufactures dealt with in the Bill are concerned, after the payment of bonuses had ceased. If Mr Sandford be right, it is very peculiar that a rich company is not prepared to risk £ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 in such a venture. If it be possible to carry on the great iron industry of fhe Commonwealth of which we have heard so much-and we are told that we have an abundance of ore in sight to enable operations to be carried on for the next sixty years-suc h an undertaking ought to be a very good thing from the point of view of a mining speculation. One would think that a company would be prepared to lose even £ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 in order to secure the profit that it would ultimately derive from its operations. A large number of companies have tost over £250,00 0 in various",42,Manufactures Encouragement Bill Second Reading
276,Mr Thomas (Barrier),I should like,43,Manufactures Encouragement Bill Second Reading

278,Mr Thomas,"I am sorry to hear theventures. £500,000, and I have known of cases in which they have lost as much as £1,000,000 before making a single penny out of their undertaking. They have felt satisfied from the first that they would ultimately be able to recoup themselves, and therefore have not hesitated to incur these losses. That being so, if those interested in the iron industry really think that duties would be unnecessary-that bonuses would sufficeit is singular that they are not ready to invest the £250,000 necessary to enable them to establish works. I think it may be necessary to impose Customs duties to assist the industry. That is the difliculty. AlthoughI believe that in Australia pig iron could be produced at a price at which it could compete in the local market with pig iron produced in other parts of the world, I think it is probable that if the iron industry were established here, pig iron would be sent from other places for less than it cost to produce, so that foreign manufacturers might destroy our worlcs, and continue to have a monopoly of our market. 15s. a ton for freight. mills abroad whose proprietors might think it good business to send pig iron here at a loss, in order to keep the Australian market to themselves. But we have been told that the people of Australia believe in the possibility of establishing the iron industry here, and that local manufacturers who use pig iron say that it would be of great advantage to them to obtain supplies locally. If that be so, the danger of foreign competition could be met by the local manufacturers who use iron combining as a big syndicate for the development of our iron ore deposits. If they did that, they would see that it was not to .their interests to use imported pig iron, even though for a few weeks, or a month or two, they might be able to get it for less than cost price. I am afraid that if a duty is imposed upon imported pig iron, we shall injure our manufacturers who use it by increasing the cost of their raw material, and it is the opinion of both free-traders and protectionists that the price of raw material should not be increased. The right honourable member for Adelaide, whose loyalty to protection is undoubted, when speaking on the first Bonus Bill, saidIn the first place, I would ask, "" Ought we to impose a duty at once?"" I supply the answer myself by saying that the policy of the Government Some have lost as much as is not iu that direction. They think rather that the immediate imposition of a duty would have the effect of greatly increasing prices and hampering industry. In his speech, he quoted Sir Leonard Tilley, a Canadian, who saidI f the duty on pig iron were materially increased, it being a raw material that forms the basis of a great many manufactures, the residt would be that the increase in price would require a change in the duties on the articles manufactured from pig or baT iron. I have another quotation from the speech of the right honourable member for Adelaide, which I do not think it necessary to read, because I take it that free-traders and protectionists are agreed that if a duty is placed upon an article which is not manufactured locally, its effect is to increase the price of that article. Pig iron is the raw material of many manufacturers, and it would certainly be unwise for us to impose a duty which would increase its price. The granting of a bonus is not the same thing as the imposition of a duty, and if I had to imake a choice, I would prefer a bonus to a duty, because, in the first place, when we grant a bonus, we know what it costs us, and, in the second place, I think that it is not fair that those who are producing or using iron should bear the whole cost of establishing an industry for .the benefit of the community at large. But there are disadvantages connected with the granting of bonuses. When the first Bill was under discussion, the honourable and learned member for Bendigo saidWe have had experience, more or less favorable, of bounties and bonuses in Victoria. good thing. Sir JOH N QUICK -No doubt. At that time the Butter Bonus Commission had not begun to take evidence. If the revelations of that evidence had been known then, neither speaker would have referred favourably to the butter bonus. Yesterday the honourable member! for Eden-Monaro read portions of the report of the Commission which inquired into the proposal we are now discussing, but he read only those portions which suited his, arguments. I should like, therefore, to read paragraph 18 of the report, which is as follows:Your Commissioners believe that the proposed bonus on spelter would substantially encourage the utilization of quantities of zinciferous ores at BrokenH ill . It is estimated that there are now raised on the surface and available for treatment about 3,500,000 tons of this material.",43,Manufactures Encouragement Bill Second Reading

I take it, however, that he is in favour of the measure as it stands. be improved. bonus £50,000 instead of ""£20,000, I suppose? When the matter was discussed in this House on 12th February, 1902, in connection with the Tariff, I said, speaking of the mining companiesAll the protection I ask for is that they shall not be handicapped, but may be free to utilize machinery to the best advantage. As a representative of a mining community, I say that it is an unfair thing to ask the Commonwealth Parliament to put its hands in the pockets of the taxpayers to bolster up the mining or any other industry. The Minister says that the Government is prepared to grant £20,000 in bonuses for the development of the zinc industry. If that is their idea, we might just as well keep the £20,000 in the pockets of the people, or spend it more profitably. We have upon the dump heaps in BrokenH ill 1,000,000 tons containing 25 per cent, of zinc, tons of the ore, from which they obtained which to-day is practically useless. At the present price of zinc, say £16 per ton, that material is equivalent to £4,000,000 worth of zinc. Mining men know it is there, and if a company will not work it without a bonus of £20,000 they will not work it at all. If they could work it at a profit, plus the £20,000 bonus, I venture to say that they would work it without the £20,000. When dealing with £4,000,000 worth of stuff, £20,000 is a mere drop in the bucket. Let us have our mining machinery, our electrical appliances, and every advantage that science can discover for us, free of duty, and that would be of more advantage to the zinc industry than a bonus of £20,000. I stand by those words now. Since then the subject has been inquired into by a Royal Commission, and its majority report was signed by the right honourable member for Adelaide, the honourable and learned 9p2 members for Darling Downs and Corinella, the honourable members for Melbourne Ports and Newcastle, and the late Sir Edward Braddon. It is only fair that I should mention that when the Commission took the evidence p f Mr Courtney, a man of whom I have a very high opinion, only the right honourable member for Adelaide, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, and Mr Winter Cooke were present. Mr Courtney is the general manager of the Sulphide Corporation, or, as we call it in Broken Hill, the Central mine, and receives a high salary, in recognition of his great abilities. At any rate, he probably knows what he is talking about. He was asked whether the proposed bonus first 10,000 tons of spelter from Australian ore would be of any considerable assistance in establishing the industry, and his reply was "" undoubtedly."" Then he was asked to give some information as to the quantity of zinciferous ores at Broken Hill. He stated that his own company had 680,000 tons-of ore upon the dump heaps, and that, altogether at Broken Hill, there was 3,500,000 tons of zinc ores at surface. Honourable members will understand that this 3,500,000 does not represent zinc spelter, but only the blende, which contains from 17 to 20 per cent, of zinc, and the problem upon which the Sulphide Corporation have been engaged has been the conversion of this 20 per cent, of zinc into a marketable commodity. I have made certain calculations based upon the presumption that from 10 tons of the material contained in the dump heaps 1 ton of zinc could be produced. That would represent a total of'350,000 tons of zinc. ney that his company have treated 2,099 360 tons of spelter. That result would be considerably above what I have estimated. I am allowing for a waste of fully 50 pei cent., because the dump heaps are supposed to contain about 20 per cent, of zinc, and I am allowing 10 tons instead of 5 to every ton of zinc. Further on in his evidence, Mr Courtney states that, whilst his company had made certain trials and experiments, bad laid down a plant which cost £26,000, and had spent money in other directions, they had not, up to twelve months ago, made a commercial success of their undertaking, because of thefluctuationsin the price of zinc.

288,I See From The Evidence Given By Mr Court,"per ton for their product they would be upon safe ground. Mr Courtney estimates that the average price of zinc is about £.17 15s. per ton. At page 156, question .3294, Mr Courtney saysThe result oT the bonus, of course, will be that during the struggle of creating the industry we should be protected against low prices. Further, if this bonus is continued for sufficient time, it will enable the industry to be so established that we shall be able to do without it. The struggle is in the beginning, and I think it will take four or five years to create the industry. After that time if the industry does not pay the works must be closed down. If nothing can be done in five years, the industry must collapse. Would that be so, with the Australian market open to you in the absence of Inter-State duties? -The 2,500 tons a year are a mere drop in the ocean. It is nothing at all when we think of the enormous deposits of zinc ores in Australia. BrokenH ill alone could produce that quantity per week. Then he was asked by the ChairmanWould a bonus of the description I have indicated lead to further expenditure on the works?It would certainly do that if the industry in the beginning is protected to the extent of £ 2 per ton. That is to say, if the selling price was £ r , that would be equal to £ 19 per tori at the works, and the result would be a decided encouragement to start the other three furnaces, which would require another £4,000 or £5,000, bringing the expenditure up to £31,000. He was asked furtherYou think £4,000 or £5,000 would enable you to start the other furnaces?-Yes, and that would bring the expenditure up to £31,000, and practically enable the works to supply the market in Australia. W ill the industry be established simply for the local market?-In our case, having established our works, we should first secure the local market. Is it worthwhile establishing the works for the local market only?-Hardly; considering that there is such an enormous quantity of available ore at the mine. The Chairman then askedYou say that the present stock at the Central Mine is 680,000 tons?-Yes. What is the percentage of zinc?-About 20 per cent., which means an immerse quantity. With this industry established you could hold the local market?-Yes. In what other market do you think you could gsin a footing?-I'robabl y in China, and then we should have to go to Europe. At question 3339 he was askedAnd afterwards, how could you hold your own in the European market ?-Once we are established we shall be able to work into the European market. The difficulty is to establish the business. It is very costly, and I do not think that anybody except ourselves will take it up. It is our experience that other people are holding back, considering that after our heavy expenditure and trouble we are making so little headway. We are, however, emerging from our chrysalis stage. Mr Thomas. You think that with the bonus, you will be able to establish the business, and gain a footing in China and Europe?I believe so, because we shall be protected against low prices. If , after four or five years of that protection, we are not in a position to compete in Europe, there is nothing in the industry, and it will have to collapse. But you are pretty sanguine?I am very sanguine that the industry can be established on the terms suggested. He says he is very sanguine that the industry could be established if a bonus of £ 2 per ton were granted for the production of the first 10,000 tons of zinc. Then Mr Winter Cooke asked himThe consumption in Australia is not enough to justify your asking for protection?-No; you must establish the industry so as to compete in Europe, 01 otherwise there is really nothing in the business. You want the bonus to give you a start?-Yes, and to provisionally protect us against market fluctuations. You could live in the face of these drops?Because we should have the works established on a large scale, and everybody trained to the business. The next question was asked by Mr GroomThe local consumption is so small that, as between a bonus and a duty, you would prefer a bonus ?-Unquestionably . The Chairman then saidAccording to the Tariff, there is power when the business is sufficiently established to impose a duty; but I understand that you do not establish much importance to that? Mr Courtney replied, ""No."" He was then askedYou look forward to competition in Europe?Undoubtedly; otherwise I do not think there is anything in the industry, especially with the enormous available supply of ore in Australia. The evidence shows that 3,500,000 tons of zinc blende on the' dump heaps at Broken Hill is estimated to yield 350,000 tons of zinc. The average price of zinc, according to Mr Courtney, is £ 1 7 15s. per ton, and therefore there is already at the surface £5,950,000 worth of zinc. half the zinc is extracted from the blende. 50 per cent, waste in treatment. Mr Courtney says that the company with which he is associated has spent £31,000 in dealing with these zinc ores, and that, if he can get £20,000 from the Government to help him to send 10,000 tons of zinc to Europe and China he is very sanguine that he can solve the present difficulty, and establish the industry.

When honourable members are prepared to attach their names to a report upon evidence of that character, I ask whether any dependence can be placed upon their conclusions ? I am aware that it is rather unusual in politics for an honourable member to oppose any expenditure in his own constituency. The£ 2 0 , 0 0 0 which it is proposed to expend by way of a bonus upon the production of spelter, will, if the Bill passes, be chiefly spent in my own electorate.

The best evidence of this is to be found in the fact that the Proprietary Company, which laid down a' plant for treating the zinc, is now extending that plant. . I have already stated the reasons why I object to the payment of a bonus to private enterprise. I fear that if we establish the iron industry in Australia by that means it will become a monopoly, and under guch circumstances free-traders and If that evidence protectionists alike will admit that the purchaser of iron will be absolutely at the mercy of the monopolists. Although it is just possible, should the Bill pass in its present form, that two companies may establish iron works in our midst, namely, the Blythe River Company and the ford, I feel certain that competition between them would not be of a permanent character. If they found that each was possessed of an equal amount of capital and that equal intelligence was brought to bear in the conduct of their businesses, they would amalgamate within a very short period, and would be perfectly justified in so doing.

If the Bill be calculated to do so much good for those who engage in the industiy, it must be of benefit to those who own the land, and the money necessary to pay these bonuses should come directly from them. I am not in favour of private enterprise being bolstered up by means of revenue derived from Customs duties which is wrung from the poor, rather than from the rich. The honourable member for Macquarie, when this Bill was before the House on a previous occasion, very pertinently pointed out that in order to provide for the payment of £250,00 0 by way of bonuses, it would be necessary for us to raise J £ I , 000,000 through the Customs, because, under the Constitution, it is necessary for us to raise four times the amount actually required.

He is prepared for the present to take up the cudgels on behalf of a direct tax, under the pretence that it does not bear on those on whom it does not directly f a l l .

I do not, however, propose to be led away by the interjections of honourable members. While on this point, I wish to make only one further reference to the speech of the honourable member for Barrier. The honourable member stated frankly that he preferred a State monopoly to the possibility of a private monopoly ensuing on these bonuses being granted; and in that respect I think he was far more outspoken than the other members of his party. I hold that the protectionists of the Labour Party are protectionists apart altogether from the principles which weigh most with ordinary protectionists. protectionists because of an idea at the bottom of their minds that when they have narrowed down the field of competition and made monopolies possible, they will proceed to nationalize the monopolies which their own actions have brought into existence. I think that they desire protection for these industries only as a stepping stone to that State Socialism of which they have, no doubt, the laudable ambitionand I do not draw this inference in any bitter spirit towards my honourable friendsto be the administrators. The honourable member for Barrier, in discussing the evidence given before the Royal ""Commission, made one especially interesting point, which is well worthy of comment. He said that the general manager of the Sulphide Corporation, in examination, said that if after the lapse of some four or five years this industry were not able to go ahead without a bonus, that would be proof positive that it was not worth troubling about. How often have we heard the same story ? It was told when the system of protectionist duties was first initiated in Victoria thirty or forty years ago; and those who quote the remarks of that gentleman will, be the first to cry out that the bonuses should be continued, in the It is clear to them that event of the industry^threatening to close down at the conclusion of the period during which they are to be supported under this Bill. engaged in the industry had spent so much money in establishing it that the Government must give them further assistance. send good money after bad. I do not propose to answer a fiscal revivalist, because Andi f wealth is to be that is too lengthy a task for any one to undertake. But the honourable and learned member for Darling Downs told us this afternoon among other things of the enormous quantities of ore, and of all the essentials for the manufacture he hopes to encourage, that exist at the present time all over Australia, and especially in the Eastern States and South Australia. to guarantee interest on capital. upon the bonuses provided for in the B i ll as merely a first instalment. I think that we are now getting at the truth. The general manager of the Sulphide Works says that those engaged in the industry would only require the bonuses for about four They are years, while our other authority tells us that he regards these bonuses as only an instalment. It is very curious that another argument advanced by the honourable and learned member was",48,Chapman I Am Waiting Of £2 Per Ton For The Production Of The

It is not my intention to discuss the maze of figures which delight honourable members opposite-the maze of figures which was introduced, not, I take it, to throw any light on this question, but to mesmerize the House and lead it away from the very obvious facts which confront us. This Bill was brought forward yesterday with considerable ability-in fact, with that ability for which we always look from the honourable member for Eden Monaro. As free-traders, we consider that his views are mistaken; but, at all events, they are extremely consistent. But whenever he moves in the direction of supporting his own fiscal beliefs, we always know that he is actuated by the most disinterested motives, that he has taken action simply because he has the matter at heart, and quite apart from political considerations. The honourable member has called all his ability into play to clothe the real issue in a maze of figures. However, his maih argument was, "" Why should we pay the foreigner for this article when we can make it for ourselves' ' ? Could Ithe honourable member reasonably apply that doctrine to himself ? We all know that a country lives on a small scale, much as does the honourable member himself. member ought to be a good judge of anything on a small scale. tells us that his main objection to the free trade policy is that under it we send money out of Australia for the purpose of obtaining necessaries from other people, although we should be able to provide them for ourselves.

That is, they can afford to give away to outside people what they are taxing their own people to produce. If that is an argument in favour of an iron bonus, I can only say it is an extremely weak one; and if Germany indulges in so wild a scheme, I sincerely hope that this Commonwealth"" will never embark upon such folly. I may recount my objections to this Bill. To grant a bonus is a more open way to help an industry than to impose a duty. Nevertheless, I do not think that any industry that requires a bonus .to assist it is an industry that we can term natural to the country. It is not an industry that is profitable, if it means taxing the people in order that it may be carried on. If an industry is established by such .means, it is also probable that in years to come we, shall be asked for yet more money to save the money wasted in establishing a bonus-fed concern. It means that we shall be diverting employment from occupations in which men now find a livelihood, not only for their own benefit, but for the benefit of the whole people, into occupations which can only remain in existence by means of a large and probably increasing tax on the general community. For these reasons I shall oppose the second reading of the Bill. I do not intend to change my vote with regard to this Bill for the mere reason that the measure has been taken-as I think ungenerously-ou t of the hands of an honourable member by a political rival. There is a great deal of force in the view which has been put by the honourable member for^Barrier and others, that the iron industry is sure to be a monopoly. I perfectly agree that if there is any industry that is sure to be a monopoly in Australia it is this. Having regard to the local demand-and it is only the local demand that we can look to-and to the amount of capital necessary to start an industry of this sort, the industry must become a monopoly, either immediately or very soon. It must become a monopoly by combination of capital or by combination of companies. My objections to the Bill on that ground are largely modified by the inclusion of sub-clause 2 of clause 8, which gives the Government of a State the power to take over the industry on paying to the owners of it the value of the land, plant, and materials This provision was suggested by me on the ist August, 1902. On that occasion I saidI should like, therefore, to make a suggestionthat we should insert a clause in the Bill to the effect that, if bonuses be granted to any private company or firm, there shall be an option for the State to take over the industry at a valuation to be fixed upon giving a certain notice. The right honourable member for Adelaide, who then had charge of the Bill, said that the Government would have no objection to insert a clause of that sort. Another reason why I support the measure is that this is a most novel industry to be started in this country, and would be worked under novel conditions. It would be a huge enterprise in respect to the capital embarked. There is a tremendous combination to fight. There can be no doubt that the industry, when it is started, will have to face and fight one of the strongest combinations in the world, because, after all, the Australian market in steel rails and iron is of some value to thos° gentlemen who control the iron industry in America. If , therefore, there are private persons who are willing to take the risk, we should be only too glad to let them' do so. We should let them try the experiment, and let fhe State profit by it. I do not wish to let the State in for an indefinite, unknown, unlimited liability. I much prefer that we should put down a certain sum of moneysay, £125,000 or £200,000. We should know the limit of our waste-of our expenditure. If , however, we were to start the industry by means of the State, we should be led on from expenditure to expenditure. No one would know how much expenditure would be involved in the risk. Private enterprise has been the best pioneer. It has made roads in the bush', and schools in the back country, and has even provided for the administration of justice in the first instance. But I hope that in the course of time, when the States Parliaments are more liberalized, we shall have an opportunity to take over the industry, and work it under national control. It has been said that the railways have been worked well by the States, and that therefore there is no danger in the States taking up the iron industry; but, strongly as I feel about the inexpediency of leaving these huge industries to the play of private greed, I say that it would be most unwise for the States to embark in enterprises without the certainty of success. Railways have been, and are being, successfully worked by the States, but all Aus-",51,Chapman I Am Waiting Of £2 Per Ton For The Production Of The

Sir JOHN FORREST accuracy of that statement last night. The Commonwealth has no land of its own, nor can it encourage settlement by legislation in regard to railways, mines, or waterworks. The one great thing which it can do to assist Australian industries and to promote the material advancement of our people, is to vote bonuses for the establishment of profitable industries such as the iron industry; and I hope that the proposal now under consideration is only the first of many similar proposals. I have no wish to unduly coddle our industries for all time, but we ought to try to establish new industries, in order to open up fresh avenues of employment, and to create new sources of wealth. If Ave can do that by the payment of moderate bounties Ave shall do an exceedingly useful AA'ork. the money ? We cannot get it out of the air. Sir JOHN FORREST I shall not ansAver the honourable and learned member's questions. I do not understand why he interrupts me in this way. are short and of rare occurrence are not objected to, but interjections Avhich are frequently made, and are of such length as to interrupt a speaker, cannot be allowed. upon to decide whether Ave shall exercise the powers granted to us under the Constitution, or whether Ave shall altogether disregard our great obligations, and stand before the country as merely an additional legislating machine, for the purpose of passing laws of general application which are not intended to exert a direct, influence upon our producing interests. The honourable member for Barrier said he Avould favour the granting of bonuses if the iron industry were placed under State control, but that othenvise he Avould rather see the mineral wealth of the country lie dormant. I altogether disagree Avith that attitude. Apparently if the honourable member cannot secuie the establishment of the industry in the particular way he desires, he . would rather not haA'e it at all. If Ave Avere guided by the same principle in right honourable the affairs of daily life Ave should meet with general condemnation. If we cannot secure the object we have in A'ieAv in the way that seems to us best, Ave should be content to attain it by other means. The honourable member I denied the for Northern Melbourne stated that the iron industry must be a monopoly, but I do not knoAv that that necessarily folloAvs. There is nothing in the Bill to indicate that only one company shall take advantage of its provisions. In fact,. I hope .that the iron industry will be carried on in several of the States Avhich possess enormous deposits of iron. Before Ave agree to this Bill, Ave are called upon to satisfy ourselves upon several points. The first of these is whether there is abundance of iron ore in Australia. I think it is generally admitted that this question can fairly be ansAvered in the affirmative. The second question is, "" Is the industry a desirable one to en7 courage ?"" It is undoubtedly very desirable that the parent industry of iron manufacture should be carried on in our midst. In the third place, Ave have to ask ourselves Avhether, in the event of the industry being assisted in the manner proposed, it can be maintained in working order as a commercial undertaking Avithout further help from the State. I am not in a position, personally, to answer that question. The matter is one upon AvhichI must take the opinion of others, Those who are competent to judge affirm that the industry can be established upon a firm basis, and they are Avilling to support their opinion by a large expenditure of their own money. All . these questions have been investigated, and have been satisfactorily answered by the Barton and Deakin Governments, and by the Iron Bonus Commission. The total amount proposed to be offered in the shape of bonuses is £324,000. Of this amount, £250,00 0 is to be offered for the production of pig iron, puddle bar iron, and steel, produced from Australian ores. £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 is to be offered for the production of spelter from Australian ore, £ 5 0 , 0 0 0 for the production of galvanized iron, wire netting, and iron or steel tubes or pipes, and £ 4 , 0 0 0 for the manufacture of reapers and binders, at the rate of £8 each for the first 500. £ 3 2 4 , 0 0 0 may seem, at first sight, to be a large sum, but it represents a sum of only",53,Chapman I Am Waiting Of £2 Per Ton For The Production Of The

349,Sir John Forrest,"We are calledabout £16,000 per annum at 5 per cent allowing 1 per cent, for a sinking fund-for fifty years, at the end of which time the whole amount would be paid off. The question for us to consider is whether >t would pay the Commonwealth to devote that amount of money to the establishment of the iron industry. 1 I think it would. would be a very poor industry indeed if it did not prove to be worth that much to the people of Australia. I look upon this proposal from a purely business standpoint. we shall provide employment for our people. The honourable member for Werriwa stated that only 400 persons would find employment, but it is absurd to suppose that that number of hands could perform all the work connected with such a large industry. Operations would have to be conducted upon a comprehensive scale, and the number of persons who would be directly and indirectly employed in winning the ore and in reducing it down to a marketable commodity, would be very large indeed. Then, again, if we manufactured iron from our native ores, we should become a much more self-contained community than at present. Instead of having to import all our pig iron and other iron, and all that we require in manufactures of metal, we should in time be able to supply our own requirements in that regard, and we might also in time become exporters. I have taken the trouble to refer to the speech that was delivered by the right honourable member for Adelaide on the 27th of May, 1902. I have accepted his statements as accurate, because I have not the slightest doubt that, as Minister in charge of the Bill, he would take the greatest care to assure himself that the facts were accurately placed before him. in 1901, 155,259 tons of raw material principally in the form of pig iron, valued at £1,117,430, were imported into the Commonwealth. We should make a very good start if we could produce that quantity of iron to meet our own requirements. During the same year our imports of manufactures of metals were valued at £6,800,000. Of course, for many years, we should not be able to manufacture anything like all the goods of that kind required by us, but there are undoubtedly immense possibilities before us in connection with the development of our iron resources. We must remember also that, before the bonus of £250,000 can be claimed, those who engaged in the manufacture of iron, and who desired to claim the bonus, must spend about £500,000 upon buildings and plant. The right honourable member for Adelaide stated that it was estimated by some persons that £1,000,000 would have to be spent, and by others, that £750,000 would have to be embarked in the enterprise. But he wished toIt be on the safe side, and adopted an estimate of £5 °>°° 0 o by law to expend that amount ? If we establish the iron industry that they could not produce iron without spending that amount of money in buildings and plant. bank, says that £125,000 would be sufficient. information from the speech of the right honourable member for Adelaide. The company, or companies, who entered upon the manufacture of iron would have to produce finished and marketable iron, valued at £1,300,000, or steel valued at £2,000,000, before they could claim the £250,000 bonus. Therefore, it appears to me, that they will have to give the strongest proof of their bona fides before they can claim one penny of the bonus. No better security could be offered to the State. No one who did not intend to embark in the industry with a view to establishing it upon a firm basis would be induced to make such a large outlay. I have no doubt that it would be possible to arrange with the States Governments for the purchase from the local manufacturers of a very large proportion of their requirements in the way of manufactured iron, at prices, not more, and perhaps less He stated that, than ""those which they are now paying. I believe that the States Governments would, for instance, be willing to enter into an engagement to purchase so many thousands tons of steel rails, within a certain time after the iron works were in full swing. That would be a good thing for the contractors, and also for the States. However, that is a matter upon which an agreement could be made under regulations. I am quite certain that a great deal could be accomplished in that direction. I confess that I am surprised at some of the arguments which have been advanced to-night, because they all seem to be based upon what I regard as a fiscal fetish. From the views expressed by some honourable members, one would imagine that fiscalism was",54,Chapman I Am Waiting Of £2 Per Ton For The Production Of The

I am surprised to learn that some honourable members believe there is no room for a difference of opinion upon the fiscal question. It seems to me that if they cannot obtain a thing which in itself is goodI refer to the establishment of the iron industry-in the particular way that they desire, they will not have it at all. For many years we have been longing for the establishment of that industry, and it is not yet started. As reasonable individuals, have we not pursued a waiting policy long enough? If that policy has been productive of no result, is it not time that we devised some other plan to gain our ends? We are all agreed as to what we require, and' we differ only as to the method of attaining it. In regard to the iron industry, we occupy the same position now as we did when this country was only occupied by the aborigines and by kangaroos and dingoes. a uniform Tariff, and possess the power to grant bounties, we should not continue inactive simply because of the fiscal views which we may entertain? there are advocates both of free-trade and protection; but to my knowledge no honourable member who is a free-trader has ever suggested that the locally produced article should bear an excise duty equal to the Customs duty levied upon the imported article, which is the basis of the free-trade doctrine. of .that course in regard to matches. the honourable and learned member to again advocateit, because the ordinary free-trader in this House and throughout the country scouts the idea. If the proposal to grant a bonus were a new idea in Australia, there might be some reason for taking exception to it. But I Rave been accustomed to the bonus system ever since I had anything to do with politics. In Western Australia we have a small population, and a large territory to develop. Consequently, we gave bonuses in all directions, with a view I suppose that of promoting and assisting the industries of the country. I cannot recollect how many were given to promote copper and lead mining. Then again, others were granted to encourage coal-mining and prospecting for gold. Bonuses were also paid for the erection of tin smelters, and land was given to encourage the construction of railways. All sorts of inducements were offered to persons to develop the timber industry, and cash bonuses were granted to encourage deep sinking in mines, and boring for gold and other minerals. Similarly we gave subsidies to steam services all along the coast-subsidie s which are still being paid. Government has no power to grant such subsidies now. It is unconstitutional to do so. subsidies are granted ostensibly for the carriage of mails; but the Government pays a large sum to'provide means of communication between the coastal settlements and the capital. Then again, bonuses were offered for the discovery of gold and other minerals, and for assisting immigration. When we pay the passages of persons from the old country, and give them free grants of land to induce them to settle in our midst, is that not a bonus ? Yet that practice has been followed in Australia for many years. Of course, where there is no necessity to enSurely now that we enjoy courage capital to develop the natural resources of the country, it is quite right that no bonus should be paid. But, if we reverse the position, we must use the In this House power of the State. I have frequently heard the Prime Minister declare that the power of the State must be used to the utmost to develop the resources of the country. My only fear is that the bonus proposed is not sufficiently large when we consider the magnitude of the work to be undertaken. When we consider that the persons who establish the iron industry will require to invest, perhaps, £1,000,000 in the enterprise before they can gain this bonus, it cannot be urged that it represents a very large sum. I claim that if we can secure the permanent establishment of the iron industry by an expenditure of £250,000, that outlay will be amplv justified.

But I cannot support a proposal 'to take £324,00 0 out of the pockets of the taxpayers, and place it in the pockets of a few speculators. If this Bill were passed, no State in the Commonwealth would in my opinion, reap so much benefit as the StateI have the honour to represent. Mr Jamieson., who gave very lengthy evidence before the Royal Commission, distinctly stated that it is the intention of the promoters of this scheme to obtain their iron ore from the Blythe River deposits. I candidly sav at once, that none of the statements which have been made to-night by the advocates of the Bill have in the slightest degree over-estimated the enormous extent of those deposits. There are practically huge cliffs which have been proved to be first class iron ore, and I believe, if its treatment were undertaken as a business without a bonus, it would yield an exceedingly handsome profit. But what is the position ? If there is one thing that has to be said for the gentlemen who gave evidence before the Royal Commission, it is that they were absolutely outspoken and honest. So far as I can see, they attempted to hide nothing, but threw their cards directly on the table, so that every member of the Commission, every Member of Parliament, and every man and woman in the Commonwealth who desired, might see whaf-„was proposed. According to the evidence reported, ore can be produced at Blythe River, transferred to Lithgow, and there converted into iron at a cost of 35s. per ton. MrM c WILLIAMS reported on page 55 of the report of the Roval Commission to have saidAfter supplying modern blast furnaces, thorA duty of 12 J per cent, is imposed on agrioughly well equipped, and every necessary applicultural machinery, such as ploughs, which ance, from material already secured in the shape of the iron ore, coal, and limestone, pig iron could be produced at Lithgow for under 35s. per ton. Mr Jamieson, who gave his evidence immediately before Mr Sandford, distinctlystated that it is the intention to use ore from the Blythe River deposits. ference to a different scheme. MrM c WILLIAMS stated by Mr Jamieson that it is the intention to use the Blythe River ore-whic h he regards as the best-in the works we are now asked to subsidize. has nothing to do with the other company. speaking of works up the Parramatta River. and Mr Jamieson gave evidence on exactly the same point. sent rival interests. MrM c WILLIAMS A little further on in the evidence the honourable member for Bland, who questioned Mr Sandford very closely, and obtained a great deal of valuable information, elicited the fact that over and above the cost of the article imported there was shown a profit of 12 s. 6d. to 15s. per ton. But another fact, which to my mind is much more important, can be found in the evidence. Both the witnesses I have mentioned declared that, in addition to the' -bonus, a duty of 10 per cent, on English iron and 20 per cent, on foreign iron would be necessary to enable them to carry on the works. rency of the bonus, or afterwards? MrM c WILLIAMS A f t e r the bonus has ceased. Unless we are prepared to impose a protective duty we should not jpass this B ill . Is it not worse than a farce to ask us to sanction the payment of £ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 or £ 3 2 4 , 0 0 0 as a bonus, and immediately after the bonus is expended to allow the industry to die? If we pass this B ill it must be on the distinct understanding that we shall impose a protective duty; and Mr Jamieson's. opinion is that it would be advisable to make that Mr Sandford is duty 20 per cent, all round.

But the question faces us, who is to pay the bonus? more than reached her 75 per cent, limit-that is to say that State is receiving less than 75 per cent of the Customs revenue. -In Tasmania, speaking from memory, we have got down to within £16,000 of our percentage. is as low as that I thought that' it was £16,000-bu t it makes my case all the stronger. If Tasmania is to pay its share of this bonus, where is it to. obtain the revenue? We are practically asked to go to the people of Queensland and Tasmania, and say to them, "" Impose direct taxation in your State in order to establish this industry."" I am not prepared to do that. I think that this question of a bonus should be looked at from a very serious stand-point. If a bonus be granted to this industry, a bonus cannot be refused to the cotton industry. Andi f a bonus be granted to the cotton industry a bonus cannot be refused to the ship-building industry. When such proposals are made we are brought immediately face to face with the financial position of the smaller States. get the money from? expenditure has been cut down in every possible way. The salaries of civil servants have been reduced; the salaries of the police have been reduced, and the salaries of railway men are very much lower than many of us desire to see them. Very heavy direct taxation is being imposed upon the people, in order that the State may be able to meet the claims which are made upon its resources by Federation. If we are to pass bonus Bill's to establish industries throughout the different States, the StateI represent will not be able to bear the additional taxation required. Believing, as I do, that the smaller States are not prepared to find the necessary revenue; believing as I do that the iron industry would be a remunerative one if it were started by the capitalists who are behind this agitation [19 OCTOBER, 1904.] Encouragement Bill. 5785 able member think it would require to start The honthe industry? without a bonus for very much less than the figures which are given in this report. Believing, as I do, that if we were to place a protective duty on raw material, such as iron, which is in daily consumption in many Queensland has of our factories, we should have to enormously increase the duties on the products of those factories, or wipe them out of existence, making the second condition infinitely worse than the first-it will be my duty to vote against the second reading of this Bill. If we are to pay this bonus, and if this industry is to be a national one, I should prefer it to be taken up by one of the States, rather than by a few speculators. since I have been a member of the House, I have stood against giving privileges to any section of the community. I am against giving privileges to capitalists in this, just as in the case of other Bills we have had before us. I have been against giving privileges to men who labour. I refuse to enable any persons to put their hands into the pockets of the people, and make their circumstances worse for their own especial benefit. It has been said here, of course, that the iron industry would be of very great benefit to the Commonwealth. Nobody denies that it would. If an industry, such as this, could be established naturally, and without being artificially propped, it would be a good thing for the Commonwealth. There are a large number of industries which, if established, would advantage the Commonwealth, but we do not propose to offer any assistance in those directions. In the past we have had a section of the community whose one idea has been to establish industries by some artificial means, their plea being that they would find employment for the people. A trial has been made in Victoria, and if there has been one failure greater than another in this State it has been the attempt to find employment for men by artificially building up industries. Nobody can recall what has been done here without realizing that fact. We cannot read the reasons which are being put forward for the failure of some of the industries which have been propped so long without realizing the absolute failure of any artificial 'means to establish an industry.

391,Mr Lonsdale (New England),"Eve rindustry will naturally establish itself. But if those natural advantages do not exist, and there is no demand for the product of the industry no attempt of ours will succeed in establishing it by artificial means. It has been alleged here that all the world has given bonuses for the establishment of industries, but that statement is not correct. America did not establish her industries by means of bonuses. It is said, of course, that she established them by other artificial means; but that statement is not correct. England did not give bonuses for the establishment of her industries. Germany and France established their industries by means of export duties. The only country which has given a direct bonus for the establishment of iron industries has been Canada. We are told that the successful establishment of its iron works was due to the bonus. If honourable members who quote that instance as a success have looked into the matter I do not know what they would call a failure. For twenty odd years bonuses have been given in Canada, and only within the last few years did the industry develop to any extent. has been some degree of development. In 1901, 150,339 tons of iron were produced, namely, 50,581 tons from' foreign ores, and 99,758 tons from Canadian ores. In 1902, 341,654 tons of iron were produced, namely, 268,553 tons from foreign ores, and 73,101 tons from Canadian ores. In 1903, 321,191 tons of ore'were produced, namely, 274,741 tons from foreign ores, and only 46,450 tons from Canadian ores. The mill which produced the greater quantity of that iron was that of the Dominion Iron and Steel Company. Last year it produced 205,000 tons, but from foreign ores. We have been told that that .mill was established 1 by means of a bonus. Its construction was started in the autumn of 1899-that is, in the very year when the Canadian Government had decided to reduce the bonuses year by year, commencing in 1902, until they ceased to exist in 1907. It should be perfectly clear to honourable members that it was not the bonus which induced the capitalists to put their money into the industry. The reason why they started was not because of the bonus, but because of the natural opportunities which they possessed. They started their works at Port Sydney, in the midst of large deposits of iron ore. Not only where the mill was erected, but across the channel, on Bell Island, they had deposits of iron ore of the Mr Lonsdale. highest quality. On the coast of Newfoundland and Labrador they also had large quantities, of which they could avail themselves. They started their mill where they had not only deposits of ore, but also large deposits of coal of the highest coking qualities, and limestone could be brought from the water-side by water car; riage to the mill. They started the industry at Port Sydney, which is 1,300 miles nearer to Liverpool, 1,000 miles nearer to (he Mediterranean, and 700 miles nearer to Cape Town than Pittsburg, the great iron manufacturing centre of America, and even 200 miles nearer to Cape Town than Liverpool itself. Having all these natural advantages and natural opportunities for the production of iron, the capitalists started their mill with the markets of the whole world before them. That was one of the great reasons which induced them to erect their mill at that point. In the autumn of 1899, as I said, they determined to erect the mill, and commence operations. One of the efficient causes in bringing about its construction was the formation of, the great American During the last four years there Steel and Iron Trust in March, 1901. The Canadians established their mill at Port Sydney for the purpose of becoming a competitor with that great trust. So far from the bonus being one of the efficient causes, in my opinion it was not, because, before the industry was started, the Government had resolved that the bonuses should decrease year by year until they ceased in 1907. Of course, like a large number of gentlemen who have influence upon legislators, the shareholders of the Dominion Iron and Steel Company had some influence on the Dominion Parliament, and, in 1903, they succeeded in getting an alteration of the bonus arrangement made. They got an additional bonus of $6 per ton for rolled wire nail-rods, of $3 per ton for rolled shapes, and of $3 per ton for rolled plates, and they got an extension of the time for the payment of the bonuses by one year. That is all the advantage they got in that direction, and it seems to me that instead of a bonus having had any beneficial, it had just the reverse effect. It is said-""If we establish these industries by means of a bonus, what a magnificent thing it will be for the Commonwealth. We shall be able to build our own navy. It will be unnecessary for us to continue our contributions to the British Navy, because this will enable us to build a-navy of our own at reduced cost. We shall be while the value of imports of the able to manufacture our own armour plates lower classes of manufactures such as the result of granting bonuses for the as pig iron, railway rails, and iron establishment of mills for the production of and steel goods of lower qualities, has pig iron and steel, and shall receive other increased to the extent of 20,000,000 dolbenefits in the same direction.

There are a large number of people who desire to see the works established. They are protectionists and Socialists. The honourable member for Melbourne suggested the issuing of paper money for such a purpose. Let those who wish to have the industry established put their sovereigns into the venture, redeeming the notes which are issued out of the profits from the concern. If the right honourable member for .Swan, and the honourable member for Eden-Monaro are anxious to establish the industry. let them apply their own money to establishing it, issuing the notes for the capital, taking them up themselves, and then redeeming them out of the profits, and as the honourable member for Melbourne said, they will then have the whole concern for nothing. That is the best advice I can give them. In other respects, the measure from beginning to end will receive no assistance from me. I shall seek to prevent this extra burden being placed upon the people. Customs and Excise, which are returnable to the States, are being reduced year by year, and I object to placing any further burdens upon the people for the sake of a set of capitalists who do not seem to be prepared to stake their own money on the venture. will' stake no money upon it if I can prevent it. much to say upon this question, because I recognise that it is useless to deal with it under present circumstances. seems to be no sincerity in the desire that the Bill should become effective as a law. I cannot realize for the life of me how a measure of this kind, involving the expenditure of such a largesum of money, can be properly intrusted to a private member who is not, and cannot be, responsible for the money which will be required. In view of the state of the finances, as indicated by the Treasurer yesterday, I should like to know before we proceed further with the measure, whether the Prime Minister is prepared to give the House some guarantee that if it becomes law, the money that is required will be provided. If not, the Bill is of no use to any one, and to proceed with it is a farce. Have we a re-, sponsible Government in power? Is this an irresponsibleParliament? able member say that to the last Government ? the Government that is responsible for the conduct of the business of the House. If that Government is sincere in its advocacy of this measure, I want to know what guarantee we have that if passed it will have any practical effect. The Treasurer yesterday indicated to us that over and above the 75 per cent, of our revenue that is returnable to the State Treasurers, the whole of the money is appropriated with the exception of £600,000; and he also indicated that after paying to the States the sum of £450,000, on account of buildings acquired by the Commonwealth, there is only about £150,000 left to play with. If , out of that £150,000 we are to pay -O 20,000 a vear to carry out the objects of this measure, are we goine to raise additional Customs revenue? In the event of a shortage, are we to make no provision for raising extra money? It must be rememThe amounts derived from bered that under the Braddon section of the Constitution, whatever extra taxation may be raised through the Customs, we have to return three-fourths of it to the States. If , therefore, large sums are to be paid for the development of the iron industry, it is clear that we shall have to raise an enormous extra amount through the Customs. The Prime Minister ought to tell us what his own attitude is. Of course we are aware that, in allowing the honourable member for Eden-Monaro to take charge of the Bill, the Prime Minister is merely playing to the party with which he has coalesced, and endeavouring to placate them.

429,Mr Webster,"-We have had no sucbManufactures come. The protectionists of Australia are not likely to be deluded by the adoption of any such tactics into the belief that the Government are sincere in their desire to establish the iron industry in Australia. They realize that the industry cannot be established without money, and they know perfectly well that the honourable member in charge of the Bill can give no guarantee that the necessary funds for this purpose will be forthcoming. What a farce we are playing by passing an enactment to which effect cannot be given. I maintain that the Government has been guilty of absolute cowardice, in handing over to a private member a measure involving the expenditure of some hundreds of thousands of pounds. I can well understand that Mr Sandford, who is very anxious to get his little business at Lithgow floated into a big company, in order that the company may nurse the baby, is very much interested in the fate of this Bill. I sympathize with men who have sunk their capital in industries, and wh® by the force of circumstances, have to face unprofitable results. But honourable members should recollect that we are hot here to pave a way for them out of their financial difficulties. I know the position of the iron industry, and I can readily imagine what will happen if this Bill be passed. I unhesitatingly affirm that there will be a fight to determine whether Mr Sandford shall establish this monopoly at Lithgow, where he tells us that he is prepared to sink £250,000 in the erection of an efficient plant for the production of iron. I repeat that a measure of such importance ought not to be handed over to the charge of a private member. It is too great a temptation to place in his hands. Are we to believe that at this important juncture those who are so vitally interested in the establishment of the iron industry will stand idly by, and not exchange a word with the gentleman who is in charge of the Bill. Are they not likely to resort to that engineering which has been practised in connection with other measures involving the expenditure of large sums of public money ? It is too much to expect us to believe that men who are so vitally interested in the Bill from a financial standpoint, will not appreciate the action of the honourable member to whose control a kind Government has committed it. to the honourable member for Hume, who introduced the measure? tics on the part of the late Government. I [REPRESENTATIVES.] Encouragement BUI. claim that if the practice which has been followed, is persisted in, it will bring humiliation upon this Parliament. If time permitted me to deal with the history of the American Congress, I could clearly demonstrate that the lobbying and the Tammany work, which has characterized its proceedings, will be repeated here if the plan which has been adopted upon the present occasion is pursued in the future. We have at the present time a Government who have not the courage of their opinions-wh o are not prepared to take responsibility, but seek to placate the protectionist members of their party by allowing a measure of this kind to be introduced when they know it cannot be carried into effect excepting by those who have charge of the Treasury. Is there anything in the anxiety of those old colleagues, who have worked in double harness in the advocacy of protection, to take charge of this Bill? They have been running side by side, dragging the protectionist chariot, each in turn supporting protectionist proposals in the State Parliament. Have we not a right to ask at this stage-the first time there has been a proposal to devote a large amount of money to a purpose of this kind -the first time a measure of such magnitude has been submitted to this Parliament -wh y there is this anxiety on the part of those two honourable members to take charge of this measure? for some time to the honourable member, and it appears he is proceeding along a line which no honourable member should take. If his speech, or some portion of it, means anything, it suggests at least a suspicion of corruption, and I cannot allow such a suspicion to be hinted at. No honourable member should cast any such slur on the House to which he belongs, or make any such insinuation. ber's remarks have certainly insinuated corruption. struction as you. sir, have placed on my remarks.

Therecan be no sincere desire to attain the object proposed, because, as I have said, the legislation can be carried into effect only if tlie Government undertake to provide the money. In assuming that position, I feel that I am on solid ground. I fully expect that we shall have revealed I to us in time to come someserious effects of this class of legislation, if we have many attempts on the part of the Government to hand over such large and important measures to private and irresponsible members. I desire to enter my protest at this stage, so that this may be the last time we shall see a Government run the risk of being regarded as unwilling to assume their proper responsibility. The Minister of Defence is present, and I ask him to confirm the words of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, that if this Bill be passed, the Government are prepared to find the necessary money. I am willing to take the word of the. Minister of Defence, or that of the Treasurer on the point. I pause for a reply. The silence settles the question, so far as the sincerity of the Government is concerned. TJie Minister of Trade and Customs, in his speech, quoted the coupletO, what a tangled web we weave, When first we practise to deceive. Those two lines have been running in my mind while I have been observing the action of the Government in their'endeavours to de ceive honourable members in connection with legislation of this kind. The Minister in charge of the business to-night cannot give us any guarantee that they are not acting a farce in putting this Bill before the House. Without that guarantee the public may say with every justification, that the Federal Parliament is merely wasting time, and that the waste is not attributable to private members, but to the Government who are for the conduct of business in this House. our usual hour for adjourning, I would AlthoughI may have been suggest to the Minister of Defence that it would not be fair to expect honourable, members to continue the debate.
