Motion posedThat this Bill be now read a second time. * Sir WILLIAM LYNE (Hume) [2.37]. I think that we should have an explanation from the Treasurer as to certain items in the Bill upon which information is required. Although honourable members appear to think that only .£100,000 is being asked for as an advance for the Treasurer, I would point out that he is really asking for £ 1 2 0 , 0 0 0 , because he is asking for £'20,000 to recoup the revenue. The sum of £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 has been spent in connection with various votes, and we are asked to repay this amount. Hitherto the rule has been to give the Treasurer a yearly advance of .£200,000. I do not know that that sum has ever been exceeded. We are now being asked to vote, not the proportion of that'sum which the period of two months' bears to a whole year, but more than half the whole amount. We are entitled to some explanation of this request for ^120,000. We should be told what the £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 has been expended upon, and where the .money was taken from. a schedule 'to the B ill , and I would remind the honourable member that it has been customary to discuss the items in Committee and not at the second-reading stage. Sir WILLIAM LYNE A m I not at liberty to discuss them now? has -been not to no into, details, more particularly as to items appearing in the schesecond reading. I have not prevented the honourable member from discussing the matter to which he refers. I have sim'plv told him what the custom is as to the discussion of details. to point out, Mr Speaker, that I was dealing not with items in the general schedule to the B ill , but with those appearing in the abstract, which ' shows that we. are asked to grant a total sum of ,£883,699. If . we shall be permitted in Committee to cover the whole range of the B ill , I shall be satisfied, but I am inclined to think that when we go into Committee we shall not be permitted to do more than discuss the particular item immediately before the Chair. It was for that reason that I rose to direct attention to the abnormal sum for which the Treasurer is JOHN FORREST, asking in respect of his Advance Account. detailed consideration in Committee, so that my answer to the honourable member is that undoubtedly thc whole matter may be debated in Committee, and debated there more freely than at any other stage. [2.42] -It seems to me that the. proposed vote of £ 1 2 0 , 0 0 0 in respect of the Treasurer's Advance is an enormous sum to entrust to a Minister, without having from him a statement as to the way in which it is to be applied.. It is a blind bandicoot method of finance. In other words, it suggests what used to prevail in New York, when everything was conducted on the "" blind dog "" system: While we have the greatest confidence in the Treasurer, it seems to me that as this House controls the public purse it should have from him a statement as to how this amount is to be expended before it is granted.",14,Personal Explanation

9,Mr King O ' Malley (Darwin),"the honourable member for Hume that this is not the stage for a detailed discussion on the schedule to the B ill . Its detailed consideration can take place more properly in Committee. Yesterday afternoon I questioned the Treasurer as to the intention of the Government with regard to the date of the first payment of old-age pensions under the Federal system, and I do not think I shall be out of order in inquiring at this stage whether they intend to depart from the position they have taken up that the first payment cannot be made until the 29th July. AfterI spoke yesterday afternoon it was pointed out by a number of honourable members that even a. refusal to pay old-age pensions untilfourteen days after the proclamation would entail serious hardship on many of the aged poor. The Treasurer, however, endeavoured to throw the responsibility on to the shoulders of others and adopted a most objectionable method of seeking to justify his position. He did not say whether the Government intended to try to make the first payment on the 14th July next, or to persist in their original intention to withhold it in five, out of the six States, until 29th July. He said that a great many papers had had to be prepared ancl circulated in connection with the introduction of the new system, but did not the first payment could be made on T4th July. If it can be made then, it ought to be made. for nearly twelve months, so that there has been ample time to carry out the preliminary work. that work has not been completed? the present Government if justice is not done to the aged poor.

I have just inlormecl adduce any reliable proof that the late Government did not intend to make the first payment in the middle of July. than the present Government have had to make the necessary arrangements. would have made the first payment on 14th July. Those who have been fighting in this Parliament for the last five or six years for the establishment of a Commonwealth system of old-age pensions have fully appreciated the unfortunate position of our aged poor, and certainly thought that, at the latest, the first payment would be made in the middle of next month. The Treasurer admitted yesterday that, on taking office, he simply allowed things to go on as he found them, and he gave no satisfactory reason why the first payment should not be made on the 14th of next month. I appeal to him to make every possible effort to relieve the sufferings of the aged poor by making the first payment on that date.

55,Mr Mathews (Melbourne Ports),"some of the former gentleman's own accounts which had entailed the expenditure. The Bill before us teems with contingencies, -reminding n:e very forcibly of a contractor's -extras after everything has been enumerated. At the end of the Bill there is a contingency vote of £120,000 j and I should like to iknow whether that may be regarded as the finish of all contingencies. I may be a little suspicious; but I want to be assured that the £100,000 down in the Bill under this heading is not to be used as a first instalment towards the cost of a Dreadnought. From the experience I have gained here, it is evident that it is possible for the Treasurer to spend money in almost any direction, and then come and be indemnified by the House. Is any of the .£100,000 to be spent towards the purchase of a Dreadnought ? cover of this Supply Bill various suggestions have been made to the Government, and I should like to add one in connection with the payment of old-age pensions. Honourable members have expressed a de. sire that the pensions shall be paid fortnightly ; and I presume we are agreed that these payments should be prompt. In this connection I desire to call the attention not' only of the Treasurer,' but of the Minister of Home Affairs, to the fact that, while it may be easy to pass a Bill providing for fortnightly payments, it is quite another matter to have the money conveyed fortnightly to the unfortunate recipients. The method of payment is, to my mind, suggestive of danger. In the first place, the services of post-office officials are availed of, although we know that, at the present time, they are simply overweighted with extraneous duties, especially in the metropolitan and larger centres. that. this extraneous work is used as an excuse for not carrying out the ordinary postal duties; and yet we. find that, say, in Sydney and Parramatta, the post-office organization is to be availed of, although the payment of the pensions under such circumstances must congest the departmental business. The average pensioners are old and infirm, and, not being smart commercial people, they are very cautious and slow in the signing of documents ; and, if there are tw« ""avments in each month in the more populous centres, we shall find the ordinary business of the post-office retarded. While I appreciate the idea of fortnightly payments, I must point out the difficulties which the Minister of Home Affairs, particularly, will have to provide for in the shape of additional accommodation. If , in the Sydney or Parramatta centres, there are 500 or 600 pensioners, the payment of a very small proportion of them might be sufficient to cause a congestion of business. The 'same sum has not to be paid to each; and the official, like a bank official, will have to exercise extra precaution until he has become familiar with the recipients. These, of course, are matters which can give rise to no party feeling; and I merely mention them in order to show that, if proper facilities are not provided, fortnightly payments cannot be carried out. Within a month from now there will be hundreds of complaints from different parts of Australia, alleging that the payments cannot be made. Why heap this extra work on the postal officials? It has come to my knowledge that, throughout the Commonwealth, they are now clamouring to have extraneous duties, such as the conduct of electioneering business, removed from their shoulders, ancl it is impossible for them to do' extra work. Responsible officers in the Department, such as would be chosen for the administration of the Pensions Act, have already too much to do. I think that the Government will speedily find that the provision already made is insufficient, and I hope that it will make further provision for the payment of pensions under a proper and efficient system. [3.12] I do not agree with the honourable member for Robertson that a Budget statement should precede the introduction of a Supply Bill of this nature; but there is an objection to the Bill which is worthy of some consideration. The Government asks fer Supply for two months, and Parliament, by granting the request, will dispossess itself of the power to enforce the delivery of the Budget within that time. It will be wholly for the Minister to' say when the Budget shall be delivered. The delivery of the Budget is of concern, not merely to this Parliament, but also to the Parliaments of the States, which are now in session, and desirous of learning their financial positions. It is impossible for them to give consideration to the financial question until they have received from the Treasurer certain information which is generally",18,Willis D O E S The Right Clusion Of The Debate On The Address In

60,Mr Thomas; Brown (Calare),"made public for the first time in his Budget speech. Therefore, to defer for two months the delivery of the Budget will seriously inconvenience the States as well .as the Commonwealth. It is for that reason that, last night, I voted for an amendment which, had it been agreed to, would have reduced our grant from two to one -month's Supply. Those who supported the amendment were contending that Parliament should retain control in respect to the delivery of the Budget. The Government, however, secured a majority for its proposal, and the Bill has been introduced. In my opinion, the House has unwisely given away its control of the Budget for too long a period. With regard to the payment of old-age pensions, the matters raised by the honourable member for Dalley deserve the -earnest consideration of the Treasurer, who will be wise if he deals with them straight away. The officials of the Post Office, partione case, one of these officers had to keep cularly in the large centres of population, already complain of the large amount of work they have to do. They say that it is only by working overtime that they can cope with the postal work alone. the work created by the administration of -the Old-age Pensions Act will be particularly heavy, and the postal officials will find it practically impossible to perform it. Therefore extra provision .must be made. The honourable member for Dalley has also drawn attention to the want of proper accommodation in the post-offices for the paying of pensions. A large number of post offices were built many years ago, and the increase of population has made their accommodation too small, even for the present convenience of the officials, and the public, for which they transact, postal and telegraphic business. Many post-offices are often congested with business at the present time, and will require to be greatly enlarged if the paying of pensions is to be ""done tion, but it is necessary to make some within their walls. Regarding the payment of these pensions semi-monthly, I ' would point out that it has recently been represented to me that in country districts it would often be more convenient for pensioners to be paid monthly instead of semimonthly, because many of them live at considerable distances from the places where the payments are made, and it is difficult for them to travel to those places. 'A number of them would, I understand, like the present system of paying monthly to continue. I suggest that the pensions should be payable semi-monthly, which would convenience pensioners in the cities, and, perhaps, the larger part of the country pensioners, allowing applicants who wish to be paid monthly to make a request to that effect. In my opinion, elasticity in the administration of the Act will meet a large number of very deserving cases. agree with the last two speakers that the postal officials have not sufficient time to administer the Old-age Pensions Act. Neither do I think that the administration can be successfully carried on by the clerks of petty sessions. In the large centres, these officers, in New South Wales at any rate, have many duties to perform. Sometimes they have courts to attend each day, and they also act as Crown lands agents, and in other capacities. They have not time to give personal attention to the payment of old-age pensions. I have heard that, in pensioners, who had travelled miles to see him, waiting from some time in the morning until 5 o'clock in the afternoon before he could give them his attention. In these centres Applicants and pensioners have to be given information, and, in many cases, instructed how to fill in their forms, and otherwise comply with the Act. All this takes time, and the work is too much to add to the duties of officers who have already a'great deal to do. Some clerks of petty sessions are constantly travelling, being in a different town each day of the week. _ They, of course, could not attend to the payment of old-age pensions. Therefore the administration of the Act is likely to break down unless other provision is made for it. I hope that the Treasurer will give consideration to these difficulties, and endeavour to make better provision than now seems likely to be made. I have no desire to increase the expense of administraalteration. matters to which the honourable member for Dalley has drawn attention should receive the careful consideration of the Treasurer and the Minister of H'ome Affairs.

With the establishment of Federation and the transfer of many State Departments to the Commonwealth, however, the postal officials became the Poo Bahs and the policeman is now the Lord High Everything Else. Commonwealth postal officers have, however, to attend to electoral, savings bank, and old-age pensions work, and as our functions increase they will have still more work to do. We shall have to recognise sooner or later that either the postal staff must be largely increased to enable this work to be coped with, or we shall have to appoint separate officers to do the outside work that has been placed upon their shoulders. It is unfair to charge the Postmaster-Generals Department with the ! increased expenditure rendered necessary to enable it to cope with the extraneous work that has been placed upon its staff. That fact is often overlooked. We hear honourable members criticise the increased cost of the Department under Federation, but it is not recognised that much of the work formerly done by State officials in other Departments is now discharged by postal officers. If we are to pile these extra duties on them, we must be prepared to increase their numbers, or else we must relieve them of some of these extra duties and appoint special officers to attend to them. been arranged. able member will find that in many cases it has not been arranged.

Is there any reason why he should not disappoint them and make an alteration now in regard to the date on which the financial year shall close? If 31st March were fixed upon, the Government would be able when Parliament met in May to bring down their policy statement, with a complete knowledge of the financial arrangements necessary for the ensuing twelve months. The existing arrangements worked very well when the State Parliaments used to meet on the ist September ancl close two or three months later, but since the Commonwealth Parliament meets about May, and continues in session until December, I am certain that the pressure would be considerably reduced if the financial year closed on 31st March.

The right honorable member last night took exception to my statement that he .should have no diffisions. The idea in the Act was that culty in arranging to deliver the Budget statement before the end of July. I still hold that view. There was never a time when thefinancesof the Commonwealth were better understood than they are now. The scrupulous economy necessarily exercised by the Treasurer of the day has caused expenditure to be kept down, and there should be no difficulty in submitting the Budget at an early date. Apart altogether from the desirableness or otherwise of granting two months' Supply, the Treasurer must recognise that it is his duty to the Parliament and to the country to submit the Budget at the earliest possible moment. Some honourable members have displayed remarkable anxiety in regard to the payment of old-age pensions, although not long since they declared that it was impossible for the federal Parliament to grant them. We are delighted to know that they will be paid as from ist July. The late Administration had made arrangements to pay them at the earliest possible moment, in the middle of the month, if possible, and, if that was not possible in all the States, in as many of the States as possible. That was the understanding before I left office, and all our efforts were partments, and also to revolutionize the being made in that direction. Although under the Act authority is given to appoint a 'Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner of old-age pensions at a salary of £1,000 for the former, and a considerable sum for the latter, the late Government, and myself, as Treasurer, administering the Act, thought it advisable not to make fresh appointments to those positions. We appointed Mr Allen, the Secretary to the Treasury, as Commissioner, and by that means saved £ 8 0 0 a year. We also saved a considerable sum by appointing Mr gives authority to expend. Collins, the Accountant of the Treasury, as Deputy Commissioner. By that act the Government saved, not only a considerable sum of money, but also a great deal of time, and obviated a great deal of inconvenience. Whatever other appointments we might have made, I believe there would have been confusion, but Mr Allen ha.d had considerable experience of the it to the service of the Commonwealth, and so the old-age pensions system has been inaugurated 'with an exceedingly, small amount of friction, considering the difficulties to be faced, and the great area to be covered. A material alteration was also made regarding applications for penpensions should not be* paid until the applications had been approved by the Commissioner himself. It was felt by the late Government that it would be much better to make the questions put to applicants more stringent than usual, and to enable the Commissioner to pay on the authority of the magistrate. That arrangement effects a great saving of time, and? avoids inconvenience, because with the declaration of the magistrate that the formis in order, and that the applicant is entitled to a pension, the Commonwealth can at once pay. That arrangement is a great improvement on what was previously proposed. I wish to ask the Treasurer whether, on the broad principle of this Bill, he may not be doing something that he will regret, in asking for two months' Supply. If the Government intend to introduce financial reforms, are they not committing themselves to pay all services for two months, even if they are out of date, or are to be .reformed out of existence? I imagine from what the Prime Minister and the Treasurer and other Ministers have said, that they intend to bring about great reforms in the Dedefence of the Commonwealth. I do not know whether that is to be done in one, two, or three months, or in as many years. interfere with our doing that. able member is committing himself and the country to carrying on the expenditure on the same lines as we have followed hitherto.",22,Willis D O E S The Right Clusion Of The Debate On The Address In

Divisions n to 16 (Department of External Affairs), £7>i5 8 [4.2] 1 see that we are again asked to vote an appropriation for advertising the resources of the Comrnonwealth. This question was threshed out at -the end of last session, whejn a large proportion of the members of the present Government were adverse to the passing of any vote for the purpose. What does the vote mean ? It means that the people of Great Britain, Europe, and elsewhere, are being hoodwinked by the Commonwealth Government. We .all know the great .resources of Australia; but, what is the use of telling a man that there is plenty of food in a restaurant if he is unable to enter the restaurant in order to obtain it? About £2,000 has been spent in filling the newspapers of Great Britain with lies, and telling the workers that, if they come out to Australia-whethe r they be iron workers, carpenters, or other mechanics-the y can obtain regular work at an increased wage. We hold out hopes to them of improving their position, while, at the same time, we know that almost every one who has been induced to come here has had a contrary experience. Uncier this vote, we have had beautiful pictures of the agricultural products of Australia advertised in newspapers abroad. I may be told that the party to which I belong carried out a precisely similar policv; but it must not be forgotten that my party . followed"" a common-sense method, proposing, as it did, to make arrangements by which immigrants could obtain possession of the resources of the Comthe party, composed as the party behind themonwealth.

Do Ministers intend to open up the resources of the country before inducing people to come here, or are they going to follow the old plan of bringing immigrants to particular metropolitan centres, with the inevitable result of reducing the wages rate?

111,Mr Mathews,"I am pleased thatto get the Premiers of the States to make the resources of the country available to immigrants. No member has done more in that direction; but he has admitted that the -State Premiers would not assist him. He was willing, as Prime Minister of the Commonwealth, to spend money in advertising the resources of Australia, but the only outcome of what was done was that certain persons were brought here by means of false promises. I ask him, therefore, if it would not be futile to continue this work? If he were to tell me that it is the intention of the Government to introduce, in the near future, a land tax for the purpose of breaking up the large estates, ancl making land available for settlement, I should at once sit down; but as he has recently charged the Labour party with supporting what he calls extreme legislation, I have not much hope that he will do that. Yet lie knows that it is cruel in the extreme to invite immigrants from Europe to take advantage of our resources when those resources are not available to them. It was the reverse of pleasurable to me last session to read in newspapers which were favorable to an immigration policy admissions to the effect that we could get thousands of immigrants more than we have land for. Does the Prime Minister, in view of the impossibility of getting the State Premiers to help in making land ^available, intend to introduce a Federal Bill which will open up our resources to immigrants? As a very minor light, I hardly expect to receive a reply from him. But I believe that, bad as he is, he has -certain good intentions, and that if his position in the present Administration were -strong enough, he would make some proposal of that kind. Since our past advertising has brought here boilermakers, engineers, stonemasons, and workers in the iron trades, of whom only a few could obtain remunerative employment, is it not high time to stop spending money until we have made proper provision for those whom we seek to attract? the late Administration came to Australia, as immigrants, and not one of them went -on the land. years ago, those who needed land could get it. grant system in South Australia. was offering large areas on easy terms of selection. But members of Parliament, the newspaper writers, and the man in the street, all know that it is worse than a crime to ask immigrants to come to this State to take up land now. Even the Conservative press admits this. That great journal, the Age, which has now the honourable member for Parramatta under its thumb, admits it . The honourable member used to charge me with being under the thumb of the Age, but that was not so. That newspaper has never supported me, and never will. It is said that the Age is becoming a supplement to the Argus. I do not say that that is true, though there is certainly a tendency in that direction. But, much as we may condemn its dirty methods in criticising politicians, we must admit its greatness. It has pointed out to the people of Victoria, and to the members of this Parliament, that it is criminal to bring persons here for whomi there is no land. The Sydney daily newspapers have made the same admission. There is, of course, land which is not in occupation, but it is such as no man could earn a living upon, or so far from markets that it would be cruel to ask those who do not understand our climate and conditions to take it up. As an Australian, I take an interest in these problems. I know that, unless the agricultural areas of Victoria are opened up, the cities will suffer. But I believe that there are little angels sitting above, and lesser, angels below, who will look after the interests of those in the agricultural districts. My principal reason for speaking on this subject is that I cannot shut my eyes to the fact that the exhibition in the Old World of pictures showing the productiveness of this country, its great buildings, and its vast foundries, will bring here men for whom there will be no employment. Already immigrants have come to electorates like mine, and that of the honourable member for Dalley, who have made the competition of the artisans there keener. Their coming has reduced the quantity of work available, and, in the of near future, must bring about a reduction of wages, too. I do not wish to see those whom I represent injured in this way. The exhibition of pictures, and the glowing advertisements of agents, will attract to Australia persons who naturally wish to improve their condition, and who think that, as this is a new country, its resources must Yes; and Victoria be as described.

I know of three families who immigrated to New South Wales, and thai came to Victoria, finally returning to the Old Country, some by the steamer in which they came out, and some by the next one. Apart altogether from the cruelty of inducing people to come to Australia by means of false advertisements,, we ought in the interests of the Commonwealth itself to put an end to a system that cannot redound to our credit. After we have prepared our house we should invite people to come and occupy it. If we do that, we shall do well. I should like this item to be rejected, but I suppose that the free majority behind the Government will carry it. I trust that the Ministry will take precautions to prevent a recurrence of the cruel experience of people who have come to our shores in the circumstances I have indicated, and that they will see that men already in Australia are not robbed of the little employment offering by reason of people being attracted to Australia by false advertisements inserted in newspapers in the Old World. not agree with the honourable member who has just resumed his seat, and who, I think, completely overlooked the fact that every man who comes to this country offers in himself a market for the produce of those already here. If we wish to maintain the White Australia about which the Labour partu are always clamouring on the platform, we must do what we can to populate the Commonwealth with people of our own race, and so save it from aggression on the part of the people of overcrowded Eastern countries. I am 1 glad that we have ih power a Government that will probably exercise a close scrutiny over the manner in which amounts are expended in connection with this advertising account. I have in mind a certain bargain that was made by the Government that has just retired from office, a bargain which 1 hope will not be imitated by Governments to come. IT"" there be any possibility of such a bargain being repeated, it will be necessary to institute a Committee of Public Accounts, such as exists in connection with the House of Commons.

Labour methods of recognising the signal ""worth"" of their supporters do not commend themselves to my judgment. The statements that have, been made this afternoon by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports would come more gracefully from a member of a party that was consistently trying to keep out immigration from Australia. Such a policy, I thinkj is suicidal, but if my honourable friends wish to talk ordinary clap-trap as to the way in which immigrants must interfere with those already in the country, I say that their own Government ought to have kept clear of any such contract as that to which I have referred. money according to the instructions given by Parliament. tions to be found ? ment vote the money? vote certain sums that may, or may not, be expended.

I remember the statement made by the present Prime Minister some time ago, that it was our duty first of all to find land for the people already here, and then, and only then, for any white men who might choose to come here. No one will deny that the State land, laws are infamous. The honourable member for Adelaide will bear out my statement that recently there were no fewer than 1,000 applications for 127 allotments a little outside of Adelaide, and that hundreds of people had to be turned away disappointed. The honourable member for Wentworth dishonoured himself ancl dolph Bedford as he did. He says that that gentleman endeavoured to stand as a Liberal. How could he do so when he was a Labour man ? offer to stand as a Liberal. ber, I am sure, is doing himself an injustice in making that statement.

Under"" Executive Counci l , "" the contingencies are only £ 3 0 , as compared with £ 1 3 5 for salaries; but for the Offices of the Commonwealth in London, the contingencies are again larger than the salaries. That brings me to the proposed vote of £ 2 , 0 0 0 for advertising the resources of the Commonwealth. I endorse every remark made by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, although the honourable member who preceded me criticised his statements. ' It is well known that men have gone from here to the Old Country painting such pictures of the conditions in Australia that the only word that can fitly describe them is "" l i a r . "" ' Men are induced to come here, and find they cannot get land. I endorse the sentiment previously uttered by the Prime Minister, that we must make the land available first for our own people, and then, when they are settled, open our arms in wide welcome and to any member of the white race who will come here. Mir. Randolph Bedford is well known, not only here, but in Great Britain, as a litterateur. He has published three books there, and has written a play called "" White Australia,"" which I a'dvise the honourable member for Went worth to see. The one note pervading that play is "" The land for the people."" In the Northern Territory, the vile system of land tenure that we have copied from GreatH e could not stand Britain is in f u l l force. In fact, throughout Australia, one cannot take a journey by any railway without* seeing large tracts of unused land. The Commonwealth or the States, or the municipalities, as representing the people, should have the right to resume land at the value which the owner I know that he asked me would put upon it, provided that he is willing to pay rates and taxes based upon that valuation. That would prevent him I repeat that he could ftom robbing the community, as it has too frequently been robbed in the past. If the Government will introduce a land tax which will permit the land to be given to the people, they will have the support, not this party, for that is a plank in our platform.

They will include telegrams that have to be sent between here and the office at Home on public matters, the printing and distribution of the Commonwealth Gazette, which alone amounts to £ 1 , 5 0 0 a year; the printing and distribution of the Commonwealth Statutes to the States Governments, & c , which costs something like £ 8 0 0 a year; interpreters' fees and cost of administration of the Immigration Restriction Act, postage and telegrams, office requisites, other printing and record books, travelling expenses, temporary assistance, and incidental cash expenditure. £ 1 . 4 8 8 in contingencies under the Administrative Division is entirely made up of those items of which the House has approved before, ancl which will appear in detail later on. orable members should not take the honourable member for Wentworth seriously. He seldom takes things seriously himself; and in this matter he has followed the old game of drawing a red herring across the track, in order to divert attention from an important matter in which he knows that honourable members on this side take a serious interest. It is evident that the Government are continuing to expand £ 1 , 0 0 0 II month, or £ 1 2 , 0 0 0 a year, on advertisof the Old World, while those who have to ing, and it is about time we knew what sort of advertisements they are issuing. I have had a great deal of evidence that the money is being spent in such a way as really to degrade Australia in the eyes of the people of the Old World. Nothing madder could be imagined than for the Parliament of the Commonwealth to spend money to do an injury to the country whose interests it is supposed to look after. Through being connected with a very large organization, which has its membership principally in country districts, and which covers the whole of Australia, I have special opportunities of knowing the effect of the advertisements on those who are brought to Australia by their agency. The state of the labour market is a serious matter to If the Minister of External that organization, and we have opportunities and machinery for collecting information that no Commonwealth Department possesses, or has attempted to provide. There are many hundreds, and even thousands of people, brought to Australia by the lying advertisements that have been circulated. The worse offender is the New South Wales Government, but Queensland is about as bad, and apparently the Commonwealth has been helping. ber ascertain from the Minister what it is proposed to do with the £2,000? must have great faith in me if he thinks I can extract any information from the Minister. The whole House has failed so far to get any information out of the Government, except a small explanation of the item of "" Contingencies."" It has been pointed out before that the term is very misleading, and some change ought to be made in the The method at present followed by the Departments. We cannot draw from the Minister a statement of what the Government propose to do with regard to advertising the Commonwealth. The present Prime Minister, when he was in different company, put forward a policy which we could not complain of. He said' that openings on the land ought first to be provided, but he is in new company now. He is in the company of those who support what has been taking place, particularly in New South Wales. The whole thing is most degrading. Thousands of people are being brought to Australia, and those who have any chance of doing so get away back again at once, and tell the truth to the people stay here write to their friends at Home and warn them not to come to Australia. misled. Many of them are carrying their swags. The honourable member for Robertson, who has some sense, even if the honourable member for Wentworth lacks it , will realize what it means to a man fresh from England to have to carry his swag and cadge his tucker through the western portions of Queensland and New South Wales. comers ?",29,Maloney Tha T Is A Petty Only Of Their Own Followers But Also Of

161,Sir John Forrest,"Are those newthe money of the people of Australia has been spent in helping to bring out. The foreign consuls in Sydney dare not speak out publicly; but I know that men who cannot speak a .word of English have been induced to come to New South Wales, and have gone to the consuls begging to be sent back to their own country again, as they were unable to get any work. It is a mean, cruel, and outrageous thing to bring such men. here, and no man with a heart would be a party to it. It could only be done by men like Dr. Arthur, who poses as president of the Australian Immigration League, and has published advertisements all over the Continent in the languages of the various European countries which lead the people to suppose that he is president of a republic. Those advertisements induce men to come here, and they think that they are sure to find plenty of work when they arrive. There is also evidence in the city of Sydney that girls who have been brought out as domestics have been driven to ruin, and on to the streets of Sydney. The Government have spent money to help to bring that about. Dr. Arthur is somewhere in England now. He was notorious in Australia as the man who cared nothing for the truth. Of course there is a great game behind it all. Not long ago, in a case in the Police Court at Orange, evidence was given that a man who was brought out as an immigrant had received for his work the magnificent wage of 2s. a week. The honourable member for Wentworth, in his characteristic ignorance of what he is talking about, says that every immigrant will be an additional consumer, and so create a market. What sort of a market does a man present who earns 2s. a week? This man, I may say, had a very liberal employer, because, after five weeks, the wage was raised voluntarily to five shillings. however, that others in the district were getLiberal partu, which provides for a White ting ios. a week, and he sued his employer for that amount ; but the employer engaged a lawyer, and the man "" went down,"" because of his agreement to take 2s. There is a bureau in Sydney which brings out misled domestic servants, whose references are held until they promise to go to some mistress at Potts Point, who starves her servants, ancl so forth, and for whom no Australian girl would work. We have the admission that in the case of New South Wales, poor men are purposely selected because they will not be ""too particular"" when they land here. The Government of New South Wales, composed as it is of the same crowd as that supporting the Commonwealth Government, are spending £25,000 a year in this direction, and that is quite enough to kill the prospects of the country. No doubt we shall have to honour the -contracts for advertisements, but the Government have control of the contents, and it would be infinitely wiser to advertise warning people against the misleading statements of the States' authorities. In New South Wales more immigrants have been brought in than it has been possible to absorb, and many have gone to New Zealand or elsewhere. One person told me that in nine miles he met thirty immigrants on tramp, who could not find any work to do, and these men have been living on the hospitality of residents in the country districts. What sort of a market is a. man. who has to beg his bread? It is denied that artisans arc brought out, but we all know well that such is the case, and the worse offender is New South Wales, with Queensland as good second fiddle. I have in my possession a letter from Queensland, which shows that I am now stating the exact facts. It is all very well for those who are living comfortably, like the honourable member for Wentworth member himself, for instance. Treasurer himself, I have some human sympathy, ancl I protest against the misleading of people who, in consequence of their disappointment, must denounce Australia, and warn their friends not to come to a country in which the lands are all monopolized. The fault lies in the disgracefully bad management of the land laws, and I hear no suggestion by the Government by way of remedy. At the proper time, I shall show that the GovernHe found out, ment have dropped the old plank of the Australia, and that they do not propose to touch the land by means of taxation. Before we pass this item, we ought to know exactly what is proposed to be done. I have investigated this matter, and I am anxious to see Australia filled with a white race, but it is no use bringing men out here to starvation and degradation, and thus doing a direct injury to the country. The Fisher Government definitely stated that they were not going to spend any of this money, and, of course, I do not knowwhat they did do, c because they had no time in which to prove",30,Maloney Tha T Is A Petty Only Of Their Own Followers But Also Of

It would be far better to save this £12,000, and utilize it in the development of the Northern Territory when we get control of it.

In any case, we ought to be honest, and not mislead the people abroad. When an immigrant comes JOHN FORREST -The honourable to New South Wales, he is sent to work on shares, and this is known to represent one of the grossest forms of sweating. There is not the slightest chance of their obtaining Land, because there are hundreds of applicants for each block; and on the share system, with the keen competition, the perJOHN FORREST -The honourable centage of profit is very low. The late Government were removed from office because they proposed to tax the land-because the big land monopolists would not permit a graduated land tax to be imposed. However that may be. the Government have control of the statements made in advertisements in various parts of the Old World, and, with some wise legislation on the part of the States, I nm sure that Australia could absorb millions. Queensland and Western Australia have done more in the work of immigration than any of the other States, but the fact remains that people are now coming here who cannot find employment. That, of course is a very serious matter for Australia, and we ought to have some statement from the Government as to whether the expenditure in advertising is to be continued. I have no hesitation in saying that some of the advertisements I have seen are absolutely false. A few years ago an immigration bureau in London on -behalf of Victoria did some advertising, and, on investigating the matter, I found that it was published that 500 carpenters were wanted at Alexandra, whereas there were not 500 people in the whole district.

The honourable member for Melbourne. Ports correctly described the position in his electorate when he declared that work could not be found for all the iron workers available there. The position is the same in New South Wales. The engineering trade and the iron workers generally in the electorate which I represent do not desire that artisans from Scotland or Belfast shall be introduced to compete with them, and they do not expect me to agree to votes for that purpose. Australia., in the matter of population, is very care how able he is, or how he spells his like an envelope. So far, although it is a vast and most fertile territory, only the gummed edges have been touched by the people. brightest spot on God's earth, and it would be a short-sighted policy to endeavour to limit it to a population of only 5,000,000. During the advocacy of Federation some twelve or fourteen years ago, the present Prime Minister and Sir Edmund Barton used to declare that within forty years of the establishment of the Commonwealth we should have a population of 50,000,000 or 60,000,000.

He had dealt with the sound investment to the country-that is, patriotism-so he put it to them as an individual business advertisement, and then, and then only, was the admiration of the Chamber of Commerce aroused so far as to agree with his sentiments. Let me quote a few words as an indication of the attitude of the gentlemen who were behind the fusion negotiations which resulted in the formation of the present Ministry, and who are asking, in unmistakable terms, that public funds -should be liberally etpended to induce immigrants to come to Australia. I quote the Honourable E. E. Smith, who, I believe, is a Victorian, from the official report of the last grand Inter-State Conference of the Employers Union, held in April, 1905. He began by saying that he would allow common sense to cure the political difficulties then existing. I ask honourable members to note the word "" obvious "" in Mr Smith's speech, although he did not explain what he meant by it. He saidI certainly would, for obvious reasons, encourage immigration. We must have the people, ment. . and we shall have them. We import machinery; why should we not import labour? So he classes a man precisely on the same level as a piece of machinery that he will scrap at any moment when he has had from it sufficient return to pay for its purchaseWe are importing machinery from America and Great Britain, and why not import labour? I do not care whether it is black or white. Gentlemen of the political persuasion of the Honourable E. E. Smith are now behind the Ministry of fusion, urging them with one voice to liberally spend the public funds to induce immigrants to come to Australia. wrong in it? We have machinery, and want labour to work it. ber for Robertson asks what is .wrong with the remark of another man that he does not care whether the immigrants are black or white.

In proof that Dr. Arthur has been guilty, to some extent, of publishing in the newspapers of the United Kingdom advertisements of a nature the existence of which the honourable member for Flinders has by inference denied, let me read another letter, in which he saysThere is a great demand at present, and will be for some time to come, for miners of all kinds, and pick and shovel men, in New South Wales. There has been such an expansion in the coal trade that hundreds of miners are needed at the various collieries on the North and South coasts. There the wages are from 8s. per day upwards, men sometimes making 12s. or 15s. per day. But all other kinds of mining need men also. Two thousand miners are required at BrokenH ill , several hundreds at the Cobar copper mines, at from ns. to 22s. a day, and small mines all over the country, whether they be copper or -gold or tin, are advertising for men. That letter substantiates the statement that Dr. Arthur and those acting with him are responsible for having published misleading and incorrect advertisements in the press of the United Kingdom, and corroborates what was said by the honourable member for Carling. To my mind, it is the evidence for which the honourable member for Flinders pertinently asked a few of others, any justification for the interjecmoments ago. When the letter was being written, miners were being dismissed at Broken Hill .and Cobar, and throughout New South Wales hundreds of unemployed of all classes would have been glad to take any work at the most meagre, remuneration. The letter shows the methods which have been adopted by that section of the community which is supporting the Ministry, on whose behalf the honourable member for Flinders ventured the interjection that the statements of the honourable member for Darling were absurd and ridiculous. It seems to me that there may have been ar> understanding between the Broken Hill Proprietary and Dr. Arthur, and that, thinking that there might be trouble with its men in the course of twelve or eighteen months, it persuaded him to get his league to use public funds in the endeavour to attract to the State 2,000 miners, whose arrival would assist to secure a reduction of wages at Broken Hill. No doubt, those responsible regret that these things have come to light. It is not to their advantage that the trickery in which they, have indulged should be exposed to the public It will not gaze. It may not be satisfactory to the If it did, it Ministry, or to the members of the three or four parties which have fused to support it, to have it known that their friends have published incorrect information in the United Kingdom, and suppressed the truth to mislead intending immigrants. I regret that these methods have been adopted, and that men of the stamp of Mr E. Smith are prepared to import labour as they import machinery. It shows how low their estimate of humanity is. Perhaps that estimate is in keeping with the opinion which many other supporters of the Government hold, without the courage to give expression to it. It is well, however, that the facts should be brought prominently before the public, in order that it may know what is being done by the section which has brought about the fusion, and whose mouthpiece, the Argus, says to-day that all behind, the Ministry must support it, no matter what it introduces, good, bad, or indifferent.

271,Mr Palmer,"Then I may say thatand that not a single acre could be obtained from the monopolists. Is that statement true? c honourable members opposite are looking with covetous eyes at those who have been able to acquire properties worth holding. There are 1,262 estates under the Victorian land tax, and the average of each assessment in the year 1900 was 6,479 acres. In 1905 the average was reduced to 5,577 acres. In 1906 it was still further reduced to 5,338 acres; and in 1907, to 5,198 acres. These are the latest figures, -and they prove that in seven years the areas of the large landed estates in Victoria have been reduced by one-fifth. That is an important fact, entirely controverting the baseless assertion that no part of the large estates of Victoria is available for settlement. There is another important statistical fact, and that is that about one-half of the area of Victorian estates over 10,000 acres in extent, consists of Crown land. There are in the large estates in Victoria, 9.545,000 acres, and half of these are Crown lands. Those figures indicate the extent of land controlled by the State of Victoriaapproachable. question at a later stage. Of the land in Victoria available for occupation there are 14,541 acres of first-class, 114,000 acres of second-class, 2,079,000 acres of thirdclass land, and 3,325,000 acres of pastoral land. There are also 6,517,000 acres of mallee land. These figures are from the Victorian Year-Book. Some time -ago several honourable members who were then sitting with the Fisher Government on this side stated that no lands were available for the people in Australia. The honourable member for Fremantle thereupon wjred to the Premier of Western Australia as to the lands available in that State, and received this replySixty-two million acres of unselected land within a ten-inch rainfall limit, one-third of which is estimated to be suitable for mixed farming; six hundred and fifty thousand acres now surveyed in advance of selection; one hunorable member for Riverina just now-is dred thousand of this at present available, the balance to be thrown open shortly. That speaks volumes for the amount of land which is available, and to which the State authorities desire to attract settlement. From the Queensland parliamentary papers I find that in that State there is a process of selection going on, and that enormous areas are available. The land not alienated in Queensland totals 145,000,000 acres. The area selected in 1906 was 708,000 acres, and by new-comers 276,000 acres. There was open for selection at the beginning of 1906 15,782,000 acres. were selected last year. land is held under very long lease. Tell us the area of land which is really available for the people. do so. "" He that hath ears to hear, let him hear."" knows that that land is no more available for the people than is his own land in New South Wales. statement of the Premier of Western. Australia. Australia that the Government are offering for settlement is available to anybody. honourable members some facts as to the total area of land in Australia. There appears to be an entire misapprehension as to the extent and scope of our country and its value from a settlement point of view. Honourable members opposite are so intent on looking with covetous eyes on those who have already acquired estates that they have no attention to bestow on the large areas of unoccupied land which are just as attractive now as the areas nearer to the shore were in the earlier history of Australia. In the Commonwealth there are 1,903,000,000 acres. I shall deduct the area below a 10-inch rainfall, although in some parts where there is less than a 10inch rainfall there are men occupying leaseholds with profit to themselves and advantage to the community. The area below an average of 10-inch rainfall is 600,000,000 acres. Above a 10-inch and up to a 145-inch rainfall the area is 1,303,000,000 acres. The area leased out of this-and this is the point which exercised the mind of the hon774,000,000 acres. The area alienated or in process of alienation is 126,000,000 acres, making a total of 900,000,000 occupied either by lease, alienation, or partial alienation. The unoccupied country therefore totals 403,000,000 acres. Of the total area of the Commonwealth only",42,Batchelor Definitely Honourable Gentleman Will Not Go Into De

While we have all these lands available, and every State is enacting laws to throw open areas as they are required for settlement, it is altogether a wrong policy to say "" We will obstruct immigration as much as possible until you have given us a land tax in order that we may dispossess the men who. have acquired land, who have held it since the early days, and who have paid for it . "" I present these figures, satisfied to know that, whilst honourable members opposite decry immigration until certain results have been accomplished, when the fact has been placed before the people that for our own protection we must have more population, the people will be with us, and say "" Go ahead, work hand in hand with the States in encouraging immigration. Do not take up a position of antagonism. are going to wait for a Federal land tax you will have to wait at least some years before you can make a start."" For reasons of defence it is essential that an early start should be made.

He can deal with it in relation to the Defence Department. to deal with it now or then. our bounden duty to assist to defend the commerce of this great Empire, as well as to protect our own shores, and the only way we can defend our r commerce is to assist the British Navy. I have placed these facts regarding land available for settlement before the Committee, because I feel impelled to view the question -from the larger stand-point of Empire. If we are to develop Australia, to make it a worthy descendant of I understand that honour great Empire, we must set to work without loss of time to introduce the right type of people, who will take up our large vacant areas. I am prepared to admit that there are thousands of acres at present not available for settlers, because the land is situated too far back; but there are thousands and thousands of acres which are in the range of practical occupation, which, if occupied, would mean wealth to the community, increased labour for the labourers, and a vast step in the direction of the progressive development of the Commonwealth. I trust that we shall not hear from honourable gentlemen opposite any further expressions of determination to resist the immigration of the right type of people; but that they will seek to induce the States to carry out this important work, and thus make the lands of mutual advantage to those who are here now, and those whom we hope will come. I am glad that the honourable member for Wentworth is now in his place, because he made some reference to my having authorized the payment of a sum of money for a special number of the Clarion, at what he conceived was £ 5 0 above the market value.

The whole business of advertising does not merely consist in attracting immigrants. Another object is to develop the trade of Australia, and to that end, to advertise the resources of the country, in the hope of developing our trade with foreign countries as well as with Britain, however anxious we may be for British preference. Another idea is to attract tourists to Australia; and most of is the ordinary the advertisements have been written with the object of directing attention all over the world to Australia as a legitimate field for business enterprise. As a matter of advertising for the purpose' of attracting immigrants. As the present Prime Minister knows, Sir Joseph Carruthers, in a claims that there is not the smallest difficulty in getting immigrants; but that, on the other hand, the agents are overwhelmed with applications. If the present Minister of External Affairs chooses to look up the files in his office, he will find that what I have stated is a fact. Mr Sydney Kidman has also said that there would be no difficulty at all in inducing thousands to come here, if they were certain of employment when they arrived. My own opinion is that we have no need to advertise in order to get immigrants by the thousand, and possibly by the million. object is to advertise to keep immigrants away; and that is wby he photographed those miners' humpies and sent copies Home. slightest notion to what the honourable member refers.

If he means that somebody somewhere photographed humpies, it is no concern of mine. The whole question is, what sort of arrangements do we make at this end in order to insure that the immigrant gets work, and that there is an opening presented for the development of his ability on the land, or elsewhere. much as we should. But all this talk of advertising with a view to attracting immigrants is so much humbug. there being no work for the men when they arrive, is also humbug. when not the slightest attempt to provide work is made, it is so much humbug.

The active co-operation of landowners the population, and that a comprehensive policy of immigration is urgently called for. honourable member not ro go into details on that question now. say that the Fisher Government definitely laid it down that, as a matter of extreme urgency, there should be progressive taxation of land values, in order that there might be subdivision of the large estates, and extensive areas thrown open to settlement, thus offering inducements to immigrants in large numbers. This proposal meant practical settlement and practical defence. member think that a progressive land tax would'settle the lands of Australia? tax is one of the measures sure of the Labour party? member knows that he will not interrupt the course of my argument and cause me to admit that the whole of the Labour party's policy lies in a progressive land tax. I will say, however, that, so far as immigration and defence, as arising from the settling of the waste areas is concerned, the key is a progressive land tax. Lands must be unlocked by some means or other. If the honourable member can suggest a mose effective means than a progressive land tax, I shall be happy to assist him in bringing it into operation. This is not my opinion, or that of the Labour party only. Sydney Morning Herald,, which is not a Labour journal, not a wild Socialistic rag, but one. whose respectability the Minister of Defence will vouch for, saysTf immigrants are to be placed on the land systematically and in numbers without prejudice to the land requirements of our people, it do not wish to discuss the theory of land is not to be disputed that the provision of settlement land on easy terms will have to proceed at a much more rapid pace than is the -case now. This applies, not in one State, but in all-a t least, in the more settled States. As to this State, we are not unmindful of what the Government is doing in the matter of resumptions. Speaking at Guyra on Wednesday night, the Minister for Lands said he was "" deupon only to pav a fair thing. termined to face the problem (of making land available), and he looked forward hopefully to the time when the men would not be moving about tlie country looking for land without the Government pursuing them tp take up the available areas."" We hope this good time is nearer than it appears to be. But we doubt if the themselves might enable the Government to do so, and, perhaps, the neglect of owners to see matters in this light raav prove to be strengthening the hands of those who are only waiting the chance to apply the goad of a graduated land tax. That is the opinion of probably the most Conservative journal in Australia. the Commonwealth Parliament should impose a land tax ? discussing whether a land tax should be imposed by this Parliament or by those of the States. ' ence. the issue. Some honourable members have to-night taken up the position that unlimited areas of land are available throughout Australia, ancl even in Victoria and New South Wales, and. that we ought to pursue a systematic immigration policy to encourage settlement upon them. If the States would impose progressive land taxation, it would be better to allow them to do so, and to leave the whole business of immigration to them. But is the progress of Australia, to be delayed indefinitely while the Legislative Councils of the States refuse to sanction such taxation ? sentatives of the people have never asked for progressive lancl taxation. the State has never enjoyed a sufficiently Liberal Government. Queensland Parliament is as broad as is that for this Parliament. taxation the best means to induce settlement ? taxation, but surely the honourable gentleman knows that its object is, not so much to obtain revenue, as to cause those who hold the land to pay something for the privileges which they enjoy.

386,. Mr Batchelor,"The debate on theable member attacks me for having caused certain advertisements to be circulated in Europe, surely I am entitled to reply. Sir member could be controverted by a reference to the very newspaper that he circulated. able member knows that, as a matter of fact, it was very good business for Australia. I ^ have here a long extract from an Australian newspaper, in which, under the heading of "" A Policy to be Avoided,"" reference is made to the difficulties that Canada has experienced owing to the lack of a proper selection of immigrants, and a proper supervision of them on arrival. If we were dealing fully with the question of immigration, I should read the article, because it describes very vividly the state of affairs which some men from Australia and New Zealand found prevailing in Canada as the result of the alleged careless immigration methods adopted by the Canadian Government. Those men have since returned to Australia. Those who bring under the notice of the authorities-whethe r in this House, at meetings of Trades and Labour Councils, of the Employers' Tederation, or bf other bodies-that in some cases no attempt is made to find land for immigrants when they arrive here, and that no genuine assistance is extended to them, .with the result that they are stranded and left destitute, do a service to the country. We ought to be ashamed of ourselves if we employ State funds to bring immigrants to Australia, and fail to look after them when they arrive here. sheaves of letters regarding cases where that has not been done in various States. Sir Australia, I hope. with regard to Western Australia. no immigration until we can look after every immigrant that comes? that, but if we employ State money to bring out immigrants we ought to look after them on arrival. a great deal on the character of the man. time. great harm is done to Australia by men being stranded here. They are led to believe that there will be any amount of work for them, and then they write to their friends at Home, telling them not to JOHN ' FORREST The honourable come out, and describing the conditions prevailing in Australia, in the belief that they are typical of the whole of Australia, whereas they are not. Those who point out that these conditions sometimes prevail, and bring such cases under the notice of the authorities, are called members of the ""stinking fish"" party. They aTe accused of decrying Australia, but it is because they love Australia, and want to better it, and do not want these statements to be made about it, or do not want such statements to be true, that they take action. . The men who really belong to the ""stinking fish"" party are those who constantly cry out that there are any amount of opportunities for anybody to get full work at full wages in Australia, and that there is plenty of land available for all who choose to come and occupy it. Under present circumstances, those assertions are not.true. Immigrants who come here, believing that they are true, write to their friends in the Old Country describing their experiences, and so considerable damage is .done to Australia. A sane policy in this matter is to make sure to do everything that lies in our power to throw open lancl at prices at which settlers will be able to make a "" do "" of it. Within the last three or four years a dairy farmer from Denmark, with eleven children, came to Melbourne with the intention of taking up land for dairying in Victoria. He applied for every Government block that was I have thrown? open, but he was allotted no land whatever. Finally the family took up land in the district of the honourable memJOHN FORREST -Not in Western ber for Corangamite, being assisted by another Dane, who was a local resident. That family paid, as naturally would be the case in the circumstances, being unider great pressure, a very much bigger price than they ought to have paid for the land, considering the use-dair y farming-to which they wished to put it. The result is that to-day the whole of those eleven children are working in factories in anld around the city of Melbourne. That is because they could not get land at a reasonable price. The father was a practical dairy farmer in Denmark, and really knew his business. He assures me that he could make much more off the land at present prices in Denmark than he could make in Victoria at the prices which",48,Batchelor Definitely Honourable Gentleman Will Not Go Into De

The men brought out to Australia are not, as a rule, most suitable for pioneering work of that kind. That is one of the reasons why we advocate a progressive land tax. We believe that the lands nearer settlement ought to be cut up, because they could be utilized much more readily by immigrants than could the outside country, which must be pioneered by Australians. member show how the progressive land tax will cut up that land? does the honourable member really require to be shown that? so many interjections passing across the chamber that it is not possible for the honourable member to continue his speech. The only result is to prolong debate. I would also remind honourable members that we are in Committee, and that every honourable member has, therefore, the opportunity to speak as often as he likes. pay taxation for every £ 1 above £5,000 [ 3]2 2 that he holds in land values, and an increasing amount for every £5,000 worth over that, he will very soon find it unprofitable to hold a large area of land, and will have to cut some of it up. throw the poorer land on the market first, because he must have regard to the productive value of the land. value is expressed in the £5,000 value. I cannot understand the honourable member's poor lancl theory. The question is not affected in the slightest by whether a man holds poor or rich land. Under a progressive land tax a man will get rid of The ballot system is a his worse, as will reduce his taxation to an amount that he can afford to pay. It does ""not follow that he will get rid ofhis poor land. He may get rid of his We must make better land, but in any case if he does sell his poorer land, he must sell more of it than he would of his richer land, in order to bring down the total value of his holding to a reasonable figure. poor land, he is bound to throw it on the market, because his charges are so much heavier. member is confusing areas with values. It makes no difference whether a man holds rich land or poor land, so far as regards his having ro throw it on the market in order to reduce the total value of his holding. The whole question is the value of the land held. If a man holds such an amount of unimproved land as to bring him under the progressive land tax, to that extent he, cannot get money out of his lands, and, therefore, he must get rid of them, in order to make an income. confiscation by taxation 1 point which, I am afraid, the Chairman would rule me out of order in discussing. When it comes to a question of confiscation, we are faced with the alternative of repurchasing the land. That is confiscation by artificially increasing the values, and making it more difficult for people to obtain land; it is an inflation' of values by State aid, and a gift of the added value to the persons who hold the land. In my opinion, the State has no right to go into any enterprise of that kind, because it really means confiscation, just as much as does a progressive land tax, which, I",49,Batchelor Definitely Honourable Gentleman Will Not Go Into De

I pointimmigration, land settlement, and advertising Australia are so interwoven that it is extremely difficult to separate them, and the discussion, brings into view the difficulty -of getting such legislation in the States as is desirable. However, I have no desire to take up more time of the Committee, and shall content myself with pointing out that .those who are really serious in trying to biing about an increase of population will have to take the advice of the Sydney Morning Herald, which I read at the beginning of my speech, and look very closely into the necessity of providing lands sufficient to employ the energy of thousands, and not of mere hundreds, as is the case to-day. .[9.20] -The honourable member for Boothby has delivered a very interesting address; but throughout he has not said that his party is in favour of the nationalization of monopolies. The Labour party regard land as the greatest monopoly, and are in favour of taxing it, with an exemption of ^£5,000 in value. But this is only in order to get the law enacted; and later they will doubtless come .down on the smaller estates below the exemption value, and nationalize them. The honourable member tried very hard, but without success, to explain away an interjection made from, this side of the House; and there is no doubt that the object of the taxation is to burst up estates. The honourable member endeavoured to get away from the fact that -the first estates to be burst up would be the poor holdings that are not productive. Consequently, the first estates to be crushed w i ll be those beyond the Goyder line of rainfall in South Australia, and those within the line will be the last. -hear the honourable member say that, bemembers shall not laugh me out of court. cause it is ridiculous ! -earned increment is there in the case of the financial crash in the early nineties? land at Terowie in a drought season? -there; they are lease-holders. -large areas of land in Terowie. individual who owns more than £ 5 , 0 0 0 institutions.

Adelaide. desert country, beyond the Goyder line; and all the private land there will f a l l into the market, seeing that its economic value will not enable the holders to pay the tax. Of course, this is an easy way in which to carry out the confiscation policyof the Labour party. Honourable members run away with the notion that there are rich lands which will at once be forced bn to the market, and that the only persons affected, will be the nominal owners. I point out that when we go out into these districts, we find a church, a smithy, and perhaps a bank. In numerous townships throughout Australia you will find these edifices. houses ? public houses there, too. The banking institutions of Australia have not established branches throughout the country merely for the f u n of doing so. There is a demand everywhere for capital. Those who have put millions into the banks require outlets for their investment, and the banks employ thecream of commercial men to manage their business, and to loan out their money to the holders of land. The result of the bursting up of large estates would be that many would be surrendered to the Crown, and the banks would lose the money invested in them.

Having burst up and confiscated the large estates, the party will say, "" We are in favour of the nationalization of monopolies."" A day or two ago there was tabled in the other House a motion for the introduction of a B ill for the nationalization of land and all monopolies. That disposes of the £ 5 , 0 0 0 exemption. The scheme of the party will never accomplish what is aimed at. Boothby has shown that the peopleiof South Australia, the most democratic community in the Commonwealth, have refused to agree to progressive land taxation. people's representatives have agreed to progressive land taxation year after vear. able member added that the Upper House has refused to pass such a measure.

Australia has always had one man one vote. franchise long before the Labour party existed, although the members of the party for this and other reforms. But the Parliament of the State has not imposed progressive land taxation, not because the Upper House represents only men of property, but because the needy wage-earners will not vote for it . They are honest. They do not desire to confiscate the property of other deserving persons. The reason why the Labour party will never be able to carry such taxation in Australia is that the proposal is unjust, and amounts to robbery.

456,,"The honourable "" Mr HENRY WILLIS I am speaking,The greatest land reformers have always regarded it as fatal to prosperity. The Labour party is bound to fail, because it appeals to the prejudices of the masses, who are supposed not to know what is meant by it, and because it makes a class appeal to the poor against the rich. The surprise is that spirited and high-principled men can be found willing to ally themselves with a party possessing such a policy. The proposal before us is the voting of money to be spent in encouraging immigration to Australia. We should do our best to induce people to come here. We need population. One leans upon another, and if the country prospers all must prosper. Those who come here will create additional wealth, and the extension of our commerce will benefit every member of the community, and every institution in it. It is matter for regret that the Government proposes to spend so little in inducing immigration. I hope that at no distant period a very large sum will be placed upon the Estimates to attract a continuous and large inflow of population. The ox-leader of the Labour party spoke some time ago at the inaugural meeting of the Immigration League of Australia, of which thc Daily Telegraph of 16th October, .1.905, gave the following reportThe inaugural meeting of the Immigration of employment, but whether they are or League of Australia on Saturday evening in are not, that is no reason why we should the Lyceum Theatre ""was a pronounced success not encourage suitable immigrants to come in every way. . . by Dr. Arthur.

It will be seen from the quotation I have made that the honourable member for South Sydney was in favour of immigration, although he would not commit himself any more than we, who claim to be in favour of it, would to the details of the scheme that might be put forward by Dr. Arthur. The honourable member for Adelaide stated this afternoon that Dr. Arthur had induced people to come here from other lands by telling them that Western Australia was a land of sunshine, and that miners were needed in New South Wales. I do not know that there is much cause for complaint in regard to such a statement. Miners may or may not be out The chair was occupied to Australia.

The statement has been made during the debate that Dr. Arthur advised the Adelaide Chamber of Commerce that it was good business and a patriotic movement to advertise for immigrants. It would be unreasonable to disagree with that statement. We cannot do better than advertise Australia and encourage people to come here. To say that those who come here are unable to find employment is not to state the case fairly. minutes, to produce a new arrival who cannot find employment. doubt that a dozen men could be found who have come here only to be disappointed. I have made inquiries, however, at the New South Wales Intelligence Bureau, which encourages immigration, and know 'that every intended immigrant to New South Wales must first be approved by the Agent General, and that very careful supervision is exercised. I have frequently rung up the Department to inquire if there were any men awaiting employment, ancl have almost as frequently been told that none were available. The honourable member for Darling said that girls coming to Australia were badly treated, but I have been toid by the head of the Intelligence Department in Sydney that they find employment almost immediately after their arrival. I have not yet heard of a new arrival being stranded in Sydney, or unable to find employment. I have employed some immigrants, and know that it takes them some time to become accustomed to Australian conditions. They are excellent men, and are just as anxious to secure high wages as is any Australian. Indeed. I think, that they are induced by statements made on board ship on the way out to entertain an exaggerated idea as to what are the standard wages in this country. I do not think that any one can point to a case where a manwho, on arrival here had enough money to sustain him for a week, was prepared to work for less than the current rates of .wages. Immigration ought to be encouraged by the Labour party. They will lose nothing, even in the matter of their party organization, by doing so, since newcomers are just as keenly alive to labour interests as are any Australian workers, I , hope that the Government will continue to .advertise our resources with a view of attracting suitable immigrants. Mr KI NG O'MALLEY [9.47] I have listened attentively to the' speech made by the honourable member for Robertson, who seems to hold that the original pre-emptors of Australian soil created this Continent. One would gather from his remarks that the Almighty had"" nothing to do with its creation, and that it owes its existence to the boodleiers of this country. He seems to forget that Australia has borrowed £250,000,000, and that that immense sum has been expended on railways, 'bridges, roads, and other works, I "" am prepared, in fifteen as well as upon public buildings, that havetended to create an unearned increment in' the property of those who first took up the soil pf Australia. And yet the honourable member says that it means confiscation to exempt £5>ooo of unimproved land values. I do not think he understands the question. If he did, he would recognise that the present system of taxing improvements is equivalent to highway robbery. The moment a man spends vast sums of money on improvements-the moment he gets his property intoa high state of productivitya valuer comes along, and up goes the assessment of his property for taxation purposes. On th'eother hand, the man next door, who keepshis property in such a state that it is fit only for dog kennels or pigsties, is exempt from taxation.

Their Treasurers have all been trained men.

We should not waste a penny in advertising to bring immigrants to Australia until we make such arrangements that we can put the men to work and provide positions for the women.

Over 59,000 Americans have left the NorWest territory of the United States during the last year or two, and taken up land in Canada. I know this to be a fact, because I owned property in Western America myself, and property has been sold there at high prices. People are taking millions of United States money into Canada because the Canadian Government offer inducements. Years ago, I said that we ought not to spend millions in keeping up our tinhonorable member for Boothby, referringpot military system, but ought tp bring people out tp this country to buy the land.

Now, I find in that publication the following: Yet, for all this industrial legislation, and the fine reforms it promises, Australia's great want is men of small capital to embark in rural occupation, and small farmers for the land. But to all decent white men and women, Australia holds out the hand of welcome, offering the freest of citizenship to-day, and the promise of partnership in the most prosperous ancl the happiest nation of the earth.

Well, this is what they published in this numberThe richest man, and the freest man-almost , certainly, the most self-reliant and the most leisured' man in the world-that is the Australian ; the last of the great continents; the country where vested interests have strangled equality of opportunity least, where class privilege cannot live, and where every adult of 21 enjoys a vote, and all the self-government a vote implies-that is Australia. The lands owned by the State are of tremendous area] the public debt-is mostly represented by railways and other public works. All, such means of transport are Slate-owned, and there is no juggernaut of private ownership to crush the farmer, who, in other countries, has found that the man who owns a railway practically owns the country through which the railway runs. This is a publication absolutely brought into life by the Government of which the honourable member for Melbourne Ports was a supporter. gotten that there was a land tax behind all this. to read every line of the publication; but I do not think there is a word there about a land tax; the article speaks of things as they are, and not as we may hope them to be.

If it is couleur de rose, why have the Labour Government paid for it, to the large profit of the people who have produced it ?

497,Mr Kelly,"Does the honourable memwher land' policy, they will be able to manage the business very much"" better than could the honourable member who lives in one of Australia's largest towns, and probably knows little enough of such matters. are all agreed that Australia, more than any other country in the world, needs immigration. We are one of the white outposts, and no other country is more required to be self-contained and self-supporting. At the same time, I am opposed to introducing immigrants until we have prepared the way for them. It is simply wasting money, unless the Government give some undertaking or definite promise as to making room for the newcomers; and, in the absence of any such promise or undertaking, I shall certainly oppose any vote of the kind. My. personal experience of immigrants, who have lately been introduced, has not been satisfactory. I have-been appealed to again and again by those who have been brought 'here under delusUve promises and inducements held out from one source and another, and now find themselves absolutely stranded. This is a most undesirable state of affairs; and, so far as my intelligence guides me, the arguments advanced against the land tax, which presents the only method of introducing a sturdy yeomanry, are fallacious. We are told that the land tax is inequitable, because it makes no exemption. That argument is used even by those who, at heart, are opposed to a land tax of any sort. I am prepared to admit that, ethically, there should be no exemption from a land tax, the values that are aimed at being those belonging to the people. One does not .need to be a deep thinker, or a learned economist, to recognise that the constantly increasing value of land is the result of public expenditure and effort. Many honourable members have been taught in that school of political thought. therefore admit that unearned increment is a legitimate mark for taxation. We ask the landholders to return to the people the value which the people have conferred on their land. That is a fair and reasonable request, and those who own land should be only too pleased to pay such a. nominal charge. But the position of affairs in Australia is such that we need, not merely a tax on unearned increment, but a tax which wil] lxso heavy as. to make it impossible to hold large areas of arable land without putting them to the fullest cultivation. To bring about the full use of land, I am prepared to vote for a tax of as much as is., in the £ 1 on large estates. Of course, land which is not suitable for close settlement has comparatively no unearned increment, and some absolutely none at all. But land which is constantly increasing in value should be subject to a progressive tax. When the State attempts to buy back land, it puts up prices against itself. It is a remarkable fact that the recent attempt to buy back land in New South Wales has resulted in a considerable increase in the price paid by farmers for small holdings. The price paid for the first instalment of land bought back, and resold, was on the average something like £1,600 a farm,, but on a later instalment the average wasabout £2,000 each for thirty-six farms or more. That, to my mind, clearly proves that it is idle to attempt to settlethe country in this way. Moreover, it is ruinous. In addition to paying for the unearned increment, the State increases values by becoming a buyer. What is needed is to cheapen land, and that can be done only by the imposition of a land tax. We aim at breaking up the big estates, and, incidentally, at raising^ revenue. We do not wish to tax the smaller estates, because we contend that their holders already pay more than afair proportion of taxation. The man on a small area is an active member of so0 ciety, who, in proportion to the land heoccupies, contributes a thousand times as much to the State as does the man who holds a large area of equally .good land. That has beendemonstrated again and again. I have had particular facts and figures brought under my notice recently which go to show that, on a rough average, a small man farming 250 acres of fairly good land contributes about £ 8 0 a year to the revenue in railway freights, whereas if the holder of They wil 1 30,000, 40,000, or 100,000 acres were contributing in like proportion-whic h he is not-h e would be increasing the revenue enormously. Instead of making all he can out of his land, even for himself, the large holder does not get from it a tithe of what it should return, and escapes his just obligations. He does not contribute nearly so largely as does the small'man by paying railway freights to and from the centres of population, Customs duties, and innumerable minor taxes. In comparison with the small man, the big man contributes next to nothing to the revenue. That is the logical reason for exempting the small man from -",58,Johnson Th E Chairman Of Com
498,Mr Carr (Macquarie) [10.23],"W etaxation, unless the taxation of his land is accomplished by the remission of taxation of other kinds. We aim at reducing things to an equality. A progressive land tax would be revenue producing up. to a certain point, but it would have a tendency to break up the large estates. When that had happened, the small men who would settle on the land would contribute largely to the revenue, and greatly augment the public funds. In my opinion, this defence of our land taxation proposals is needed. I do not think honourable members have clearly understood our reasons for exempting small men from taxation. which I have put forward are proper and effective. I urge the Government to include land taxation in its programme. It seems to me that'the present line of cleavage between the two great political parties is due to the division of opinion in regard to land taxation. Clearly, to obtain the support of certain honourable members, Ministers had to jettison their land tax proposals. But the country cannot progress without land taxation. Without it we must have stagnation. In the face of the fact that the situation in Europe is critical; that we have an awakened East knocking at our door, and that our population is infinitesimal compared with the property which it controls, it is imperative that we take steps to place ourselves in a position of greater security. Australia's position will be worth nothing, unless, in the meantime, a land tax is imposed. taxation, it will be unnecessary to discuss proposals for increasing immigration. The fact that land is available here, and that a paternal Government is willing to assist men without capital, on the French system of credit, will lead to the inundation of the country by a virile population, such as years ago came to our shores in the hope of winning gold from the earth. When men elsewhere know that they can secure in Australia areas of land sufficient for the bank or other financial institution in Aussupport of a. family in comfort, they will come here'in large numbers, and we shall have all the immigration that we need. Unless land is made available, the continent will be lost to Australians in the course of the next decade or so. I see nothing to save us. That any Government should so abandon the destinies of the country as this Government has done to secure support, is a tragedy for which posteritv may yet liveto curse the present generation.

There is only one other point to which I wish to refer. I was under the impression that State servants on being transferred to the Commonwealth had their rights conserved, and it was my boast, until lately, on many a public platform, that men and women in the Federal service received equal pay for equal work. I find, however, that that is mere moonshine, judging by the treatment that has been meted out to three transferred officers, apparently because they are women. These women, one with twenty years' service, another with twenty-two years' service, and still another with twenty-three years' service in Victoria, were recently transferred to the Commonwealth, and they are receiving the munificent salary of £ 7 8 per annum. Yet we have in the Public Service Act a provision that any adult who has been for three years in the Public Service of the Commonwealth should not receive less than £ r r o per annum. they were transferred. transferred to the Commonwealth Service, but I am sure that if they were men they would have received different treatment. I do not blame the present Government. I should speak as I am now doing even if the Fisher Government were in office. I was sorry to see the signature of a member of that Government attached to the notice of transfer which appeared in the Government Gazette. Rather than sign such a notice I would have resigned had I been a Minister. I have made my protest, and will take another opportunity to press these cases on the consideration of the Government.

I made special representations to the Department recently about the range. The whole of the facts of the case have been under review, and as far as. I can ascertain they are as I,have stated them. The rifle clubs and others who are interested in the range have been deprived of the use of it for twelve months, and they want to know how much longer they are to remain in that unfortunate, posimembers of the Cadet Forces at the public tion. The fault lies with the Department. This is not the way to encourage the development of our Defence Forces. It is only another instance of the disheartening experiences which young men in country districts bave to put up with in their desire to do their duty by equipping themselves for' defence purposes. They should receive some consideration at the hands of the Government. If provision is not made for the work until the Estimates are brought down the probabilities are that the vote will not be passed until just before Christmas, and that will mean that the work will not be taken in hand until some time next year, making a year and a half, and perhaps two years, that the range will have been lying idle. This is a case that deserves' special consideration, which I hope it will receive from the Treasurer and Minister of Defence. -There were at one time in my electorate five rifle clubs. They had two ranges, one of which has been closed. I am speaking from memory, but I think the other was at Oakleigh. There was a case of rifles there, but when the club opened it an officer of the Department threatened them with all sorts of pains and penalties if they dared to use them. The young fellows in the district were very keen on rifle shooting, ment. No family should be expected to but they have had tp give it up on account of the absence of a convenient range. At present they have to go to Williamstown on their Saturday afternoons, and that takes the whole afternoon. When there was a range in the district they could get an hour's shooting at any time. , I feel that the departmental officers. have very little sympathy with the rifle .clubs, but if we wish to new 6-in. Mark VII . guns, purchased by the protect this country we"" ought to teach every man to shoot. I trust the new Minister will see that every facility is given in that direction. These young men get no payment, -although they give their spare time to practising rifle shooting for the good of the country. The permanent military men have not the sympathy that they ought to have with these volunteers. Men who are prepared to give their time to learning to shoot should receive every assistance from the Department. Money spent in putting up and keeping in order these rifle ranges is money well spent in the defence of Australia. wish to bring under the notice of the Minister of Defence the difficulty which the schools and elsewhere have in getting their uniforms. Many of the cadets are the children of very poor people, but, although the parents put up some proportion of the money, considerable delay takes place in getting the Government or the contractors to do their part in providing the uniforms. A specially urgent question is the need for increased accommodation at the Adamstown rifle range. That is the centre of a large district. It serves a population of, I suppose, 150,000, and on the occasions of the annual matches or rifle 'courses it is patronized by men from Sydney and from as far north, I suppose, as the border. All the musketry courses for the district have to be fired there. I learn that only recently when they were '.rying to get through an ordinary musketry course the men were firing over one another at the different distances in order to get through. Something should be done there to'accommodate, hot only the men who must go through the musketry course, but also the members of rifle clubs who patronize the range. The competitions for prizes, for which' I presume we' provide money, also take place there, and I am told that the accommodation is utterly inadequate for the number of competitors. The caretaker's residence is a standing disgrace to the Departlive in quarters such as the caretaker and his family have to occupy. I hope the Minister will look into the matter as early as possible, with a view to improving the range.

It is absurd that there should ""be only one rifle to every twenty of the -men who are prepared to risk their lives for' the defence of Australia.

When the Transvaal was fighting against the mightv British Empire, not only did the Boers make stheir own rifles,but theyactually constructed big guns. Surely we possess suffiIn purchasing guns of that cient intelligence to do the same sort of thing. If the Minister of Defence will only show as much energy in the administration of his Department as he used to display in criticising the Government when he was Leader of the Opposition, it will not be long before every man in our forces will have a rifle. I recognise much good in the Minister's past actions. I commend to him the idea of making the defence of Australia dependent upon a land tax. In my opinion a land tax should be made to pay for the whole of our defence. In England at one period there was almost incessant war for over 100 years, and, nevertheless, no debt accumulated. It was only when the Hanoverian succession occurred, and the debts of Charles II . of unblessed memory had to be discharged, that a national debt was commenced. Let me .commend to the Minister the example of a country whose legal enactments can be claimed to be scientifically exact, and whose Customs Tariff is, in respect to the principle on whicli it was framed, probably, the best in the world. I allude to the country which Great Britain chose to be her ally for defence and offence, namely, Japan. Japan offers an excellent example of what can be done. I * shall quote from the Financial and Economic Annual of Japan, published by the Government Printing Office, Tokio. I learn from this book that £ 1 0 0 of income pays a tax of £ 1 ios. But in case of special emergency the tax would be £ 3 9s. A man who has an income of £ 3 0 0 ordinarily pays £ 6 , but in time of emergency, he would pay £ i J6S. A man 3 who has £1,000 of income will pay £ 3 0 ordinary .taxation, the amount to 'be -increased by 150 per cent -makin g £ 7 5 a year-in a time of emergency. A man with an income of£10,000-and there are many wealthy men in Japan-woul d under ordinary circumstances pay an income tax of £550, but the special tax -which might be imposed would be £2,035. I do not blame any one for having a large property. I wish every member of this House had a large income, and were able to pay taxation on a large estate. I do not wish to see a miserable, shabbv land tax, such as exists in Victoria. The'A^e. to its eternal credit, has thundered out its denunciation of the Victorian tax in no uncertain way. It is.

No difficulty should be experienced in getting that information. At the time this line was projected, I objected to placed in a different category from residents in the country, who are obliged to guarantee a certain sum before any new line will be constructed by the Department. I should like the Minister to ascertain the -exact position before the next. Supply Bill is under consideration, so that honourable members may know whether the persons using the trunk telephone line between Sydney and Melbourne are placed in a superior position to that occupied by country residents. -[11.28] I wish to direct attention to a new departure in Postal administration. It appears that in new centres where postal facilities are sought, the Department practically says to the applicants, ""You must carry on the business yourselves for a period -of twelve months, and then if the traffic warrants it Ave will consider your request."" I know of two cases in my own electorate. One is on the railway line between Parkes and Condobolin. At a certain point on that line a number of new'Settlers have located themselves, owing to the cancellation of certain improvement leases. As a matter of fact, about fifty families are settled there, and they have endeavoured to obtain .a post-office at their siding. In reply the Department has informed them that it will provide them with a mail bag, and if they can secure the services of some person who will receive the bag, make it up, ancl attend told that a consignment was expected from to the distribution of mail matter, it will allow him £ t per annum, and at the end -of six or twelve months, if the traffic warrants it, steps will be taken to establish a post-office there. a similar position of things obtains at another siding on the Cowra-Harden line. That is not a progressive policy to adopt in developing country centres. If any -concessions are' to be made, they ought to be to these outlying places; and I hope the Postmaster-General will look into the matter, and see 'whether a more liberal policy cannot be adopted. not allow this vote to pass without supplementing what has been said by the honourable member for Calare. Only today I brought under the notice of the Postmaster-General a country locality in my district, which the State authorities have thought of sufficient importance to construct a railway to, but where the administrators of the Post and Telegraph Department decline to afford the usual the metropolitan residents being facilities until it is shown that they will prove a paying affair from the start' All this seems to be due to Mr Scott, who runs the Department, and has done so for a considerable time. But we must nof forget that in the metropolitan areas extensive services have been ordered without any guarantee. Svdney trunk telephone line. to which I have referred there are a large number of settlers; and under the circumstances it is not surprising that some people are finding that Federation is not having the desirable results they expected. A railway has been constructed there for about forty miles, at a cost of £3,000 a mile; and yet it is not deemed of sufficient importance to provide telegraph or telephone facilities. The same complaint can be made in regard to other places, though in a lesser degree. I do not know whether all this is because the Deputies have no responsibility, and are just figureheads, subject to red tape. I venture to say that there are twenty or thirty localities in which there are large numbers of applicants for letter-boxes, which could be erected at the cost of a few shillings, and return revenue at the rate of £ 1 per annum each. The boxes I have «in my mind were promised two years ago, and have not yet been supplied. First, I was England, and next that some were expected from Melbourne; and, as a matter of fact, I am not only ashamed to meet my constituents, but also ashamed to have to interPrecisely view the Postmaster-General on such small matters, when his mind ought to be devoted to business of much greater importance. As I say, I do not know whether all this arises, because the Deputy Postmasters-General have no control, or whether it is because they will not take the initiative ; but, at any rate, the administration of this Department is not nearlv so good as in the pre-Federation days. For instance, before we entered the Union, no guarantee of 10 per cent, was asked, but 5 per cent, was considered sufficient to cover interest and wear and tear. In some places, after the guarantee has been subscribed, the desired facilities are not afforded. Only",65,Brown Calare Tion This Treatment Of Rifle Clubs Is Not

Although scores of thousands of pounds may have to be spent in the cities no guarantee is asked for, whereas in the country the service must be shown to be a paying one, even, as I have said, in a case where the State Government has thought the district of sufficient importance to construct a railway.

I am not quite sure that the results from this line are so satisfactory as might be desired, but, at any rate, full information will be given at an early date. The honourable member for Calare, and the honourable member for Grey, have mv fullest sympathies as a'country member myself. It is highly desirable that country districts should have their requirements fairly considered. I found, however, when I assumed office, that certain practices and precedents had been laid down by my predecessors to the effect that certain facilities were not to be granted unless there was some proof or evidence that they would pay their way. I have only to repeat what I informed the honourable member for Corio recently that, for my part, I do not feel inclined to be bound by previous practices, but I cannot take the responsibility of reversing them without consulting my colleagues, especially on questions of expenditure on works which may involve loss of revenue. I do intend to consult my colleagues as to whether it is not desirable to establish a new rule that postal, telephonic, and telegraphic extensions in country districts shall be provided, even in cases where they will not t pay. In such cases Parliament might be asked to make a special provision so that the Postal Department will not be charged with the loss. At any rate, I undertake I know scores of to bring this matter under the notice of my colleagues. would the Minister charge the loss? it, perhaps, to the Consolidated Revenue,, but it is a matter that will require discussion. I can only say that the representations of the honourable members for Grey and Calare have my warmest sympathy, and, so far as I can help in the matters referred to, I shall be prepared to. do so.

The Treasurer might give the Committee some information upon the proposed vote of £20,000 for refunds of revenue, and also upon the proposed vote of £100,000 advance to the Treasurer. The last sum has generally been considered sufficient to cover six months; but I have discovered that the Treasurer has sometimes Been granted more than £200,000 'towards hisadvance account, by means of these Supply Bills.
