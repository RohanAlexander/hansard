Before progress was reported last night, I was dealing with the assertion of representatives of the State of Queensland that white men can work in the cane-fields there as well as black men, and I stated that, if that be so, there is no need for the expenditure of public money to provide bounties for the encouragement of white labour. I added, however, that the experience which I had gained by a visit to Queensland some time ago, and in other ways, had led me to believe that climatic conditions there are entirely against the employment of white men, because of the exhausting heat caused by the vertical rays of the sun during many weeks of the sea-: son. this heat is a physical fact which cannot be denied. of cane, it is said by some that' it is necessary, and by others that it is not, but. the truth seems to be that everything depends on the district. Tn the Burdekin district, for instance, it would injure the cane to trash it, but in districts where the. rainfall is more copious, the cane must be trashed, or the moisture will reduce its sugar contents. Last session a planter from Queensland waited upon me here to know if the bounty would be extended. I told him that I was opposed to this extension, b.ut that I thought it would be agreed to. I then asked him if white men could' cultivate cane in Queensland, and he replied "" Yes."" I asked him if he had registered his plantation as one on which only white labour would be employed; and he again said ""Yes""; but when I questioned him on his success he said-, "" I have succeeded with white labour up to the cutting of the cane, though I have had to get black labour to cut it . "" I asked this gentleman how it was that he had not continued to employ white labour and he .replied that he could not get the men-. I then suggested that that proved that white men could not perform fhe work, but he said that if the planters could get the right, class of men, white labour would meet the case. He then explained that he meant sober, steady, industrious men, who were not afraid of a day's work. I asked him Whether he thought' that men of that class would go into the cane-fields to cut cane, when other work, such as shearing, was available to them. that part of Queensland? You might as land there is shearing to be done at about that time .of the year. We know that shearers start from the Queensland stations, and work their way right down through New South Wales, as far south as Victoria. months to travel from the sugar plantations to the shearing sheds; utterly impossible for the honourable member to continue h:s speech if continuous interruptions take place.

14,"Mr Lonsdale,","T p the summerthought it was possible to obtain a sufficient number of men of the proper class to cut the cane, at that particular season of the year. He could not give me a satisfactory reply. I then asked him whether he knew anything about Hood's gang, and he stated that he knew them well, as they had been working in his district. These men were reported to have done their work well right through the season. They had earned a large amount of money, and had satisfied both the growers and the mill managers. The gentleman to whom I have referred said that they were the right class of men. Thev were the sons of farmers, strong, sturdy, temperate men, and were prepared to do a good day's work, and as a consequence did well. I asked this gentleman whether he could tell me how many of the men who started with the gang remained with it at the end of the season, and he replied that about one-third had stuck to the work. That seemed to me to afford absolute proof that white men could not successfully carry on the work in the canefields. Here were men, admitted to be of the right class, who were both willing and able to perform the work for a certain time, and yet two-thirds of them dropped out, because they were not able to continue it. member's informant say that those men were not capable of continuing the work? own conclusions. My informant did not say that two-thirds of the men fell out because they were not able to do the work; but I contend that, in view of the fact that they had been able to earn a large amount of money, they would have continued the work if they had not found it too much for them. I do not see how any stronger proof could be adduced of the fact that there-is something which prevents this work from being carried on by white labour. member any objection to give the name of his informant? the name, but I will wire to my son at Townsville, and obtain it, if required. have referred was a sugar planter, and I think his name was Crawford. I have had interviews with sugar planters, who declared that they had been prepared to employ white labour exclusively. One employer said, "" I started operations with the definite idea that I would not employ a coloured man upon my plantation. The first week the men engaged were all white, the second they were of a piebald character, and the third they were all black."" In other word's, the first week the employees consisted wholly of white men, the second they comprised white and coloured men, and the third week they were all coloured. I met with innumerable instances of that kind. I do not make any charge against the white man. I say that the sugar industry is one in which he cannot work successfully. The very conditions of the country are against him. When we offer a bonus of £ 2 per ton to encourage the production of sugar bywhite labour, we are endeavouring to fight against natural conditions, and those conditions will always defeat us. I say that if we can assist to continue that industry in Queensland it will be a splendid thing. But this House has decided that the Kanakas employed there shall be deported to their homes at the end of their engagements. From my stand-point, that was not a wise decision. I say at once that it would have been much better if we bad resolved that no further Kanakas should be recruited, but that those who were alreadv in Queensland should be allowed to remain there and to die out. Eveni f white labour can be sucD i d the honourable cessfully employed in the cane-fields, we must allow time to effect a. transition from black to white labour conditions. In order to carry out that change upon humane lines, the Government should not enforce the deportation conditions, and, if necessary, those conditions should be altered. We are accustomed to say that we are superior to the black race. But let us prove our superiority. Why, in all our actions, we are practically proclaiming to the world that we are not equal to the coloured races. In my district I have repeatedly declared that I am equal to any six black men. I make that statement deliberately, and I am prepared to meet them in open competition in any occupation in which the natural conditions are suited lo white men like myself. I contend that we should exhibit our superiority. As we are I do not remember strong, let us be merciful. Possessing the power that we do over these men, let us show our humanity to them by tempering The gentleman to whom I justice with mercy.

He declares that the Kanakas were recruited upon the understanding that they should be returned to their homes at' the end of their agreements. But I would point out that some of them may not desire to go back to their islands. I claim that if any of them wish to remain we should not insist upon their deportation; if , on the contrary, they desire to be returned to their homes their wish should be respected. Personally, I should not allow them to be recruited in the future. I do not believe in this semi-slavery business. Therefore, in the interests of the black race's themselves, I should forbid recruiting. with this question, because I regard it as a very important one,and I do not think that we should take any steps which would be calculated to injure the sugar industry. On the contrary, we should do what we can to encourage its growth.

The moment we obtained command of our market and commenced to export, I would reduce the import duty. I would do that because otherwise a great advantage would be conferred upon the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. When I made that statement last night some honourable members laughed at me. They do not understand this question. I stated that I objected to paying a tax in order to make commodities dearer for myself and cheaper for the ""other fellow."" I will not be a party totaxing the whole of the people of the Commonwealth in order to make sugar dear to them ancl cheap to the man outside. That would be the action of an idiot. Once our production is sufficient to satisfy I have dealt somewhat f u l l y local consumption, and we are becoming exporters, we should begin to take off the duties. Coming to the question of the Braddon blot, I wish to say that I am against the extension of that provision. I fully realize that the States require to be protected as well as the Commonwealth, but the system under which we are now acting is such that the financial arrangements of the Commonwealth are very seriously trammelled. It seems to me that the Commonwealth is to-day little more than a great In the north less revenue-producing machine for the States. When the Commonwealth Constitution B ill I think that the was before the people, I-perhap s in my foolishness, as some will say-oppose d it , and did all I could to induce the people of New South Wales to vote against its adoption. One of the strong points that I then made against it was that it contained the Braddon blot, which, I urged, would limit I say that by the the power of the Commonwealth in every direction. That statement has been f u l l y justified by our experience. I have often advocated that it would be better to have some such system as that for which provision is made in the Constitution of the Dominion",14,Budget

32,Mr Lonsdale,"If I had my way Iof Canadaa system under which the finances of the States would be protected to the extent of the revenue they are at present receiving, while the Commonwealth would be entirely free in respect of the disposition of the balance. If the States required any additional revenue, they would then have to raise it for themselves, instead of coming to the Commonwealth to obtain it. Under the provisions of the Braddon blot, we cando absolutely nothing towards extending the functions of the Commonwealth in matters involving expenditure, unless we impose direct taxation. I am a believer in a certain form of direct taxation, but hold that it should be imposed by the States themselves. We have the control of the Customs and Excise revenue, and all the revenue that we require' should be secured by means, not of a protectionist, but of a revenue Tariff. The States should be allowed to secure their own revenue in their own way. Under the Constitution as it stands, if we attempt any extension of the functions of the Commonwealth requiring increased revenue, it is necessary for us to raise four times as much as we actually require for that purpose. By means of an income tax and a land tax, we should be able to at once raise what we required for ourselves, and there would be no necessity to return any proportion of the revenue so obtained to the several States. I do not'think the Commonwealth should be restricted in its financial operations, as it is at the present time. It should be free, in this respect, to take any course it pleases, and should not be controlled in any way by the States. There are some honourable members who seem to imagine that we are here to represent the separate States. As a matter of fact, however, we are here to represent, not any one State in particular, but the Commonwealth as a whole, and we snould not allow a consideration of State divisions to in any way control our decisions. should be our desire to do that which is best calculated to promote the interests of the whole Commonwealth. I should prefer to see a fixed amount given to the States. That is the course adopted by the Dominion of Canada. Under its Constitution the Dominion took over, with' the exception of a small amount, the debts of the provinces, subject to the condition that if the debts taken over from any one province exceeded the amount mentioned in the Constitution, that province should pay fo the Dominion the interest on the difference. In addition to this, the Dominion gave the provinces a fixed endowment, as well as an endowment of 80 cents, per head of the population, as fixed by the census of 1861. It was further provided that, so far as the smaller States, such as Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick, were concerned, they should'also receive an endowment of 80 cents, per head of their population until that population reached 400,000, after which they would receive no further increase. Whatever may have been said by the eminent men who framed our Constitution as to the practicability or otherwise of applying, this scheme to the Australian Federation, I am still under the impression that we could have arranged some such! system, and that it would have obviated the difficulties that have arisen. In connection with the consideration of the Braddon blot, the question of the taking over of the debts of the States naturally arises. I should favour the taking over of the whole of the debts, but if we cannot do that, we should take over from each a proportion, the interest on which would be met by the revenue returnable to that State. If that course were adopted, we should be entirely free from the States for all time, so far as our finances were concerned. A good deal has been said in reference to this question. I favour the suggestion which has been made by the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne that instead of taking over the railway revenues of the States, as advocated by the right honourable member for Balaclava, if the whole of the debts are taken over, the Constitution should be so altered as to provide that special Acts shall be passed by the States permanently appropriating the proportion of their revenue necessary to meet the interest! payable on the debts taken over. These would be special appropriations, and with such a provision It in the Constitution it would not be necessary for the States to vote the money every year. If the payment of interest were secured in that way, nothing further would be required. I hold that for the present at all events the Commonwealth should not interfere in any way with the railway systems of the States. The question of what pontrol should be exercised over States borrowings is one of great difficulty upon which the States themselves are disposed to be very touchy. The honourable member for Kooyong advocates the establishment of a Board of Advice, consisting probably of the Treasurer of each State and the Treasurer of the Commonwealth, which would deal with all 'loan proposals on the part of the Commonwealth or the States. We should seek to so guide the States that they will not borrow as largely as they have done; but if they desire to do so. we should not restrict their powers in this respect. There' are certain matters in connection with this subject that demand very close attention. should effect considerable saving by the conversion of the States debts; but many of the statements that have been made on this subject will not bear investigation. It would be impossible to bring about any large conversion except as the loans fell due. If it were known that we had a sinking fund, out of which we could buy up our stocks as they came into the market, the result would naturally be to keep up the price. We should not reap any benefit from such a system, unless in consequence of. great finanthan New South Wales stock gave it a cial depression the price of our stocks went down. enter the market and buy them up; but I feel that the knowledge that we should be purchasers in ordinary circumstances would keep them from going down. I have read a good deal by different gentlemen on the question of conversion. I do not profess to be a,very great financial expert; but I have tried to familiarize myself with the question, and I am quite satisfied that there can be no extensive system of conversion aiid that the conversion from State to Commonwealth stock would have to be made as the loans fall due. Any saving of interest which might be effected by the conversion should go to the credit of the State whose stock was converted.. It is said' that Commonwealth stock would command a higher value than State stock. But that, I think, is imaginary; the belief has no foundation. The idea is, I know, endorsed by big names. My name is, I suppose, only a little one in the financial world, but I am satisfied that if these things are examined carefully, it will be realized that there are innumerable causes which affect the value of stock. One of these causes is the question as to whether the affairs of the State are being conducted economically by its Government. Then, when a depression comes about-we know not why, sometimes -it affects the price of stock. So that we must come to the conclusion that, .whether he is dealing in Commonwealth or State stock, the investor is governed simply by Mr Lonsdale. the way in which the affairs of the Commonwealth or State are being conducted, and by no other consideration. The Commonwealth could not give investors greater security for Federal stock than they have to-day for State stock. During the contest on the acceptance of the Constitution Bill, ii. was continually urged that the Commonwealth would make a great profit out of the conIt has been said that we version of the States' debts. I looked up the matter, and obtained some particulars which I shall quote, to show how little dependence is to be placed upon such statements. The figures relate to stocks of the same class, though there is a difference in the rate of interest, and the currency of the stock. In June, 1892, New South Wales per cents., with thirty-two years to run, stood at £ 9 6 19s., while Canadian three per cents., with forty-six years to run, stood at £ 9 3 17s. The fact that Canadian stock had fourteen years more to run higher value, and the fact that it paid one We might then be able to half per cent, interest less gave it a lower value, but still it stood at about £ 3 less than did the other. Victorian stock stood at about 16s. less than did New South Wales stock, although it bore the same rate of interest, and had the same currency. In 1893 the value of New South Wales stock had fallen from £ 9 6 to £ 9 2 , while that of Canadian stock had risen from £ 9 3 to £94. At that time Canada was federated, but Australia was not. Why did the value of New South Wales stock fall by £ 4 in that year,and that of Canadian stock rise by £ ? The reason was, because it was x a year of depression in our State. Canada did not feel that depression as we did, and therefore its stock continued to rise in value. In 1894 the value of New South Wales stock had risen from £ 9 2 to £ 9 8 . In the interval we were forced to have very economical government; no loans were floated, and because we kept off the loan market, the value of our stock rose. In the same year the value of Canadian stock rose by only £ 1 , while the value of New South Wales stock was £ 3 higher. Although Canada was a federation, stilf the stock of New South Wales stood £ $ higher than it did the year before, when it was £ 2 lower than the other. Will any one explain to me how Commonwealth stock could have a greater value in the market than State stock ? The fact that New South Wales was forced off the money market, and was practising economies, sent up the value of its stock. But when we come-to 1898, what do we find'? In that year the value of New South Wales stock had risen from £ 9 8 to £ 1 0 8 . In a period of four years the value of our stock had risen by J£ > L O but the value of dian stock had risen by only £ 6 . So that cause we belong to the Commonwealth? our stock stood £ 7 higher than did that No. Simply because the administration of of Canada, although the latter country was the Government is economical, because we much closer to the market. remembered that during those years in New living within our means.

We are seeking to improve the position of men by legislation-to make them happier and more prosperous by Act of Parliament. In no State has that policy been carried to such an extent as has been the case in Victoria. Here in every direction legislators have been seeking to coddle their people. The British race has grown to its present noble position, not through coddling by Parliaments, but by the inherent power and strength of individual men. If we are to rise as a nation by no other means can we do so. We must not take all the self-reliance out of our people, or we shall fail. Demands are made in every direction not to throw our people on to their own resources, so that they may be developed by their own strength, but to coddle them, to keep them swathed in bandages and flannels, and to shield them from the competition of the world. By this policy we are simply weakening the fibre of the race. We stand to-day a race of weaklings. Yet we presume to look down upon the coloured people with contempt. We affect to despise that little brown race which has just come victorious out of its great fight with what was thought to be the Colossus of the world.

I do not intend to go into details of the Budget; in fact, 1 had not intended to speak at all, and it was only yesterday evening that I thought I had, perhaps, better say a few words since my silence might be misconstrued. speaking to-day I am acting against the express orders of my doctor, who has told me not to take any"" part for the present in parliamentary business. Like most honourable members who have preceded me, I listened to the financial statement of the Treasurer with feelings of profound disappointment. .1 had thought that the right honourable gentleman would, at any rate, afford some indication of an intention on the part of the Government to deal with thei iarge and, important financial problems that confront this Parliament. In my opinion, there is no more important question' than that of the States debts, and I did think that the Treasurer would have announced the intention of the Government to deal with that matter in a 'practical way. Sir vernment, of which the honourable member was a member, not deal with the matter in the Budget statement last year? which I was a member advanced the matsuch a proposal, would have ter very considerably at the Conference I could not imagine which was held with the Premiers of the various States at Hobart; but the present Treasurer has not announced any intention on the part of his Government to takeadvantage of what was then done; on the contrary, the right honourable gentleman treats the question in a most perfunctorv manner, as if it were not of the slightest importance.

A t that time. I certainly I should now like to did not take the view presented by the present Prime Minister. I felt that any assets that would contribute to the credit of the Commonwealth would have to be extracted from the States; that there would be no new asset. I admit that at the present time the credit of the Commonwealth I might add that in should stand very much higher than that of any individual State, for the obvious reason that the revenues of the States have been largely diminished and impoverished, owing to the fact that the whole of the Customs and Excise revenue has been handedover to the Commonwealth. The States have nothing; but direct taxation on which to depend, and it is reasonable to assume that their credit must stand much lower than that of the Commonwealth at the present time, provided, of course, that the affairs of the Comnionwealth are managed in a proper, business-like manner. Yet no serious attempt whatever is being made, or, at any rate, no attempt is foreshadowed by the Treasurer in his Budget statementand that was the proper time-of any intention on the part of the Government to deal with this all-important matter in a practical JOHN FORREST -Why did the Gobusiness-like way.

Financial authorities agree, I think, that the weakest point in the Commonwealth Constitution is found in the defective provisions made in regard tofinance-in the extraordinary, and, in my opinion, unfair allocation of assets and liabilities, as between the Commonwealth and the States. The Commonwealth is endowed with the whole of the Customs and Excise revenue, and also with unlimited powers of direct taxation, with no responsibility whatever in regard to liabilities or interest charges. On the other hand, the States, whose only recourse is such direct taxation as the people can bear in addition to any direct taxation which the Commonwealth may impose, are left with the responsibility of providing fdr the redemption, of loans and It is true that the Convention did make temporary provision by means of the Braddon section to provide for the return to the States of three-fourths of the Customs revenue, the expenditure of the Commonwealth being limited to one-fourth.

As a protectionist I have been in favour of the payment of these bounties. I am always in favour of the State providing a reasonable sum to encourage any new industry, in order to tide it over its initial difficulties, provided that I am satisfied that when that has been done the industry will become self-supporting and valuable to the country. In this particular case, the bounties were not given for this purpose, but in order to compensate cane-growers for the loss of Kanaka labour. That seemed to be a legitimate policy to adopt, and I supported it. I quite agree that something further should be done in that direction, but I do not think that the burden should be a perpetual one on the taxpayers. I do not think it should continue for all time, and certainly the Government proposal is the first step towards making it perpetual.' When the Government renew these bounties for five years, without any reduction whatever in the amount, we know perfectly well that the next Government, in the face of the clamour of those interested, and the pressure that will be brought to bear on them, will do the same, and so the bounties will go on for all time. man tell us what was the policy of the late Government in respect to this matter? able gentleman wh'at my views were.

Yet we are told that the remedy for this state of things is that the Government should lead and control the House. The persons who are constantly giving the Prime Minister wholesale advice from outside ought to provide him with the ways and means. They ought to tell him how it is possible for a Government with twenty followers to control a House numbering seventy-five members. That is the primary problem which the purveyors of advice from outside ought to solve for the Prime Minister, and then he might be able to do what they wish him to do-to control the House as the leader of a strong majority ought to do. But, in the meantime, matters in the House must go from bad to worse, and our institutions must be degraded more and more in the eyes of rightthinking people outside. We are told that we are to have our privileges further curtailed, and that this is to be done on the initiation of the honourable member for Kennedy.

That its achievement is crippled by Standing Orders or other rules of procedure, a definite and decisive blow is struck at the very purpose of parliamentary government. Apropos of the charges of the leader of the Labour Party as to ""stone-walling,"" and as to the burking of ithe real business of the country, I point out that one of the great purposes of parliamentary discussion is to form and lead public opinion outside. We are not here merely as a registering machine, but exist as a deliberative Chamber; and it is our supreme obligation to inform and shape public opinion outside, as well as within these walls.

All I desire to do is to protest against both the tone and temper of this Chamber in regard to the conduct of public business, and, above all, in regard to a deliberate attempt which has been made to curtail the privileges of this House. That is my object in rising, and I shall make the protest when permitted to do so by the noisy members in the corner. And what has been the result of discussion in this Chamber? Onlv yesterday the Minister of Trade and Custom promised to submit substantial amendments in the CommerceB ill ; and that promise, I venture to say, is the result of the elucidation of the question on this side. elucidation on that side of the House. lightful statement from an honourable merfiber, who, only the other night, promised the Opposition that he would submit amendments. Sir WILLIAM LYNE the Opposition anything of the kind. which the Minister of Trade and Customs will eat his own words in twenty-four hours is remarkable. The result of the discussions which have taken place in this House up to date has been of the most beneficial character, having regard to the interests of the people at large. The Minister of Trade and Customs may sneeir as he likes, but he never debated a subject in his life-h e never could rise to the necessary intellectual plane. All he can do is to sit and sneer and jeer at honourable members who do debate the questions before us; but the Minister may keep his jeers to himself, for I shall not tolerate them. I propose to conclude my remarks in a very few minutes. I regret that, owing to many interruptions, they have occupied very nearly an hour. I did not purpose, when rising, to claim the attention of the Committee for more than a sufficient time to enable me to make a protest against the on-coming of what I believe to be a violation of our parliamentary privileges. Under the circumstances, there Having made that protest, I do not desire to occupy the time of the Committee any grievances, that"" having been acfurther. I shall be very glad indeed if my remarks constitute the whole of the observations on the subject from this side of the Chamber at this stage. My point, to put it briefly, is that if these newspaper reports be true, and I believe there is every reason to assume that they are accurate in almost every particular, we are faced with a very serious state of affairs. The proposal is one to still further centralize the government of the country, and I say that the present Government, of all Governments, has no mandate to make any attack upon our parliamentary privileges. It is only a strong Government, possessing the complete confid'ence of the country, and consisting of a homogeneous party, that may begin to assail the privileges of Parliament; certainly not a Government which comprises a party of less than one-third of the members of the House. In a condition of affairs like the present, we require more, and not fewer, parliamentary checks on the operations of a Government which represents only a minority of the House. The primary purpose of the institution of these checks is to preserve the privileges of minorities, but certainly not to 1 pfovide a minority with instruments of oppression and coercion when they may happen to be in power. I say that the preI did not promise sent Government has no authority from the country, and no constitutional authority of any kind, to whittle away the powers of. Parliament.

So far as I am concerned, I shall resist to the utmost of my power any proposal by this Government to curtail the rights of this Chamber, or the privileges which honourable members enjoy. External Affairs) -It is not for me to determine the purpose or profit of the speech to which the Committee has just listened. The pretext put forward most frequently for its deliverance was the promotion of the serious business of Parliament. I ask in truth what serious business could be assisted by it? So far as it related to anything, it discussed two proposals which the honourable member for Parramatta believes will be made to the House, one involving the resignation of an honourable member of the Standing .Orders Committee, and the other the possible submission of a new standing ordfer to the House. proposal can be advanced or retarded until submitted to the House for decision, so that in any case nothing will have been gained by the present debate. On the contrary, time has been absolutely lost by the speech to which we have just listened. Parliament, as the honourable member suggested, is a great and complex machine. But it was framed long ago, and works to-day under conditions which render every legislative body in the world incapable of transacting its business unless it takes measures to provide against abuse of the powers of individual members. With us a member physically strong enough could occupy with his speeches the greater part of every sitting throughout an entire session, to the"" curtailment of the rights and opportunities of all his fellow-members, and the deprivation of all the constituencies other than his own of their due representation. The rights of the House are sacrificed to and by one member, whenever a speech is made, not bona fide for the advancement of the business of the country, but to discredit Ministers, the Parliament, or a party, or to serve some personal end. Such conduct is always unpatriotic, disloyal to Parliament, and harmful to parliamentary institutions. The parliamentary machine, like many other magnificent pieces of machinery, if injured in a slight and apparently insignificant part, may temporarily, at all events, I have already be paralyzed. Honourable members have only to discuss to-day what cannot be done until to-morrow, or what ought £0 have been done yesterday, and year after year may go by without the enactment of a single piece of legislation. They have but to insist always on' considering that matter of most importance which is not regularly before the House, and cannot then be dealt with, or dealt with only in an unsatisfactory and incomplete fashion, to absolutely destroy its usefulness. advice ? sion. and are told that it is a conspiracy of silence; if we speak, that we provoke discussion.

I am not going to discuss to-day what I shall probably have to discuss next week, or at all events very Neither soon, because to do so would be to pursue the course which I am condemning. The speech of the honourable member for Parramatta was merely the ebullition of his personal feeling, profitless to those who listened to it , and without a tittle of advantage to the business before us. He cannot pretend that anything he said during more than an hour will advance in the slightest degree either of the proposals with which he dealt.

I would also remind the readers of Dickens that when that functionary himself was to be executed, he suffered even a greater collapse than did the Treasurer when he had to leave office. When he was taunted by a fellow criminal with inconsistency, and was reminded that he had been accustomed to declare that it was rather a jolly thing to be executed, he replied"" I ain't inconsistent. I was the hangman then. If I were the hangman now, I would say the same thing again."" Similarly, if the right honourable member for Swan were in opposition, he would say of our friends in the Labour corner what he said of them last year when he was in opposition. But coming to a more serious aspect of the matter, even at the risk of being accused of snivelling, I have no hesitation in saying that the present position of affairs in this Parliament is one of the most grave that I can possibly conceive. I have not the slightest objection to any of my honourable friends upon the Treasury bench. of honourable members behind them, holding the same views as themselves, they would have my support. Eveni f my honourable friends in the Labour corner occupied the _ Treasury bench, I should not consider that the position was so serious, because, they would then be saddled with responsibility in proportion to their power. But what I consider threatens the best interests of the country, is the fact that the honourable members who occupy the corner benches-toward s every , one of whom I 1 entertain nothing but the most friendly feelings-posses s supreme powejr without any responsibility whatever. I venture to say that if they were in office they would not attempt-and even if they did, they would not succeed-to pass some of the legislation which has been taken up by the present Government at their dictation. does the honourable member refer? MrM c LEAN If the right honourable gentleman will restrain his youthful impetuosity I will tell him. I have already pointed out the serious consequences which will ensue if we allow the Braddon section of our Constitution to lapse before any provision is made for taking over the States debts, and thus hypothecating the large revenue of the Commonwealth.

MrM c LEAN If that clause be carried it will create a condition of things in Australia bordering upon civil war, and will stop very little short of that if it stops short at all. Again, in the Manufactures Encouragement Bill members of the Labour Party are not content with a measure which was framed in the interests of the whole people, and more particularly in the interests of the workers. They are not satisfied with the B ill , which was brought down by the right honourable member for AdeI f they had a sufficient number laide, who is one of the best friends of labour that Australia possesses. Instead, they have compelled the Government to insert in that measure a special clause conferring special . privileges upon the class which they represent. These are important provisions which have been inserted at the dictation of my honourable friends in the Labour corner, and which are probably indicative of many others to come. The present position of the Government reminds me very forcibly of a mine which is being worked upon tribute. Honourable members know that when mine-owners are unable to work a mine or are unwilling to risk their capita] in it, they frequently let it upon tribute. That is to say, the persons who work it give them a proportion of fhe gold which they derive from it. My honourable friends who occupy the corner benches are not now in power. To their credit, be it said, they place the interests of those who sent them here, before their own personal interests. They are content to allow the Government the prestige and emoluments of office provided that the latter do their work for them. In other words, the Ministry are carrying on the government of the Commonwealth upon a system of tribute. In effect they say to members of the Labour Party, "" If you will'keep us in office we will do your work.

He knows that a former Government of which he was a member accepted a clause in the Immigration Restriction Bill which prevents unskilled labour from coming into Australia under contract. There was another clause in the same Bill which prevented any person coming in who might be a charge upon the Commonwealth. was in favour of that. MrM c LEAN not an unusual provision ; but I was bitterly opposed to the first-named clause. I was prepared to concede that which the honourable member for Bland first said he desired to get. If he desired only to prevent men being brought into the country to take the place of others on strike, I should go with him so far as was necessary to guard against such a contingency; or if he said that the desire of his party was merely to prevent men coming into the country to accept lower rates of wages than those prevailing in Australia, or to remove any other disability, I should also be with him. meet the honourable member. conditions, I say that to prevent a man coming into the Commonwealth under contract is really to prevent immigration.

MrM c LEAN H a d we remained in office we should have referred it to the country. We could not hope to repeal it in a House that was largely committed to the principle.

So far, criticism of it has come solely from this side of the Chamber. The matter is one of such moment ithat it should be thoroughly and carefully considered. There are a few matters on which I should have liked the Treasurer to give us a little more light. For instance, on the first page we find agricultural products coupled with groceries. I should have preferred the right honourable gentleman to separate the items, and"" let us know exactly what revenue he expects to receive from the duties on agricultural produce. When agricultural produce is coupled with groceries in the Budget, we cannot form an idea as to what quantity of the former is coming into the Commonwealth. We know that from New Zealand we receive oats and other articles. I should like to know what trade in agricultural produce it is doing with Australia. I notice that the great bulk of the criticism from this side has been directed against the sugar bounty. This is one matter in respect to which the Ministry has defined its attitude. It intends to extend the sugar bounty for a period of five years. I sympathize with the interjection of the honorable member for Maranoa, that the Kanakas came here under contract. The most trying time in the history of the sugar industry will be at the end of 1906, when the Kanakas will be deported. In my opinion I went to the Minister the Government is justified in extending the bounty for a period of five years. are employed in New South Wales? to say that in New South Wales the farmers are able to grow sugar with white labour, although I understand that some 2,000 acres are being cultivated with black labour.

If we believe in the policy of a. White Australia, we have a perfect right to show (our loyalty by giving this bounty to the farmers, so long as a black man is employed in the sugar industry at wages lower than those paid to white men. ber would perpetuate the bounty as long as a black man was employed? the period of five years there will be an over-production of sugar, both the bounty and the FJxcise duty will become things of the past, and the industry, will have to compete with the sugar grown by black labour elsewhere. That is a point which we ought to remember. The revenue from the import duty on sugar is about ,£90,000 a year. A representative of Victoria was crying out the other day that it is receiving ,£100,000 a year less from sugar duties than it did under its old Tariff. That is one of the results of Federation. Victoria has not cried out about the way in which she is flooding the markets of other States, such as Queensland and Tasmania, with the products of its factories built up by means of protective duties. The estimated revenue from the Customs duty on sugar this year is ,£90,000. the years roll on the revenue from this source gets smaller and smaller, and the time is very near when the import duty of £ 6 a ton will be inoperative. When that time arrives, there will be no necessity for granting a bounty, and the Excise duty will have to go, because it would be unfair to ask for Excise duty when the import duty was inoperative. Our sugar-growers will then have to face the markets of the world. When the honourable member for New England' was speaking with much warmth about the employment of coloured labour, he forgot to mention that the Treasurer will receive ,£514,500 from the Excise duty on sugar. If we deduct the bountv of .£146.000 Ave shall get a balance of ,£368,500. Despite the Treasurer's brilliant account of the resources of this country, which we know are very great, the revenue is growing smaller and smaller every year. I notice that the estimated revenue for this year is -£357>9 ° less than the actual revenue for 2 the previous year. If the bounty be abolished Budget. [REPRESENTATIVES.] Budget. the Excise duty will have to be repealed, and that represents a sum of .£368,500 more than what the bountv cost. In that case, the Commonwealth will return to the States ,£726,420 less than it did in the previous year. We should consider very seriously how the revenue will be affected. I agree with the remarks of the honourable member for Gippsland on this subject. I can see that his idea regarding the bounty is a very good one, because it is only a matter of time when both the bounty and the Excise duty will vanish, and, owing to the large production, sugar-growers will have I would not, because during to compete in the markets of the world. I am sorry to see that the Treasurer is asking for such a small sum for the purposes of defence. When we Come to consider how extensive iand wealtihy Australia is, and what it has done for its people, I think we should be prepared to vote money for defending its shores. The sum placed on the Estimates is not adequate for that purpose. The Treasurer had no warrant for saying that he could not get more money voted, because we shall return to the States ,£400,000 more than we are obliged to. He would have been quite justified in asking for a larger vote for the military service. I take a very deep interest in the rifle clubs. The members of rifle clubs are not paid for their services, but they have sufficient patriotism to take up arms and devote a great deal of leisure to training. As When the Government find a class of men willing to bear arms in this way, the very least it should do is to give them a little encouragement. The paltry sum of ^£600, which is set down for rifle clubs, in New South Wales, is altogether inadequate. That sum will be required to put some of the ranges in proper order. All that the military authorities-whom . I propose to discuss when the military estimates are submitted-thin k they have to do is to put down a range, no matter how it is constituted, and give the men a target. They seem to think that that is good enough for the people in the country. In Kempsey, where there is a splendid rifle club, a range has been formed. I was there a few months ago. There are logs across the range, and it is impossible to lie upon the mounds for firing purposes. Furthermore, a rifleman has to wait two and a half hours for a shot. That is how the military spirit is being encouraged in this country. Instead of £ 6 0 0 , the Government would be justified in giving",38,Budget

Its condition is simply disgraceful. The Victorian Rifle Association has to find all the money to keep that range in order, without receiving one fraction from the Commonwealth. It is time these matters were looked into. New South Wales is .£169,736. amount for the permanent forces is ,£70,766.

Some time ago efforts were made to establish an artillery battery on the Clarence River. We have no means of defence between Newcastle and Brisbane. Men were willing to give their services, but they were refused because it was said we could not afford the expense. Yet the Treasurer proposes to give back to the States ,£400,000 more than the three-fourths which we are obliged to pay back to them. I consider that the Government ought to be more liberal in dealing with the defence of the country. higher paid officers are properly treated; but I am speaking in the interests of the rank and file-the men to whom we shall have to look if ever the time comes when we shall have to defend our shores.

I venture [64] to say that the time which has been spent in this debate has been well employed. In the States Parliaments, Budget debates are protracted to a much greater extent than ours has been. In New South Wales, Budgets have been discussed for three weeks. In all the States, such debates are lengthy. We have to consider the affairs of six States. I think that the The military vote for time has been well spent, and that the The Government have no cause of complaint. In criticising these matters we, who are members of the Opposition, think that we have only done our duty, and we intend to No efforts seem to be continue to do it fearlessly. We are determined to criticise wherever we think criticism is necessary, and in so doing we believe that we shall be acting in the best interests of our States and of the Commonwealth. honourable the Treasurer has come in for a good deal of criticism in regard to his first Budget. It was not, I think, to be expected that, coming into office suddenly, as he did, he would be able to follow in the footsteps of the ex-Treasurer in displaying the facility for handling the figures No doubt the of the Commonwealth that the right honourable member for Balaclava has always shown. I have heard that it takes three generations to make a Lombardy olive-pruner; and I should say that it would require several attempts for any one to excel, as the late Treasurer did, in bringing forward his account of the financial affairs of the Commonwealth. We have had a great mass of figures /put ibefore us. It 'iappears to me that the details are too numerous. To establish at once a close connection between the speech of the Minister delivering the Budget and the mass of figures presented in the papers, must involve a great deal of work. In fact, the right honourable gentleman, in the position which he occupies, reminds me of a story of Mark Twain, related in his Innocents at Home.

Some people seem to think that that gentleman introduced more matter than was necessary, having regard to his former position as Minister of Defence; but it is not always that we have the advantage of hearing a gentleman who can speak, not only as an ex-Minister, but also to a limited extent I do not wish to flatter him by saying more-as an expert. I agree with the honourable and learned member as to the expenditure that is necessary, because I think that up to the present we have been rather playing with the question.

344,Mr Skene,"That is so. The conago,, men in Melbourne engaged in business, and making a little money, were nearly all under the impression that they must have a landed estate somewhere. Their competition for land had then to be taken into account, but it has since entirely disappeared, and a cash purchaser for a large landed estate is hardly to be found in ""Victoria at the present time. The State Government is now practically the only cash purchaser for these properties. One great advantage which has followed the many discussions of the subject is that the State Government, instead of asking land-owners to take Government debentures for their land, now offer hard cash for it, and in this way they are in a position to buy land cheaper than any one else. If the people in the old country were made to realize what can be done in this way, I believe we -should have many of them coming here. I am glad to see that a movement in this direction has already been made by Mr Referring again tp. Switzerland, it has ocTaverner, the Agent-General for 'Victoria. He has written to the State Government, suggesting the placing at his disposal of some areas of land to'assist him in inducing families in fhe old country to take advantage of the new scheme. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -A t any would help to keep those we have here. ing those we have here. I do not say that it would follow that labourers could not be introduced from the old country under this scheme, but I am afraid that the Immigration Restriction Act would not be found to work well in conjunction with ""the scheme. But for the operation of that Act, I believe that under such a scheme farmers corning to Australia from the old country with a little capital would be able to introduce a number of labourers who would, be glad to eome out, if they knew that when here ttiey could find work on the farms of men with whom they were acquainted in the old country. the value of land under the ""Victorian scheme ? limitation is £,i,$oo in value; but I am under the impression that the members of the Land Purchase Board are satisfied that in some parts of the country that is not a sufficiently high amount, and I should not be surprised tp see it increased to ,£2,000. However, that is a matter pf detail, and I have referred to the general principle. I dp not propose to touch pn the question of the transfer of States debts. Many schemes pn the subject have been put before us, and while I have not any of my own to suggest, I say that the question is one which should be tackled, as early as possible. The longer -its settlement is delayed the greater will be the 'difficulty, and some reasonable scheme should be brought into operation as soon as ppssible. A matter that has not, so far, been touched upon is that of the control of the railways. I think it is probable that this will be found to be even a more troublesome question than that pf the transfer of States debts. Speaking for Victoria, I am able tp say that there is a strong disposition in this State to believe that it would be practically imppssible fpr the Federal Gpvernment to manage the railways. I am of ppinion that the railways pf Australia cannet be properly managed from one centre. curred to me, withput goingfurther, than the puter edge pf the subject, that the adoption pf another of their methods might probably assist us. While the legislative powers pf the Swiss Federal Government are very large, its administrative powers are net so great, being left, to the Cantons. rate, it The feeling in Victoria is very strongly against the taking over pf the railways by the Cpmrnbnwealth, but I do not think we shall have full and effective Federation until we have taken pver, not only the debts.pf the States, but the railways; and possibly we might adopt to our mutual advantage a system under which the financing of the railways would be left to the Commonwealth, and their administration to the States as at present. I shall not : anticipate the report of the Old-Age Pensions Commission, but, no doubt, the subject into which it is inquiring is one which we shall have to consider very clpsely from several points of view.. I think that something might be done by the encouragement of thrift in the cpmmunity to make, the public burden, less than it would ptherwise be. I have referred to the English berlain's suggestipn. that individual contributions to benefit or insurance societies might be supplemented by Government grants of equal amount on the individual attaining the age of sixty, or sixty-five years.

349,A Mr Luard,"Pattison, whp was secretaryof Canada, and. is now manager for Lord Iveagh, who has done so much for the better housing of the poor in England, from whom I obtained some very interest ing information on this subject. Unfortunately, he was on the p o t ° leaving in { .Australia, so that I could not get him to give evidence before the Royal Commission ; but he told me that in ' 1.896, or in 1897, he wrote a letter to the Times, headed "" A Voluntary Old-age System,"" in. which he suggested a certain method for assisting people to' provide for their old age. I have looked through Palmer's Guide to ihe Times,. and . have been helped by the Parliamentary Librarian, but I have not been able to find the letter. Speaking from memorv, the system as described to me by Mr Pattison. was that, when any person had been in the employment of another for a period of a year, and had contributed to a sick pay insurance fund for the same period, the employer should buy for himj by a contribution of an equal amount, to an insurance or benefit society, or in some-similar way, a portion of an annuity, lo mature at a certain age. If the workman went to a second employer, that employer aQ the end pf the year would have to do the same. These payments were not to be made to the wprkman himself, but to go to his credit, until, at the age of sixty pr sixtv-five, or whatever might be the time fixed uppn, the annuity would mature, and become payable: If we can encourage men to do something for themselves in their ypunger years, it will be of great assistance to the Commonwealth in decreasing the amount that would, be required fromi the Government for old-age pensions and charitable assistance, I do not propose to discuss now any of the other questions arising out pf the Budget, because I make it a rule to,, as far as possible, confine my remarks tp subjects which are not touched on by other honourable members.
