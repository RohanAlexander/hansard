The petition reads as followsWe, the undersigned, hardware, iron, .nnd timber merchants and distributors of galvanized irnn respectively ask'that whatever rate of duty may be levied on galvanized iron should be based on tbe tonnage thereof nnd not on its ad val. value. As the value of the different gauges of galvanized iron varies somewhat the latter method of fixing the duty is confusing to customers, and we consider it leaves an opening for fraud in relation to the invoice value thereof. It may perhaps strengthen our case to remind you that in all the States of the Commonwealth in the past the duty was always levied on the tonnage. Company Proprietary Limited, T.

Sir WILLIAM LYNE departmental officers to let me know what fixed duties would be equivalent to the ad valorem duties; and the information I received is that I have read to honourable members. The honourable member for Grey has said that the proposed fixed duties on the iron comprised in paragraph B are more than an equivalent for the ad valorem cluties. I point out that I must depend for information on the officers of the Department; I cannot be expected to go into mathematical calculations of this nature. I hope honourable members will not accuse me of submitting this amendment without notice, seeing that I received the information only on Saturday morning. If the fixed duties be made equivalent to the ad valorem duties, and the fixed duties are preferred by the importers, then no injury can be done to others.

Before we pass this item we are entitled to some information as to the Government attitudein reference to the position of this industry I under the Manufactures Encouragement Bill.

But as the duty will be so widespread in its incidence, and will affect so profoundly the primary industries of Australia and those who are engaged in building up the prosperity of the Commonwealth at such great cost to themselves and with so much deprivation of home comforts.

Is this industry, after the bounty has expired, to be left absolutely at the"" mercy of the Steel Trust of America, or are we to have in the Tariff a duty to come into operation in 1911 to prevent its absolute annihilation? Unless honourable members are very careful the industry will be at the .mercy of the Steel Trust of America, with its enormous capital, which has nearlv the whole industry in America, and desires to control these manufactures all over the world. the honourable member's own calculation, will amount to 30s. per ton. very much, having regard to the fact that it applies to galzanized iron to be made from native ore The object of the bounty is to encourage the galvanizing of iron produced from our native ore, and not merely of imported black iron.

If my contention be right the local manufacturer will enjoy an advantage of something like £ 5 per ton as a result of ihe bounty and the duty. It should not be forgotten that this is an article which is largely used throughout Australia.

One of the first requirements of a man who takes up a piece of land is galvanized iron. He may be able to get a few straight spars on his holding with which to construct the frame of the buildings he must erect, but he must have galvanized iron to complete them. in South Australia, 400,000 acres of land have been made available for settlement, and have been taken up. There is not a stone to be found on that land, and the residences, as well as the necessary outbuildings of the settlers, will have to be constructed of wood and iron. The duty proposed on this item would be a serious tax upon those people. ber suggests that we should not manufacture anything at all in Australia. be able to convince the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. If the honourable member were in England he would advocate a duty on grapes, in order that they might be grown in that country.

Under this Tariff duties are imposed upon Consequently the individual who almost everything they require-timber , iron, and the implements used on the farm. On the cheaper class of iron the duty works out at over 20 per cent., which, from my stand-point, is exorbitant. People livI think that I ing where stone or bricks can be easily obtained, largely escape the duty, and it beI take it that he will. comes a sectional tax and not a general tax. I recognise that there is something in the contention that there should 'be a difference between the duties imposed on corrugated TO the galvanizer, and on plain iron, and I think that 5 per cent., which .would represent about 15s. per ton, is a sufficient margin to provide for. The only reason advanced by the Chairman of the Tariff Commission for the duty recommended on corrugated iron is that certain works in South Australia have been closed down. The owner of these works had a few rollers with which he converted galvanized sheet into corrugated iron. . He claimed that because no difference was made in the duties between galvanized and corrugated iron under the old Tariff,, he was compelled to close down his works. For the information of the Chairman of the Commission I mav state that the owner The item is one which of the works is satisfied with a margin of from 15s. to £ 1 per ton between the duties on corrugated and on plain iron.

The Treasurer makes an excited and exciting speech, and calls on his protectionist friends to support the protectionist duty which he proposed, but when he used his arguments he was either not aware of the effect of his own Tariff, or else attempting to deceive the Committee. I would not accuse him of that. Sir so. did not understand the effect of his own Tariff. It is not a question of protection to the maker of iron from native ore at all, and. no protectionist can view it as such. cannot we make it? honourable member not know that under this Tariff black sheet-iron is coming in free? not the point. We are dealing with the Tariff as brought down by the Minister. It is the free black sheet-iron that competes with the maker from native ores. It is not proposed to give him protection against it, and yet the Minister excitedly calls on protectionists to assist him to preserve the industry of making iron from native ores. That industry is not affected at all by this duty. black sheet from which plain and corruI f the honourable gated galvanized iron is made comes in free under the Minister's own Tariff, and the enormous protection that the Minister now proposes is simply for galvanizing and corrugating. simple process? simple. When Division VI . A is put into I have just asked the force, there will be a duty of 12 per cent,1 on black sheet-iron, but at present there is none, although the Minister could ask that Division VI .

The enormous protection of ,£3 ios. and £ 3 a ton is all for the most simple processes of corrugating and galvanizing. processes that employ very little labour, and yet it is proposed to allow this euoimous extra cost to go on to the shoulders of the consumers of galvanized iron for the sake of that small industry.' member mean that the local man is going to charge so much more than the foreigner ? agreeing to the Treasurer's proposal, we should be giving him the opportunity to do so. We have never been so reckless yet-no t even the strongest protectionists enormously higher than is needed for the purposes of protection. By so doing we. should only give the opportunity to the roller or corrugator or tinner to charge much higher prices to the consumer. it is net imported, that way in the case of a simple process, because there is plenty of competition. enormous duty is proposed for revenue purposes, .the whole revenue will disappear It should not. under it . N.ot a ton will be brought in after a time, except as black sheet-iron. We shall not be doing justice to the people of Australia if we impose such terrific duties as the Minister proposes on these articles. The Minister has succeeded in carrying a proposal for a bounty of 10 per cent, to iron manufacturers. As soon as that bounty has operated and the industry is sufficiently started, the Treasurer will be able to put a duty of 1 2 per cent, 1 on black sheet-iron and other duties. on other iron goods. that, we shall never get it done.",20,Fowler Th E Committee Is Very Dis

I am sorry to have had to speak on this item. I had not intended to do so, but when the Treasurer makes a statement which is quite apart from the factsI do not say that he did it knowingly-that by imposing the duty which he proposes, we can protect the local manufacturer from iron ores, that statement must be refuted. The making of it by the Minister only causes debate on his own Tariff. proposal of the honourable member for Grev is ample for every purpose. It is even a protection for galvanizing and corrugating. The honourable member states"" that a. man,interested in a galvanizing mill in South Australia is perfectly satisfied with it. they are not satisfied, and he gave evidence here. that he would be satisfied with a margin of JS per cent. stand that the honourable member for Grey has the latest information on the point. If we impose such duties as the Treasurer proposes, for a reason which is no reason at all, because it is incorrect, upon the backs of the people of Australia, especially those in the back-blocks, and upon all the industries of Australia which use this iron largely, we shall be deserving of the reprobation of the public. Sir JOHN QUICK (Bendigo) [11.38]. I venture to think that it will be foundon f u l l consideration, that the ad valorem rate is preferable to the fixed duty. Sufficient 'grounds have not been made out by the petition or memorial signed by merchants in favour of changing the advalorem rate to a fixed rate. It may be a little more convenient in clearing goods out of the Customs, but that is not the point. The point is which method will result in securing the fairest duty and the most reasonable amount of protection. A fixed duty, whether of £ 3 or £ 3 ios. a ton, will operate equally upon small or inferior sizes or grades, as upon superior and more expensive sections and grades. I therefore do not think that a fixed [231]2 duty is a fair one, and that is the reason"" why the section of the Tariff Commission with which I ' was associated reported in favour of substituting an ad valorem rate for the old fixed rate. Consequently, I cannot support the Treasurer in the change which he proposes at the request of certain merchants. The plain black sheets from which the galvanized and corrugated sheets are made are admitted duty free. The Lithgow works received consideration by the granting of a bounty under the Manufac1 tures Encouragement B ill . A section of the Tariff Comimission, at the instigation of South Australian manufacturers, recommended certain duties; their recomThe mendations did not originate in Victoria. We were informed in South Australia that there three expensive plants for the corrugation of iron, each costing about ,£1,500, were put down under the old State Tariff, and those interested in the industry asked for a differentiation against corrugated and galvanized sheets. It was alleged that the corrugating industry was one of the strangled industries, and the Commissioners were of opinion that it should be restored to the position which it occupied under the South Australian Tariff. The three witnesses who were exI underamined on the subject were unanimous in the opinion that the Commonwealth duty, 15s. per ton, was insufficient for their protection against the importation of the cheap labour product of the Old World.' Mr Charles R. Morris, the representative of the English firm of Lysaght and Co., which makes galvanized and corrugated iron in the United Kingdom, said that the firm were not interested in the manufacture of flat sheet iron, or in galvanizing in Australia; but had found it convenient and economical to put down a plant for corrugating here, so as to enable them to satisfy themselves that the corrugated iron they supplied was sound and good. They had found that imported corrugated iron, when opened up, perhaps at some remote place in the interior, was occasionally faulty, and had to be returned to Adelaide at their expense. The old Commonwealth duty of 15s. per ton was equivalent to about 5 per cent, ad valorem, and the Tariff Commission recommended that the rate be increased to 15 per cent: ad valorem, which .would be equal to a fixed rate of £ 2 5s. a ton. I am prepared to vote either for 15 per cent, ad valorem, Or for the fixed rate of ,£2 5s:",21,William Lyne I Was Not Doing Here A S To Say That We Will Give A Duty

The Government are proposing in the General Tariff a rate of 25 per cent, ad valorem, o r £3 I 0 S P r ton, and in the Tariff for e the United Kingdom a rate of 20 per cent. ad valorem, or £ 3 per ton. proposed cluties, if agreed to, will fall most heavily upon the working classes, especially upon those who have to make homes for themselves in rural and mining districts. Galvanized iron is largely used for the building of cottages in country districts, where it is often impossible to get weatherboard or other suitable material, so that, not only the roofs, but the walls as well, are made of iron. This is especially the case in new mining settlements. Galvanized and corrugated ""iron is comparatively cheap building material, and for that reason, and because it is easy to deal with, it is very much in favour, and any action tending to make it dearer will cause the poorer classes of the community to suffer. The Treasurer, in an impassioned speech, spoke ot the terrible importations of the American Steel Trust. He had afterwards to admit that the figures which he quoted in this connection were wrong; but even had they been correct, they would not have supported his argument, because they showed that only a comparatively small portion of galvanized iron is imported from America. Nearly the whole of our importations of galvanized and corrugated iron come from the United Kingdom, whence we imported last year £1,033,118 worth, or 96.535 per cent, of the whole quantity brought here from abroad, while from the United States we got only £[36,780 worth, or about 3.440 per cent. Britain sends all the commodity here will not console us. my argument in the slightest degree. The Treasurer bases his appeal for support of this duty on his assertion that we have to protect our local people from the competition of this vast American Steel Trust, which he implied was dumping its wares upon Australian soil. figures, but he did not withdraw the implication. The total value of the importations from all countries outside Great Britain and the United States of America is 0 l l i y £ 1&Surely it is not worthwhile 2 to trouble about that. We have nothing to fear, so far as foreign countries are concerned, and according to the figures the Treasurer's impassioned appeal to his protectionist .friends to resist the encroachments of the American Steel Trust falls to the ground. With regard to plain iron, we import from the United Kingdom £111,998 worth, equal to 55.98 per cent.; from Belgium, £18,705 worth; from Germany, ^45)956 worth; and from the United States of America, only £22,301 worth. The imports from Belgium, Germany, and the United States of America, represent only 44.2 per cent. of the total importations, while from all other countries we import only £[1,074 worth. It will be seen that the duty is really directed against British importations, and that its value as a protective duty is not worth talking about. preference come in? ence at all, because we already receive from Great Britain 96 per cent, of 1 our total importations without any preference. When we come to compare the proposed duties with the old duties, what do we find? As regards corrugated galvanized iron, 26-gauge, the f.o.b. value of which is £[15 a ton, under the old Tariff the duty was 159., but under this Tariff the duty in the general column is equivalent, not to £ 3 ios.; as the Treasurer said, but to £ 3 12s. 6d. iron is continually fluctuating, those figures are no guide. to take the figures subject to fluctuations; but the proportions will remain about the same. Under the new Tariff the duty on corrugated galvanized iron from the United Kingdom is equivalent to £ 3 7s. 6d. As regards corrugated iron, not galvanized 26-gauge, the f.o.b. value of which is .£10, under the old Tariff it was free, but under the new Tariff the duty is equivalent to 44s. in the general column, and 33s. in the preferential column. Then, as regards galvanized iron not corrugated the f.o.b. value of which is ,£16 a ton, under' the old Tariff the duty was 15s., but under the new Tariff it is the equivalent of £ 3 ios. 5d. in the general column, and £ 2 12s. 9d. in the preferential column.

108,Mr Johnson,"Exactly. We haverefer to corrugated bi-carbided iron, which is a new substitute for galvanized iron, and runs out at £ 3 a ton cheaper. The new process is said to be fast superseding the galvanizing process. The treatment has practically the same effect, and in all respects the corrugated bi-carbided iron serves the purpose equally as well as does the more expensive galvanized iron. Really there is no need for imposing a duty on this particular iron, because the importing expenses run from about 56s. to 67s. a ton, constituting a very high margin of natural protection. The object of the duty, of course, is to protect the corrugation and galvanization of imported plain iron sheets, but when ^ye look at the evidence what do we find in that connection? Mr Weidenhofer, representing Lysaght's Corrugation Works in Adelaide said, in reply to questions 50923-4, in volume iv., page 2566, that their corrugating plant employed six men. ber does not think that we ought to employ six men? which we are to be asked to pay for the employment of those six men would be better double merely to do nothing, than to impose these duties. According to the evidence of that witness the corrugating plant of Lysaght's Adelaide works employed only six men earning £ 1 5 a week amongst them. In reply to questions 50959-61 he said that twenty-four men required to work the three existing corrugating plants in Adelaide could "" a m p l y "" supply the South Australian requirements, which amount to about 6,000 tons annually. corrugator, 'in reply to question 50507 on page 2556, gave the value of the plant employing three men at about £ 1 , 5 0 0 . That gentleman, in reply to questions 50545 and 50612, and Mr Weidenhofer, in reply to questions 51005 and 51079-81, admitted that the local product would be increased in price. The Treasurer has just told us that there is no danger of the iron being increased in price as the result of the imris, . an expert in this business, who says that the effect of the duty will be to bring about an increase in the price of the local article. In almost all cases where high duties are proposed there is a tendency towards the formation of combines. According to the evidence of Mr Weidenhofer, there is a combine for the purpose of fixing and regulating prices in connection with the industry. In reply to questions 50966-71 he admitted that three firms had combined to fix prices, namely, Lysaght of Sydney, Lysaght of Adelaide, and the Victorian Galvanized Iron Company. In reply to questions 84151-2, on page 2570, Mr Thornley, the manager for Mr Sandford's Esbank Iron Works, opposed the imposition of any duty on corrugated iron. say to that ? Sir WILLIAM LYNE Mr Thornley was very foolish. marily interested in the industry make statements which are, in the Treasurer's opinion, foolish, he must admit ford's representative arrives by train to-day the honourable member can ask him what he thinks on the point. what Mr Thornley thinks, but to his sworn evidence before the Tariff Commission. If we asserted that interested manufacturers had said foolish things which affected their It own industry, the Treasurer would be the to pay the men first to resent such a statement as a reflecthe wages they are getting tion on their intelligence. As a matter of fact the manufacturers would derive an extra profit of nearly £ 7 , 0 0 0 from the proposed duty on a plant capital of £ 4 , 5 0 0 , whilst the workers would share between them about £ 2 , 3 4 0 for their labour. It will be seen from these figures that it would pay the Commonwealth to give the employees double their wages and to keep them idlf rather than to impose these duties, which would burden so large a section of the comMr Morris, another munity. With regard to the question of galvanizing what do we find when we turn to the evidence? We find that in reply to questions 84151 and 84157 on page 2570, Mr Thornley, representing the only firm in Australia which galvanize iron sheets, declared himself satisfied with a duty of 12J per cent, on iron "" corrugated, galvanized, and galvanized not corrugated,"" though preferring £ 2 per ton, but in reply to question 84158 he admitted that very little labour was employed in galvanizing,and in reply to questions 1 84182-3, that mostly boys and. youths were employed in the industry. It will be seen that this is really a boys' industry.

According to the Australian Ironmonger', in September, 1901, the price ot "" Queen's Head"" plain galvanized iron in Sydney was £ 2 1 5s., and in November of the same -year it was £ 2 2 5s., showing exactly the difference of £ 1 to which I have called attention. In the same period in Sydney, the price of the "" Orb"" corrugated galvanized iron increased from £ 1 9 to £ 2 0 per ton. In Melbourne, in September, 1901, the price of the "" Queen's Head"" brand was £ 2 3 , and was the same in November, but the "" Orb"" brand increased in price, as in Sydney, from £ 1 9 to £ 2 0 .

I do not intend to go into The Treasurer was misdetails, but merely to intimate that if rejected, I shall move what I regard as a fair compromise between the protectionist and the free-trade proposals.

Let us, for one moment, compare the duties now propo:ed by the Government with the duty which was finally adopted in 1902. No one will question the protectionist inclinations of either Sir George Turner or the honorabkmember for Adelaide, who were, of course, chiefly concerned in the first Commonwealth Tariff. The original proposal by the Barton Government, in this connection, was a duty of 30s. per ton, but after long debate the Government accepted 15s. per ton. Yet we have the present Treasurer coming here ill-informed and ill-advised,' and asking for a duty equal to 25 per cent. ad valorem. This is most singular, in face of the fact that the Barton Government were glad to accept a duty of 15s. per ton. vernment were not glad to accept that duty.

148,Mr Hutchison (Hindmarsh),"against a reduction. The first is that this is an industry that only requires a simple plant and a small amount of labour. The inference is that we ought not to encourage the industry because it does not employ 1,000 people. If that argument were to be applied to all our small industries, we should wipe out the occupations of half the people engaged in the factories of the Commonwealth. against the proposed duty is that we should penalize the users of galvanized iron. But the first argument destroys the second. If the process is so simple the competition w i ll be all the greater. I am quite satisfied that the result will be that the price will soon be far less than it is to-day. I admit that there' is something in the contention of honourable members who contend that until a protected industry is well established the consumer has to pay increased prices. But that argument does not apply in the present instance. The honourable member for' Lang pointed out that there_are three plants established in South Australia, one of which is sufficient to he is ready to go back on the recommendasupply the whole State. There are also plants in other parts of Australia, and notably those in New South Wales. The argument deduced from those facts is that there are already more plants established in Australia than are sufficient to do the whole of our work. Buti f that be so the consequence will be that the price will be considerably lowered. For that reason it does not matter whether the duty which we impose is that proposed by the Government or a lower rate so long as it is effective. It was proved to demonstration before the Tariff 'Commission that this was one of the strangled industries of Australia, and it was understood that ihonorable members were prepared to give consideration to those industries. It is one that is capable of great expansion -to n § per cent, on imports from Great the manufacturers ask for ? the Tariff Commission show that in New South Wales a duty of 15s. per ton on galvanized iron was inadequate, and that business was practically at a stand-still. low percentage. It was further stated that the experience of manufacturers was that during the term of the duty of £ 2 per ton a satisfactory trade had been done. That surely shows conclusively that £ 2 per ton is a percentage on the process of galvanizing, duty which would enable the industry to but the Minister is trying surreptitiously be carried on successfully. Australian manufacturers asked for? conversation with me, said that he hoped the duties proposed by the Government would be carried. I am quite prepared to support the higher duty if the Minister intends to stick to it. . But I wish to know what the Government intend to stand by. The other argument I find. various honourable members moving amendments for reductions, and it is difficult to know how we stand. I should like to have a plain statement from the Minister. Sir WILLIAM LYNE I have already said that I intend, to stand by the duty which 1 have proposed. no justification fori a reduction, and if the Minister is prspared to stand by the duty proposed by him I shall support h i m ; though at the same time. I should be ready to support him also if he would agree to a reasonable reduction. I find the honourable member for Bendigo intimating that tions of the protectionist members of the Tariff Commission. I understand that he is prepared to support a duty of 45s. per ton with a preference of 5s: to Great Britain. I think the Minister should be satisfied with that. Ss. per ton would mean 1 3 per cent, 1 against Great Britain as far as galvanized iron is concerned. The suggestion made is that as to paragraph A the duty should be 45s. per ton-whic h is 15 per cent, against the foreigner-and 40s. per ton, which is 13 1 per cent., against Great Britain, and iron under paragraph B 40s. per ton, equal to 13^ per cent, in the case of foreign imports, and 35s. per ton, equal Britain. member for Bendigo prepared to stand by the first proposal made by him that the duties should be 45s. and 40s. per ton?

You say ios. goes in labour, and 5s. in interest on plant, and cost of supervision?-Yes. The witness showed conclusively that these to l e a d are actual charges that must be added to the cost of the material to the consumerI f that is so, how is that price going to come rlown through competition, if it represents an absolute payment in value ?-The competition ? By saying that, I meant the competition would keep the price down to within reasonable limitsnot an excessive profit would be made on it. You cannot indicate where the 15s. is going to disappear when the price is quoted to the consumer, can you, seeing that it represents actual costs on value given ? The witness answered weakly enoughI suppose it would make a little difference, a few shillings. Seeing that the people who handle this galvanized iron in Australia appear to have an understanding as to the price, does it not look as if this representation was intended to secure some little monopoly for a few people, for the corrugating iron trade in Australia?--That is one way of putting it. It cannot be denied that there exists pracI aim sure that the contically a monopoly which it would not be worthwhile for any one to break into. Here are some further extracts from the examination of the same witnessYou told us that your plant, if kept going all the time, could pretty well turn out the requirements of South Australia.

I take less objection to the protection of intive of the only galvanizing works in Ausdustries that are natural to the country than I do to those which are not. We have here a proposal to import the raw material and to dignify with the name of an industry the work of giving to it one or two insignificant touches. is to be introduced. duced before these duties are imposed, rather' than encourage the work of adding something to the tail-end of an industry and dignifying that work by the name of another industry. the'total value'of this production is created outside Australia, and every one who requires galvanized iron is to be taxed in order that we may give in Australia two insignificant touches to the imported material. The proposal is so childish that I am surprised that the Committeehas devoted so much consideration' to it . wish to emphasize the point that those who sought protection for this industry wanted no more than a differential duty of 15s. per ton. Recognising that the numbers are against me, I am prepared to go to the extent of supporting such a duty, and surely protectionists do not wish to vote for' a heavier duty than a protectionist producer himself declared would be sufficient' to meet his' case. If they do they will simply impose a tax on everiy unfortunate'-individual in Australia who has to buy this material. Mr. FULLER (Illawarra) ' [12.46] I had not an opportunity of hearing the speech delivered by the Treasurer in submitting this proposal, but from the comments made upon it, it would appear that he put before the Committee an incorrect statement as to the importations, and had subsequently to ""correct it. No reason has been given either during this debate or in the evidence given before the Tariff Comrate. mission for increasing the-' duty to anything like the extent proposed by the Treasurer. amount of labour employed in the corruI fai l to. see how it can be. justified, more gating of iron I may mention that a witparticularly in view of the fact that it is far in excess of the request made by any manufacturer who appeared before the Commission. The request made before the Commission was that a duty of 15s. per the same ton should be imposed in the case of galvanized iron and 303. per ton on corrugated iron. That demand, was supported by Mr Morris, Mr Weidenhofer, to whom the honourable member fori Hindmarsh has referred, and Mr Sandford, the representatralia, whose highest demand was for a duty of £ 2 per ton on corrugated iron. ' His request was supported by Mr Wade, the representative of the workers in the industry, and Mr Thornley, the manager of Mr Sandford's works, who gave similar evidence. That being so, there is no justification for the Treasurer's proposition, and I hold that it is the duty of the honourable member in every case in which he proposes to go beyond the demands of the manufacturer to explain fairly and openly his reason for doing so. I do not At least five-sixths of know that any such explanation has been given in this instance, and in its absence the debate will certainly be prolonged. It is clear from the evidence given before the Commission that very little labour is involved in the process of galvanizing and corrugating iron. The proposal of the Government is inI tended to protect not the iron manufacturer in Australia, but the galvanizing and corrugating industries, which employ very little labour, and which in reality only out the finishing touches upon material imported from abroad. Everybody knows that galvanized iron is an absolute necessity to the pioneers of Australia, who use it. for roofing their homes. Why they should be penalized for the sake of developing industries which provide such a. very small amount of employment can be explained only by a protectionist of the tvpe of the Treasurer. The honourable member for Hindmarsh has made a strong plea on behalf of Mr Weidenhofer, of South Australia, but Mr Thornley, the manager of Mr Sandford's works at Lithgow, admitted that the labour employed in the galvanizing of sheets was very insignificant, and that he would be satisfied witha duty of 12 per cent, all round. 1",28,William Lyne I Was Not Doing Here A S To Say That We Will Give A Duty

169,Mr Fuller,"As illustrating the smallness in South Australia admitted that his plant, which was one of three in that State, would be able with twenty-four men as a maximum to produce sufficient iron to supply the whole of its requirements, which were estimated at 6,000 tons annually. When he was asked whether it was worthwhile to impose an additional -charge of 15s. per ton upon the annual consumption of corrugated iron in order to -employ sixteen additional hands, he declined to express an opinion. As a matter of fact, it would pay the settlers of Australia to pension off the whole of those engaged in the industry rather than to be subjected to the imposts proposed. I think that the proper course for us to adopt is to accept the amendment of the honourable member for Dalley. It is evident that the Treasurer is not well versed in the facts relating to the industry, and to afford him an opportunity of becoming familiar with them, we might reasonably postpone the further consideration of the item until -a later stage. think that corrugated iron stands on a par w»i;th wire-netting. The Committee reduced the duty upon wire-netting to as low a rate as possible, and I think that corrugated iron should be treated in the same way. We all desire to promote land settlement in Australia, and we know that the very first act of a selector is to erect three or four sheets of corrugated iron to provide him»with shelter. We must recollect that his means are limited. In the mining districts almost all the houses are roofed with corrugated iron. tralian corrugated iron? people be taxed to assist an industry which is not indigenous to the country? When I resided in Ballarat, the' miners were at liberty to take up residential areas of a quarter of an acre each. They used to build wooden-framed cottages, and cover them with corrugated iron. A ll the sheds there are roofed with the same material. On the mining fields of Western Australia even the walls of the houses are of corrugated iron. It is not necessary to impose a heavy tax upon this commodity, and there is no necessity to increase the old rate of duty four or five-fold. The honourable member for Perth has already pointed out that those who have as'ked for a duty .upon it are satisfied to accept 15s. per ton, which is equal to about 15 per cent. Personally, I think that we should make this article dutiable at 15 per cent, under the general Tariff, and that we should extend a preference of 5 per cent, to the United Kingdom. Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.13 p.m. I had intended, had I spoken earlier in the debate, to say something about the truly domestic nature of the cominodity we are discussing, but honourable members have dealt with that already at some length. It has been pointed out that not only the pioneers of Australia, but the farmers and small householders all over the Commonwealth, depend upon galvanized iron for roofing material, as also to secure supplies of wholesome drinking water against times of drought. We know that bark roofs do not catch all the rain-fall, and what they do catch is so discoloured and impregnated with the flavour of the bark, that they are only resorted to where there is some"" difficulty in obtaining galvanized iron. This -domestic article, it should also be stated, used, except for industrial purposes, almost wholly by the poorer classes, because people of means, in building houses, prefer the use of more aesthetic tiles or slates. Once these facts are recognised we are induced to make the use of this material as economical as possible. I direct attention to the want of clearness in the explanation given by the Treasurer. It has never been properly explained to those honourable members who have not discovered the facts for themselves that what we are discussing now is not a duty on iron but a duty on two particular processes known as galvanizing and corrugating to which iron is subjected. The Minister spoke of the item as if the question involved were the imposition of. a duty upon iron j whilst, as a matter of fact, it is proposed to impose a duty upon galvanized iron and corrugated iron withtheobject of encouraging only the local galvanizing and corrugating of iron. The Tariff Commission deal with the ""question remarkably well, and I propose to read a couple of paragraphs from their report. They say Only one firm in Australia appears to have undertaken the galvanizing of sheet iron, the manager of which admitted that the process required very little labour, and was a' comparatively small thing in relation to the total value of the iron.

178,Mr Bruce Smith,"Some of it may must be regarded as most valuable. As,be presented to a number of intelligent men. pealing to the prejudices of certain honourable members, the Minister told the Committee that no less than £ 3 9 0 , 0 0 0 worth of galvanized iron was imported to the Commonwealth from the United States of America. Upon that statement, as a premise, the honourable gentleman built an interesting and attractive edifice, with which he appealed to honourable members in a very heated way to resist great trusts in the United States of America, preventing anybody in Australia from engaging in these industries. sumed that his figures were correct, and made this appeal to the prejudices of certain honourable members to put the duty at a high level in order to prevent the possibility of these several industries being destroyed. What followed? We had the very pitiable exhibition of the Minister having to depend upon an exposure of error in his figures by the Governnjent Whip. suddenly realized that instead of the imports from the United States of America amounting inj value to £ 3 9 0 , 0 0 0 , their value was only about £ 3 7 , 0 0 0 , and the whole edifice on which he depended, in his appeal to honourable members to resist the American trusts, fell like a house of cards. But there is a moral in all this. impossible for us to look into all these matters for ourselves; and we are entitled to expect that a Minister, receiving a substantial remuneration, submitting the various items will supply information by which we may be guided. him to recognise the difficulty of our getting this information for ourselves,, and we ought to be able to rely upon every word the honourable gentleman utters as to the facts bearing upon the items under consideration. In this case it has been shown that the Treasurer is ignorant of the figures or careless as to their correctness; and even with the help of an officer behind the Speaker's chair, is unable to give the common or garden information which we should have to guide us in dealing with matters of this sort. dental presence of the Government Whip who has run over the honourable gentleman's figures, we were able to discover that he had made a mistake of about 1,000 per cent, in those which he submitted to the Committee. for Grey also corrected the Treasurer. No doubt, with the intention of apand the honourable member for Grey gave the Committee a .great deal of valuable information in the early part of the debate. If we had not the information which the honourable member for Grey, and also the honourable members for North Sydney, I l lawarra, and Perth gave the ' Committee, we should have been in the dark unless we looked up the records for ourselves. It might not have any special pertinence to this particular item, but it shows that the Committee should be careful to note that the treatment of these matters by the MinThe honourable gentleman asister is absolutely prejudiced from the outset, and that he is absolutely unprepared, either through want of knowledge or want of industry in obtaining the necessary information, to put before the Committee the. facts to which they are entitled when dealing with a Question of this sort. If 5 per cent, on the cost of the iron will give a handsome The honourable gentleman protection upon the two processes of galvanizing and corrugating because we do not want to protect the iron itself-w e really ought to consider only the value of those two processes. It is altogether a misleading method of calculating the proper duty on this material to take the value of £ 1 5 per ton of the maI t is terial itself. If the witnesses from whose evidence the Commission thought fit ro draw the conclusion that 5 per cent, upon the original cost will give a handsome profit upon these processes, be right, we should be perfectly satisfied with that, rememberWe expect ing that we are not putting the duty upon the material itself, but upon the work which is now being accomplished, or was lately accomplished, in South Australia and New South Wales. suggested before lunch that galvanized iron should be placed in the same position as wire netting, upon which the Committee decided to lower the duty, but in that case the netting was a necessity in fighting a scourge throughout the Commonwealth.

In any case I think we should be justified in following the Commission's recommendation. sary and the workers ready to do this work, but I am not prepared to impose such a duty as will make the cost to the consumer greater than is desirable, but I certainly will not be prepared to follow the Government in their proposal for a higher rate. [2.37].'-In view of the importance of the item and the large number of people likely to be affected by a duty on galvanized iron, it is desirable that the Committee should give it a fair amount of consideration. We know that the article is made from plain black sheet iron. It has been said that it does not require a great amount of capital for plant or a great deal of labour to convert black sheet iron into galvanized iron. Anybody who visited the Lithgow ironworks with us a little while ago would be well satisfied as to that. The honourable member for Parkes stated that 5 per cent, on the outlay would fairly represent the cost of the industry. on the f.o.b. price of the iron. I think the honourable member'sfigureswere about 15s. per ton. We must first consider whether the public are now getting the benefit that they shouldget. In order to ascertain that, I must turn to the figures furnished by the Commonwealth Statistician, Mr Knibbs, in order to find the Eveni f the great Trust in values of the articles. He gives the amount of plain sheet iron imported. That is on the free list. The total imported into the Commonwealth in 1906 was 458,197 cwt., of a value of ,£200,034. That works out a t £ 9 SSper ton. We imported of galI vanized iron, plain and sheet, 1,2*45,211 cwt., of a value of £1,069,174, which But I feel shows that the average' price would be about 2s. 6d. a ton. The priee the honourable member quotes would include the 10 per cent, added for Customs purposes. the figures given by the Statistician in preference to any information furnished by a wholesale importer or manufacturer. WhacI have stated will be admitted by everybody to be the fair average price of the article imported. When speaking of an average price, I want it to be understood that in this particular item there are quite a number of different kinds of iron, not only in quality but in gauges. Anybody who has handled it knows that when you buy from We have here the spelter neces5 ft. to 8 ft . iron you.pay less than for 9 f t . or 10 f t . iron. thickness. the thickness but on the length. Those figures show that the declared value of galvanized iron, plain and corrugated, imported, is £ 1 7 2s. 6d. per ton, 'and of black sheet iron £ 9 15s. a ton, or a difference of £ , 7s. 6d. a ton. I agree with the horforable member for Parkes and several other honourable members that 5 per cent, would be a fair thing to cover the cost. We saw that there were only a few hands engaged in the process of making galvanized iron, plain and sheet. Four boys were employed in dipping the iron, and there were two or three men at the stampers doing the corrugating. That is the whole process. The people of Australia are'paying £ 7 7s. 6d. a ton for that, because the iron is in the hands of a number of importers and there is no competition. The Committee is always in sympathy with the primary producer, and the evidence I have goes to show that he is not getting",32,William Lyne I Was Not Doing Here A S To Say That We Will Give A Duty

190,Mr John Thomson,"Not only on the benefit that he ought to get, simply because the iron is handled only by a few, and the cost of converting black iron into sheet or galvanized iron is not given to the people who should receive it . It would be very much better for our people-and the provisions of the Tariff allow it-to get black iron in free, and convert it at a cost of 5 per cent, into galvanized iron, so creating a number of industries whose competition would reduce the extra charge of £ 7 7 s. 6d. per ton for conversion to somewhere about 17 s. per ton. member think that £ 7 7s. fid. a ton is a good protection? able member knows that prices are regulated more by competition than by either free-trade or protection. Every man who has an article to sell gets for ""it what the public will pay. I believe that we can create a number of industries, which do not require a very big capital somewhere about £ 1 . 5 ° ° ' as has been statedwhereby black iron mav be converted into corrugated iron. I think the proposals before the Committee will do that, even if the Government's proposals are considered too high. By that means we should be assisting our primary industries by allowing them to get plain and corrugated galvanized iron cheaper than they have in the past. I hope the Committee will agree to a duty which will be sufficient to give encouragement to the industry, apart from an\i assistance which'we are giving to the production of black iron. I believe that by that means we should be able to supply the people with galvanized iron cheaper than they are getting it now from the hands of the importers. necessary, it could be found in the evidence given before the Tariff. Commission. A New South Wales witness, an importer, -complained that under the present duty his firm felt very keenly the competition of Australian made galvanized iron, That shows that whenever there is competition from inside against the importer the public must be getting the benefit. The state of things that obtained before Federation is shown by the evidence of a Victorian manufacturer of galvanized and other sheet iron. He said that he was much better off under the Victorian Tariff of 30 per cent. that in New South Wales the experience of :manufacturers was that during the term of the £ 2 per ton duty on plain and corrugated galvanized iron, satisfactory trade had been done, but that when the duty had been removed, in 1896, business felt off to such an extent that one of the mills at one factory had been stopped, and the other used intermittently. Under the old South Australian Tariff, the duty on corrugated iron was 30s. per ton, and plain sheet iron was free. Several corrugating plants, costing about £ 1 , 5 0 0 each, had been put down and satisfactory business had been done. That evidence goes to show the possibility of starting works of this kind. T.!y giving encouragement to the industry we should create inside competition, the price of the article would be reduced to the people, and by that means we should advantage them considerably, and also be creating an Australian industry. sire to put in a plea first for the consumer, considering the large number of people who are interested in this special duty. We must consider how iargely corrugated galvanized iron is used. A great quantity is used for roofing purposes, The smallest house takes about half a ton of iron to roof it, and must be furnished with gutters and spoutings made of iron, which, after being galvanized, has to be twisted and turned into various shapes, so that it must be of superior quality. Galvanized iron is also frequently used for fencing material, and for the manufactuie of household articles, such as buckets, tubs, ashpans, and the like. Then, in a climate like ours, no house is complete -without its bath, and most baths are made of galvanized iron. Lastly, the conservation of water is absolutely necessary, and for this tanks made of corrugated and galI f further proof were vanized iron are extensively used. It will be seen, therefore, that sheet-iron is ot immense importance to our pastoralists, agriculturists, dairymen, and miners. Are we going to penalize the whole of the producing industries of Australia by putting a tax upon its importation to encourage a very small industry ? According to the .Tariff Commission's evidence, the three South Australian firms to which reference has been made employ only about twenty hands each. The free-trade members of the Commission reported on this subjectIt was stated definitely that the margin of difference between the landed cost of imported The Commission states black sheets, viz., £10 8s. iod. per ton '(or £'1 18s. iod. over the f.o.b. price in England) afforded a sufficient natural protection after allowing for the price of local bar and rod iron, viz., £ 9 , which price, it was stated covered",33,William Lyne I Was Not Doing Here A S To Say That We Will Give A Duty

Witnesses stated that any duty or charsre on black sheets would seriously prejudice Australian industries whicli were now established, some doing, a considerable export trade. These are the recommendations of the protectionist section of the CommissionThat on galvanized or corrugated iron, plate, and sheet, there be a duty of io per cent, (equal to about 30s. per ton). We have bee 1 told that in South Australia ihe Industry has flourished without protecttonThat on corrugated galvanized iron there be a duty of 15 per cent.

Some of the raw material used by brewers is imported in iron tanks, ancl so, too, is mustard, as well as other commodities. These goods could not be imported in any other way, and, therefore, the tanks will continue to come in, notwithstanding the duty, and no encouragement will be given to their manufacture'locally. I am in favour of the amendment of the honourable member for Dalley,. who has suggested the postponement of the item. tinuance of the present situation. tunate. I am surprised that the Minister does not come here prepared with all the information necessary to guide our deliberations. Instead of being properly informed on this subject, he read figures which were entirely misleading, and was not man enough to take the responsibility of his mistake, blaming officers who, at the present time, are probably sweated and overworked. worked ? overworked just now. If I had my way, we would adjourn over the hot weatner. The Government are piling business upon us at the last moment, when we axe all anxious to get away, and possibly in the end the Committee will be so weary of the whole thing that it will pass the items en bloc, instead of dealing with them separately, as it should. am as desirous as most honourable members that a decision should be come to on this matter, but I feel that we should not divide on a question of such importance at the risk of a misunderstanding as to the result of accepting the Government proposal. Even the Minister must admit that the proposed duty will not benefit the iron industry, which is to be encouraged by the , bounties to be granted under the Manufactures Encouragement Bill. What we have to consider is' what duty should be imposed on galvanized and corrugated iron to encourage persons, to do The galvanizing and corrugating here, the black sheets being admitted free. To my mind, it is That on tanks containing goods, or empty, doubtful whether it is advisable to impose any duty with a view to bringing this about. more than it is worth. given by the industry is more than counterbalanced by the increased cost to the community of galvanized and corrugated iron. to double the wages of those now engaged in the industry, on condition that they would go out of it. us to give the few boys employed in this industry a decent wage to go out of it. The encouragement of the manufacture of iron from native ores is an entirely different thing. To put a heavy impost upon the community, merely to encourage the galvanizing and corrugating of iron in this country, is not sound economy. is a parasitic one. under that category. The industry gives so little labour that we are haidly justified in considering it. When we were at Lithgow, we saw a few boys engaged in dipping the iron sheets into the galvanizing liquid, and passing them between rollers to corrugate them. We ought not to place a burden on the primary producers to support so small an industry as that. Out back, men cannot build houses of brick, with slate roofs, and when their homes are not constructed wholly of galvanized iron, they are, in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, roofed with it. The Minister might well be satisfied with a small increase 011 the old duty. The maximum rates for which I shall vote are 30s. against foreign countries, and 20s. against Great Britain.",34,William Lyne I Was Not Doing Here A S To Say That We Will Give A Duty

204,Mr Frazer,"l t practically comesspeech of the honourable member for Cowper tended to show that galvanized and corrugated iron should be on the free list. He spoke of the average value of imp5rted galvanized iron as £ 1 7 2s. 6d. per ton, and of imported black sheets as something over £ g per ton. The difference between those two prices-j£ S per ton-surel y allows a good margin of profit for those engaged locally in galvanizing. will not importers crush out the local industry, as has been done in other cases? competition, there is a very large margin of profit to work on. My proposal is to fix the duty at 25s. in the general Tariff, and 20s. in the preferential Tariff. at 30s. and 20s. respectively. about fixing the duty in the general Tariff at 30s., because ,practtcally all the importations come from the United Kingdom. respectively, we shall afford ample protection, plus the advantage which the local manufacturers already possess owing >to the difference between the cost of black iron ancl galvanized iron. I would not press this proposal upon honourable members but for the fact that galvanized iron is one of the first requirements of. the primary producers. settling people on the land.' If honourable members really want to help the seftlers they will adopt my suggestion. Whatever duty is imposed will practically be a revenue duty. Why should we penalize the primary producers by levying that which after all is an excessive revenue duty? I propose to alter my amendment by substituting 30s. for 25s. per ton. Amendment amended accordingly. I do not wish to prolong the debate, but I hope that the Government will not insist upon the higher duty they have imposed on this article, which is largely used by the Tural population all over Australia. We have Leen engaged in imposing high duties on many commodities which are used by the farming and pastoral population, and it has been difficult to see how they will derive any special benefit therefrom. We are now afforded an opportunity not to impose a Tiigh duty on a Commodity which is used very largelv by all persons engaged in rural pursuits. To the pastoralist, fo the agriculturist, to the minen, in fact to every one in the rural industries, galvanized iron is a necessity, ancl in many cases it has to be carted long distances, whereby its cost is very much enhanced. I hope that the Committee will accept the proposal to levy a duty of 20s. against the United Kingdom and 30s. against other countries. This is a case in which I think the Government might do something for the rural people, who will not benefit from many of the the last month or two. also hope that the Government will not insist upon levying a high duty on the articles embraced in this item, especially on plain galvanized iron, Which is used more considerably than honourable members seem to think. In the interior of Western Australia it is used for the purI am not particular pose of building houses. It is nailed on the inside of the studs and is papered. It is very easily manipulated, and the cottages are made to look very nice indeed. Again, If we fix the duties at 30s. and 20s. hundreds of tons of the article are used in Australia, not only to be corrugated, but also for making guttering, ridge-caps, and all kinds of things. generally it is strange that no attempt has been made to manufacture it in Australia. ally that when iron-is made in Australia We all talk about there will be some sense in levying a duty on plain galvanized iron.' make iron in Australia if I continue to get such support as I shall get on this occasion. same category as wire-netting.

I 'had hoped that the duty under the new Tariff would not exceed the duty under the old Tariff. I shall he prepared to vote for duties of 15 per cent, and 10 per cent, respectively, or something like those rates. Motion (to postpone the item) negatived. I think that it would be very convenient if the Committee would now decide whether the duties on the articles contained in this item should be ad valorem or fixed. I am pledged at the present time to vote for the imposition of ad valorem duties, and against the imposition of fixed duties. If I were afforded an opportunity to vote for the imposition of ad valorem duties, 1 should be prepared, in the case of corrugated galvanized iron, to vote for a duty of 15 per cent, in the general Tariff 'and 10 per cent, in the preferential Tariff; and in the case of iron galvanized, but not corrugated,, and iron corrugated, but not galvanized, to vote for a duty of 10 per cent, in the general Tariff and 5 per cent, in the preferential Tariff. I think that the Minister should take a test voteas to whether the duties shall be fixed or ad valorem. If that is not done, I might be called upon to vote against the imposition of fixed duties which would be almost equal to the ad valorem duties I prefer, whereas, if a test vote is taken, I may be able to t approximate to some proposition equivalent to the ad valorem duties. I am bound to vote against the imposition of any fixed duties. agree with the honourable and learned member for Bendigo that we should decide at once whether the duties are to be fixed or ad valorem. There is no question that the price of. this commodity fluctuates so very considerably that a duty of 10 per cent, at the present time would yield more than would a duty of 7J per' cent, at a later time, and vice versa. I do not intend to vote for the imposition of a duty higher than that which prevailed under the old Tariff. In the session of 1901-2 this item was debated at very considerable length, and the Labour Party intimated its desire that it should be placed on the Tree list. I think it will be generally admitted by those who took part in ffie discussion on that occasion that a serious bungle was ""made when the item was not put on the member knows per-fectly well how that hapfree list. Galvanized iron is used very pened. largely in my constituency. I should say that it is used exclusively for roofing purposes. If we impose a high duty on galvanized iron, which is the roofing material used in the back country, the price of every other kind of roofing materia] will be almost certain to rise in sympathy with the price of galvanized iron. I refer to such materials as slates, tiles, and rubberoid. 1 shall not vote for the imposition of any duties higher than 40s. and 30s. respectively. I do not say that I will not vote for less than those rates, but certainly I shall, not vote for higher rates. the former Tariff was under consideration, 1, together with many other members, was under the impression that galvanized iron would be duty free, but somehow or other, in the putting of the question, we got boxed up. After it was passed we found, ourselves in the position that the article was liable to a duty, and of course we had to bow to the inevitable. If this were a proposal for the protection of a primary or secondary industry, I should vote the whole protection which the Government desire, but it is nothing of the sort; it is simply a question of giving a protection of .£3 per ton to thoise who are engaged in the tinning and corrugating of iron. All the houses which are erected in the far western districts of Queensland are built of galvanized iron. Do honourable members intend to inflict a specific duty on the pioneers of the interior of Australia? I venture to say that even in Victoria 80 per cent, of the houses outside Melbourne are roofed with corrugated iron. If 'honourable members intend to penalize men for going out back and making the country what it is, by all means let them vote duties as high as the Treasurer wishes them to do. The honourable member for Fremantle has stated that it takes only a boy to operate a corrugating machine, but the honorable member for Hunter interjected that three men are required. Tn EnglandI have seen women galvanizing, not only sheet iron, but other materials.. Tf ever there was an instance of bunkum, it is to be found in the case of this particular duty.

They have secured a bounty upon the production of sugar, and they have also gained an advantage under the new mail contract. Now they want more. Of course, we all know that an appetite grows by what it feeds on, and I do not blame them for compelling the Treasurer at the point of the bayonet to make an exception in favour of these machines. growers receive different treatment, from that which is extended to the miners and producers of the Commonwealth? idle for the Treasurer to urge that the Department has effected a re-arrangement of these articles: the Department?

Sir WILLIA M LYNE -We have a He patent law in operation with which I am not in agreement. I regret that the honourable member for Coolgardie should have almost cast aspersions upon me. If these articles could be made locally I should fight for a protective duty upon them. One of the gentlemen to whom I have referred is an official in the Customs Department, and the other expert is connected with the Melbourne University. warmth which has. been introduced into this debate is quite unnecessary. As the Treasurer appears to have such an intimate knowledge of these cane loaders on Why should the sugarwheels, I should like to know what they are. Certainly I do not know.

We -may add that we do not desire any duty to -be placed on any of these implements or machines nor parts thereof. letter manufacturers or importers? manufacturers who built up their industries under the old protective policy of Victoria. They distinctly affirm that they do not desire any alteration in the old rate of duty. All along the line the Treasurer has taxed the primary producers. agricultural, horticultural, and viticultural pursuits are already sufficiently taxed. Even the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission only recommended a duty of 12 per cent, upon these articles. I would 1 further point out that under the old rate of duty they yielded a revenue of £21,883. It is now proposed to impose a duty of 20 per cent. If an amendment to that effect has not already been moved, I am prepared to move that the articles in item 148 should remain dutiable at 12 per cent., the rate fixed under the old Tariff, and recommended by the Tariff Commission. Treasurer has been very ready to inform the Committee that the cane-loader cannot be made in Australia because it is patented. How often has the honourable gentleman insisted that other patented articles absolutely necessary in industries that derive no benefit from protection ought to be made in the Commonwealth, and that the patentees should be compelled to make arrangements for their manufacture here? When we dealt with high-class water-tube boilers used in connection with mining, and a statement was made that they were not made in Australia because they were patented, the honourable gentleman said, "" Let us put duties on and compel the patentees to make arrangements under which they can be made in Australia."" -Now, when we come to deal with a comparatively simple implement, which appears to be in limited demand, we are told thav it should be admitted free, because, being -patented, it cannot be made in Australia. It was the occurrence of,just such instances as this' in the consideration of the first Tariff that compelled ""the free-trade section of the Commission to recommend, as far as possible; a uniform duty on all importations of this kind, so that one industry should not be allowed to escape' taxation, whilst another was heavily taxed to make up the shortage of revenue. It would be a thousand times better, in the interests of a consistent system of protection, as well as in the interests of the country generally, that the Government should set aside these exceptions, most of which are absolutely absurd and unjustified, and propose a reasonable uniform duty which would give a certain amount of encouragement to engineering here, while it would not operate as a handicap upon those larger industries upon which engineering must depend for I hold that the its existence. I wish again to direct the attention of the Treasurer to the letter from the Carolin Machinery and Furnishing Company, which was referred to by the honourable member for Indi. I propose to read the letter in full. objecting to the proposal to fix a lower duty on cane loaders? there are some other articles in this item on which the duty should also be lower than that proposed. This. is the letter which I wish to readWith reference to item 148, Division.

Here we .have manufacturers of. these articles in Victoria saying that the duty proposed would be of no use to them, and would only be a tax on development work. In the circumstances it is fair to ask the Treasurer whether he will not add some of these articles to those which he proposes to transfer to item 155?. I think there might be a protective duty imposed on garden sprays and such things, but I do not see why we should impose a duty of 20 per cent, on ordinary agricultural implements when a duty of 12 per cent, 1 has already proved effective. mean to say that we cannot make channel graders here? manufacturers in Victoria have said that they do not require the duty. bore-channel graders that could be possibly be made at work in Western Queensland, and it was made in South Australia. whose names are attached to the letter which I have read say that the duty is not required. ber suggest that they represent the whole of the Victorian engineering firms ? They represent only three small firms. facturers who say that these duties are of no use to them; and I ask why we should impose duties upon articles which are so necessary to our developmental work? Treasurer has expressed his intention to put cane loaders on wheels and channel-making graders practically on the free list. I shall vote against any such proposal. The honourable member for Herbert, who is as much interested in the sugar industry as any honourable member on the other side can claim to be, has said distinctly that these cane loaders, or unloaders as, I believe, they should be called, can easily be glue-pots. reminds me of an amendment moved by Senator McColl in the last Tariff, to the effect that three-legged glue-pots should be admitted free. We have been given, by the 'honourable member for Capriare not engaged in making these articles, and who if asked to make them would expect a special price. . If the canegrowers of Queensland were asked to quote a price for potatoes, they would quote a special price, because they do not grow potatoes. I hope the Minister will reconsider his amendment, in view of the speech made by the honourable member for Herbert, who told us that any bush carpenter could make the articles referred to. I voted for fhe protection given to the sugar industry amounting to 50 per cent., and would do so again, but I agree with the honourable member for Coolgardie that that industry has been treated very fairly. Those engaged in it could not expect that they should be allowed to get everything they required duty free, whilst a practically prohibitive tax is imposed on the article which they themselves produce. of the amendment he now proposes, it is amusing to recall the fact that when we were discussing the proposed duty on galvanized iron, the Minister; put his back up, and said that he would fight for it to the very last. As I interjected during the speech of the honourable' member for Yarra, I am reminded by the present proposal of an amendment moved by the then honourable member for Echuca, now Senator McColl, who desired that three-legged glue-pots should be admitted free. three-legged pots. suggestion was that in this country we could not manufacture glue-pots or threelegged pots.. With regard to channelgraders, I can bear testimony to the fact that old Mr Cudmore sent up a channel-grader made in South Australia to Tara Station, which is owned by the Cudmores, and it proved to be one of the best ever made, and the forerunner of many similar graders im-",42,Pairs

There may be a number of others that can be made here to let all these machines in free from the United Kingdom under item 155, because one of them is a patent. Cane loaders on wheels are like the frames used on the railways for carrying rails from the truck to the head of the road. They consist of four wheels running on a tram-lirie, two axles, which are on two clips, the I said 10 per cent. platform being of wood, with pieces fastened on to keep the cane from falling off. Where does the patent come In there ? This bears out what the honourable member for Parramatta and the honourable member for Lang have told the Treasurer over and over again-that the Tariff is framed in such a haphazard way that the honourable gentleman does not know what he is doing. He allows his leg to be pulled in order to put on the free list two articles that are capable of being manufactured at any workshop in Australia. I hope the Treasurer will reconsider his proposal, and. allow the two items to remain as they stand Where have the cane in the Tariff.

The first included such machines as stripper harvesters and stump-jump ploughs, on which a duty of 25 per cent, was proposed. The second group included other ploughs, harrows, cultivators, and chaffcutters, upon which we proposed a 20 per cent. duty.

Many of these machines can be made, and I should like to see them made, here. Therefore I shall support the proposed duty. I do not feel disposed to vote for revenue duties thought duties of 12 per cent, sufficient unless they are shown to be absolutely necessary to the small States. I am surprised at the reason given by the honourable member for Bendigo for not supporting the proposed duties. It is not long since the honourable member for Perth told us that only three witnesses appeared before the Tariff Commission to give evidence in respect to lead piping, and that not one of them asked for an alteration of the Tariff. member for Bendigo in that case recommended the imposition of a duty of 50s. a ton. How does he reconcile that recommendation with his statement this afternoon that he is not going to vote for rates that have not been asked for? What is proposed how is a revenue duty. I am opposed to revenue duties, and will not vote for 12J per cent, on any item. We should either give protection to local industries, or allow consumers to purchase in the cheapest market. ber vote for the proposal to make these rates lower? understand why the Minister proposes to strike out cane loaders. what is done with them. should be dutiable, because they are simple inventions, upon which it will be easy for local makers to improve.

I wish to see our inventive genius developed. orable member for Hindmarsh-and , apparently, the honourable member for Laanecoorie, too-is opposed to the proposed deletion. The former said that as a protectionist he objected to revenue duties. I The Minister has proposed the omission of certain machines, with a view to making the duty on them, if they come from foreign countries, 10 per cent., admitting They are evidence of the them free if from the United Kingdom. No one will pretend that the honourable member for Bendigo, Senator McGregor, ex-Senator Higgs, and Mr Francis Clarke, are not protectionists. They have been regarded as red-hot protectionists. Yet they 1 on all these machines. I shall vote for this proposal, not only because it is the recommendation of the Tariff Commission, but also because cane loaders and channelling machines are very bulky, and, if imported, would probably have to be brought here in parts, giving to our own people the work of re-assembling them. I shall vote for a duty of 12 per cent., and against 1 the proposed omission. Yet the honourable here as a protectionist, not as a revenue Tariffist, and it seems to me that this is a revenue Tariff proposal. As the revenue from these items was last year £22,000, it is clear that a duty of 12 j per cent, would nob encpurage their manufacture locally to the extent to which we as nationalists wish it to be encouraged. We recognise that without protection there is little hope of establishing manufactures here, because old firms elsewhere can always bring down -values, with a view to discouraging local competition.

The Government themselves have always made a distinction between other kinds of machinery and implements used by those engaged in the horticultural and agricultural industries. Implements and machinery seem to be distinguished at the Customs House, and have always received separate treatment by Parliament. The reason is that the bulk of the machinery which is to-day used in horticultural work is patented, and cannot be made here, even if we wished to make it for ourselves. It is idle to tax a thing which we could not make in the country, even if we had a 100 per cent. duty. I know that that remark does not apply to all the articles affected, but it .does to many of them. Another reason for the low duties was that it was always considered, even by strong protectionists, that it was a fair thing not to tax the implements of those engaged in the primary industries in the interior. With regard to the remarks of the honourable member for Grey as to the omission of the words proposed, I should like to remark that he inferred-probabl y unintentionally-that those who vote for the amendment will be bound to vote for the increased duty upon the item. That is not so. The Minister himself indicated that voting for the amendment would not bind honourable members to vote for the item. I say that by way of personal explanation. I cannot agree to vote for a high duty of 20 per cent, on this item. I think that the rate is excessive The subthat an increase of 2J per cent, will not ject was threshed out very extensively when the 1902 Tariff was before us, and, although a higher duty was at first proposed, Parliament ultimately agreed to 12 per1 cent.

I am inclined to think that a duty of 12J per cent, is scarcely, sufficient. cent, were put in the first column, what would the honourable member propose to put in the second column? duty should be fixed in Loth columns, because the bulk of these implements come, not from the United Kingdom, but from the United States and Canada; and fhe United States is a country that never has, and never will-whil e the people are of the same mind as they are now-giv e any other nation Tariff consideration. us reciprocity. procity that a cat gives to a mouse-the y would swallow us.

It is most essential that agricul[2.32] say 17 1 tural industries should be conducted on an extensive scale to make them pay, and in order that they may be extensively pursued, the most modern machinery must be used. Probably as a result of similar conditions in America and Canada, the greatest improvements in implements and machinery have been made in those countries. Some"" years ago, our agricultural and horticultural implements were manufactured in England. But those implements have now been displaced by more up-to-date and suitable ones manufactured in the United States' and Canada. I have a recollection of using an English pitchfork many years ago. The difference beCOOK -The honourable tween such an implement and an American pitchfork is most marked. In fact, I do not know of an instance where an English pitchfork is now used in connection with agriculture in this city. A similar change has been made with respect to a number of other machines. We have to look to the United States and Canadai f we arc I am glad to know that the inventive 1 genius of this country has been equal to making some improvements. We are adapting ourselves to our own needs, and are producing implements that are more in accord with American types. ought to be encouraged. agree with the honourable member, but for the sake of hypothetical encouragement, I am not prepared to lock out implements from America. Under the old Tariff, something like £162,000 worth of this ported last year, of which £140,000 worth came from countries other than Great Britain-mainl y from Canada, and the United States. The Tariff Commission, composed of free-traders and protec1 tionists, investigated this matter upon evidence submitted to them, and considered not only the interests of producers, but also of manufacturers. The protectionist section of the Commission agreed to recommend a duty of 12 per cent, upon 1 these protected lines, whilst the free traders proposed a duty of io per cent, on most lines, and 15 per cent, on a few. The interests of the primary producers must be considered as well as 'those of the manufacturers, and I trust that honourable members will see their way to adopt the amendment of the honourable member for Indi.",51,Pairs

398,Mr Thomas Brown,"I quiteI should like to point out that the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission were prepared to recommend a high duty of 20 per cent, on a certain group of agricuitural, horticultural, and viticultural machinery and implements' that it was considered were entitled to such protection. We recommended that implements and machines should be divided into three groups. cluded implements and machines invented Australia, stump-jump ploughs, strippers, disc cultivators, horse and other power winnowers, combined corn sheller, husker and bagger, combined corn sheller and husker. recommended that the duty on that group should be 25 per cent. group, which we recommended should be dutiable at 20 per cent., we placed ordinary or common-place implements and machines, namely, ploughs (other), plough shares, harrows, cultivators n.e.i., chaffcutters arid horse gear, scarifiers, castings malleable and other, plough mouldboards, wholly or partly prepared, corn shellers and corn huskers. third group should consist of lighter and less expensive implements, specialties, & c , namely, articles not otherwise enumerated, and that they should be dutiable, as under the old Tariff, at 12 per cent. The last1 named group is substantially covered by the item now under consideration,and, although I have listened carefully to this debate, I have heard no statement of fact to justify any alteration in the opinion which I and miy protectionist colleagues formed, that the duty should be 12 per 1 cent. tion of the Commission recommend a duty sof 15 per cent. ? a general classification of the whole scheme of duties, ranging from 5 per cent, on raw materials to 10 and 15 per cent a cast-iron system of duties which it is evident would never work, and which apparently has been abandoned. We pointed out in our report that with reference to the third groupLight and less expensive tools and appliances as well as specialties', parts, and novel and exsupport of certain newspapers. perimental improvements which have originated in other countries and for which there is a limited demandshould be subject to a lower rate'of duty than prevailed upon such high-class machines as harvesters, which were either invented here, or highly specialized and made in Australia, which we thought justified a higher duty than 12 per cent. I see no 1 reason for altering that opinion, and shall support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Indi. [5.49-j -I think it is a pity that the Government have not decided to at once give In the first group we in the House a holiday, so that some honourable members who were returned as protecor specially improved in tionists may recuperate and come back in namely, . stripper-harvesters, a normal state of mind, prepared to work up to the true protectionist standard. 1 am afraid that many protectionists are assisting free-traders to make the duties We upon manufactured articles as low as possible, in order that the level now fixed may In the second be taken as a standard when we are dealing later on with certain other items. We have heard a great deal as to what can and cannot be manufactured in Australia. If there is anything in this item that cannot be produced here, I think that Australia might just as well cease to attempt to manufacture anything. Those who talk so much about the primary producers We decided that the ought to declare at once that we should wipe out the whole of the manufacturing industries of Australia, and should assist the Labour Party to impose a stiff land tax, so that the people will be able to secure land on which to settle. the primary producer a show ?

408,Mr Mathews,"I hope so, if someclication of what the Tariff as finally passed will be. As to the implements in the item itself, the cry of those who suggest that we cannot make cane-loaders, for instance, reminds me of the story of the black gin, who said to a carpenter, ""Why, you are a funny carpenter; you can't make a jam tin."" Then, again, is the mechanism of garden rollers, which are included in the item, so complicated that it is impossible for them to be made in Australia? Why the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission should have included the implements named in this item in the lowest group, I cannot understand. To my mind, the lowest range of duties should' apply only to those machines or commodities that cannot be manufactured in Australia. I am satisfied that all the implements covered by this item can be manufactured here, and that local competition will prevent high prices prevailing. Even the leader of the Opposition has admitted that the majority of honourable members of this House were returned pledged to protection, but apparently he knew when he made the admission that he could secure the support of certain protectionists to a proposal that the protec1 tion granted should be at the lowest ebb. I repeat that unless the Government can obtain the passing of more highly protective duties than they . are securing just now, they should consider the desirableness of at once giving the House a holiday, so that at least some honourable members may come back with a better sense of their duty as protectionists.

It is most ominous that the Treasurer should now suggest a postponement. in a hazy way,, that the postponement is in view of the production of a memorandum which the Prime Minister promised me three or four weeks ago would be laid on the table.

All the industries which seek the assistance of the Tariff ought to come under the new protection. I remember hearing members of the Labour Party say that they were not much in favour of giving We are told, Tariff assistance, unless the benefits were shared by the employees and also by the consumers.

The maker out. treasurer has moved to eliminate sheepshearing machines from this item, with the intention, I presume, of including them in item 164. The honourable member for Grey 'has declared that he is not prepared to tax the tools of trade of the shearer any more than the tools of trade of other industries. I intend to support the industry which manufactures these tools of trade. The sheep-shearing machine which has been exhibited to the Committee, is exceedingly well made, and, seeing that £12,000 has been invested in the industry, it is certainly deserving of encouragestances. The 10 per cent, duty amounts ment. The hat industry has received substantial port the Treasurer in his desire to include this article in another item, and to impose a high duty upon it. The local shearing machine is the Moffat-Virtue patent, and it might be given the benefit of a duty in view of the duties agreed to on woollens and hats. -The Treasurer is asking the Committee to do business in a very unbusinesslike way when he comes forward at the last moment with inside information with respect to this shearing machine which should certainly have been placed before honourable members a long time ago. We should be told what is the output and the capacity of the company in order that we may know to what extent the pastoralists are to be taxed for their benefit. I heard one person say that these machines run hot, and that the Wolseley machine has a better joint. examine the machine, they will find that the principal patent is in the joint as the combs -and cutters are a very old device. I have here a list of the sheds in which the local machine is used, and' it includes about 200 in New South Wales and a smaller number in Victoria. If we assume that it is used in 400 sheds altogether, that would represent not more than 10 per cent, of the total number of sheds in Australia. So that the Treasurer asks the Committee to tax 90 per cent, of the pastoralists of the Commonwealth for' the benefit of the makers of this particular machine. can look after themselves. probably said in the most straightforward way, "" I cannot make the combs and cutters, but if you put a tax on the other parts of the machine, I shall be very much obliged to you,"" and the Treasurer appears to have said, "" Very good, that seems .1 straightforward proposition. I will do it."" I should be prepared to agree to a duty if it could be shown that the local company can turn out a sufficient . number of good machines. With regard to cream separators, they are on an entirely different footing. They are purchased by people who, in many cases, are far from being in good circumto about 15 per cent, to the consumer, and assistance, and I shall supmeans something like £ 3 on each machine. That is a pretty heavy tax. Cream separators of English make are no good, and as tlie honourable member for Grey has said, the Danish or Swedish separators are almost universally used. For the same reason as that for which the Treasurer proposes to put a duty on shearing machines, he should taket he duty off cream separators. The honourable gentleman would do well either to lower the duty proposed on cream separators or to put them on the free list. here the hand-piece of the shearing machine made locally, and I am somewhat surprised to find that it was not made in the Commonwealth at all.

I do not think in the circumstances that we are justified in imposing a tax on these machines. It would be far better to postpone the decision on the question.

Others have since endeavoured to copy the Wolselev machine, but in the opinion of shearers* generally it is, for all-round efficiency, far above all other shearing machines. I have here the hand-piece of a shearing machine of the Moffatt-Virtue patent. One might be led to believe that, with the exception of the combs and cutters, it was made in Australia, but the card attached to it saysNot yet manufactured in Australia, although only a question of a little time when it can also be made at the works in Sydney. piece only. but it includes the intricate mechanism. On such slight evidence as has been put before the Committee, the Treasurer proposes that this particular piece of mechanism, which is of great importance to the pastoral industry, shall be transferred from an item under which it would be dutiable at 10 per cent., to another, under which it would be dutiable at 30 per cent., with a view to encourage the manufacture of the article in Australia at some future time. ister, in the case of almost every piece of machinery that is not made here, will always find some one who says that -he is ready to make it , provided that it is put upon the high Tariff' list. In the meanwhile, the industry which uses the machinehas to suffer. That is a w a y of getting revenue out of the primary industries that I do not care for. Should this firm demonstrate that they can make the machine, and are making it , and putting a good workable article upon the market, they may reasonably ask for consideration from this Chamber; but it is preposterous to come along with the statement that in a little while the machine will be made here, and with a request for a 30 per cent. duty.

This is history repeating itself. Thei n ventor of this machine happened to be a constituent of mine. He was the late Mr Wolseley, of Cobram station, now owned by Janet Lady Clarke. He had to meet the same prejudice, which existed then in a more modified form, as, I am sorry to say, exists in Australia to-day. With his practical knowledge, as a sheep-owner, of shearing and sheep grazing, he tried his best in Australia to induce Australians to take up his invention, but he absolutely failed, because, then as now, there were in Australia those who said, "" You cannot invent anything in Australia."" Like Brennan, Whitehead, and almost every other Australian inventor, Mr Wolseley was driven out of Australia by the prejudice of free-traders. ' These gentlemen had to go to England and the Continent to place their inventions which, when they are in the hands of monopolists, are brought back and foisted upon the people of Australia at an enhanced price. on that invention? remark, because, as the honourable member knows.

He told us of an interview with could not be made here, but that the other certain manufacturers, and laid on the parts could. table a sample of one of these sheep clippers. This provoked the honourable member for Dalley to deliver a most interesting address about the employment The honourable member for given to moulders and finishers.

The sheep-shearing machine itself has never been made in Australia. The ticket attached to the sample whicli I have speaks of it as not yet manufactured in Australia, but says that it is only a question of a little time when it will be'made here. It is not only a question of time, but also of money and of fools. I do not feel annoyed when the Treasurer gives us no information, although that seems to irritate members of the Opposition; but I protest most emphatically against statements which are absolutely misleading. I admire good workmanship, and, on the strength of what he told the Committee,. I was prepared to protect the industry, and so, too, was the honourable member for Dalley. Now it appears that the machine is not made here at all.

When the honourable member for Darling said 'he had been misled, and would have to reverse his vote, there was not a word from the Minister.

There is no need for any anger. and that is that free-traders have no right to be lobbying about the House. to challenge the Government to have the galleries cleared of evervbody who is here on business connected with the Tariff. It seems to be the correct thing for the maker of this instrument to erect it in Parliament House; at any rate, the other day I saw it being erected in the passage-way.

I hope that gentleman has a right to come to see me; at any rate, he has a good case, which I shall represent when we arrive at the proper item. Since the matter of lobbying has been raised, I think some steps should be taken, even to asking Mr Speaker to exclude all those persons from the precincts of Parliament, so that we may discuss the Tariff free from influences which no doubt have effect.
