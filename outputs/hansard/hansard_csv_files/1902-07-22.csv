I communicated with the Postmaster-General, and after waiting several days I received a reply to the effect that no change could be made. The people of Queenstown then gave orders that their telephones should be taken down. This will involve the department in a loss of .£700 per annum, which will not be recouped by means of the Telegraph department, because the business between the two towns will not warrant the expense of sending telegrams. I find that subscribers to the telephone system in Melbourne can communicate with the outlying suburbs, such as St. Kilda and AVindsor, without any extra charge. phone from Melbourne to Mordialloc, a bers of Parliament have the privilege of distance of 16 miles. MrO ' MALLEY I protest against the revenue-destroying proclivities of the Government. I do not know how many telephones have actually been taken down in Queenstown, but the order went out that all should be removed, and twenty were taken away in one afternoon. Regulations suitable to a large city like Melbourne are not adapted to the circumstances of a mining town, because in the latter case the residents can communicate with each other without much difficulty, and can very well dispense with the telephone. I desire to enter my protest against such a foolish and bungling regulation. I have another cause of complaint. As a member of this Parliament I desired to communicate with the Postmaster-General upon a matter of public business, and instead of being allowed to send a telegram free of cost I had to put my hand in my pocket and pay for it . able member ?

Sir WILLIAM LYNE I never heard of it. MrO ' MALLEY I am afraid there are a good many things that the Minister has not heard of. A member of the Eederal Parliament should not be called upon to pay for telegramS despatched fo the Postmaster General or other Ministers upon public business. On the occasion referred to I was endeavouring to save the Commonwealth £700 per annum, and I should not have been compelled to put my hand in my own pocket. I am in a worse position as a member of the Commonwealth Parliament than is a member of the Tasmanian Legislature. In Canada, and in the United communicating free of cost with Ministers upon matters of public business. This applies even to cases in which the telegraph lines are held by private companies. The whole system of federation was based upon the idea of uniting the people and improving their means of communication, but the administration is working in an opposite direction. Unless the causes of complaint to which I have directed attention are removed, I shall strongly advocate the abolition of all franking and other privileges. One of the results'of the present condition of affairs is that federal members are being ignored, and the electors are relying on the members of the local Legislatures to look after their interests. The Commonwealth member is merely a figurehead, and apparently possesses no privileges or rights whatever. had the experience of the honourable member for Tasmania, Mr O'Malley, in con"" main trunk linesf neither am I concerned 1 to represent-there are a number of sparsely populated settlements.

Indeed, some of the out-stations, which are situated. 15, 20, and even 30 miles from the head station, are regularly worked by this means. 1 think that the policy which formerly operated in New South Wales, and. for which the honourable member for Parramatta is largely responsible, seeing that he introduced these up-todate methods of communicating, isolated settlements, is one which commends itself to the people, and certainly it is worthy of the consideration of the Eederal postal authorities. transfer of the Post and Telegraph department placed before the head of that department in New South Wales applications for telephonic extension to several settlements. Some of these were approved, and others were under consideration when the transfer took place.

It reads as follows :-'Adverting to your communication of the 18th October last, and my reply thereto of 24th idem, respecting an application made through you by Mr T. Nosh, Long Plain, Navromine, secretary to the I'avvendale and Wollan Billan farmers' and Settlers' Association, for the establishment. of telephonic communication with Wallan Billan, I have the honor to inform you that under the new regulations of this department, such communication can only be provided when funds are sivailable (which is not the case at present) on the cash guarantee system, under which persons -desiring the erection of a telegraph or telephone .line are required to deposit with the Postmaster General a sum equal to two-thirds of the cost of constructing the line and supplying the instruments, plus the cost of operating same for a period ot five years, and subject to the following .conditions, namely1. The amount so deposited to be placed to the credit of the Postmaster-General, in a Government savings bank, and Mr Brown. into the Postmaster-General to have power These facilito withdraw at the end of each complete year a sum equal to the difference between (a) the telegraph (or telephone) revenue derived from such line during that year, and (b) one-fifth of two-thirds of the cost of constructing the line, plus the total cost .of operating for such year. 2. At the expiration of the term offiveyears the amount of the deposit, with inter-. est allowed thereon by the Government savings bank authorities, less any sum or sums deducted as above, to be returned to the guarantors. The cash deposit required for a line between Wallan BalUiu and Narromine, via Farrendule, would be about £688 (is. 8d., namely £623 6s. 8d. -two-third s of tbe estimated cost of the neceswith sary line and instruments, and £65-the cost of operating, if fixed at £13 per annum.

To the west of Dandaloo is another settlement known, as Lansdale, and whilst the honourable member for Parramatta was Postmaster-General of New SouthI have in my' WalesI applied to him on behalf of the settlers there for telephonic communication with Dandaloo. An estimate was made, and only a simple guarantee was asked for. No arbitrary condition, such as the enforced payment of a sum of money into the bank .to the credit of the Postmaster-General, was imposed. In connection with that work, which involved the construction of 30 miles of line, all that was asked for was a guarantee of between £ 6 0 and £ 7 0 . The settlers, however, were rather afraid to face such an obligation. I ascertained that the postal revenue derived from the settlement exceeded the cost of the mail service, and upon representations beingmade to him the Postmaster-General decided to place the surplus as a set-off against any loss incurred in connection with the establishment of the telegraphic or telephonic service. The result of the adoption of this enlightened policy was that the settlers were required to give a",17,Adjournment Telephoxe Reculations
25,Mr Thomson,What is the distance 1,18,Adjournment Telephoxe Reculations
26,Mr Brown,"It is something like 30guarantee of only as originally suggested. This guarantee was readily forthcoming; the line was constructed, and has proved to be revenue producing from, its inception. Indeed, the income from this source exceeded the anticipations of those who were interested in the carrying out of the work, so that the guarantors have never been called upon to pay anything. For the past five or six years that settlement has enjoyed the advantages of this up-to-date means of communication. There is another little settlement in the same class of .country which has to contend with similar obstacles. -Under the new regulations, its residents will be required to place a sum of £631 in the Savings Bank to the credit of the Postmaster-General as a guarantee that the department will not suffer loss by providing these facilities. This money will continue to lie in the bank for five years, even if the Minister who supervises this important deline prove a payable one. From my experience of these back-country settlements, I claim that it should be the aim of the Federal Government to afford them means of communication which will assist settlement and render the advantages of civilization accessible. It is lamentable to think that, should an accident occur in an isolated settlement where there are women and children, the only way of communicating with the nearest medical man, who is perhaps 30 or 40 miles distant, is by messenger on horseback. I unhesitatingly affirm that the policy adopted by New South Wales in this connection was an enlightened one, whilst that of the Federal Government is a retrogressive one. The demands which are now being made upon the small settlement to which I have referred will absolutely prevent the settlers from securing the advantages which they have hitherto enjoyed. If this sort of thing does, not make federation stink in the nostrils of the country people nothing will do so. I think that the Government will be acting wisely if they review the regulations and -see whether it is not possible to frame them on the enlightened lines adopted by the postal authorities in New South Wales prior to the transfer of that department to the Commonwealth. I have other communications of a similar character. I asked for a short extension from the telegraph station of Ungarie to a small settlement at Bena. That would have been carried, out under the old system of a guarantee of something like -£30, instead of £ 6 0 , £30, the distance, being not nearly so large as in the case I have mentioned Communications which I hold in my hand are similar to the one I have read, with the difference that in this case £2.51 13s. 4d, is required to be placed to the credit of the Postmaster-General. In the interests of the settlements I have mentioned I hope the Government will see their way to alter the regulations. Mr G. B. EDWARDS (South Sydney). It was inevitable that some such discussion as this must take place sooner or later. There is a great deal of dissatisfaction with the administration of the Postiil department, the regulations not. being what we were led to expect when a re-organization was entered upon. Much difficulty has been caused in my own constituency ; and I think that we suffer through not having in this House the partment. The only opportunity hitherto afforded in discussing these matters has been on the Estimates, and, under the circumstances, there has not been that criticism for which the administration calls. I am inclined to think that it would have been better had the motion taken a wider form, and had the whole question been fully ventilated. Under the regulations any 25 persons can, on application, obtain a telephone exchange; but in Redfern, which is the most important centre in my district, there is no exchange, and when application was made, the answer given was that there was already a connection with another exchange two or three miles away. The whole conduct of some of the exchanges shows an unwarrantable lack of administrative ability. Redfern is tacked on to a less important station at a distance, though the former is a business centre larger than Richmond in Victoria. Richmond. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -The absence of an exchange in Redfern is not the only difficulty. There is no exchange in the whole of my electorate, which is one-fourth the size of the city of Sydney, the only communication being with other stations which are already congested with business. If the department had any business ability, they would consider the question of re-organizing ""the exchanges and distributing the work. Another important point is that sufficient regard is not had to the object of",18,Adjournment Telephoxe Reculations
27,Mr Tudor,"There is no exchange atmaking the department pay. I am perfectly certain that the want of communication will prevent the business paying as it would pay if iii the hands of business men. In. Redfern, Botany, Alexandra, all flourishing manufacturing districts in my electorate, people would make much more use of the telephone if an exchange were established in their midst. scriber wishes to communicate with a man living, perhaps, only two blocks away, he has to ring up an' exchange four or five miles distant. re-organization from top to bottom. first place, this House does not seem to have enough power of criticism in the absence of the Minister; secondly, there is no uniformity of system throughout the Commonwealth ; and thirdly, there is required some power of decentralization under which the local .Deputy Postmasters-General will be able to deal with trumpery details, the settlement of which is at present postponed from time to time in order that they may be referred to head-quarters, where business appears to be congested. I pointed out to the Deputy General of Sydney the disgracefully dirty condition of a certain post-oifice in Redfern. That office was so dirty that, had it been in the hands of private people, it would have been condemned by the local authorities : and I believe complaints on this score are also made in regard to the post-offices in Sydney and Melbourne. in connection with local offices have to be referred to the in Melbourne, even though only £50 may be required for repairs. seems to be blunder after blunder. my district the department shut up two offices which had heen in existence for a number of years, and were paying, and it was only after strong representations permission was given to continue the business at these offices pending an ultimate decision. All these matters should be dealt with in a business-like spirit. The more facilities, in reason, which are given, the more business there will be, and the more revenue will result. A deputation waited on the Deputy Postmaster-General in Sydney the other day, when this matter was referred to, and that gentleman was reported as having passed some reflections on the difficulties which were in the way. The Deputy master General, however, ported ; what he said was that Mr G. IJ. Edward*. was always a great deal of difficulty in referring matters to head quarters. In any big private business details would be left to the local representative. The Waterloo, honourable member for Tasmania, Mr O'Malle}', is perfectly justified in bringing this matter before the House in order that the Government may know that throughAt present if a subout the length and breadth of the States there is a feeling of dissatisfaction, and a desire that the department should be reorganized on business-like lines. I underThe department seems to require stand that the Postmaster-General has been In the asked to make a business-like statement of the results of the administration under the Commonwealth: and, if he did so, the information given would prove a useful guide to this House, because we should, in all probability, be shown where revenue is lost through want of better management. Sir JOHN QUICK (Bendigo) -Actua l experience has disclosed a number of serious anomalies and absurdities in connection with the regulations of the 5th June, 1902. We must, of course, give credit to the Postal Only the other day authorities for the best of intentions in Postmasterpromulgating these new regulations. No doubt the variety of conditions which had to be dealt with account for some of the complaints which have been made. The honourable member for Tasmania, Mr. O'Malley, has drawn attention to an anomaly which requires some explanation. In the regulations there does not appear to All such matters as these be a definition of what is to constitute a trunk line or long-distance telephone. The Postmaster-General distance may be a mile or two, or 25 miles -ther e is no limit. Some effort should There certainly be made to attain uniformity, and In a definition given of what is to constitute a trunk line, on which these special charges are made. It does seem absurd that the line between Queenstown and Gorthat manston, which are only two and a half miles apart, should be treated as a trunk line, w'hile the lines in other States between many towns which are five or six miles apart, come within anothercategory. I have no doubt that now attention has been drawn to the matter, steps will be taken to rectify the anomaly. I take the opportunity of reviving a question which was brought under the notice of the Postmaster-General a fortnight ago by a large deputation, representing the people Postof Bendigo, Ballarat, and Geelong, in was misreregard so the time limit on trunk lines. there Hitherto in A ictoria the time limit has 7 been five minutes, and the charge between, say,' Melbourne and Bendigo, Is. 6d. cut down to three minutes, and the view of the deputation was that the latter is utterly inadequate when it is desired to conduct important business transactions. The brokers of Bendigo and Ballarat, and the merchants of Geelong, pointedout that in many cases it was utterly impossible to complete a conversation and make it effective within that time. trunk line between Newcastle and Sydney is three minutes, and there is a big business done. everywhere, except in Victoria. Sir JOHN QUICK people have been trained, and are accustomed, to five minutes. I believe that in many cases it is difficult for a subscriber, say, in Melbourne, to get in communication with a subscriber in Ballarat. It may happen that the business man at Ballarat is in the exchange, and by the time he has been found and ' brought to the telephone, one or two of the minutes .have elapsed, with the result that the conversation is rendered abortive by its being cut off in the middle. I am aware that the Postmaster General said that in other countries the limit is three minutes; but, as a compromise, the deputation suggested a regulation to the effect that a subscriber might have the option of extending the conversation for five minutes, on paying an extra proportionate charge. The Postmaster-General took a note of the suggestion, which he promised to consider. and learned member say that a subscriber is arbitrarily cut off at the end of three minutes, whether or not the conversation is finished ? desire on the part of subscribers to monopolise the wire, and hence the suggestion to the Postmaster-General. In all probability three minutes will be sufficiently long in many cases; but it is desired to have the option of extending the time to five minutes on the condition I have indicated. hope the Attorney-General will support the view which I am now presenting, or, at any rate, bring it under the notice of the Postmaster-General. As a result of the reduced time limit, business on the long distance 4.1 u telephones has fallen off considerably. If the public demand increased time for the That five minutes has now been discharge of business and are prepared to pay for that time, their demand ought to be met, and if one line is not sufficient, another ought to be erected. There are many points in the regulations which require revision, and the Postmaster-General ought to welcome these observations and criticisms, which are intended to meet the requirements and the convenience of the public more apparent every .day that it would be an advantage to honourable members here,, who more particularly represent localities, to have the Postmaster-General's departmentrepresented in this branch of the Legislature. I suppose, however, that the absence of"" In Victoria the that Minister cannot be remedied untilanother Government is in -office; so that we may dismiss the matter, at any rate foia time. I think that the Postal department is taking the proper course in insisting upon a cash deposit of some kind from those who ask for these lines, because I know that, while in New South Wales a written guarantee to make good any probable deficiency was required, deficiencies occurred times without number, and in no case were the guarantors; asked to pay the money for the payment of which they had rendered themselves-.. responsible. ber is wrongly informed. When I was Postmaster-General the department collected money from guarantors in some cases. General assured me the other day that he did not remember an instance in which money so'guaranteed had been collected, and I know of many instances in which it has not been collected. It is folly to pretend to place the administration of the department upon a business footing, and not takeordinary business precautions. But I have a letter here, which I have received from, the department in regard to a suggested telephone line, which seems to me to go to the other extreme. The department ask,, in connection with an application for a telephone line in my district, not only to be guaranteed the payment of two-thirds of the I cost of construction, but also for the placing in the bank of a sum of moucy to"" cover the estimated cost of five years' working of the line, although they admit in the letter itself that the estimated revenue should more than cover expenses.

Some weeks ago the Secretary to the Post Office informed me that a regulation, which would permit of the licensing for use in -connection with the Commonwealth services of lines erected in the cheapest manner possible by the people whom they were to serve, was under consideration. adopted,' I am convinced that small populations 'can be connected with the Commonwealth lines practically without cost to the Government, and without the need for the ordinary guarantees. and, I dare say, it is the same in other districts-the fences to carry telephone wires being taken over gateways and roads upon poles. I have spoken over such lines with the greatest satisfaction, and on two occasions to places 40 miles distant. eagle is a township in my electorate ten miles distant from Young, but onlythree or four miles from the nearest telegraph line, which runs along the railway. If the fences were used to carry, the wire the township could be connected with Young, irrespective of the cost of instruments, for, perhaps, £10 or £15 ; whereas the department ask for a guarantee of £173, which is' not likely to be raised by so small a community. therefore, that the Minister will see the desirability of promptly proclaiming regulations which will permit of telephone extensions of the kind to which I refer. I am satisfied that in nearly every case that will .get over the difficulty of guarantees, aud that the lines will be found quite sufficient for -ordinary business for the present, at all events. tain point, it will be possible for the department to put up a permanent line, and to take over the whole work. In nearly every instance in which telephonic, connection is asked for, the working expenses would be more than covered by the revenue received, and if the department is not asked to undertake the construction of an expensive line, I do not see that any guarantee need be 3fr.

Therefore, whenurge upon the Government, in the most friendly manner, the desirability of revising the regulations under which telephones may be extended into, country districts. Under But I the New South Wales State system those living in country districts could obtain telephone connexions by simply guaranteeing the payment of interest upon the cost of construction-, and general maintenance, but now they are being called upon to deposit in cash two-thirds of the actual cost of constructing the line and supplying If that system is the instruments, plus the cost of operating the same for a period of five years, before the work will be undertaken at all. smaller districts are not able, to find the local squatters use their large amount of money which is generally lines, the necessary, although they would be willing to enter into a legal guarantee to become responsible for the interest on the cost of construction, and working expenses. I Monthave here a letter from the department, dated 16th July, which deals with an application for an extension which is two or three years old. Before the department was taken over by the Commonwealth, I had prevailed upon the New South Wales authorities to practically agree to the erection of the line. If it had been erected then, the guarantors would have been called upon to find, speaking from memory, I trust, something like £ 2 S a year, but they are now being asked by the department to pay £ 4 0 3 into the Savings Bank to the credit of the Postmaster-General. Such a request is absurd and outrageous. As the honourable member for Bland has suggested, if the Government cannot see their way to alter this regulation, they should allow people residing in distant parts of the When the traffic increases to a cercountry, to whom the telephone is the only adjunct of civilization which they enjoy, to undertake the construction of lines for themselves, to ultimately become the property of the Government.

I have put other cases before the Postmaster-General, but without avail. There appears to be some cast-iron rule in the department from which it is impossible to get away, and advice, no matter how tendered, is practicall}' ignored. WheneverI have given advice to the department I have done so in a spirit of friendliness. I have not asked them to do anything unreasonable in view of the necessities of revenue, but have tried to prevail on them to do what will benefit the people of the country. But whatever I have put before the Postmaster General has been quietly ignored, until I am pretty well tired of it, and much resent it . I am ashamed to send this letter on to the people interested in the matter to which it refers, and I have in my pocket Another letter of the same tenor. I am sorry the Postmaster-General is not a member of this House, so that we could put these matters directly before him. The' present state of affairs is giving serious dissatisfaction in New South Wales, and this dissatisfaction will increase if some alteration is not made. Itkeotherhonorable.memberSjhavesomepostal grievances, and I think that it is time they were seriously looked into by the Postmaster General, so that they may be remedied, because it is no pleasure to us to have to anthem so constantly. The new regulations which have been published are altogether of a retrograde character. Honourable members have been asking for uniformity, but the uniformity which has been obtained is all in the direction of retrogression. The honourable and learned member for Bendigo complains that the time limit on the line between Melbourne and Bendigo has been reduced from five to three minutes, upon the ground that three minutes is the limit elsewhere. I remember that when the first long-distance telephone was opened in New South Wales, the time limit was fixed at three minutes, because the officers of the department told me that that, was the recognised limit elsewhere. The honourable and learned member was similarly informed that the time allowance was to be cut down to three minutes, because that was the rule elsewhere. Wouldi t not be wise to err on the side of conferring additional advantages upon the public, rather than to limit the facilities afforded to them ? This is a purely business question, 41 E i and the greater facilities that can be extended to the public, the more we shall popularize the service, and the more profitable it will become. Too great a tendency is being shown to square accounts, but that is not the way in which the department can be made to pay. The balance may be squared very quickly, if that is the only object ; but if reasonable facilities are denied to the public, the balance will very soon be on the wrong side. When I proposed to reduce the telephone fees in Sydney, I was told by the officers of the department that we should incur a heavy loss, but during the twelve months immediately following the reduction in the charges, the business of the department was trebled, and it paid handsomely. The more business-like the administration, the greater the chance of success for the department. I do not agree with the honourable member for Bland that a,cash guarantee should be given.

The point to which I desire specially to refer is that mentioned by the honourable and learned member for Bendigo, namely, the three minutes' limit. Complaints have been made in Queensland, especially where long distance telephones are in use. In the case of Warwick, which is about 169 miles from .Brisbane, a fee of 2s. 6d. has to be paid for the privilege of conversing by telephone for three minutes. As a rule the telephone is used by merchants to settle the prices of goods which have been ordered by their customers. .During these conversations, invoices have to be consulted perhaps,' and before any conclusion can be arrived at, the persons conversing are rung off. Then a delay occurs, and they have to be reconnected in order that the business may be concluded, the charge made for the extended time bringing the total fee up to 5s. The people in Warwick think that it would be fair and reasonable if a reduced charge were made for the extension of the time beyond the first three minutes. South Wales. MrL . E, GROOM -It is not so in Queensland. It has been represented to me by the Chamber of Commerce and by the municipal authorities in Warwick either that the charge should be reduced, or that a reduced charge of, say, Is. 3d. should be made for the extra minutes required to carry on long conversations. An increase of the facilities in this way would undoubtedly lead to an enlarged business and an improvement in the revenue. Mr' WATKINS (Newcastle) I desire to There is no more reason for demanding a cash guarantee in connection with the construction of a telephone line than in the case of the erection of post-offices, or the carrying out of any other works for the public convenience. Officers are employed by the Post and Telegraph department tb ascertain whether certain lines will pay, and I do not know of any cases in which a telephone service has been extended without a fair assurance of Sufficient revenue. In several cases where the reports showed that the lines would yield a substantial return over and above the working expenses, the department have absolutely refused to provide a service. telephones the authorities have absolutely though the returns show that the construction of a second line would pay handsomely. Another hardship to which I would direct attention consists in compelling a private subscriber, who desires to speak from his place of business to another centre over a trunk line, to pay threepence for connecting him with such line. That practice has never previously been adopted. to make the lines pay. they are pursuing a wrong course. If they intend to harass people instead of assisting them the result must be disastrous to the department. Moreover, business people very frequently find it impossible to finish a conversation upon an important subject within the three minutes prescribed by the regulations, and in such circumstances it is only reasonable that they should be allowed an additional two minutes at a reduced rate. General) I regret the absence of my honourable colleague, Sir Philip Eysh, who is better informed upon this subject than I am, although upon a debate of this character the intention of honourable members is rather to make suggestions than to engage in any final discussion upon the merits or demerits of specific practices. In its essence the question is the old one, as to the extent to which the State is justified in providing telephonic facilities with a view to increasing not only the public convenience but the public revenue. It is difficult to determine the exact point at which we should decomplain of the new regulations. clare"" Beyond this the advantages confer led upon the public will not be commensurate with the loss imposed upon the taxpayer."" Exactly where that line should be drawn will always be a matter of contention. The views of honourable members will be influenced by the practice ' which formerly existed in their respective States, and by the density of population in the districts from which they come.

52,Mr Deakin (Ballarat,"Attorneywhich he established were to be applied to portions of Australia as different as are Western Australia and Tasmania from New South Wales and Queensland. My honourable colleague, the Postmaster-General and his advisers, were thus placed in a delicate position. ' Different practices existed in the six different States, and we had to adopt that one, or some amendment of it, which seemed likely to apply fairly in an average way throughout the Commonwealth. I have listened in vain to-day for either ' some protest or approbation from representatives of those States which are receiving enhanced benefits as compared with those which they formerly enjoyed. There arc many such benefits. The rates which are now charged are lower than they were previously in these States, and the time during which the public can engage in telephonic conversation has been extended. Of course we hear nothing of these advantages. But from those Statesi n which reduced facilities are now given we naturally hear a cry of alarm. It has to be discounted by the fact that it is inevitable in the initial stages of establishing a uniform system throughout Australia. The honourable member who moved the adjournment comes from a Statei n which the people have been treated most liberally in telephonic matters. Consequently there need be no surprise at the tentative discontent which is engendered in bringing that State up to the Australian standard. The particular matter which aroused the honorable member's wrath has met with its due reward. Instructions have been given which will enable the two great centres of the West Coast to communicate with each other directly without the necessity for sending their messages over a main trunk line. lege given in one case ? will turn to the regulation referred to by the so. It is to be applied only in cases where honourable and learned member for Bendigo they will find that no minimum distance was fixed below which a line would cease to be a trunk line. The words used are "" 25 miles in length or under."" Therefore, a line a foot long might be termed a trunk line. It was the endeavor of the Postmaster-General to decentralize that led to the curious anomaly in Tasmania. The Deputy Postmasters-General were allowed to determine what, according to the practice of their respective States, were trunk lines. The complaint which the honourable member has made is due to the fact that the Tasmanian authorities denominated this particular line on the west coast of that State a trunk line. In structions have now been given that where two small settlements are concerned no line under five miles in length is to be regarded as a trunk line, whilst in the case of cities the minimum has been extended to ten miles. The honourable member for Parramatta was in error when he declared that the three minutes limit was not of universal application. So far as the postal authorities are aware there is not a line outside of Victoria where three minutes is not the ordinaiy limit. country people are allowed to use the telephone for more than three minutes. is universal because 70 or 80 per cent, of the conversations in which business people engage consist merely of a question and a reply. That period is also fixed with a view to preventing a monopoly of the line. Otherwise it would be sometimes possible for a few men to get possession of a telephone line ,to the exclusion of their rivals. The Postmaster-General has been impressed with the good case made out by the honourable and learned member for Bendigo and others in favour of an extension of the three minutes limit to five minutes, at a reduced charge for' the last two minutes. That appears to be a reasonable suggestion, and I have every reason for believing that he will shortly make a concession in that direction. The other series of complaints by honourable members had reference to the deposits required in connection with the construction of certain telephone lines. that this new condition is to apply to the If honourable members construction of all such lines. Buti t is not the estimated revenue is not considered sufficient to justify the erection of a line.

But, unless some such restriction is imposed, many deserving localities will be denied proper facilities for communication. There must necessarily be discrimination, in justice to the various communities interested ; and the communities which offer the best results have the first claim to be heard, and must be first considered by the Postmaster-General. The honourable member for Bland appears to have received some very proper encouragement in submitting his proposal. think it came from some one in the department. the honourable member has referred appears to meet with approval in the department and to offer a satisfactory means of escape for those in the back-country, with whose conditions it is most difficult to deal. There, in many cases, those concerned will be satisfied with simpler appliances, which the Government simply dare not erect as their own, and expedients may be devised to work well for some time. The people will take advantage of natural conditions and circumstances to obtain short cuts so as to reduce expenditure, and thus, with the assent and assistance of the departs ment, obtain the privileges which they desire to enjoy without imposing any burden on the public purse. This plan seems to offer great opportunities for development, and I trust that amongst the amendments made in the regulations will be included some for promoting and encouraging self-help in this connection throughout Australia. But I do not say, even apart from this matter, that it ought to be necessary to insist on so large a deposit in the great bulk of the instances which come before the Post-office authorities. The proposed guarantee, however, was a very good basis on which to start-o n which to lay down in a business-like cash fashion a principle which would have the effect of bringing home to the public what their responsibilities were. I have not the least doubt that the representations made by the honourable member for Cowper and other honourable members will have due effect, and will not be passed over, as that honourable member appears to think they have been. We have as a basis these regulations framed with the best knowledge and judgment the department possesses, but not proposed as representing the completed regulations which must ultimately be evolved. Honourable members, Australian born as many are, and all Australian residents, have yet but a very imperfect conception of the enormous area of this great continent, of the immense diversity of its conditions, or the absolute contradistinctions which obtain. There is but superficial appreciation of the difficulty of moving the people of the different States out of the grooves into which they have grown in regard to expenditures of public money. It is not my proposal; I General sits down we shall all apologize for speaking. The proposal to which for speaking is that honourable members have given me such good material. I shall' have great pleasure in submitting the several representations which have been made. As to some of these representations, I know that they will be accepted, and as to the others I am sure they will be considered. W it h the assistance of the HouseI hope we shall obtain, if not entirely satisfactory regulations-that is beyond the dream of the most ambitious politician-jus t and workable provisions, fair to the people of Australia as a whole. The -task of framing regulations so minute as these must necessarily be, capable of meeting the needs of 4,000,000 of people spread over the whole of this enormous continent, is one in the performance of which difficulties must be discovered. Defects may readily be forgiven by members of this House, who are to some extent, at all events, acquainted with the innumerable and almost insuperable difficulties to be encountered in Federal administration and legislation. we have good reason to believe that this discussion has come rather as a surprise to the Attorney-General. able members. I am hopeful that what has been said to-day will have due effect in inducing the Postmaster-General to remedy the defects which have been described, and to apply up-to-date regulations, more in accordance with a progressive policy.

64,Mr Hartnoll,"W it h other honorwith less advantages than those possessed by many other parts of the Commonwealththere were the most liberal conditions connected with the telephone service: and yet the postal and telegraphic service, when handed over, was producing a surplus revenue amounting to £16,000 a year. That ought to prove to the Attorney General, that if, instead of a retrogressive policy, there had been adopted the policy of Tasmania, the revenue from the telephonic service throughout the Commonwealth would be beyond the present expectations of the Government. There is an intense feeling of disappointment in Tasmania in regard to these regulations, and I hope they will be speedily altered. arid in the press it is constantly said that the desire is to encourage our primary industries. On the banks of the Huon the only industry is that of growing fruit, which I am sure every honourable member desires to encourage. Yet in isolated parts of that district, perhaps 30 miles from Hobart, the telephone facilities previously enjoyed have been seriously curtailed. Formerly the producers could communicate with their agents in Hobart and get their produce shipped at considerable advantage, but under the new regulations these fruit growers have to meet an expenditure of £20, and storekeepers an expenditure of £50, in order to comply with the demands of the department. Altogether a backward -and mean policy has been adopted. In Tasmania for years farmers, squatters, and -others had, at the expense of £ 1 a year, the privilege of fixing letter-boxes on their front gates, which are, perhaps, 2 or 3 miles from the homestead. Under the regulations the charge for that privilege has been raised to £ 2 a year in order that the great Commonwealth of Australia may get more revenue. No doubt some of the squatters and others are extreme]}' wealthy, but a great number of those concerned in this convenience are poor, and it is the poorest who should be considered in such a connection. The Commonwealth could surely do without this small accession of revenue. Now that the subject has been so fully debated, J. think we may rely for some good results on the practical adaptability of the Attorney-General. MrO ' MALLEY (Tasmania), vn reply I feel grateful to honourable members for the interest they have shown in this debate. What is the object of providing that the Tasmania is not the only State which is nomination shall be signed by not less than suffering from _great wrongs under these regulations. I am glad to hear that the central Government was not responsible for the miserable bungle on the West Coast. The people of Queenstown met, and sent to the Deputy Postmaster-General a telegram placing the case before him, and he sent a reply stating that there would be no alteration-that the regulations were final. Yet the whole of the odium was placed on the Postmaster-General, and the people of the West Coast denounced the Commonwealth. It would seem, after the observations of the Attorney-General, that some officials are better fitted for the New Norfolk lunatic asylum than for running a postI n the House office. It is time that the responsibility was put on the right shoulders ; and I am glad the Government have withdrawn from all these infamies, because they are nothing less. Wherever a Government refuses to grant redress for wrong done, that Government, is on the brink of a political volcano, ten times more dangerous than Mont Pelee. Question resolved in the negative.

MrL . E. GROOM (Darling Downs) It seems to me that in the case of a State like Queensland a candidate for the Senate should not be compelled to send his nomination to the electoral officer lor the State. In Queensland, that officer would reside.in Brisbane, and it might be veryinconvenient for a candidate residing in the northern part of the State to have to send his nomination as far as Brisbane. When the last general elections were held, any returning officer in the State had power to receive nominations. Sir JOHN QUICK (Bendigo) -Thepoint raised by the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, is worthy of careful consideration. It would be very unfortunate if we inserted in this Bill a provision out of harmony with the design of the Constitution. The Constitution contemplates that the writs for the election of senators shall be issued by the States Governors, who must necessarily issue them to States officers. The question then arises, has the Commonwealth Parliament authority to appoint returning officers for the Senate? It would appear to me to be open to very strong argument that the returning officers for the Senate must be States officers. use our rolls and other inachinerv? to be arranged for as a matter of administration. The times and places for the elecI think that tion of senators must also be fixed by the States.

This clause provides that if more candidates are nominated than are required to be elected, the proceedings shall stand adjourned to the polling day, and that if no greater number are nominated the returning officer shall declare those nominated to be duly elected. But no provision is made to meet the case where a smaller number are nominated than ai:e required to be elected. Such an occurrence is extremely unlikely, but a similar case occurred in Victoria many years ago, for which no provision had been made by the electoral law, and the matter had to be referred to Parliament.

It is desirable that the fullest possible facilities should be given to voters, but this should always be consistent with a minimum of influence being exercised upon the voter. Under the old system of open voting, we know that veryT few votes were recorded without undue influence. Voting by ballot, which was designed to overcome this difficulty, first saw the light in South Australia, and it has proved very effective, because it leaves the decision of the voter absolutely secret. Notwithstanding its obvious advantages in some instances, voting by post makes an attack, although not with an evil intention, upon the system of voting by ballot, because the elector has to record his vote m the presence of certain people. that. that would affect the objection I have to any great extent. made. evidently has in mind the system in force in Victoria, but that does not apply everywhere.

McLEAN -The principle of voting by post has worked well wherever it has been tried. gather it has worked well, and I inserted the provision in the B ill with a view to affording all electors an opportunity' of voting, whether they were able to attend the ' polling booth or not. It is all very well for the honourable member for Bland to refer to Tasmania, as an example, but it must be remembered that that State is not so large as some of the electorates in other parts of the Commonwealth, and that therefore provisions which would be workable in Tasmania would be utterly unsuitable for other States. The honourable member's proposal is to enable an elector to vote at any booth in the Commonwealth, aud I would ask how it would be possible to check attempts at fraud, or impersonation ? in regard to that than in connection with the provisions under which the Minister proposes to enable electors to vote at any polling booth in the electorate to which they belong. Sir AVILL [ AMLYNE is : because in the case of an electorate which is sub-divided there are facilities for communicating from one point to another. But in the outlying parts of Queensland, the north of South Australia, the north-west of AVestern Australia, and the back portions of New South Wales, it would be impossible to ascertain within a reasonable time what electors had recorded their votes at different polling places. The amendment of the honourable member is absolutely impracticable. He declares, that the provision in the Bill is liable to abuse. That argument, however, could be applied with equal force to any other provision. Under his proposal, ""persons who reside a hundred miles from polling places would be denied an opportunity of recording their votes. I am sure that in South Australia, Western Australia, and Queensland, there are post-offices which are separated from each other by a hundred miles. I have in my hand a voter's postal certificate, which will show honourable members how it is proposed to carry out the provisions of the Bill. If they will look at it they will see that it practically insures the secrecy of the ballot. Of course if an elector chooses to tell another ' in the State, many would be unable to do so person how he intends to vote, no one can prevent him from so doing. As the honourable member for Gippsland has pointed out, wherever this system has been tried, no serious injury has arisen The honourable member for Bland declares that under its operation undue influence will be brought to bear upon certain voters. But I would point out that in clause 112 special provision has been made to meet such cases as he has described. who has to vote by post get the information that all the provisions of clause 112 must be complied with 1 Sir WILLIAM LYNE It is printed upon his certificate. The objection taken by the honourable member for Bland is that in some parts of the States the postmaster , may be a squatter, selector, or storekeeper, and we all know that these individuals exercise considerable influence. That was pointed out to me, and thereupon I had the provision which appears in clause 112 inserted, with a view to giving the Government power to appoint some one outside of the individuals mentioned to receive the votes. The honourable member declares that this portion ol the Bil l constiYes, there t tutes an attack upon the system of voting by ballot. I cannot agree with him. WhatI propose is to confer upon those who are situated in remote country districts an opportunity of voting, which will otherwise be denied them. If we allow a man or woman to record his or her vote at any polling plaoe, we shall have confusion worse confounded, and be unable to prevent impersonation and abuses against which we have fought for many years. I trust the committee will assist me in making this B ill the most liberal measure of the kind. am afraid that if the proposal of the honourable member for Bland be carried he will injure the very men whom he desires to serve. The mere fact of giving an elector the right to vote at any polling booth does not by any means insure to every elector an opportunity of voting.

MrL . E. GROOM (Darling Downs) I am sorry the honourable member for Bland feels it incumbent upon him to oppose the clause, because I regard this part of the B ill , as exceedingly liberal. What we all desire to get is the expressed will of the people, and it is only by such a provision as that now before the committee that we can really get the expressed will of the whole of the electors. When I stood at the by-election for this House, many of the electors of Darling Downs experienced serious difficulty, and I have several letters in my possession from shearers expressing regret that on the polling day they. would be working at too great a distance to record their votes. Had these men been ordinary loafers about the city they could have voted, but because they were doing work which society requires shall be done, they were absolutely disfranchised, and they asked me to do what I could in the Eederal Parliament to remove the injustice. It is utterly impossible to predict at what particular place in an electorate these vast bodies of shearers may be. The polling place may be fixed at one station, and at the very next election the men who had been working there are pursuing their avocation miles away. The seamen on the vessels along the coast are many of them absolutely out of their electorate on the polling day, and surely they ought to receive some consideration.

The honourable member for Bland and myself are at one in the desire that every person who has the franchise shall vote, but we differ as to how to bring about that result. The honourable member for Bland objects that undue influence is likely to be exerted, and the same charge was made in Queensland in regard to small polling places. It was said that by reason of the small number of ballot-papers being opened after the voting, secrecy could be, and had been, violated ; but all that is prevented by the Bill. Practically, the charge made by the honourable member for Bland is that a squatter may require men in his employ to hand their ballot-papers to him so that he may see how they vote, but that would be a very audacious act on the part of any man, and I am glad to see that in tlie Bill there is a stern provision to punish any person guilty of such an act, so that danger in that connection, I think, is rather exaggerated. I understand that the honourable member'for Bland is speaking with a certain amount of knowledge, and I do not want to minimize his opinion. I hope the Minister may see his way to adopt a suggestion to allow the vote to be attested in the pre-. sence of two electors or extend the provision in some way. Another charge made is that this clause is practically a violation of the ballot system. The object of the ballot is simply to place the ballot-paper in a box so that no one can see how the vote is given; and this clause is certainly no violation of the system per se, though the secrecy rather than the system may be in vaded if a person insists on opening a ballotmember for Bland. We have had considerpaper. I do not think, however, that there is any very serious danger; in any case, the danger is small as compared with the vast extension of utility given to the voting power in the Commonwealth. We had voting by post at the last election in 'Queensland, and I believe it worked well, *md it is in operation elsewhere with beneficial results. We have extended the franchise to the fullest limit, and the voting system should be practically as wide as the voting power. MrO ' MALLEY (Tasmania) The community may avail himself of them, it is honourable and learned member for Darling still more important that we should give all Downs says that what we desire to obtain is the exercise of the will of the people. . That is exactly what the honourable member for Bland desires: but it should be the will of the people and not the will of a person or a few persons. I myself am a martyr to tlie system of voting by post in South Australia. The danger lies in circumstances where a clever employer, with perhaps 40 or 50 or 200 workmen, asks the latter whether they have voted, and asks them' to send their votes from his place. We all know that employers do exercise more or less power over the men who, directly or indirectly, are dependent on them for a living, and it is wrong for us to put such a temptation in the way of any justice of the peace, or similar official. The objections of the honourable member for Bland are thoroughly reasonable. Nothing could be simpler for a man than to walk into a polling booth, and break the law in the way suggested. My experience in South Australia leads me to feel that the adoption of the system provided for in the Bill will give the death blow to democracy. We talk about giving every man a chance, and providing equality of opportunity. The way to do that is to adopt the system now in vogue in Tasmania. There a man can go into any polling booth and say"" My name is on the roll for suchand-such a division."" He signs a declaration to that effect, and records his vote, which is then despatched to his own district. No man will run the risk of being imprisoned for perjury by wrongfully signing such a declaration. I look upon the system provided for in the Bill as vicious, pernicious, and damnable in its effects. I support the proposal of the honourable able experience of the absent voter system in South Australia. I think it was adopted in that State before it was adopted in any of the other States. Our first Absent Voters' Act was passed in 1891 or 1892; another in 1893; and another in 1896, when, owing to the abuses which had occurred, the privileges given by the system were considerably curtailed. The South Australian system is not so wide as that provided for in the Bill. Whilei t is our desire and our duty to extend the opportunities for voting, so that every person in the",33,Electoral Bill

It is more importable members think that the system will be ant, indeed, that the votes recorded should be recorded without undue influence than that here and there some elector should be unable to vote. In South Australia the provisions of the Absent Voters' A ct have not been taken advantage of by employees to anything like the same extent as by employers, because of the suspicion which has been aroused that the system allows influence, to be brought to bear on employees who avail themselves of it .

I should be very glad to help the honourable member for Bland to give the additional facilities he proposes, but I am afraid it is not practicable. If electors were allowed to vote at any polling booth in the State there would still be large numbers who would be so far removed from polling booths that they would be unable to exercise the franchise. It is these people to whom we should give some thought. All electors are not so favourably situated as are those who reside in the cities. I am surprised that the amendment should come from the professed representatives of labour. The whole of the labour is not centred in the cities, and the best men we have are those who are able to do without luxuries, and who devote their energies to developing the resources of the country districts. I am prepared to go as far as any one in preventing abuses and in providing safeguards, but what has been possible in Victoria may very well be extended to the other States. I have always voted for the extension of the franchise to every man and woman in the Commonwealth, and I am very glad that we have given the franchise to women. I now wish to afford every possible facility for electors to record their votes, and I should like to even go so far as to impose a penalty on those who neglect to exercise their privilege. I hope honourable members will consider those electors who are many miles away from the nearest polling booth. The honourable member for Bland said that it was preferable that a few persons should be prevented from voting rather than that opportunities should be presented for the exercise of undue influence upon a large scale. The cases of improper influence, however, will be very few and far between, whereas of the 50 per cent of the voters in the country districts who refrain from recording their votes, many are absolutely unable to reach the polling booth. Every facility should be afforded to electors to record their votes so that our legislation may be a true reflex, of the opinion of the whole of the people, instead of that of a section residing in the centres of population. think that the provision for voting by post has been abused in South Australia. I was rather inclined to think at first that, perhaps, the person who could afford to employ the greatest number of canvassers, and who could thus secure the largest number of votes by post would be placed at an advantage, but I am somewhat doubtful upon that point. I looked up the election returns with a view to satisfying my mind, but I was unable to conclude reexamination. The fact that a candidate procures a voter's certificate for an elector does not, but is apt to be considered by some to place him or her under a moral obligation to vote for such candidate. If any influence of that kind is exerted the same objection would apply to all classes of canvassers, because there is not one person in five who is not approached in some way or other regarding his vote. The only coercion exercised under the system of voting by post is upon those who are foolish enough to think that because they are being helped to obtain a voter's certificate they are under an obligation to vote for the person who obtains it. We know that the expediency of voting by post maybe pointed out to certain voters by the friends of some particular candidate, .and that the voter may think that he is under some obligation, but I do not see that any other coercion could be brought to bear to influence the judgment of an elector. I have never heard of any case in which there has been any breach of the secrecy of the ballot. but I know of cases in which influence has been exerted. feared is the activity of particular candidates. On the whole, a very small proportion of electors take advantage of the facilities offered for voting through the post. The system of voting by post was strongly advocated in South Australia in the interests of sailors, and any abuses to which the system may have been subject at the outset have now been provided against by amendments of the law. The alternative suggested by the honourable member for Bland is open to many objections, the principal being that it would involve great delay in the declaration of the poll. An elector entitled to a vote in Sydney might be in Western Australia upon the day of election, and might record his vote in that vented from doing so ? convenience would be involved in permitting him to do so than' in preventing him.

We have had some experience of the system in Victoria, and during the election of representatives to this House a number of applications were made for voters' certificates. In one case a candidate applied, through his canvassers, for 80 certificates, but as the candidate did not receive more than 50 votes, and the balance went to his .opponents, it is clear-that it does not follow that those who. provide the certificates necessarily secure the votes. I would urge the honor' able member for Bland to withdraw his amendment, because the clause as itstands ""will afford facilities to a large number of people who have recently been admitted to tlie franchise, and who will probably not register their votes if (-hey are required to attend the polling booth. We are told that in New Zealand and South Australia a large number of women go to the poll, but in Victoria our experience in municipal elections is that only by exerting the strongest influence can they he induced to record their votes. different where all the women have votes. with those who approved of the principle of universal suffrage, and I am glad that we we elected our representatives to the have provided for it .

Our experience in New South Wales shows the necessity for care in this direction. The honourable member for Bland cited an instance which occurred in his electorate in which the presiding officer wen^ to the extreme of kicking the ballot-box to pieces, because the votes were not recorded in the direction which he desired. I have had a somewhat similar experience. A t one station in my electorate, the manager ascertained the direction in which the men intended to vote, and when polling day arrived, he sent out-.to the back of the run those who would have voted in opposition to his desire, so that they could not exercise the franchise, whilst the others were brought in to the home station. These illustrations serve to show the extent to which feeling is sometimes carried. In other instances, a number of men have been discharged from their work after ah election. Their employers have said to them "" You voted for So-and-so ; go to him for a job."" Like the honourable member for Bland, I fear that if ' the Government proposal -.he carried, it will lead to the exercise of a great deal of undue influence. I recognise, however, that additional facilities for the exercise of the franchise must be given In every centro of any importance in New South Wales pollingplaces exist..

In my own district there are places with a mail only once a week or once a fortnight. I regret the committee are not in sympathy with the amendment, but I reserve to myself the right later to agitate for an alteration if my views are borne out by experience. In any case, there is necessity for a considerable number of alterations with a view to safeguard, not so much the application for a certificate, as the exercise of a vote. The conditions under which the vote is exercised are such as to make it necessary to provide that no undue influence shall be brought to bear, and that the receiving of the votes shall be restricted to some official person. The place should be confined to the office of -the official, though I am not certain whether the class of postmaster before whom the vote must be exercised is clearly provided. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. ' I am glad the amendment is withdrawn. In the Victorian Parliament I opposed a ' measure providing for voting by post, which was introduced by the McLean Government, and I and those associated with me were so successful, that we compelled the Government to change the Bill into a measure such as this is becoming, namely, a Voting Before Officials Bill. Voting by post means that the elector sends his vote by post from himself to the returning officer. Subject to small modifications, which are on the lines of those suggested by the honourable member for Bland, I think the committee may safely adopt the proposed system of voting before officials. We opposed the Bill introduced by the McLean Government for the very reasons mentioned by the honourable member for Bland. As that measure was brought down, any person could vote of his own free will, anywhere, in the presence of anybody. 41 F 2 But we knew how an employer might collect the votes of his workmen, and we also knew the constraint which is felt when the person who wants the vote is present and the elector is not sure whether the candidate may not see the vote in some way before it reaches the returning officer. That would be like a return to the old system of open voting, of which I had some experience in the old country. I have seen a farmer have to mount a table, and in the presence of his landlord and agent say for whom he voted : and the country never got a proper representation until that sort of thing had terminated. The system proposed in the B ill will achieve an object we all desire, namely, that every person shall have an opportunity to vote. During' the last election, I was called to see a man suffering from rheumatic fever who could not attend the polling booth, and whoasked me how he could exercise his vote. By the Bill such a man is given a vote, but I do not see any provision as to how he is to exercise it . Clause .109 confers the vote,, and clause l l 2 says that such a man may make his mark in the presence of the official! named, and that he is to hand the vote to the postmaster or post it at the post-office. But how is such a man to find a postmaster or to go to a post-office ? Then there should be some provision, as in the Victorian Act, that the vote shall be handed only to the officer in whose presence it has been signed,, and that he shall then become responsible to. the State for dealing with it . The idea is anxious to do his duty, in order not to fall under the censure of his superiors. If that officer is to be trusted with having thevote exercised in his presence, he may also be trusted with the duty of forwarding it to the returning officer. and learned member referring to what is to be done with the ballot-paper 1 how a sick person who cannot leave his house is to hand a ballot paper to the postmaster, or post it at a post-office, and suggesting that some amendment was necessary.

Tlie information that is wanted before an absent voter's certificate am be issued is not whether the applicant resides 5 or 50 miles from a polling place, but whether he has reason to believe that he will on pollingby post, and that provision has worked day be absent from the polling place -well. No complaint has been made about Paragraph (6) is quite sumcient. Mi'. THOMSON (North Sydney) -To my mind, a man living more than 5 miles from a polling place should be entitled by that very fact to an absent voter's certificate. I think it is unnecessary to require such a man to declare that he anticipates being more than 5 miles from the polling .place on the day of the poll. Paragraph i(l>) is necessary to meet the case of the -elector who resides .within 5 miles of a \polling place, but believes that on the day of the poll he will be away. The only reason for allowing voting by post is to convenience men who cannot attend a polling place on the day of the poll; a man's place of residence has nothing to do with the question. Paragraph (a) does not convenience anybody who is not provided for by paragraph (b), and it is therefore unnecessary. Buti t offers encouragement to all -who live 5 miles from a polling place to vote by post, a practice which it is .'better to discourage, because it adds so greatly to the difficulties of conducting -elections. Where men cannot attend at the polling places to vote, let us give them -the opportunity to vote by post; but do not let us give them the right to vote by post simply because they live 5 miles, or .any other distance, from a polling place. Apart from the population in the townships, nearly all the electors of South Australia reside 5 miles from the polling places. MrV . L . SOLOMON (South Australia). -There is a good deal in the contention of vthe honourable member for South Australia, Mr Batchelor. Absent VotersA c t provides only for the -case of electors who have reason to believe that upon polling days they will be at a' certain distance from a polling place. But paragraph (ce) offers an inducement to all who live 5 miles from a polling place to vote by post. The system of postal voting may be a good one for the convenience of people who are ill , or are otherwise unable to attend at the polling booths, but it would be a very bad one if it were to be generally availed of. The South Australian Act provides that any elector who has reason to believe that he will be more than 15 miles from the polling place at which he is registered to vote may vote the distance, though it might perhaps be well to reduce it to 10 miles. The system provided for in paragraph (b) was first introduced into South Australia by the member representing Port Adelaide, in order to enable the numerous residents of that district who are engaged in the intercolonial, Gulf, and coastal shipping trade, and are therefore frequently away from home, to exercise the franchise. The principle was subsequently extended, so that persons living in sparsely-populated districts, who found it difficult to reach a polling place, might take ' advantage of it, and the cost of too many polling places might be saved. I agree with my honourable colleague that if paragraph (a) is struck out, any elector to whom it applies may avail himself of the provisions of paragraph (6). there is much reason for retaining paragraph (a). I find that in Victoria one arbitrary limit has been fixed, and in South Australia another. I am not quite sure that 5 miles is not too short a distance. Of course it is not intended to induce people to keep away from the polling booth, but the object is to afford voting facilities to those who cannot reasonably get there. There cannot be any harm in striking out paragraph (a). agreed toThat the following words be omitted :"" («.) who resides move than 5 miles from the nolli'iif pluce at which he is entitled to vote'; or."" The South Australian posedThat the word ""five,"" linefi, be omitted, with a view to insert in fieu thereof the word ""ten."" 5-mile limit was recently adopted by the Victorian Legislature, and, as it has worked very well, I do not see why we should extend it to 10 miles as suggested.

By exhibiting the ballot-paper unmarked and in the condition in which it was issued : (n.)

In many country districts large employers of labour act also as non-ofticial postmasters. They receive a salary, but are not civil servants, and they are therefore subject to all those throes of partisanship which would influence ordinary electors. We could easily conceive of undue influence being exerted by such persons in recording postal votes. I have no objection to postmasters who are civil servants acting in the capacity provided for in the clause, and I move That the words ""being a classified public officer,"" be inserted after the word ""postmaster,"" line MO. ment would considerably limit the usefulness of the provision. A number of post offices in the country districts are conducted under what is known as the contract system, and the postmasters or postmistresses in such cases would not come within the scope of the honourable member's amendment. These persons are not employers of labour, and the) are not open to the same ob7 jection as are storekeepers who also act as postmasters. I know of a number of ladies who carry on post-offices in country districts, and perform their duties exceedingly well, and who would not be open to any objection so far as the purposes of this Bill are concerned. The contract system under which these ladies and others carry qn their work is largely resorted to in Victoria, and as it is favoured by the department, the probability is that it will be availed of to a much larger extent in the future. I cannot see any. objection to allowing postmasters or postmistresses, who follow no other occupation, from acting as provided for in connection with postal -ballot-papers. Mr O'MALLEY. (Tasmania) I suggest that* police officers should be included among those who are empowered to deal with postal ballot-papers under this clause. A t the same time, I am opposed to ladies who act as postmistresses being allowed to discharge any such functions. A t my second election in South Australia, one of the postmistresses in my electorate was taken round in a buggy day after day with a view to securing votes for my opponent, with the result that I was ousted, and obliged to go away to Tasmania. I am not quite sure that even civil servants would be proof against the allurements of a drive round the electorate under the care of an electioneering agent. I do not regard civil servants as being entirely above suspicion, because my experience shows that they are not always entirely free from prejudice. some force in the contention of the honourable member for Grampians The object of this clause is to extend certain privileges to electoi's residing in remote districts ; but if only postmasters who are classified public servants can deal 'with postal ballot-papers in the manner provided for, its operation will be limited to the more populous districts. I admit that there is a grave objection to squatters, who are also postmasters, being allowed to act; but in the State of New South Wales there are a number of non-official postmasters, who perforin 'the duties of deputy registrars with very satisfactory results. If these officers are to be debarred from dealing with postal ballot papers, the electors in the outlying districts will be placed at a disadvantage. I prefer that the persons charged with the performance of this duty should be appointed by the Electoral department. I am not prepared to go to the extent of limiting its performance to official postmasters to the exclusion of all other suitable persons. The Government proposal will do a grave injustice to a large number of electors. I really do not see what objection there can",40,Electoral Bill

In ray judgment it would be a great mistake to extend this provision to country postmasters who are not servants of the Commonwealth. If there is no official postmaster at some remote settlement, the State still has the head-master of the public school, the special magistrate,-or tlie police or stipendiary magistrate to fall back upon. Surely amongst all these individuals we can secure some official before whom the absent voter may exercise his franchise? I ask the honourable member for Bland to temporarily withdraw his amendment to enable me to move a prior one. To my mind it would be a mistake to multiply the places at which absent votes may be recorded. Let us limit the duty of receiving such votes to officials, and let the work be done at their usual office. I admit that under my proposal the sick would be disfranchised, but if we attempt to legislate for every possible case, we shall immediately open the door to all sorts of abuses. I am extremely anxious to avoid even the suspicion that undue influence may be brought to bear upon absent voters by the person charged with the duty of receiving their votes. One of the chief reasons which led to the extreme disfavour with which the Electoral Act was viewed in South Australia was that at one election a certain postmaster was carted round by members of a political organization for the purpose of securing votes for its candidates. There is nothing in this Bill to prevent a repetition of such iin occurrence. I do not think that it is worth our while to risk spoiling the whole measure by attempting to attain the ideal. It is far better for us to confine our attention to providing reasonable facilities for the exercise of the franchise. amendment is withdrawn, I submit that the honourable member who moved it has scarcely kept in view one class of case which must arise, and in which it would be absolute cruelty to ask electors to go to an office. These are the cases referred to in sub-clause (c), and there ire other cases of sickness and made by members who have had experience infirmity, in which to enforce the amendment would mean practical disfranchisement. residence of the sick person ? that persons who are away from the electocandidates. rate, perhaps for slight cause, shall have this cumbrous machinery created to enable Act was altered. them to vote, why should we not also provide for persons, who, on account of illness, cannot leave their homes ?

For instance, I see that the Federal Franchise Act gives the franchise to any elector whose name is on the roll, whereas this Bill seems to contemplate that unless a person lives in the division for which he is enrolled, he shall not be entitled to vote.

I take it that any of these officers might be selected, no matter how many there might be in a particular locality. I . protest against the Minister having power on the eve of an election to appoint any person he chooses to undertake this necessary work. Where we have ample officers at the disposal of the Government, I do not see the necessity for going further. I shall, therefore, vote against the amendment. me that we are getting into a curious muddle in connection with this clause. The policy of the Government as defined in it is that it is wise, in connection with voting by post, to specify the classes of persons who shall receive the 'ballot slips. We have had a long discussion in favour of enlarging those classes, to comprehend everything which is> comprethe result of which has been to leave the clause as it stood, but to give an additional power to the Minister to appoint any person he chooses, irrespective of his class or occupation. That is a very circuitous way of legislating. Eitheri t is a good thing-as was at first suggested-that we should specify the classes of persons who shall undertake this work, or it is-bad. If it be good, why should we. insert a provision which robs the clause of all virtue ? Why not leave the matter entirely in the hands of' the Government of the day 1 If we specify the persons to whom this work shall be intrusted, and the Government subsequently appoint someone else, they practically reflect upon the postmaster, or head of the State school, by saying-""Although you are the person Named in the Act, we cannot trust you, and intend to appoint another individual."" It is a most invidiousthing, to say by legislation that a certain man has to do a certain thing and afterwards to leave it in the power of the Government to ignore him and appoint someone else. MrA . McLEAN -That provision was inserted in the Victorian Act to meet the case of outlying districts, where none of these officials were stationed. of. the Victorian. Act was to show the Government that members of the police force could cover the whole ground. Why, then, should we specify'two classes, who will not cover the ground ? I would much rather leave the whole matter in the hands of the Executive than specify classes which may afterwards be ignored in the administration of the Act. Sir WILLIAM LYNE I scarcely think that the. right honourable and learned member is correct in his interpretation of this .clause. The Government"" merely propose that they shall have an additional powerin cases where the services of the officials mentioned in this provision are not available. The necessity for this is really to be found in the interpretation of the word ""officer."" That Word was inserted in the Senate. I saw my colleague there, and asked him to insert a word which would give to the Governor General power to do what I am striving for now. But when I come to look at this, clause, and to read it in the light of the definition of the term ""officer"" contained in clause 3, I find that it does not effect my purpose. That word was intended hended in the amendment now submitted. clause the word ""officer"" is used and under clause 3 that term is interpreted to cover the chief electoral officer, as well as the presiding officer and poll clerks. These presiding officers and poll clerks are generally appointed only a day or two before the election takes place. Does the Minister contemplate that their positions shall be permanent ? manent, and there is an Act in existence which givesthe Government power to remove them in the same way that they , are appointed'. does not wish to include poll clerks as officers before whom these votes can be registered ? Sir WILLIAM LYNE No . interpretation clause, poll clerks and presiding officers are included, and unless these officers are to be permanently appointed, I do not see how the clause can work. This provision is intended to apply to thinly populated districts, and it very often happens that the returning officer from whom the elector would have to get his authority, resides 200 or 300 miles away.

If there should happen to be a repetition of what took place in South Australia, the Minister would, if the appointments were specially made, have power to deal' with officers so offending. A t the same time, if the Minister decides on retaining the clause in its present form, I see no objection to the proposed addition. In outlying districts where there is small settlement, there is sometimes no police officer, postmaster, or schoolmaster. much objection to the latter part of the amendment, in view of the fact that the appointment of special registrars is in addition to the other officers mentioned in the clause. There is, however, something in the suggestion of the honourable member for Canoblas that it would be unwise to include as officers, poll-olenks and others, who are only temporarily appointed, and were not, I think, contemplated by the Minister when the clause was drawn It would not be desirable to strike out Sir WILLIAM LYNE remarks I made showed that the word "" officer "" was inserted with a different intention from that of making poll-clerks and others perform the duty of dealing with voters'"" certificates.

I see the difficulty, of course, in the case of persons who are ill ; but to leave any opportunity for the envelope getting into the possession of a third person might lead to serious danger. For instance, an elector might be under the influence of some one for whom he had promised to vote ; and the personto whom .the this clause, will promise had been made might insist on seeing the voting-paper before it was despatched. There are various methods which persons with strong reasons, and small principle, may use for the purpose of surreptitiously opening envelopes ; and we know that a few votes may alter an election, and have a great effect on the politics of the Commonwealth.

212,Mr Reid (East Sydney),"It is very impersons who have great influence over them, the secrecy of the ballot w i ll be gone, because the envelope provided for can easily be opened and closed again. It is quite conceivable that hundreds of votes might be polled in that way, so that persons interested might be able to say whether the voters really voted as they had promised, under some improper influence, to do. The clause aims at the voter posting the ballot paper himself. It says that he shall record his voteBy handing' it to a postmaster for posting, or What is everybody's business is nobody's posting it at a post-office. MrL . E. G ROOM -That provision would allow persons who were ill to vote only before a postmaster. the provision were evaded in such cases. But the intention is that the ballot-papers shall be either handed to a postmaster for posting or be posted by the voters themselves. I see the difficulty of preventing the abuse to which I have referred, but some remedy should be provided. What makes the matter more serious, in my eyes, is that under the Franchise A ct the qualification of an elector is that his name is on the .electors' roll, and it is not provided in the Bill that a man who has left an electorate shall thereby be disqualified from voting in it. A man may have left an electorate for two years, but unless some person files an objection before a revision court, and pays a deposit of 5s., his name will not be removed from the roll. It is astonishing how many men remove from a populous electorate in the course of twelve months. In Sydney we have found that in that time 700 or 800 men leave a district in which there are 2,500 on the roll. MrL . E. GROOM -D o they get their names on another roll ? fact constitutes another grave political danger. '.Unless special machinery is brought into play, their names remain upon the roll for the division from which they have removed. weight can be thrown either into the electorate from which they have removed, or into the electorate in which they reside. In New South Wales a voter may be asked, "" Do you still possess the qualification in respect to which this elector's right was issued to you?"" and he would be liable to a penalty for perjury if he stated falsely that he did. But under the B ill an elector may be asked only whether he is the person whose name appears on the roll, to which he can truthfully say, ""Yes;"" and whether he has already voted at the election or is disqualified from voting, to both of which he may be able truthfully to say, "" No . "" The names of hundreds of persons who have removed from a district may remain on the rolls for a year or two after they have left, because no one will take the trouble to have them removed. business, and no elector is likely to deposit 5s. in order lhat the name of John Smith, who has removed from the district, may be struck off the roll. the electoral officer to strike off such names. not scour his district to ascertain whether John Smith had removed from, say, 150 Yurong-street, East Sydney, and gone to Bourke. Therefore, when an election took place there might be hundreds of men living out of an electorate in which they were actually residing. Of course, where men apply for a transfer no harm can, happen. at Bourke before an elector was qualified for that division, he could not vote by post for his own electorate. ately he would have a choice. He could either get a transfer, and vote for .Bourke, or he could vote by post for his old electorate. I simply mention the matter so that it may be considered. The difficulty might be got over if it were made a disqualification for an elector to have ceased to reside in a division, and the question might be asked, "" D o you still possess the qualification in respect to which you were enrolled?"" Then a scrutineer, seeing an absentee, could direct the presiding officer's attention to him, and he would probably abstain from voting. Mr G. B. EDWARDS (South Sydney) But at election time their The leader of the Opposition has pointed out a very serious flaw in the clause under consideration, which I noticed myself, and intended to 'deal with.

During the last few days I 'have been perfectly inundated with communications' from the rifle retire Colonel Templeton, the officer who is in charge of these associations in Victoria. If such be the case it appears a most extraordinary act at a time of retrenchment. Colonel Templeton is an honorary officer, and has rendered magnificent services, for which he has charged nothing. He was selected on I account of his special fitness to control rifle clubs, and they haA'e made marvellous progress under his direction. He is eminently qualified for the work, being an excellent and enthusiastic rifle shot, and a good disciplinarian and drill, instructor. militia battalion for years. MrA .

They receive £ 5 0 or £ 0 0 a year, but that does not keep them in horse-feed, or provide them with uniforms. that. Mi-. JOSEPH COOK -In New South Wales Colonel Holborow, a man practically worshipped by, his regiment, has been retired because he has reached the age limit. I do not think we can make invidious distinctions between any of these officers. Colonel Holborow has been in the service of his State for the last 30 years. MrA . McLEAN -There is no case upon all fours with that of Colonel Templeton. He is outside the military altogether. Sir WILLIAM LYNE trouble. thab the fact mentioned by the honourable member for Gippsland is a reason why Colonel Templeton should not have been retired. Tho whole scheme for defence must be placed before the House before these individual cases can be dealt with. I feel that some of the retirements in New South Wales are very hard indeed, and almost harsh, but in justice to the Minister, who has had a most unpleasant duty thrust upon him, we should hear what he has to say before judging his action. from the Minister if it is not correct that Major Boam, who is really doing a large part of the work of the rifle club movement in 'Victoria, was retired from the New South Wales forces because he is over age. ing now as a clerk, not as a military officer. has been appointed at a salary of £300 to do the work which Colonel Templeton was doing. Colonel Templeton was, four or five years ago, a brigadier of the infantry militia of Victoria. He had won respect for his ability and his command of men, and he was offered £250 a year to take charge of the rifle club movement: but, feeling that he could occupy himself with honour -.11 c without the salary, he accepted the position for the kudos he might gain, and for the pleasure he would receive in seeing the movement grow under his hand. He has largely helped .to create the rifle club movement, which is of such importance to our defences : and I think the Minister should explain why another officer, who has also passed the age limit, has been given his work. I do not agree with the honourable members for South Sydney and Parramatta that we should wait until the Minister gives us some explanation before criticizing what is being done. Action has been taken which, in some instances, is irrevocable. A t Swan Island, in my constituency,eight men, some of them between 20 and 25 years of age, have been dismissed, although they are necessary for the efficiency of the engineering corps there. I think it was intended that the scheme of retrenchment which has been sanctioned should not affect the men at all, but simply the allowances of the officers. Our defence forces are being That is part of the smashed up, and the work of years is being destroyed ;. and yet we are told that we should wait for the statement of the Minister at some future time before having anything to say on the subject. MrA . McLEAN -The dismissals should be held over pending discussion. taken place. ter to let us know definitely when he is prepared to make an explanation, or. to promise that nothing will be. done until the whole matter has been discussed. with other honourable members in testifying to the high character and ability of Colonel Templeton. I have known him for many years, and I think it was a mistake to retire him. There' is another matter which I wish to bring under the consideration of the Minister? Some time ago, an ardent desire was manifested by our young men in all the States to form themselves into rifle clubs. From my own electorate, and from other parts of the Commonwealth, requests have been sent in for permission to form these clubs, but the applicantsliave been put off from time to time-in one case for twelve months-and have been unable to obtain any satisfaction from the military authorities.

264,Mr Chant Er (Riverina),"I joincultivate among our young people in order that we may have ample reserves of good rifle shots to draw upon for the purposes of defence. The policy of the Government should be, and so far as I ' know is, to give every encouragement to young men to form rifle clubs, and bring themselves to a state of efficiency as rifle shots, .so that they might readily become competent members of any military organization necessary in the case of invasion. I trust that tlie Minister will make a careful inquiry, and that the ardour of our riflemen will not be damped by continued delays in the organization of clubs. MrO ' MALLEY (Tasmania) -From the revelations made to-night, it would appear that, if the Government continue dismissing the privates, they will have no force left but a lot of officers, for whom there will be no occupation. From what I witnessed at the swearing-in of the Acting Governor General, I should judge that there were any number of officers, because they seemed to come in from all quarters. A t the time that the defence retrenchment was decided upon I felt that there was a danger that the poor men would be sacrificedthat the democrats would have to go in order to make room for the plutocrats. Sir WILLIAM LYNE (Hume Minister for Home Affairs) I think that the honourable and learned member for Corio was scarcely fair when he referred to the dismissal of certain young men belonging to the Victorian Permanent Artillery. decided that the defence estimates must be reduced by £131,000. fence estimates increased by over £200,000 at the time of transfer ? Sir WILLIAM LYNE into that matter now, because it would take too long to dea* with all the details. The honourable member, however, is absolutely mistaken in supposing that we had a margin f about £200,000 to work upon. 0 I would ask honourable, members how the decision of the House is to be carried out unless we make some reductions in the forces. creasing the number of officers. lutely incorrect. The proportion of officers retired is larger than that represented by the men dismissed. I have been through the whole of bhe staffs, and a very unpleasant task it has' been. In New South Wales the headquarters sbaff alone has been reduced by fourbeen othcers, and some of bhe men musb also go. A proposal has been made bo me bo reduce bhe pay of bhe men, bub I have refused bo do so. The case referred bo by bhe honourable and learned member for Corio probably arose in this way :A list was brought to me one evening by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, showing that certain married men in the permanent arbilleiy force in Vicboria had been .recommended for rebiremenb, and I was requested to give the married men preference over the single men. This seemed to he reasonable, and the result has been bhab some of bhe younger men have been retired; while bhe married men remain in bhe service. have referred include four married men. Sir WILLIAM LYNE I do not know about that particular case, but certain dismissals musb bake place, because bhe cosb of our defences has to be reduced. In reference to the remarks made by bhe honourable menaber for Parramatta, no doubt there are a number of cases, including bhe oue to which he refers, iu which officers have been retired under circumstances involving great hardship. Colonel Holborrow was paid only a few pounds per annum, and as there is no doubt that he has practically given up his life to military work, it is hard The House has deliberately upon him, and also upon others in New South Wales, that they should be called upon to retire at this time. There are also But were not the deseveral very hard cases in Queensland. I do not think there are any in South Australia, because the Sbabe Governmenb had retrenched so far that it was not possible to I am not going go muchfurbher in bhab direction. I realize that something must be done with regard to the rifle clubs, and I am expecting a report upon the subject from the military authorities. I have always taken a very great interest in those clubs, as I have been a member of one or two of them for several years, and have tried my best to become an efficient rifle shot. A recommendation was made bo me to strike off nearly all the grants to the rifle clubs, or to reduce them to a merely nominal sum ; but I refused to carry out bhab suggestion, and the grants are being placed on the Estimates in the same way as before.

269,Mr Ceouch,"The eight men to whom Iin this matter does not show any desire to injure the rifle clubs. The difficulty in Victoria is caused by the fact that the rifle clubs have grown to an enormous extent. They now have 20,000 members, and whereas a year or so ago they used 1,300,000 rounds of ammunition, they expended last year 4,000,000 rounds, and between 4,000,000 and 5,000,000 rounds will be required for the current year. involves serious expense. I do not know how the expenditure of ammunition can bo curtailed, but some provision must be made so that the cost shall not be so largo as in the past. It strikes me. that there is a great leakage somewhere; as it would be almost impossible to fire away that quantity of ammunition in a legitimate manner. I am against any undue military interference with the rifle clubs, but still there must be a governing power, and I do not think that 20,000 armed men in Victoria, or 30,000 or 40,000 in the whole Commonwealth, should be absolutely beyond the control of the military authorities. Mr G. B. KnwABDS -They will be of no use for defence purposes unless they are under control. / same time) as I say, I am entirely opposed to any undue military interference with the rifle clubs. Now, with regard to the case of Colonel Templeton, that officer has been retired as being over the age l i m it ; and I would ask honourable members where we are to stop if we make exceptions to that rule. difference between officers who are working for nothing and those who are drawing high salaries 1 of other officers who have occupied positions similar to that held by Colonel Templeton, so far as salary is concerned, have also been retired. Colonel Templeton mode a stipulation with the State Government that his age should not operate as a cause for his retirement; but, now that the whole matter has come under the control of the Commonwealth, one general age' limit has been fixed, and I am trying as far -as I possibly can to avoid being placed in the invidious position of allowing one officer to remain in his position whilst retiring another.. ' I am not making any exceptions. I have my own'opiuion as to the age -limit, which was fixed before I took over the control of the Defence department. I know 41 u z many good men who have a lot of work left in them, who have been retired; but that is a military matter. A number of petitions have been presented to me during to-day and yesterday, and I suppose that I shall receive others from all the rifle clubs with reference to Colonel Templeton's retirement. Theserepresentations will receive duo consideration. I know Colonel Templeton, and. This that is all, and I have no feeling whatever against him. I feel that I shall have manyinfluences brought to bear upon me to induce me to reinstate this person or that, person; but I must sit tight if I am to carry out' retrenchment such as the House has.. demanded. MrA . McLKAN If Colonel Templeton.. is retired, a salaried officer willhave to do-. his work. Major Boam is concerned, I believe the salary paid now is less than it was. I am not quite sure. Two or three clerks have been removed to tlie Treasury, and their salaries have been saved, and Major Boam is doing the work for the same salary that it was previously costing: He is a very able man, and he is now acting as. a clerk. The applications from rifle clnbs,. which were referred to by. the honourable, member for Riverina, almost stagger one,, and unless the House js prepared to vote a. larger sum of money for defence purposes,, wo cannot accede to all the requests. Then,, again, the members of rifle clubs are applying for '303 magazine rifles We have in there is a stock a large number of '303-rifles without., the magazines, and I cannot understand why the members of rifle clubs cannot becontent with these weapons for a time, in stead of putting tlie Commonwealth to theexpense, of obtaining magazine rifles. Wealso have a large number of Martini-Henry rifles, and a large quantity of ammunition for them. Tlie members of the rifled uba can learn . to shoot just as well with Martini rifles as with Lee-Metford magazine rifles, and it. would be better to wear out these weapons, and when we get fresh rifles secure the best obtainable. get rifles of any kind. Sir AVILLIA M LYNE -When I was in SydneyI was applied to on behalf of some of the rifle clubs for magazine rifles, but I considered that it would be highly improper to grant any such request, because it would",54,Adjournment Retirement Op Colonel Templeton

274,Mr Brows,"A number of clubs cannot-'involve a very heavy outlay to-supply magazine rifles all round. We must use up our present supplies before WB buy new rifles and ammunition. That is one of the reasons why the requests from some of these rifle clubs cannot be acceded to as readily as we could wish. I am a great believer in rifle clubs, and I should: like to encourage their formation in every possible way, because I believe that the men who, as members of these clubs, are taught to shoot will bave to be depended upon to come to our assistance in case of invasion. retrenchment scheme be submitted to the House? Sir WILLIAM LYNE It is impossible to say at present. The task has been a very arduous one, and it is very nearly completed, but I cannot make any statement to honourable members before the Estimates . are framed and put in proper order. The principle upon which I have acted has been ""to dispense with a number of officers as well as men, and not to unreasonably reduce the pay of the men. engineers has been reduced. pay has not been reduced, except in the -case of the Victorian Naval Brigade. The pay of the, men in that instance was reduced from £ 9 10s. to £ 8 10s. per annum. We must have harmony throughout the : States in connection with a matter of this sort. I . wish to retire' a good proportion of officers as well as of men. The largest reduction has been made in Queensland, because that State possessed more men than it should have had relatively to its population. The forces there have been reduced by 800 or 900. In New South Wales the naval brigade has been reduced -from 650 to 440, and I have entirely dispensed with the naval artillery volunteers ; -so that honourable members will recognise ithat Victoria is not the only State in which retrenchment has taken place. It has had .a biting effect in the other States. I will give every consideration to the matter brought forward by the honourable member for Gippsland, but I cannot promise to accord one officer different treatment from that meted out to another.
