There was a consensus express a whole series of other basic ideas, reached at the 1998 convention that the ideas about democracy, about the rule of law, preamble do contain a reference to Almighty about equality, about freedom, about respect God-not a recognition, not an affirmation, for the environment and so on. There does not although those words were used in other really seem to be a big issue here about these contexts, but a reference. sorts of core ideas, although I have to note One possible way of making that reference that the Prime Minister's draft in fact contains is to pick up, as the Beazley alternative draft no explicit reference to the environment or does, the language of the existing covering even indirectly in terms of love or respect or clauses in our parent United Kingdom act, affection for our land. That concept is simply which refer to those originally adopting our missing.

I am not sure that this preamble represents 'my own feeling about legislation is not too restrictive in terms of this country-the history, the contribution of how we put out information in relation to the the original Australians, the contribution of referendum and how we might approach immigration, the sense of space that I feel people. about Australia and the impact that that has had and continues to have'.

That the biHb'enow 'read a second time.

I am pleased to see that the bill contains a number of beneficial measures that will. assist these carers because, when it comes down to it, these are people who are in employment, even if they are not being paid a wage for that task. Their work is often arduous and thankless and the value of the work they perform must not be underestimated in either financial or social terms. Carers, selfless in the work they do, are an asset in our communities, giving much more than they take. They take the burden off institutionalised care, saving governments millions. All too often, they receive little or no recognition for this. Carers do an outstanding job in our community, looking after the elderly and the disabled. It is a job which frequently has little respite, with carers having no choice but to work around the clock, seven days a week, for every week of the year. I am sure all members of the House know of many of these 'people and see the problems they deal with on a day-to-day basis. This is the case in my area which has one of the highest proportions of aged people in Australia. I know, from personal experience, just how carers play a very important part in assisting those who cannot look after themselves. I know that is the case for most members of this House. With age, unfortunately, there comes a time when it is difficult to go about day-to-day activities unaided. Without the assistance of carers, most of whom are family members, many of our elderly citizens would have no choice but to move into institutionalised care. For many this transition is stressful, causing a great deal of hardship for both the individual and their family. The transition more often than not is accompanied by a deterioration in their condition as they move into unfamiliar surroundings. Without compelling medical evidence, people should have the opportunity to remain in their homes amongst familiar surroundings, with their friends and with their family. To this end, providing extra assistance to carers is indeed pivotal. The difficulties faced by the elderly in this regard are also shared by younger people in our community who, through no fault of their own, are unable to cope with their disabilities. Providing extra assistance to their carers helps to relieve the burdens faced on a day-to-day basis by younger people with disabilities and their families. There are many beneficial measures in this bill. I believe it is appropriate to draw attention to the vast areas of unmet need in the disability sector before I deal with those in detail. It is widely acknowledged that disability services are crying out for extra resources. In my state of Queensland, there is a package coming from the state government which will deliver substantially more. This was acknowledged by the 1997 Commonwealth, state and territory community services ministers meeting. This meeting followed a report from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare entitled Demand for disability support services in Australia.",110,Adjournment Ture Age Partner Allowance And Found A Job
275,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr Nehi) Took The Chair At 4.30 P.m.,"4108 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday ,23 March 1999 The figures for unmet needs are quite sobering. There are 13,400 people who urgently require accommodation, while 12,000 people require day or recreation activities, and 38,000 people require employment services to give them the opportunity to participate in the work force. These issues need to be addressed. This cannot be done overnight, but it has to be a high priority for government policy development. State and federal ministers agreed at this meeting I mentioned before to discuss these unmet needs, but the next meeting to do this has yet to happen. It is unfortunate that Senator Newman postponed this meeting from December last year to next month, some 12 months after it was first promised. The demand for disability services is continuing to increase, yet, sadly, the federal government has wound back expenditure in recent years, and this has placed undue burdens on community service and disability sectors. Providing assistance to carers is important and long overdue, but for people with disabilities there are other issues that affect them on a daily basis. I am quite concerned that the government's tax package-described in the House today by the Treasurer as the ANTS package-will have a dramatic impact on people with disabilities and raise new roadblocks for them. This insidious tax not only affects them directly but also undermines the ability of not-for-profit and charitable organisations to help people with disabilities and their carers. People with disabilities have higher costs of living compared with others. In this respect, the GST will be particularly regressive in relation to their incomes, which are diminished by their inability to earn income and to do similar work to other taxpayers. Although many disability services are GST free, many are not. For instance, a person with a disability may be unable to drive or use public transport; they have to rely on taxis, which cost a lot more. I shudder to think how much extra this necessity will cost when the GST is factored in. Mrs Elson interjectingliving. In addition to this, charitable and not-for-profit organisations, which provide assistance to people with disabilities and their carers, will have no choice but to cut valuable services with the imposition of the GST. Massive GST administrative burdens have been estimated to cost the community and charity sector between $500 million and $1 billion annually. I think that, if government members read the submissions,particularly those from the community affairs sector inquiring into this, they would be quite shocked by the impact this will have on those organisations which play such a vital role in caring for the elderly and those with disabilities. In particular, ACROD has had this to say: It is our considered opinion that the tax reform package will adversely affect both people with disabilities, their families and the charities which serve them. The evidence in the Senate inquiry on this is quite compelling, and I will leave that for another day, except to make the point that, whilst there are beneficial measures in this bill, they are being introduced in an environment which will take a lot more away from carers through the government's tax package. Whilst the measures in this bill are welcome and long overdue, I think the government should reflect on the damage the GST will do. I would now like to consider the measures contained in the bill in some detail. As I said before, whilst we support the bill, we have some serious misgivings about some of the changes it proposes. Schedule1 of the bill empowers the government to create an adult disability assessment tool for assessing the level of a person's disability. This will replace some of the",113,Representatives Main Committee
276,Mr Swan,"They do not get vouchers for every trip they take. This is the normal cost ofTuesday, 23 March 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 4109 key criteria for determining entitlement to payments for people caring for those over the age of 16. We are not necessarily opposed to the movement this represents to more objective criteria for assessing disability. Our view depends entirely on the detail of the new assessment method. What we are very concerned about is that, by agreeing with this bill, we are agreeing to the introduction of an assessment tool we have not yet seen. We have seen a draft of the assessment tool but it has not yet been finalised. As the assessment tool is to take the form of a disallowable instrument, we will not be able to seek amendments to it. Our only option, if we have real problems with the instrument, is to try to have it disallowed. This is a very difficult option as the effect of the bill is that, from 1 July 1999, entitlement to certain payments cannot be assessed without the tool. Any delay in implementing the tool after that date will cause delays in assessment of entitlement. We have had some experience with this, and this is why I raise it. I hope government members opposite take note of this, because they would have had experience with the child disability assessment tool already and seen people in their areas who have experienced severe problems with this. The child disability assessment tool was introduced last year. I and many other members in the House have received many complaints from carers, community organisations and the medical profession about the way that this tool is operating. In the House only yesterday we had a private member's motion from the member for Braddon, Mr Sidebottom, who detailed many of the difficulties involved in this area. He was talking particularly about cystic fibrosis-and we have all had some experience with people in this position-and about returning cystic fibrosis to the list of recognised conditions contained in the child disability assessment tool. This motion was prompted by many letters from anxious parents of cystic fibrosis sufferers and their treating doctors. I am pleased to say that the motion received support from government members, the members for Bradfield and Moore. That was good to see. I would like to quote from the speech from the member for Bradfield, Dr Nelson, in response to the motion moved by the member for Braddon, Mr Sidebottom. Dr Nelson said: On a personal note, my experience of dealing with this disease as a paediatric registrar, as a general practitioner and as a human being is such that I believe this disease should be automatically listed for the child disability allowance. The honourable member concluded by giving his personal support to the motion moved by the member for Braddon, Mr Sidebottom, and urged the team that is currently reviewing the tool to replace cystic fibrosis on the recognised conditions list. It appears that two government members also believe, along with members on this side, that the child disability assessment tool is inadequate in its treatment of this condition. This is a serious issue that has been raised with us by parents and professionals since that tool commenced operation. I do not believe that the government got the child disability assessment tool right and I am now very concerned that they will not get the adult tool right either. Given our experience with the child disability assessment tool, we are concerned about taking the government on trust in this matter. To add to these concerns, the National Epilepsy Foundation of Australia have already raised a serious issue regarding the draft adult disability assessment tool. They say that the draft does not contain enough questions about intermittent or episodic conditions, such as epilepsy, which 4110 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 23 March 1999 require constant vigilance and occasional intensive care from a carer rather than constant care on a day-to-day basis. I would urge the government today to look very seriously at this issue. Despite the serious practical problems it might cause, if the final version of the adult assessment tool is likely to lead to significant inequities, those on this side of the House and many in the community organisations that have supported the bill to this stage are going to be put, as I explained before, in a very difficult position. I would urge the government to avoid such an unfortunate possibility. I would urge the government, for example, to provide us and the community organisations with the final version of the tool as quickly as possible to give us sufficient time to consider it and to discuss any problems with the government well before 1 July. I mean that in a very genuine and bipartisan sense. Schedule1 of the bill also provides that a person is not entitled to carer payment unless they provide constant care for a person who has been given a score of at least 25 under the new tool. This will replace the current criterion that the person being cared for must be 'a severely handicapped person'-that is, a person requiring frequent care in connection with their bodily functions or constant supervision to prevent injury because of their disability. The schedule further provides that two people may qualify for the carer payment if the person they are caring for has been given a score of at least 80 under the adult disability assessment tool. This replaces the current rules under which they would be entitled to the payment if the level of disability is severe enough to justify the provision of constant care by more than one person. So far these changes simply reflect the current situation except that certain criteria are to be replaced by an assessment under the new tool. However, the schedule does make three significant and beneficial changes to the carer payment. Firstly, it provides that a person may qualify for the carer payment if they are caring for an adult and a dependent child of the adult, aged under 16, if the adult has been given a score of at least 20 under the new tool and, if the child is aged six or more, the child is sufficiently disabled to qualify a carer for a carer allowance. This beneficial measure extends the current rules for the carer payment. Secondly, the schedule provides that a person may qualify for a carer payment for up to 63 days if they are caring for a disabled person in hospital, provided that if the disabled person were not in hospital the carer would be likely to qualify for the carer payment and the disabled person is either terminally ill or likely to return home after leaving hospital. This does represent a further improvement of the rules for the carer payment and is in addition to the 63-day respite period currently available. So it is a beneficial measure. Thirdly, it extends entitlement to bereavement payments for a person receiving carer payment so that they will qualify for the payments if their partner dies and was receiving a social security benefit for the 12 months prior to their death. Under the current provisions a carer payment recipient is only entitled to bereavement payments if their partner was in receipt of a pension or income support supplement. This beneficial measure will make the rules applying to carer payment consistent with those applying to other payment types. Schedule2 of the bill proposes to replace the domiciliary nursing care benefit and the child disability allowance with a single new payment to be called 'carer allowance' for people caring for adults or children with disabilities. The rate of the carer allowance will be $75.60 per fortnight, which is the current rate for both child disability allowance and domiciliary nursing care benefit. Neither the old payments nor the new allowance are subject to means testing. Tuesday, 23 March 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 4111 Where the person is caring for a dependent child under the age of 16, they may qualify for the allowance if the child is given a score of not less than one, or has a recognised disability under the child disability assessment tool, and the person is providing care and attention to the child on a daily basis in their own home. This reflects the current criteria for the child disability allowance. Where a person is caring for a disabled person over the age of 16, they may qualify for the proposed new allowance if the care receiver is given a score of not less than 30 under the new adult disability assessment tool and the person is providing care and attention to the adult on a daily basis in their own home. These rules will replace those for the domiciliary nursing care benefit currently available under the National Health Act 1953. The domiciliary nursing care benefit is currently available to a person who is providing care in their own home for a disabled person over the age of 16 who requires nursing home level care. The new rules improve upon the current provisions in a number of ways. Firstly, moving from assessment based on the question of whether the care receiver needs nursing home level care to assessment under the adult disability assessment tool should make qualifying for the allowance easier. The government says that 14,000 additional carers will qualify, and that will be a good thing. Secondly, the new allowance will be payable for overseas absences of up to 26 weeks. Under the current rules, domiciliary nursing care benefit is not payable during any absences overseas. Thirdly, a person may qualify for a carer allowance for up to 63 days if they are caring for a disabled person in hospital provided that if the disabled person were not in hospital the carer would be likely to qualify for the carer allowance and the disabled person is either terminally ill or likely to return home after leaving hospital. This also represents an improvement of the rules for the domiciliary nursing care benefit and is in addition to the 63-day respite period currently available. Finally, in respect of disabled adults, the new carer allowance will allow backdating of entitlement for up to six months prior to the date on which the claim was lodged. This represents a significant improvement of the rules for the domiciliary nursing care benefit which do not provide for such backdating. Part2 of schedule 2 makes a number of amendments to the Social Security Act consequential upon the introduction of the new carer allowance. Most of these amendments are technical in nature, but one will impact upon a small number of parenting payment recipients. The amendment in question will prevent a sale parent from qualifying for a parenting payment on the basis that they are receiving a child disability allowance for a child who is over 16 years of age. Under the current rules, a sale parent can qualify for a parenting payment if they have a dependent child who is either under the age of 16, or is a child for whom a -hild disability allowance is received. As the child disability allowance can currently be paid 'for a full-time student up to the age of 21, this means that a sale parent can also receive the parenting payment until the child turns 21. Sale parents who lose their parenting payment because of this amendment will need to apply for another form of payment, usually the Newstart allowance, which is paid at the lower rate. I understand that there will be a small number of people affected by this around the. country. I have to say I am concerned about that. 4112 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 23 March 1999 In conclusion, as I said at the beginning, there are a number of beneficial measures in this bill. The opposition is pleased to support them, but we are concerned not only about the wider environment in which the elderly and the disabled are operating but also that the government's tax package will, in fact, have a severe effect upon them and that these measures will subsequently be eroded by the effect of that impact. We are also, as I said earlier, quite concerned about the new tool. We would like to see from the government a high level of consultation so that it can be introduced to the benefit of all. Ms MAY (McPherson) (4.51 p.m.)-Help is at hand for carers. I am delighted to support the Assistance for Carers Legislation Amendment Bill 1999 which will provide a boost for many people in my electorate who spend so much of their time and energy caring for others. In announcing its staying at home package in April 1998 to allow more elderly Australians to stay in their own homes, the Howard government gave a reassurance that it would look after carers. The package aimed at ensuring that staying at home and receiving community care is a real option for those older Australians who choose to do so. The bulk of this package involves improved services to older people living at home and their carers, including community care packages, respite care, continence management .and assessment. The bill gives effect to a number of measures aimed at improving assistance to carers, including the measures announced in the staying at home package. The bill is an indication that the government is listening to the needs of those people who care for people of all ages. The bill brings into effect a series of measures aimed at improving assistance to carers from 1 July 1999 and introduces a new social security payment-the carer allowance-which combines two existing payments-the child disability allowance for carers of a child up to 16 years of age, and the domiciliary nursing care benefit for carers of adults 16 years of age or more. In June 1998, Australia-wide, there were 101,377 children and students receiving the carers disability allowance. In the 1997-98 program, 45,675 carers were assisted to care for 46,124 people under the domiciliary nursing care benefit. Under the government's changes, people who now receive the current child disability allowance or the domiciliary nursing care benefit will continue to receive the same amount of money. A major benefit of these changes is that the eligibility criteria for the carer allowance for carers of adults will be liberalised to achieve a net increase of 14,000 recipients. This will mean that more Australians will be rewarded by the Howard government for their efforts· in caring for individuals who have a disability, are frail aged or chronically ill. It is good news for the people of my electorate that a new category of people eligible for a carer payment has been created, taking into account those who are caring for an adult with a level of disability that is not sufficient to qualify their carer for income support. The carer allowance will not be subject to any income or assets test and will not be taxable. In addition, it will provide a simpler and more consistent system of income supplement for carers·of people of all ages with disabilities.The creation of the carer allowance simplifies carer repayments and brings them all into the one department. Combining the child disability allowance and the domiciliary nursing care benefit into one payment delivered through Centrelink will provide carers with a streamlined and simple payment system. In addition, carers will need to deal with only one organisation and fill out one form to arrange their carer payments, making this process easier for carers. Tuesday, 23 March 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 4113 Within my electorate, I have more than 300 carers registered with Centrelink to receive social security payments. From feedback received from carers, I am well aware that currently a person cannot qualify for a carer payment where they are caring for an adult who has a disability but that disability does not satisfy the definition of 'severely handicapped person'. In cases where an adult has a child, and that adult's carer also cares for the child because the adult's disability means that the adult cannot care for the child himself or herself, the carer may be caring for the adult and child and be unable to work full time. It is good news for the people of my electorate that these changes announced by the government take situations like this into account. The changes extend the carer's qualification for carer payment to persons who are caring for an adult with a disability and that adult's child under 16. The aim is to provide assistance for people who are not only caring full time for the adult with a disability but looking after the child as well. Like everybody, carers need a break. A major boost will be that, when a person being cared for has a terminal illness or is expected to return home after hospital treatment, the carer will continue to qualify for the carer payment or allowance while the person being cared for is in hospital for up to 63 days a year. Previously, carers could not claim child disability allowance, domiciliary nursing care benefit or carer payment when the person they were caring for was hospitalised. The new adult assessment tool to be introduced with these changes will be used when assessing eligibility for carers allowance. This new tool will assess the functional ability of the care recipient on a more consistent basis than in the past. It replaces a rather restrictive and, in general, an unsatisfactory requirement under the domiciliary nursing care benefit that the person being cared for must be in continuing need of nursing home care. In the past, this has had the effect of discriminating between people with similar care needs. It is the government's intention to fix this problem, with the introduction of the new assessment tool, by extending eligibility to more people with cognitive impairments such as dementia, intellectual disability and psychiatric illness. The Howard government has a track record of implementing new positive changes to benefit carers. In every budget since the government came into office, we have introduced measures to improve the situation for carers in terms of income support, respite and access to information. The government has provided additional resources for carer respite centres, and has announced more assistance for ageing carers, and as well has increased the rate of the domiciliary nursing care benefit from $58.30 to $75.10 per fortnight from 1 July 1998. This bill is further evidence of the coalition government's concern for and commitment to carers. I commend the bill to the House. Ms HALL (Shortland) (4.58 p.m.)-The Assistance for Carers Legislation Amendment Bill 1999 would generally appear to be a positive initiative. It seeks to refine the current legislation that encapsulates a concept that was initially introduced by Neal Blewett in the early 1980s. Labor recognises the importance and the commitment of carers and, in doing so, the importance of giving financial recognition to the role they play in looking after a person with a disability or an elderly person or someone with a terminal illness. It was also a Labor government's initiative that introduced the domiciliary nursing care benefit in 1973. We, on this side of the House, appreciate the role of carers. It is a very hard and often thankless job, born out of a commitment to the person with the disability.

It is extremely important that;governments of every colour and persuasion recognise the work that carers doin ourcommunity,alld this legislation goes some way towards that. ' . '"" . As a person who worked in the area of disability for many years I have seen the commitment of these carers and I know just how much they put into caring for those people: Let us take the example of a person, maybe a young male, with a head injury from a car· accident. This young person was once a healthy, vibrant, active young man who may have been involved in sport. He may have been attending university or may have had a job. All of a. sudden he has changed from being an active, vibrant person to one wpo needs nearly 24. hours'a day care. He may have undergone a massive personality change. He may even have diffic\llty:walking and toileting-the most basic self care. This person has to pe cared for by someone who is prepared to give up their time voluntarily. "" .' I was recently talking to a constituent whose young daughter was absolutely brilliant. She was an outstanding student in her second year at university when it was discovere,d that she had a tumour. She is now confined to a chair, requires assistance, 24 hours a day andisunable to see. Without her parents, both of whom have given up, their jobs to care for her, she, would be institutionalised. The cost to government would be enormous; the cost to that young woman would be enormous. She would not be in a loving, caring environment, would not be surrounded by familiar things, and would not have quality of life, which she hasnow. One of the issues that is important is to make it easier for people to have two carers. Caring for someone with a spinal injury is nearly a 24-hour a day job. I have worked with many people with spinal injuries. They have been sentenced to spend their life in a chair.. These people need to be turned in their beds, fed and looked after in the most basic ways, which is what carers do. They give up their lives and their jobs to care· for that person. They prqvide that care and keep that person out of an institution. , You would think that someone with a back injury would be able to look after· themselves, that they should be able to cope. I am sure that a number of us here ,today ,have occasionally had a twinge in our back. A severe back injury can be very disabling; It can prevenYOIl from carrying out very basic self care, cause you to lose your job andto be totally dependent. on other people.

Xoucan,have ay,oung person that had the world at their fingertips .and that changes from being a vibrantp-r-on.to Tuesday, 23 March 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 4115 being a person that requires care nearly 24 hours a day. SoI see that, once again, this is giving recognition to the people that care for people that have these cognitive and psychological disabilities. I was recently talking to a constituent in the Shortland electorate who lives on the Central Coast. She is a very committed person and one of her friends has a son that is very, very badly affected with cerebral palsy. This young man had been cared for by his mother for some time, but his· mother also suffers from a disability and is able to care for herself but unable to care for her sOn. And this very generous woman has taken that young man into her house and cares for him 24 hours a day. She has to feed him, she has to dress him, she has to look after his most baSic needs, but the carer allowance is the only benefit she gets. I must add that she is just a little upset that she is not able to access some other benefits too, because the way she sees it she is saving the government a lot of money. She feels that the domiciliary care nursing benefit that she has been getting goes some way towards helping her and recognising the work that she is doing, but she feels that she should be eligible for some other sort of benefit. Her husband is only on an average wage, and she is doing this because she cares for her friend and cares for the young man she is looking after. That brings us to the elderly. The government has made a commitment to introducing aged care packages in the community which are designed to keep people in their homes longer. In doing that, I think we need to recognise once again the role the carers play. In Shortland electorate we are chronically undersupplied with aged care facilities, particularly in the Central Coast part of the electorate, and the eastern side of Lake Macquarie which Shortland covers is very, very disadvantaged. This package will encourage carers to look after their elderly relatives and friends in the community. In saying that, I must also say that it is not a lot of money, but it is some recognition. But it would be really nice if the government followed up their commitment to carers and this carers package by a commitment to more aged care facilities in Shortland. I would appreciate it and I can assure you that the people of Shortland would be very grateful to the government. These people that are caring for the people that suffer from these disabilities, and for the elderly and the chronically ill, will be the people who will be eligible for the new payment. At least, I hope so. In supporting the legislation, I must express some disappointment and some serious concerns that the adult disability assessment tool is unavailable. I would really like to be able to have a look at it before I say this is a great package. I would really like to know that that assessment tool will ensure that all those carers get access to the new carer payment. This is a significant change to the legislation, and the adult disability assessment tool is a key element. of the package. lam sure the government realises that. I am just nervous-nervous that we cannot see it and nervous that this tool that will be used to determine the eligibility may lead to the exclusion of some carers. If the adult assessment disability tool does not work, then the package does not work. It is as simple as that. The package and the success of the package really rely on that adult disability assessment tool. When I look at the changes that were made last year, or came into effect in July last year, to the child disability allowance, I am sure that those on the government side would be aware, as are those of us on this side, that there are a number of problems. There are a number of children and young people that were excluded who had previously been eligible for this allowance. One of the key groups that I feel are particularly disadvantaged in our society are children that suffer from ADDHD. These children are struggling not only to integrate within 4116 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 23 March 1999 our society and within their school community but also to learn. These young people definitely require a greater expenditure. If we fail with kids that are suffering from ADDHD, then the cost to our community further down the track will be enormous. A number of studies detail how children that are suffering from this disability later tend to be very disadvantaged, leading to long-term unemployment, crime and all the other things that are associated with people that are extremely socially disadvantaged. Recently a constituent in Shortland came to see me. He has a young boy that was recently diagnosed with diabetes and he has been denied the child disability allowance. I feel quite sure that he would have been eligible before. Because his son is okay when he is not sick he has been denied the allowance. This man has had to give up his job. He has to go to the school six times a day to ensure that the child does not end up in hospital. He has already been hospitalised three times within two weeks recently. It is a great worry. I am worried that the assessment tool will be rigid as the child disability allowance changes have been rigid and that that this will lead to exclusion of people that should be eligible for this disability allowance. This will mean that carers that should be getting this carer allowance will be disadvantaged. The domiciliary care benefit has been criticised for being subjective and unduly restrictive. I am worried that this will be perpetuated in the adult disability assessment tool· and that it will also be unduly restrictive and will not ensure that the people who should be getting the allowance do get it. Another thing that worries me greatly is that, when I look at their track record, I am not convinced the government are committed to people with disabilities. The disability panels have been abolished in social security. These panels were working with people with disabilities to assist them to get back into the work force. It was a fine initiative and from personal experience these panels were working. They were saving government money and enabling people with disabilities to have a full and fruitful life. But this government moved away from it. The government's move to privatise the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service has got me extremely worried. The privatisation of the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service will move the emphasis away from the people with a disability, away from the people that are supposed to be offered that rehabilitation. A government that has abolished the disability review panel, is looking at privatising the CRS, and is introducing a GST, will really disadvantage people who have disabilities, will disadvantage carers, and disadvantage people who are committed to caring for others. It would be most remiss of me if I did not put my concerns on the record. If the adult disability assessment tool in this legislation is not right then it is going to impact on the quality of life of those people with disabilities and the carers. It is all very well to put something like this in place but, if people in the community do not know about it, and if they can only find out about it by accident, then it will be a problem. The government must make sure that it advertises very extensively within the community so that people who are eligible for this carer allowance are aware of it. The other thing that is of great concern to me is the fact that Cen,trelink is being ravaged by this government. Centrelink staff are in a state of chronic crisis where they are moving from one disaster to another. They cannot cope with the workload that they have now and this is Tuesday, 23 March 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 4117 going to put an extra burden on them. The government has to look at making sure that Centrelink is staffed adequately before this bill comes into effect. In conclusion, I would like to recognise the dedication and the commitment of carerspeople who care for family, friends and loved ones, because they are good, decent human beings. Without dedicated carers, many of the disabled, elderly and chronically ill people whom they care for would be institutionalised. Everyone would be a loser: those that are being cared for, the carers, and the government that would have to find the money to meet the increased costs associated with the institutionalisation of those people who are being cared for. I sincerely hope that the adult disability assessment tool is workable and that this legislation does benefit Australian carers. I sincerely hope that this time the government is genuinely committed to people with disabilities and the elderly in our community, and that there is not some hidden trick in the legislation where it is really going to tum around and bite those people whom it is seeking to benefit. Carers Legislation Amendment Bill 1999, but before I do I would like to comment on the statements made by the member for Lilley. The member for Lilley deserves to be reprimanded by his constituents for his outrageous, irresponsible and scaremongering comments about costs being increased for the disabled because of the GST; To make comments like that is a cheap political stunt that is made at the expense of those less fortunate than most. It shows the scant regard he holds for the people of Australia. He knows full well there will be no GST on those services. This bill provides several measures designed to improve assistance to carers. It will finetune the federal coalition's Staying at Home package announced in April 1998 and enhance earlier programs initiated by this and other governments. The first measure is the introduction of a new payment, the carer allowance, which combines two existing payments-the child disability allowance and the domiciliary nursing care benefit. The carer allowance is a payment to people who are caring for someone who has a disability, or who is frail, or who is chronically ill. It provides non-means tested assistance with the extra costs of providing care. It is not to be confused with the carers payment which provides means tested income support. The carer allowance streamlines the previous system where, as most people move from one age group to another, their type of assessment, care and payment all have to be changed over to another system and another type of payment. It was, as it sounds, all very confusing. Now, while there are differing criteria for eligibility according to child or adult status, the two payments that make up the carer allowance will be broadly aligned. The other benefit is that carers will now have to deal with only one organisation, and this is because the previous domiciliary nursing care benefit has been transferred from Health and Aged Care to Family and Community Services. My office i:ecently received a call from a constituent who has five children. Three of these five children have disabilities. One of my daughters contracted a disability that required a lot of medical expense and lots of time in hospital for some seven years. The whole household lived with the difficulties created by 'long absences from home spent at hospitals, the breakdown of routines, the lack of normal support mechanisms and the insecurity and emotions that these all bring. My mother also required increasing amounts of care in the months before",114,Representatives Main Committee
277,Mrs Gash (Gilmore) (5.18 P.m.),"TodayI would like to speak about the Assistance for4118 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 23 March 1999 she died, so I do have some understanding of the special requirements for carers and for the people receiving the care and for the rest of their families. However, I cannot begin to imagine how difficult life as a parent could become while looking after the needs of three children with disabilities. I know that just looking after children can sometimes be extremely difficult, without having the disabilities. Carers are people who give their time selflessly to look after the needs of others who are frail aged or have a disability. Often carers give up jobs and financial security to take care of people at home who need them. There is no holiday pay, no sick pay, no workers compensation or superannuation. The job that carers take on is a lifetime one. They are on call 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Their commitment ensures that their loved ones and those for whom they care remain in a familiar environment and out of nursing homes, hospitals or other institutions. Previously, a tool existed to test the functionality of a child to determine that child's level of ability. The results would provide a scientific basis on which to determine entitlement. There was no such tool for adults. Carers for adults received entitlements based on subjective opinion. There was no standardised scientific basis on which to make decisions on entitlement. With this amendment, it is this government that is now introducing the adult disability assessment tool. Carers work tirelessly, motivated not by money or power but by generosity and kindness, and they will know that their claims have been assessed using a standard methodology. The generosity of many carers has gone hand in hand with an amount of financial hardship. This government has recognised that something must be done to ease this financial burden. The Assistance for Carers Legislation Amendment Bill 1999 is the result. Accordingly, the eligibility criteria for the carer allowance has been liberalised-pardon the pun-to achieve a net increase of 14,000 carers. Australia, through the federal government, needs to assist and commend carers in this society. This government has a good record in its responsiveness to the needs of carers. The extension to the carer payment, introduced last year, assisted carers of children with profound disabilities under 16 years of age. The coalition government's further extension to the carer payment will allow for carers who must care for an adult as well as care for a dependent child or children of that adult. This must surely be good news to people whose responsibility as carers also embraces the extended family of the person with a disability. Often carers are forced to rely on the generosity of their friends and neighbours to help them out when they need a break or they simply need to dash to the shops. Should this occur, be it for one hour or for a weekend, the carer payment can assist with payment for respite care. Parents of young children who do not go out to work become quite adept at setting up that network of people who help each other. It is not so with carers of people with disabilities, as this sort of support network is not always easy to find. People who are not used to helping people with disabilities often feel unable to cope and consequently the need for regular respite is greater and generally must be paid for to ensure appropriate quality care. The extension to the carer payment will provide welcome additional financial support for parents and carers who have a very high caring load. It will, I believe, not only lighten their financial load a little but also make having a break less stressful. As an example, Beth Sanson, from my electorate of Gilmore, is the Secretary of the Council of People with Multiple Sclerosis on the South Coast. She has had MS for nine years, and her husband, Gordon, left work to care for her. According to Beth, caring for someone with MS Tuesday, 23 March 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 4119 can be different from day to day, as the illness can take different forms each day. Progressive MS gets steadily worse until the sufferer is completely disabled. They require full-time care, from getting them out of bed in the morning to showering, feeding and toileting. Other sufferers get attacks of MS which can render them partially paralysed for days or months at a time. Beth does not need 24 hours a day care, but she cannot do a lot of the things she used tothings that we take for granted. For example, Beth can put the washing in the machine, but cannot hang it out or bring it in when it is dry as she cannot stand up long enough to do that. If she wakes up in the middle of the night, her husband has to help her to the bathroom, as she finds it difficult to get off the bed. Beth welcomes the changes to the Assistance for Carers Legislation Amendment Bill 1999 because she said that it will at least give her a little extra money to enable both her and her husband to get the benefits from some respite care. She said that they both need a break, but she knows that Gordon finds it difficult to leave her unless he knows she is in good care. In the area from Berry to Ulladulla, the Council of People with Multiple Sclerosis has compiled a list of the people with MS. There are 47 people listed with the organisation. In the area from Wollongong to Bega, 300 MS sufferers are listed with the organisation. However, Beth believes there may be twice as many in both areas, but there are some people who do not choose to be part of the support group for various reasons. The Assistance for Carers Legislation Amendment Bill 1999 meets the needs of the community. I applaud the government for having the vision to see this and the commitment to do something about it. When the Assistance for Carers Legislation Amendment Bill 1999 was announced, I wrote a press release, which was published in the local papers. My office was then inundated by people requesting further information. Therefore, I know that there is a need for more assistance. The government is meeting this need and the number of people eligible to receive the carer allowance will be dramatically increased. In fact, an extra 14,000 people who care for others less fortunate will be able to receive financial assistance. More good news is that the carer allowance will not be subject to any income or assets test and will not be taxed. Carer allowance and carer payment can be claimed and paid while the care recipient is in hospital for up to 63 days in any calendar year. A bereavement payment will be paid on the death of the care recipient. Easing the financial burden for carers is an acknowledgment by this government that being a carer, although in most cases a labour of love, is also a job and one that deserves financial recognition. The response from the people of Gilmore has shown me that the Assistance for Carers Legislation Amendment Bill 1999 is well supported in the community and welcomed by those who give selflessly to others. The changes to the carer payment have come about through extensive consultation with the Carers Association of Australia. The association is supportive of measures in this bill and, even though the financial assistance may be less than the association would have liked, the eligibility criteria and the administration of the payments will all be vastly improved. Similarly, this government will be communicating with the Carers Association of Australia to revisit the changes after they have been implemented and address issues as they arise. I welcome feedback from the Gilmore community and look forward to comments and constructive criticism should there be any. 4120 MAIN' COMMITTEE Tuesday, 23 March 1999 Ms HOARE (Charlton) (5.28 p.m.)-The opposition does support the Assistance for Carers Legislation Amendment Bill 1999, but we still have serious concerns over the introduction of significant changes to the way the eligibility for many of these payments will be assessed prior to the finalisation and the availability of the adult disability assessment tool, which is a key part of that assessment. The basis of the need for governments to provide financial and social support to Australian carers is that those carers actually save our government around $16 billion a year. The largely unrecognised work of carers translates into over $700 a week cost savings for each person who does not have to enter a nursing home. The carers looking after these people survive on around $200 a week. This legislation is another small step in providing carers with the resources they need to be able to care for their loved ones at home for as long as possible. Government financial resources are minimal and previous eligibility criteria could have ruled out that support for some. I hope that the adult disability assessment tool will alleviate some of those restrictions on families and we in the Labor Party will be insisting that the government do provide us with the final version of the assessment tool at the earliest possible time. If there are then significant problems with it, we will have no option but to seek to have it disallowed. Let us hope that this is not necessary. We will also want the government to commit itself to review the operation of this legislation to ensure that no Australian family is worse off. . I will turn to some background to the carers legislation. Social security income support for people caring for adults with disability originated with the creation of the spouse carers pension in December 1983. It was a Hawke Labor government initiative that introduced the original carer discrete income support payment. It was payable to the husband of a severely handicapped aged or invalid pensioner or rehabilitation allowee who required constant care and· attention, either permanently or for an extended period. The care had to be provided by the husband in person and in the matrimonial home. The husband could only receive the spouse carers pension if he was ineligible for an age, invalid or service pension. The rates and the conditions were the same as for the wife pension. From November 1985 this payment was renamed the carer pension and made available to anyone caring for a severely handicapped relative who was an age or invalid pensioner. The care had to be provided by the carer in person and the carer had to live in the home of the handicapped relative. From February 1988 the carer pension could be paid to a carer who was not a relative of the person being cared for. The requirement that constant care and attention was necessary was removed. It was replaced by a stricter requirement that personal care· in connection with bodily functions, including eating, toileting and medication, or constant supervision to prevent injury to the person or others, were required. From January 1991 the carer pension was made available for people caring for a severely handicapped person in receipt of any income support payment. Carers who lived in neighbouring dwellings to those in which the person they cared for lived were also made eligible for the carer pension. From July 1993 carers were allowed to cease care for a total of 42 days in a calendar year-up from 28-and still be eligible for the carer pension. They were also allowed to travel overseas during the periods when they were not giving care. Carers were also allowed to participate in employment, education or training for up to 10 hours a Tuesday, 23 March 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 4121 week and were allowed to accompany the person being cared for overseas for up to three months without losing their entitlement. From March 1996 the carer pension was paid for 14 weeks after the permanent institutionalisation of the person who had been receiving care. Carer pension was payable where the person receiving care was not in receipt of a social security payment. The carer was no longer required to live in the same house or in an adjacent house to the person being cared for. This is how the carers legislation has evolved. From July carer pensioners were eligible for advanced pension payments of between $250 and $500 to assist with living or capital expenses. In July 1997 the carer pension was renamed the carer payment. The number of hours that the carer could spend in employment, voluntary work, education or training was extended and the number of days that a carer might temporarily cease caring in a calendar year was increased. From July 1998 eligibility for the carer payment was extended to carers of profoundly disabled children under 16 years of age. Carers were able to cease caring for up to 63 days in a calendar year and still qualify for the carer payment. In July 1998 there were nearly 34,000 people receiving carer payments, with total outlays of $270 million in 1997-98. At the moment there are nearly 12,000 people caring for people who are on an age pension. There are more than 18,500 people caring for people who are on a disability support pension. There are just over 3,500 people who are on a carer payment where it is not indicated that the people they are caring for are on any other kind of social security payment. As previous speakers have indicated, caring does bring its own rewards but the work is unpaid, unrelenting and around the clock. The chores involved include feeding, washing, lifting, toileting, giving medication, transporting, coordinating medical practitioners and filling out forms. Carers get little sleep, emotional support or respite. Carers who fulfil these tasks are mainly women. A breakdown includes 39 per cent adult offspring, mainly daughters, caring for their parents; 23 per cent are spouses or partners, mostly elderly wives caring for husbands; 20 per cent are parents, mostly mothers, caring for children. The remainder are caring for a range of other relatives, usually elderly. Carers must also deal with a wide and diverse range of disabilities and behavioural problems, including some that have been mentioned here today: diabetes, stroke, dementia, heart disease, cancer, arthritis, asthma, multiple sclerosis, musculoskeletal problems, cerebral palsy, Down syndrome, development delay and various psychiatric disorders. Half the care recipients have multiple conditions. A common feature of caring for a relative with a long-term illness or disability is dealing with problem behaviour. In a recent survey, about 38 per cent of carers found their relatives' behaviour 'difficult' or 'very difficult' to cope with. About two-thirds experienced at least one frequent behaviour problem. The most common of these were repetition of questions and stories, listlessness and fatigue, inability to concentrate, crankiness or irritability and forgetfulness. Over half the carers surveyed indicated that relatives 'often' or 'sometimes' behaved in these ways. Attention seeking, hyperactivity, uncooperativeness, depression and fearfulness were also common. Over one in four carers recorded aggression in their relatives and one in 10 physical violence. Another major problem facing carers, which I think all members would agree with, is the need for respite care. While this legislation extends the time available for respite, and we 4122 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 23 March 1999 welcome that, it really is not much good for our communities where that respite care is not available. The complaints I hear from my carer constituents are that there are not enough respite facilities available or that those facilities are not appropriate to the needs of the carer or the patients. The expense of in-home respite care puts that out of reach of most of my constituents. All of the local community options packages are full and'there are 12-morith waiting lists for residential respite care in nursing homes. With our ageing population, however, there is a myriad of services available to th--se families and many of these are funded under the Home and Community Care program by the Commonwealth government. These services in my area around Lake Macquarie include the Alkira Respite Centre, the Carers Action Network, Carers New South Wales""HJlnter Carer Respite Centre, Dementia Support, the Community Aged Care Packages, the AgedCare Rights Service, the Independent Living Centre, the Lake Macquarie CounCil-Ageing and Disability Worker, the Newcastle Council-Ageing and Disability Worker, the Lake Macquarie/Newcastle Home and Community Care support project, the Pensioners Advisory Service and the Program of Appliances for Disabled People. There are also many support groups which operate and which are gladly appreciated by my constituents who require those support groups. They include the Newcastle Agoraphobic SelfHelp Group, Cleft Pals, the New South Wales Council for Intellectual Disability, the Crisis Assessment and Treatment Team of Lake Macquarie, AMPS for amputees and associates, the Spina Bifida Support Group and the Stroke and Disability Information Service. And other support groups are around for sufferers and carers of people with anorexia nervosa, arthritis, attention deficit disorder, autism, cancer, cardiac and open heart, cerebral palsy, chronic fatigue syndrome, colostomy, cystic fibrosis, deafness and hypoglycaemia. There are support groups also for Down syndrome, Huntingdon's disease, muscular dystrophy and musculoskeletal problems, sudden infant death syndrome, sight defects, Parkinson's disease and Paget's disease. There are probably many more support groups in my electorate and in the electorates of other honourable members who will be participating in'this debate this evening. The Alkira Respite Service which operates from my home town of Toronto is run by a group of hard working, dedicated people who are committed to the work they are doing and who do much more than their funding suggests. These people include Betty Lawton, the coordinator of Alkira Respite Service; Pat Jones, who relieves Betty as coordinator; Lavina Staader, the activities officer at Alkira; Heather Riley, Kim Tobin and Jeanette Tudgery, who are nurses with Alkira; and Lenore Goodliff, the administrator. There are many more casuaJs and volunteers who give their time, their commitment, and their dedication to assist carers who are looking for respite care. Alkira also works closely with our local Community Options. Ann Mearrick is the coordinator of that group. As many other speakers would find, as I find when I go around my constituency and attend meetings of support groups and support organisations, many of these people are the same people who tum up all the time. I applaud and pay tribute to many of those workers in our community who give so. much time to those more in need. I would like to conclude with a reference to the funding which is allocated through home and community care forums and the funding which is allocated to the organisations that support carers. The level of funding is not enough, as I indicated before. The shortfall could Tuesday, 23 March 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 4123 have been alleviated by the $1. 7 billion that this government paid for private health insurance rebates. This $1.7 billion could have gone into reducing hospital waiting lists. Five hundred million dollars would have elimiQated hospital waiting lists across the country. Part oUhe $1.7 billion which was allocated for private health insurance rebates could have gonetoin,home and residential respite care. There could have been more for daycare respite. There could have been more assi-tance offered in this package, from that $1.7 billion, to carers. There could have been more money given to nursing homes so that it does not cost people when they do eventually have to gointo a nursing home. There was reference made by the previous speaker, the member for Gilmore, to a GST on health services; she indicated that most of these health services will not attract a GSTMr Hardgrave interjectingGST applied to every other good that a carer buys and every other service that a carer uses. Some of these expenses that other families in our communities do not have to face include home renovations and modifications around the home to enable the person that they love and care for to stay at home a lot longer. Another expense is services such as taxis which carers have to use· a lot more often than the average family that does not have to provide care for somebody with a severe disability. A GST will apply to electricity bills which are already much higher because of health requirements within the home. Therapeutic swimming pools will attract a GST. Special dietary requirements will attract a GST, as will sanitary needs. Any extra leisure activities pursued by the carer and the person whom they are caring for will attract a GST. Mr Hardgrave interjectingin my electorate that try to provide care for their loved ones in their homes for as long as possible, and who try to live on $200 a week, will be worse off with a GST. I reiterate: they could have been better off if the government had spent the $1.7 billion, provided for private health insurance rebates, on making life easier for carers and their families. Party opposition speak on any matter relating to aged care a very simple theme always develops. While they offer the big scare, the coalition offers the big care. There is a definite difference between those opposite and those who are in government. There is no doubt about it, when we came to power after 13 years of those opposite running this nation, it was the area of aged care, nursing homes in particular, which stood out as an area crying out for instant help and reworking. The fact is they defunded the area of nursing homes over a number of years as some sort of penalty to try to get nursing home operators to bring on capital works. All that did was fail. We then brought in a system adopting completely the approach that they had taken on hostels. But do you think those opposite would offer support when we mimicked their policy that had worked quite effectively in the area of hostels? No, it was the big scare. It was the big scare targeting older Australians day in, day out for months on end. I am on the record on so. many occasions as saying that the member for Jagajaga and her cohorts needed to be condemned for that big scare.",123,Representatives Main Committee

280,Mr Hardgra Ve (Moreton) (5.45 P.m.),"Whenever members of the Australian Labor4124 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 23 March 1999 Today, the member for Lilley, who seems to have adopted the mantle of the big scare after his three years of exile in the paddock-as I think he calls it-is now back on the white horse of scaring older Australians. So too is the member for Charlton. I was, until the last few minutes, going to associate myself with some of her comments in regard to recognising the real heroes of the carer community in her electorate. In fact, I think carers are the untold heroes of Australia and deserve the sort of support contained in the measures before us. But the member for Charlton adopted the big scare herself and decided to highlight things that were going to go up as a result of a GST. One she mentioned was sanitary items but, of course, every sanitary item has a 22 per cent wholesale sales tax on it. And did the Australian Labor Party offer any compensation to older Australians, disabled Australians or Australians in need when they increased wholesale sales taxes from 20 per cent to 22 per cent after the 1993 election? No. At least this government-the Howard government-is progressing along the path of recognising that costs will rise in some areas as a result of the changes to the taxation system and there will be compensation in such forms as: an up-front increase in pensions; holding on to the nexus between pensions and the male average weekly earnings-25 per cent of average weekly earnings will be the benchmark; and pensions will be tied at 1.5 per cent ahead of the CPI. These are all good reasons why this government can be said in faCt to be in care mode while Labor continues in scare mode. The member for Forde, who was in the chamber until a few moments ago, had a long and distinguished career in the area of disability services. Listening to the contributions from those opposite, she remarked to me that Labor never did the sorts of things this government is doing in the area of care and carers and care for disability services, and I believe the member for Forde is 100 per cent correct on that. Whilst it was never stated by those opposite it was certainly implied in the contribution of members to the debate today-a continuation of the early debates about nursing home funding arrangements in the 38th Parliament-that Labor has this philosophical notion that, when Australians reach a certain age, families no longer have the prime responsibility for care, and that, rather, institutionalisation is the answer. I found that particularly offensive. I actually put that to a meeting of people concerned about these matters, held in the Palomar Room at Sunnybank about 18 months ago. They realised that the automatic assumption that people reaching old age must be in a nursing home for some reason or other was a worrying philosophical underpinning of the Labor Party argument. Most families understand their responsibilities and will do their very best to provide the care and attention that those in their family need as a first port of call. This government is doing something about assisting them. We are doing something about helping families realise that responsibility that they do, in the main, want to take on. Through these measures here today we are offering some additional assistance, a package of measures aimed at improving assistance to carers, making sure that there is a clearer cut and more understandable definition and better allowances, through· eligibility criteria, for people who are carers of adults, liberalising it-if you like-to increase the number of recipients of benefits by 14,000. I know that in my own electorate there is a crying need for assistance, particularly amongst those who are the carers of adults; parents who have gone through the emotional tragedy of finding their child afflicted with a disability at birth who is then denied the natural consequence of working, growing older and retiring. Instead they have to continue to look after Tuesday, 23 March 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 4125 a disabled child. As until now there has never been the sort of assistance they needed, it has been, I am sure, an absolute lifelong tragedy for them. I know that the people at Soubirous Place-which our Lady of Lourdes Church at Sunnybank opened a couple of years ago and received substantial assistance for from this government-provide direct daytime respite for parents of the adult disabled in my electorate. I congratulate the work of the people in places such as that. I know that families undergo stress when they are taking on the role of caring for older relatives. They watch the person whom they looked up to as a child, and from whom they got all of the life skills that we all hope parents can pass on to their children, losing dignity. I am thinking in particular about my own family and how my parents did everything they could for my grandparents. My father's father realised, I guess, in his own mind, that it was no longer a possibility for my father to look after him and he moved out of my parents' home where he had stayed for a couple of years. He went into a hostel and paid his bond moneythere was never any argument about that-and he ended his life six weeks after moving into a nursing home, just a few months ago; a nursing home where, again, he fulfilled the government's requirements. He was a proud man who was never afraid to stand on his own two feet and do his darned best. It is people like that that this bill is really all about. This government is all about supporting those who want to realise the personal priorities that they establish for themselves and their families, whether through birth or simply the degeneration of the body and mind as life progresses. I congratulate the government for having this sort of resolve in the area of assistance to carers. I believe this bill will, in fact, provide the sort of certainty that a lot of carers want. But let us not kid ourselves that everything is always as good as it could be. I think we all understand that we would like to put as much effort as we could into assisting those who, of course, we can relate to in a personal way. I think it is worth noting for the record that, as a member of parliament from Queensland, I continue to have concern about the slowness of coalescing of nursing home payments which the government pays-federal funding, if you like-for nursing home residents in my state of Queensland. In fact, in comparison with Tasmania, Queensland continues to have a funding deficit of $7,391 per person per year for category 1 nursing home patients-a considerable deficit. In fact, $89.74 is paid per resident per day for category 1 in Queensland, while $109.99 is paid in Tasmania. That is no criticism of the circumstances that Tasmanians find themselves in but, in comparison with Queensland, Tasmanians do very well out of federal funding for nursing homes. I am looking forward to receiving the final version of the Productivity Commission's inquiry into this matter, because it is important that Queenslanders understand that they are getting a fair and equitable set of circumstances from federal government funding to nursing homes in Queensland. The solution that has been put forward by lobbyists from Aged Care Queensland is budget neutral. It does not disadvantage other states and I hope the government will look closely at it. Mr Deputy Speaker, I am sure you will be disturbed to know that disparity occurs simply because of what occurred in the Hawke government era in 1987, and this government again is left with another mess in the area of nursing homes to try to fix up. It is also worth noting that those who are already receiving domiciliary care benefit or child disability allowance currently need to understand what will happen when the carer allowance is introduced on 1 4126 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 23 March 1999 July this year. The people who are already receiving these sorts of payments will continue to receive the same amount of money but it will be called carer allowance. Reviews of entitlements will continue to be conducted, of course on a regular basis, to make sure that both the child and adult streams of carer allowance are commensurate with the cost involved and so forth. The new adult disability assessment tool will also be used for reviews of the adult stream of carer allowance, including recipients of child disability allowance who are currently receiving payments for a student child over the age of 16 with a disability. There will be reviews of their circumstances, and other people currently receiving child disability allowance for a child under the age of 16 will be reviewed and tested under the adult disability assessment tool at the same time as their child's 16th birthday. Essentially this government is getting on with sensible measures, measures which will offer the sort of dignity that those who receive the care as well as those who give the care deserve. I think it is important that all in this place do pay a great deal of tribute to those people who are the untold heroes of this nation. That both sides of this chamber are supporting the measures contained in the government's bill-while, of course, taking the opportunity to make their comments, to make their observations, on how to enhance them-is recognition that both sides of politics see the need to give everything we can to those who give everything they have to those who deserve everything they can get. I commend the bill to the House. Carers Legislation Amendment Bill 1999, we have a number of reservations, which have been outlined. The shadow minister, Wayne Swan, did a particularly good job of outlining some of those reservations, as did Kelly Hoare. She made a particularly good speech that certainly did not warrant the sorts of comments that it drew from the member for Moreton, who has just sat down. There is an immense amount of work that is yet required to be done in relation to caring and disability issues generally. While it is fine for government members to get up here and say what a great job the government is doing, as the previous speaker did, I think one has only to go out into the community, particularly the disabled community, to talk to some of the people and to listen to them tell some of the horrific stories about the way their lives are impacted on and the way they are affected when they simply set out to care for someone with a disability, particularly when that someone is a family member, to see what still needs to be done. I was recently adopted under the Adopt a Politician program, a scheme which was initiated in Western Australia. The family that adopted me was a family by the name of Edwards in my electorate-no relation-and, through that relationship with the father, Ian Edwards, and the son Alex, I have come to get a pretty good understanding of the incredible commitment that, in this instance, a single father has to make to look after a severely disabled son; a commitment which he has made for many years, and a commitment which he is happy to go on making. But the amount of government support he gets is negligible. Not only is it negligible but, because of the stand-off between the states and the attitude being taken by the minister responsible, and given that funding arrangements are not yet in place, his son is being even further disadvantaged. This government really needs to wake up to the problems that it is causing unnecessarily in this area. I would certainly urge the member who spoke before me to perhaps get out into",129,Representatives Main Committee

I want to speak about a different aspect from those raised by others. I want to refer to parts 2, 3 and 4 of schedule 1, which makes some minor technical amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. In my view, these amendments do not go far enough, and I will go through them and explain why I am saying that. I have been approached by a person who provides some financial support to a person who is a quadriplegic. In approaching me, this person has outlined to me how this particular client-and I will give his name: it is a Mr Dario Sinibaldi-requires care around the clock. In 1991 he was awarded a lump sum to pay for his cost of living independently from an institution. He does not want to go into an institution; he prefers to stay in a home environment. Mr Sinibaldi is a quadriplegic. He has no use of his feet or legs and very little use of his arms and hands. He is immobile, other than through the use of an electronically controlled wheelchair. He relies totally on carers for his every requirement: feeding, bathing, getting into and out of bed, drinking, turning over. As I said, my constituent chooses to live alone. He values his independence. He likes to be at home; he does not want to be in an institution. But he recognises and accepts that he has care for about 18 out of 24 hours. He probably needs care for 24 hours, but he simply cannot afford it. There are two issues at stake which I want to develop. I simply ask the minister to have a look at these issues and perhaps at some later stage of this debate he might be able to come back to me. If he cannot come back to me today, I would accept that, but I would really appreciate the minister's views on the things that I am about to outline. The first issue is whether Mr Sinibaldi should be entitled to a tax deduction for his cost of employing carers, or whether he should only receive the current available rebate, which is 20 cents in the dollar over and above expenditure of about $1,250 a year-I am not certain of that figure. The other issue is that the cost of providing amenities for carers is currently subject to neither a rebate nor an allowable tax deduction. I simply ask that the minister have a look at these issues and perhaps he might be able to take them on board. But in developing the argument about the first issue, which is that carers' wages should be tax deductible, I will just say this: Mr Sinibaldi's funds are carefully invested, so as to produce sufficient income to meet his expenses, and these expenses are quite considerable. His carers' wages are $75,000 per annum. Costs for carers' amenities are in the vicinity of $2,340 per annum. His personal living costs are about $20,000 per annum. That amounts of $97,340 per annum. The generation of this income means that my constituent is liable to pay tax at the top marginal rate of 49.6 per cent, which is inclusive of the Medicare levy on nearly $50,000 of his income. The income generated goes, in the main, to pay his carers. He pays tax on that income and, in turn, the carers pay tax on their earnings. As I understand it, he is entitled to claim a rebate of 20c against his medical costs. That only partly defrays the 49.6 per cent income tax liability on the bulk of his income. He is left with a situation where he has a tax liability of about $35,000 each year. He has that liability because he is a quadriplegic who requires care. As I said, he has to generate a lot of income to cover those costs-something like $130,000 per annum before he 4128 MAIN COMMIITEE Tuesday, 23 March 1999 pays tax and the other carers' costs about which I spoke. Of course, he also needs to generate the amount of about $20,000 needed for his personal living expenses. I might say that while he is outside of an institution and in a home he lives quite frugally. I have actually visited him in his home and he looks after his dollars; he simply has to. You, Mr Deputy Speaker, would probably understand how difficult it is in today's economic environment to generate that sort of an income. Going back to the rebate, it seems that the rebate was conceived as being a fair method of compensating people for medical costs without encouraging unnecessary spending. It was probably also implemented without thought for people in my particular constituent's situation, but with bracket creep affecting tax on earnings and with the continually rising cost of living, clearly the rebate does not fairly compensate people with higher incomes required to meet medical expenses. As my constituent was awarded his lump sum to enable him to live independently, it seems only fair that he be given an opportunity to use his funds for that purpose rather than seeing those funds largely being absorbed in taxes. He is currently eating into his capital, Mr Deputy Speaker, and it seems that in the foreseeable future he is going to find it harder to generate the sort of income that he requires to live independently and to pay his carers. What is going to happen is that he is going to find himself, if he is not cautious, back in an institution or relying on some other public monies to enable him to ha""e the sort of care that he wants. That is why I am saying that parts 2, 3 and 4 of schedule 1, which make these minor technical amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Acts do not really go far enough. That is why I want to take this opportunity during this debate to get the minister to perhaps have a look at the issues that I am raising. We all know that five minutes prevention can often negate a whole lot of problems further down the track. In relation to my constituent, carers come in for 18 of the 24 hours per day, and two carers are in the house for four hours in the morning. As I said, he would really like to have care for 24 hours but it is just not something he can afford. The cost of running his home is largely related to the cost of his carers. More than half of all household items consumed and depreciated would relate to use and wear and tear by carers for their own reasonable amenity. The expenses attached to the day-to-day requirements of the carers are simply an extension of his medical carer costs. While this is only $2,340 per annum, the income that must be generated to pay these costs attracts the top marginal tax rate, as I have explained. As these expenses are purely the result of his need for care, perhaps this item should also be subject to either the medical rebate or treated as a tax deductible item because without carers the costs would not be incurred. I will give you an itemisation of these costs as they were presented to me. Carers sleep in the house overnight, every night, which means that a room must be kept solely for the use of carers. Each carer requires freshly laundered bed linen, evening tea and coffee, a morning meal and a morning shower. Expenses relating to the provision of these facilities for carers are: laundry goods; wear and tear on the washing machine; power; tea, coffee, toast, cereals and fruit et cetera; and cooking utensils and the power that they consume. He goes on to tell me that there needs to be the replacement of linen every nine to 12 months, for example, three sets of sheets and pillowcases. Doona covers, mattress protectors and other bedroom items require replacement less often. The bed and mattress depreciate and require replacement probably on a 10-year or so rotation. Toiletries and cleaning goods such Tuesday, 23 March 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 4129 as soap, toilet paper and general maintenance, including light bulbs, also need to be taken into account for the 12 hours that the overnight carers work. . Generally, the things I have listed here are the things that, as we go about our general dayto-day living as able-bodied persons, we would consume and use ourselves. But, as I have said, because this bloke requires carers-not just one carer, but a number of carers over the course of the day-the use of these things is much more pronounced. The use is probably similar to that of a family with three or four kids rather than an individual, as this person is, living in a home and trying to stay independent, trying to stay away from the government purse, and trying to stay out of an institution. He goes on to tell me that he estimates that a sum of about $5 per day would cover consumables, and the depreciation of furniture could either be calculated on a straight line basis over 10 years, or that a flat sum of $10 per week could be allowed for wear and tear and replacement. In total, he believes that the cost would realistically be $5 by seven days, plus $10 per week, which equals $45 per week, or $2,340 per annum, which I mentioned as the figure he has come up with. Having visited Mr Sinibaldi I know that he lives conservatively, and he keeps costs down as a matter of necessity. He needs to do this to ensure that he is not running over his budget, and to ensure that the dollars he is generating as a result of his investments are there to pay for the type of care that he requires. As I said, as conservative as he is, it is very difficult to foresee his future and to foresee where his investments might be and what they will be generating two or three years down the track. I apologise if I have strayed a little bit further than the bill would normally have taken me, but I think it is important when we talk about carers to look at both sides of the coin. HereI have given you a situation where the government has brought forward a bill which the opposition has said it supports. We have voiced reservations to that support, but in giving that support, as I am today speaking on the Hll, I also wanted to draw to the attention of the minister and of the committee, this other side of the coin so that we can see that there is still a lot of work required. I do not want to get into a debate about the GST, and perhaps some will argue that this bloke will get some relief under a GST given the income that he is generating, but we do not know what impact he will suffer as a result of the GST and perhaps that is something that the minister could have a look at. I will conclude my remarks fairly soon, but I did want to reiterate that which I said at the start of my comments on this bill. None of us in this place should lose sight of the need for those who are in receipt of care to have that care delivered in a dignified way, and neither should we lose sight of the need for those who provide the care to be able to do it in a dignified way. Giving care, either on a professional basis, or on a basis where you are looking after someone who is a family member, where you are not being paid, requires a great degree of commitment. I have great respect for people in that situation where they have to give care, and I think that we in this place, regardless of which side we sit on, should do all in our power to ensure that that dignity is there as much as it possibly can be. Ms GAMBARO (Petrie) (6.17 p.m.)-I sympathise wholeheartedly with the previous speaker, the member for Cowan, and his story about his constituent and the care that is required around the clock. It is a very intensive process and he made a great and painstaking effort today to go through the daily costs of a person who is at home, who has a disability",132,Representatives Main Committee
282,And Requires Constant Care. People Like Mr Sinibaldi,"and I hope I have said that correctly4130 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 23 Mar.ch 1999 have the choice to stay at home because of a number of aspects that this· government has brought in that were not there before. It is always preferable to stay in one's home and be in the comfort and the familiar surrounding of one's home. People like that constituent would not have been able to stay at home had we not brought in a vast array of measures in the particular area that we are all speaking on today. I sympathise with the member for Cowan. I know the problems of carirtg for elderly relatives. I meet regularly with people in the community who have to care for people with disabilities, and the enormous strain that imposes on their daily lives and their family lives is very apparent to all of us in this room. I know that there is a great deal more that can be done and I would not hesitate to recommend that more be done in this area for people. But it needs to be brought to the attention of member for Cowan that this government has achieved a great deal, and I would like to reiterate some of those things that we have done. When the Howard government came into office in 1996 we inherited a system and an economy on the edge of collapse. In that time we have managed through our economic policies to reshape some of those mismanaged and misguided policies of those Hawke-Keating Labor years. The previous Labor government was driving the economy into the ground. They ignored so many areas because of their rather arrogant and indifferent attitude towards the plight of the people that we are speaking about today, battling Australians. The Assistance for Carers Legislation Amendment Bill 1999, unlike so many that have come here before under Labor, will address the needs of an average group of Australians who provide the community with an incredibly valuable service. The fine work that they do must be reiterated-and at little or no cost in the past. The Assistance for Carers Legislation Amendment Bill 1999 recognises the demanding work and the hardship that comes with being a carer. It is a 24-hour job and a very relentless one at that. But the carers that I speak to do it with great compassion and great love. It is a bill that redresses the balance in an area that was neglected by the previous· Labor government. The provisions in this bill deliver on the government's April 1998 Staying at Home package. That was quite a revolutionary package, which made life a lot easier for hundreds of thousands of Australians. These measures that we are speaking about here today will go a long way towards making life much easier for carers. The principal reform of the bill is the introduction of a new social security payment, the carer allowance. This carer allowance will combine two existing payments: the child disability allowance payment and the domiciliary nursing care benefit. It actually makes it a more simple system. The child disability allowance formerly provided a benefit to the carers of children up to the age of 16. Conversely, the domiciliary nursing care benefit was paid to carers of people aged 16 or more. In this bill, the carer allowance will bring the two together. The combination of these two payments will also be complemented by a liberalisation of the eligibility criteriafoi: the new carer allowance. The current eligibility criteria do not really allow for sufficient flexibility in the recognition of the role of carers of adult sufferers. For example, as it stands at the moment, access to domiciliary nursing care benefit is based on whether or not the carer requires ongoing nursing care and also on whether or not the person would be eligible for nursing home car-. This poses a real problem for many carers of people of adult age in that it locks them really out of the benefit because of the rigid definition of the role of a carer. Tuesday, 23 March 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 4131 The criteria also fail to recognise and include people who care for people who need high level care; The previous speaker mentioned a person in that particular position, a high level care person who needs constant supervision but does not need continuous nursing care. Carers of dementia sufferers and of people with multiple disabilities are therefore ineligible. The Howard government believes that these carers should be eligible for assistance and that is why this bill introduces a new assessment method for the carer allowance for the adult stream, and I would like to commend that recognition. Schedule 1, part 1 of the bill amends the Social Security Act 1991 to create the adult disabilityass.essment tool. The new assessment tool will ease the eligibility criteria for the carer allowance by more broadly recognising the needs of carers and the recipients .of care. This is a very progressive move that the government anticipates will see some 14,000 carers take up assistance for the first time. I know the carers in the Petrie electorate will be very pleased to see this in place. From July 1999, the government will inject approximately $98.5 million over four years into the carer allowance and this is a huge step forward. Liberalising the eligibility criteria is also an important step. Exempting the carer allowance from means and income tests reflects the government's commitment to Australian carers. We will always have an ongoing commitment to people in this particular role. The liberalisation of the eligibility criteria for the carer allowance will also extend to the means tested pension payment for carers, and that is the carer payment. The introduction of the adult disability assessment tool covering carers who look after adults with disabilities where the disabled adult has a child under six or children under 16 with qualifying disabilities is a welcome measure. In my role as a federal member I quite often have to attend functions that are put on in my electorate and I admire people like those in the Endeavour Foundation and the work that they do with people with disabilities. It is important to note that there is a need for more services like that in the community. What is more, this bill also makes provision for carer payment recipients to receive a bereavement payment on the death of a partner who was in receipt of a social security benefit. That can be a very welcome thing. It is a very distressing time when a partner is lost in these circumstances. I do work in my electorate for Meals on Wheels and I was quite pleased one day to be able to assist someone who was placed in this position. The impact that the death of a person has on the partner's life can never be underestimated. The elderly gentleman in question was very distressed and was not even able to pick up the phone and make a phone call to Social Security. We must always recognise that a lot of people in that situation do not have any family or any people that they can call on. The bill makes provision for a bereavement payment. That is a very welcome addition. The bill also provides for the recipients of both the carer allowance and payment to claim benefits while the care recipient is in hospital for a period of up to 63 days in a calendar year. I believe. that this isa very welcome measure as well. Carers have spoken to me about this in particular. Carers, as 1 am sure many people would agree, playa very important role in our community. It is not a role that people seek out by choice; it is a role that they are often driven to by tragic circumstances. They are often looking after elderly parents. I think back to when I was in my teens and my mother cared for our grandfather at home. It gave me a new insight into the constant care that she provided-I think that, as younger teenagers, we often underestimated 4132 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 23 March 1999 the care that she provided in our home. Having worked with people in this situation and spoken to many carers, I think it is something that we should never underestimate. In Australia today, nearly half of all people with dementia live at home, and I would like to speak about that. They are also dependent on carers for support. Without that particular support, dementia sufferers would be institutionalised. Dementia is often caused by a variety of reasons, a lot of which are medical reasons. I think we need to provide for those people and ensure that they are in a safe and comfortable environment, and quite often the home is that environment. In recognition of the contribution carers make to the community, the Howard government has also increased funding available for carers, despite the budgetary constraints imposed upon the government's social program by Labor's mismanagement. That needs to be highlighted here. Despite the fiscal difficulties that Labor brought upon the current administration, the government has been able to set aside $280 million as part of a staying at home package. In summary, I would like to reiterate my pride in being a member of the Howard government that has put this bill in place. I also believe that any measures that can somehow lighten the heavy burden that is carried by carers are worthy of unequivocal support. I commend this bill to the House.
