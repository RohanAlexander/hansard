The paragraph containing has directed attention. In regard to tbe the statement reads as follows: The Premier( Mr Holman) has advised the City Council that to combat the statements that which I have already given; have appeared in some English newspapers concerning the small-pox outbreak cablegrams had been forwarded to Mr Coghlan and the officer in charge of the State's agency in San Francisco, asking them to give wide publicity to the fact that the epidemic is of a very mild type, and that of the 400 cases no deaths have occurred, and no patients have been dangerously ill. Has notice been taken of that statement by the Government, or will notice be taken of it? Isi t intended to back up the Premier of New South Walesi n the endeavour to remove the stigma which has been cast by this Government on the whole of Australia? to answer questions generally, but I may inform the honourable member that some time ago a message was sent by the Commonwealth to the H i gh Commissioner, telling him exactly the nature of the outbreak. That message was somewhat on the lines of the statement to which the honourable member has drawn my attention. there is published a letter signed by MrM . Meagher, of Bathurst, who, discussing the question whether the Attorney General should continue to hold the Marconi Company's general retainer, saysThe late Sir Charles Russell held a general retainer for the London Times. This paper was publishing a number of articles attacking Parnell and his party. hands were tied in Parliament, and because of his general retainer he could not deal with such questions as "" Parnellism and Crime"" as freely as he would wish. He wrote to Mr Soames, the Times solicitor, as follows :W ill the Prime Minister Dear Sir,-As the writings in the Times under the title Parnellism and Crime, and in relation to that subject, are now under discussion in Parliament, in which discussion i may be called upon to take part, 1 think you It would be very interwill agree with me that it would be better, at such a juncture, I should not continue to hold the general retainer for the Times. The w o r d "" general "" is used there in a very emphatic sense. I would ask the Attorney-General whether he is disposed at the present juncture to adopt a similar attitude in regard to the MarconiI wish to direct the attenCompany to that which was adopted by MrW . H . IRVINE I have read other part of his question I do not propose to give any answer other than that personal explanation. In last Saturday's issue of the Register and the Advertiser, both of which newspapers are published in Adelaide, I am credited with having made the following statementHe did not believe the present Sydney outbreak was small-pox at all, but the dictum of the Medical Union, which was the closest and narrowest in the world, had to be obeyed. He protested against the Government's action in having quarantined Sydney on account of the damage it had done in this State, and also New South Wales. He also objected to the Commonwealth, through the Naval Board, finding well-paid jobs for half-pay Navy officers in connection with the administration of the Navy Act, as had been done in the case of the lighthouse exprrt. Some honourable members may hold the views which have thus been attributed to me. I wish to say that I expressed no opinion on the quarantining of Sydney, that I did not mention small-pox during the course of my speech, and that I did not criticise the appointment of the lighthouse expert.

14,Mr Frazer,"I desire to make a-Parramatta ) ting the motion which I intend to propose in regard to the business of the day I should like to make mention of the death of an old and respected member of this HouseI mean the Honourable William Knox, who, for many years, was one of our most highly-esteemed representatives here, and one of the most useful members withal that this chamber has known. He was a man of patriotism and zeal in the public service of the country-on e whose example all may worthily emulate, though few certainly will excel. It seems as if death has laid a heavy toll on the members of this Commonwealth another is to be counted amongst those who have gone hence, and lef t their labours to be carried on by others. We can but acquiesce in these visitations from time to time, and hope that we may do our duty as f a it h f u l l y as he did who has just gone from amongst us. I am quite sure that I voice the feelings of the whole House when I say that we tender our sincerest sympathy to the bereaved ones, and pray that a kind Providence may assuage their grief and soften the blow to them. The Prime Minister quite correctly said that he spoke for the whole House when he expressed sympathy with the widow and family of the late Honourable William Knox, who, both in a private and public capacity-especiall y in his own State -ha s rendered valuable service to the community. The head of the Government also very fittingly referred to the severe toll demanded by Nature of the people's representatives in this Parliament. I have expressed my views on that subject before, and I do not wish to repeat them. Our sympathies go out to the bereaved ones. Nature demands that we must all go hence at some time, and however much we may differ as to the methods which should be followed in carrying on the government of the country we all recognise f a it h f u l service by any honourable member, no matter what political views he may hold. important for us to recollect that every person who enters this Chamber enters it as the choice of a majority of the electors of his constituency. The position which OP THE Honorable he holds is, therefore, a very honourable one. I join with the Prime Ministeri n offering our sympathy to .the widow and [3.12] -Before submitrelatives of the late Honourable William Knox, and in placing on record our recognition of the public services which he rendered. I wish to add a few words to what has already been said by the Prime Minister and my respected leader, because the late Honourable William Knox was the oldest friend I had in politics. It is more than forty years ago when he, one of the handsomest men in Melbourne, took my part as one of the youngest officials in a bank in this city, and thus rendered me a kindness which afterwards cemented into a friendship that was never broken. Later on, I followed the study of another Parliament. One after profession, whilst he remained associated with the bank. Few men have filled as large a position as he has, and though we differed politically, our friendship was never estranged. I wish, therefore, to pay my meed of praise to one who proved himself a true friend and a kindhearted gentleman, especially when I brought the unemployed movement under his noticea movement which he assisted monetarily and in other ways. I join in the hope which has been expressed, that his bereaved ones may have God's help to enable them to bear their affliction, and, in conclusion, I would say, as every one else here will say, "" God rest his soul.""

MrM c DONALD (Kennedy) [3.22] I enter my protest against the suspension of the Standing Ordersa procedure to which, both in Federal and I would point out State politics, I have always objected. To my mind, there, could be no more serious invasion of our parliamentary privileges than is involved by the suspension of the Standing Orders. The Government of the day, whether it be a Not under our Labour or a Conservative Administration , Bhould protect to the fullest extent the procedure of the House. A time may I am speaking now come when party feeling is running high, and when the one side or the other, having behind it a strong servile majority, will by this means rule the Housei n a way that the people do not desire. This is a proposal against which every honourable member in ordinary circumstances should take a stand; but as I understand that on the present occasion the suspension of the Standing Orders is desired in order to obtain Supply, I do not intend to take very strong exception to it . I shall, however, continue to protest, as I or REPEALING ACTSof the Standing Orders from time to time. endorse the words that have just fallen from the lips of the honourable member for Kennedy.

29,Mr Higgs (Capricornia) [3.24],"Ibhe Commonwealth Parliament should be able to tour the country with their guests, who, by the way, we are most anxious to see enjoy themselves while in the Commonwealth. In the circumstances, I do not offer any objection to this motion. The Treasurer to-day is so very mild and courteous that one really finds it difficult honourable member suggested, early in to offer any objection whatever. wish to express my pleasure that some honourable members have at last learned the lesson that the Standing Orders should not be lightly suspended. I quite agree with what has been said by the honourable member for Kennedy, but regret that when from time to time, during the first five years of the Commonwealth Parliament, I objected to the Standing Orders being suspended I did not receive the support of honourable members now sitting in Opposition. A t that time they sat behind another Administration, and gave it their f u l l support. On almost every occasion on which such a motion as this was submitted I pointed out that it was not in accordance with the best parliamentary practice, and should not be encouraged; but I cannot say I ever received the support of a member of the Labour party. In this instance there is some excuse for the action proposed. Who delayed the last general election so long that a SupplyB ill could not be brought forward until the financial year bo! which it related had already been entered upon ? rightly have been held last March or A p r i l , We should then have been able to meet by the 1st June-befor e the beginning of the present financial year. I do trust that now that we have in power a sound Administration they will correct this ' procedure at the first opportunity, and that we shall at last have the granting of Supply, as it ought to be, within the control of the House. I , therefore, welcome the support of honourable members opposite, who have announced their objection to the suspension of the Standing Orders, and have no doubt that M i nisters will gladly receive it in bringing our procedure in this respect into that f u l l aud proper order from which it ought never to have departed. is obvious that the honourable member for Werriwa is trying to score off the Opposition by urging that the general election should have taken place at an earlier date. The honourable member, who professes to be a student of the Constitution, ought to know that under the Constitution the Senate continues to exist until the 30th June, so that if the general election had taken place in A p r i l , and Parliament had been called together, as the June, any members of the Senate who had been defeated at the polls would have been able to take part in the passing of the SupplyB ill . That is what is advocated by the enthusiastic constitutionalist who has been returned-temporarily , I hope-by the electors of Werriwa. the honourable member is particularly pleased that the honourable member for Werriwa has been returned. The Government has far more docile supporters. The honourable member for Werriwa urges that the late Government were responsible for keeping the Housei n existence longer than was necessary, with the result that we have now to pass a SupplyB ill when we ought to be dealing with the Estimates for the current financial year. He must have forgotten his constitutional knowledge, of which he used to give us the benefit when he was a member of the House on a previous occasion. Apparently, he recognises and approves of the pernicious principle that defeated senators should continue to take part in the legislation of the country. deal with Money Bills. liant gem of constitutionalism! Does the honourable member say that the Senate has not to deal with this B ill ?

It has to meet competition Hawaii and from F i j i and Java, which are natural places for sugar production in the tropics, and where white labour is not employed. The Australian Parliament is determined that the industry shall be carried on by white labour. Thirteen years ago it was difficult to make people in the southern parts of Australia believe that it was possible to produce sugar by white labour. The denunciations that came from the press, and those in terested, were all in the direction that it meant a disaster to the industry, and failure to those who had put their money into it . We on this side were the one party that stood solid, and predicted that the industry would succeed under reasonable Protection, with white labour conditions. The Government of the day-tii e Barton Government-brough t in the present Tariff with the addition of the bounty and the Excise, differentiating between white and coloured grown cane. By the economic operation of that legislation, without any coercion at all except the repatriation of the Polynesians, the industry has prospered as a white labour industry. It has settled about 700 miles of the north-east coast line of Australia in a way which could not have been done under other circumstances. Twenty years ago one could not persuade people even in Queensland that sugar could be successf u l l y grown with white labour north of Mackay. To-day, they all admit that it I is practicable to do so in nearly every part of Australia. There is another point in this matter that I wish to deal w it h ; then I will be finished.

We have also heard a great deal about the I have said that I great American Republic, and how its is now people are going to remedy their troubles with regard to trusts, combines, and monopolies. How does the President of the United States intend to act?

In America, sugar-growers have coloured labour, and yet those in terested there say that by the act of the Senatei n passing a measure to wipe out the duty by degrees, they would destroy They have a hope of existing the industry. How is it possible in a country like Australia, where there is a determination to provide that every white from two sides-fro m man who is engaged in a productive industry shall get fair wages and have reasonable conditions, the sugar industry could compete against open ports? The suggestion is impossible. Whatever our opinions may be on this question, they w ill have to be put to the test. Australian people, I believe, are ready and willing to pay more for sugar to enable the industry to continue.

Therefore, it lies with the Australan people to say what Protection shall be given to the industry. Certainly the Protection should be sufficient to give each party a fair return. In my opinion it would not help the producer if the Protection were such as to make the production in excess of the requirements of Australia.

The land-owners will not forget these honourable members when it comes to their turn to judge them. is not my intention to attempt to reply to the choleric outburst of the honourable and gallant Colonel. I will deal rather with the action of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer in regard to the repeal of the Sugar Bounty and Sugar Excise Acts. Later on, I may have a few words to say upon electoral matters. The Prime Minister stated the other evening that he did not promise to repeal the sugar bounty and sugar Excise legislation unconditionally. Of course, one may be excused for doubting the honourable gentleman, because he appears to make so many statements, and to forget all about them, that a denial on his part is quite a frequent occurrence. But I would remind honourable members that about a fortnight prior to the declaration of the poll at the recent general elections there appeared in the Brisbane Courier the followingInformation has been received by the Australian Sugar Producers' Association, through the Liberal Senatorial candidates, Messrs. T. D . sugar legislation was proclaimed ? And Chataway, R. J. Sayers, and A. G. St. Ledger, from the Honourable J. Cook, leader of the Party, that if the Liberals are returned to power at the coming general elections proclamations will be at once issued abolishing Excise and Bounty on sugar unconditionally. (Signed) 240 Queen-street, Brisbane. That statement appeared in the Brisbane Courier of 13th May, 1913, and was not What was done was absolutely uncontradicted by anybody. No doubt, it was used in the interests of the Liberal candidates there. up to that promise, we can understand the action of the Minister of Trade and Customs in proclaiming the repeal of the sugar bounty and Excise legislation without making due inquiry as to the quantity of sugar which was in bond at the time. Nobody in a deliberate assembly ever appeared more uncomfortable than the Minister did on the day that the honourable member for Yarra revealed his action in allowing the stocks of sugar in bond to be released without first having paid Excise. It is all very well for the Government and their supporters to say that it was the duty of the late Administration to have inserted in the Sugar Excise Repeal Act a provision to remind the) Minister of Trade and Customs that duty must be paid upon the sugar which was in bond at the time of the proclamation of that Act. By doing so they would have made themselves ridiculous in the eyes of Australia. It would have been necessary for them to have inserted a section which would have read somewhat as follows"" Whereasi t is probable that this Government will vacate the Treasury benches on the 31st May, and that a Liberal Government will take its place, it is hereby expressly declared that all sugar in bond upon the proclamation of the Sugar Excise Repeal Act shall pay Excise."" We have to recollect, too, that this is the Ministry of all the talents. It includes the Attorney-General, an eminent lawyer, who seems to have taken a very great interest in his work. The moment he was sworn in, he rushed away to introduce quite a new feature into our electoral administration. He at once instituted a search with a view to ascertaining all the information that he could regarding the electoral administration of the honourable member for Darwin.

They had important public duties to perform, and one of them was to see that the millers and others interested in this sugar paid duty upon it . Trade and Customs must know-and , indeed, anybody who takes an interest in Customs matters knows-that people like the Colonial Sugar Refining Company are perfect artists in. their endeavours to pay as little duty as possible. whose trade renders it necessary for him to pay duty is always watching the Tariff, and always making preparations to avoid paying Customs duty. Without doubt, some of those interested in sugar were awaiting the time when they could release the stocks which were in bond without paying Excise upon them. The Government seem to have been reminded by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, on Mr Knox's own showing, that they had made a mistake. I can well understand that that company, out of gratitude for the defeat of the referenda proposals, and the return of the Liberal Government to power, would be inclined to be magnanimous. at a meeting the other day that on the 25th July, the date of the repeal of the Sugar Bounty and Sugar Excise Acts, he informed the Government of their mistake. accurate.

Accordingly, we gave at once to the Customs all the particulars we possessed as to the quantity of sugar in which we were concerned that would be covered by the proclamation, and pointed out that whatever steps might be taken to protect the revenue, the growers who had made early deliveries of cane should receive the same advantage in respect thereto as those whose crops were cut after member for Yarra had spoken. 25th July. These representations were made by us three weeks ago, and since then the Comptroller has on several occasions seen our Melbourne manager about the position."" I join with the Leader of the Opposition in emphasizing the point that, though the Government knew this three weeks ago, nothing was said about their proThe Minister of posed legislation in the statement .which was thrown on the table of the House by the Prime Minister without any explanation whatever. Wasi t that they wished to hush the matter up ? Did they expect the Colonial Sugar Refining Company's Any person example to be followed by the other millers; and if the whole of the Excise due upon the sugar in bond had been collected, would nothing have been said about the matter ? The Minister of Trade and Customs stated on the night that he endeavoured to reply to the honourable member for YarraHonorable members opposite will find that the people they are complaining of are more Liberal than he gives them credit for. But they are not all as liberal as the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. It must be admitted that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company is a very powerful corporation, and that it has gained a great deal by the defeat of the Mr Knox stated referenda. One of the principal stockbroking firms in Australia-that of Messrs. Palmer and Son-state d that if the referenda were defeated the Colonial Sugar Refining Company's shares would go up. That prophecy has been fulfilled, shares in the company having increased in price by some £ 3 or £A each. It has been made possible for the company to bleed the people to a greater extent than they would have been able to do if our referenda proposals had been grateful, an'd intends to return this money, which ought to have been collected by the Minister of Trade and Customs and his officers. the money ? to do so. There are, however, others who have declined to pay. A meeting of the farmers and millers of Mackay was held about 15th August last-jus t about the time when the Minister said he was sending away telegrams to see if the matter could not be arranged in other words, to see if his mistake could not be rectified quietly before the honourable said that he had sent away telegrams that morning.",25,Arthur E Lavis Isters Were Not Foraging Amongst The

139,Mr Ttjdor,"I think that the MinisterHouse met that day he sent the telegrams. and millers of Mackay discussed the question, and, according to a report before meThe millers contend that the Government is in a difficulty through having paid bounty on cane sugar which paid no Excise, owing to not having gone into consumption, and wants to shelve the liability on the millers. A motion was proposed that the Federal Government should be asked to refund.to the refineries a l l the Excise of Trade and Customs would not have collected on this season's sugar up to July 25th, the date of the abolition, and that the refineries ing from the Queensland Government should be asked to pay the equivalent to the millers, in which case the millers would pay the growers gs. 2d., except where the growers have already received the bounty from the Government, in which case 7s. would be refunded -to the Government. The motion was not carried, some of the millers stating that they would not support the proposal, which would mean a loss to their companies of several thousands of pounds. carried "" That the Federal Government be asked to arrange the matter with the refineries."" To return to the point that this matter should have been attended to by the late Government, and that there should have been inserted in the Sugar Excise Bill a clause providing for the collection of duty on the sugar, I hold the opinion that the whole thing would have been arranged by the ex-Minister of Trade and Customs, the honourable member for Yarra. He would naturally, as any intelligent and active Minister of Trade and Customs would have doneI am not suggesting that the present Minister is not intelligent, but I do say that he was neglectful. after us. sistance was being sought by the Attorney-General and other members of the Government in their efforts to find out something against the late Ministry, whilst they neglected their important public duties. In all probability the ex-Minister of Trade and Customs, knowing the habits and customs of those who deal with the Department, would have said to those interested, "" The Queensland Government having passed certain legislation, we now propose, on a certain date, to proclaim the Acts repealing the sugar bounty and Excise legislation. Will you clear all your sugar up to 12 o'clock midnight on the day preceding that date?"" Naturally the refiners and all others interested in the repeal of that legislation would have said, "" Certainly, we shall do so,"" and that is all that would have been necessary. The Government could This meeting of the farmers have said to these people, "" Unless you clear your sugar up to the date named we shall have to suspend for a perioduntil you come to your senses-the issue of the proclamations with regard to the repealing bounty and Excise legislation."" There is yet another point to be considered. I venture to say that the ex-Prime Minister and the ex-Minister issued the proclamation without first asksomething more in regard to the promise made by Mr Denham. It will be remembered that the honourable member for Wide Bay, when Prime Minister, addressed to the Premier of Queensland a telegram stating that the Government of the Commonwealth would abolish the The following amendment was sugar bounty and Excise legislation if the States concerned would pass an Act(a) to confer upon the Commonwealth Parliament the power to legislate in respect of the employment of coloured labour and regulation of wages and conditions of labour,or (*) to abolish coloured labour in the industry and establish tribunals for the regulation of rates of wages and conditions of labour. Mr Denham, it will be remembered, said that he preferred the proposal contained in paragraph (6), providing for the abolition of coloured labour in the industry. But have tbe Queensland Government abolished coloured labour? No. They have passed three measures dealing with this question, and one of these will interest the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General, as well as the honourable member for Gippsland and others who have said that it is impossible for a Parliament to regulate wages. The Act is cited as "" The Sugar Growers Employes Act of 1913,"" and contains a schedule declaring that the weekly rates of wages for forty-eight working hours shall be, in the case of adults-withou t keep, £2 8s.; with keep, £ 1 16s. Youths (sixteen to eighteen), £ 1 4s., and so on. This is an attempt, and a successful attempt, apparently, to fix rates of wages. It is not the first time that a Parliament has fixed the wages to be paid in an industry. This Parliament, as well as the Parliaments of the States, has fixed the rates of wages payable to barristers. It has done so, if not directly, at least indirectly. scale.",26,Advantage Expected Carried The Company Is Apparently

150,Mr Conroy (Werriwa) [4.55],"Iyears we find that this industry has cost the Commonwealth over £14,000,000, while the total production, in addition to what it has cost the owners of the sugar lands, has been only £11,000,000. Manifestly, there has been a loss of nearly £4,000,000 of money, but, as some of this has gone into the Treasury, and has been expended for general purposes, we may take it that the cost to the community, in order to keep going a business that is not suitable to Australia, has been £10,000,000. In fact, the more we go into the matter the more we realize that this is what might be termed a blacklabour industry. sugar industry? ent result there might have been had this £10,000,000 been used in a different way-if it had been lent to young men willing to start wheat production on the share system. For each of such young men, £300 would have been quite sufficient, and we know that every sugar producer is costing a great deal more. On the average, those to whom this money could have been advanced would' have been able to repay it in about three years. In the first three years, with an advance of £1,000,000 , employment would have been given to 10,000 men in share-farming, and those men would have become the backbone of the country. In the second three, with the advance of another £1,000,000, and re-lending out of the first million, employment would have been given to 20,000 more, and in the third three years to 40,000 more. MrJ . H . CATTS -With whom would they have shared ? with whom they would have shared; they would have probably shared with themselves or with their fathers; at any rate, they would have had capital to start on their own account. MrJ . H . CATTS -Should we finance the squatters on half-share terms? finance a single squatter, but to finance the sons of farmers, who are directly concerned in the primary industries. Under such a plan as I have indicated, we should, at the end of ten years, have given employment to 70,000 farmers, who would have been returning the money advanced, and not costing the country a penny. The money would then have been available to advance to others. munity making a living by taking in each other's washing. would have had to sell their products in the markets of the world against the competition of the world. Theirs is a real primary industry; and if it were not for the primary industries no secondary industry could exist. would apply to any other industry. way. My point is that another class of men would have been put on that land. By granting them assistance in the same manner in which we have built up the sugar industry, and at practically the same cost, we could have placed 70,000 young farmers on the land working on shares, who would all be of great benefit to the countryj earning something for themselves over and above the cost of production. able member say that they could grow wheat on the sugar country? the sugar industry passing out. Take poultry and eggs; they return three and three quarter millions, nearly three times the value of the sugar production. The average area under sugar is 140,000 acres, and we contribute £ 7 per acre to keep that land under cultivation, though I have been told this land is the richest land in Australia, or, some say, in the world. If we have to contribute £ 7 per acre to keep rich land in cultivation, then the more rich land we have the worse off we are. We ask the man on poor land to contribute to the owner of the rich land. B ut this is the monstrous proposition that is assented to by Parliament, that the richer the land is the less it is able to support itself, and the greater the contribution demanded from the man on poor land in order that the rich land may be held under cultivation. at this juncture ? pointing out what it costs the community to grow sugar cane.

We find roughly that it has cost the Commonwealth Parliament £10,000,000, which could have been used in other directions.

I have shown that, in poultry and eggs, we produce three times the value of the sugar output, and that is an industry conducted on the poorer lands of the Commonwealth. From this time forward, the sugar industry will depend upon the Tariff only. The production may be 190,000 tons, but the people of the Commonwealth will still pay not less than a million pounds sterling, which is, no doubt, to be a continuing payment. In an ordinary business concern, people may consider the advisability of advancing a million or two to get a return of £10,000,000, but we have a definite statement from the Leader of the Opposition that there is no hope for the sugar industry, except with the introduction of new machinery. Are we to call on the poorest citizens fo pay for machinery for this industry? I merely incidentally MrJ . H .

I should like to say that, so far as honourable members on this side are concerned, they have always endeavoured to deal out even-handed justice to the farmers, as well as to other people in Australia. In the Parliament of New South Wales, as well as in the Federal Parliament, I have represented districts in which there are a great many farmers. that the Labour party is the political party that looks best after their interests, and we consequently get a very large measure of support from them. It would be well if the honourable member for North Sydney were more careful in the statements he makes in this House, and did not endeavour to fasten a stigma upon this side, while at the same time insulting every elector in Australia of a different way of thinking from himself. The honourable member for Werriwa takes exception to the amount of money expended in connection with the sugar industry. The honourable member is of opinion that it would be far better for the Commonwealth, instead of fostering that industry and encouraging the production of sugar by white labour, to expend the money in some other direction, and preferably by inducing people to take up land on the share-farming system. First of all, we would require to find the lane? on which to settle the 70,000 farmers the honourable member spoke about. But, apart from that difficulty, I venture to assert that the legislation enacted by the Commonwealth Parliament some years ago to deal with the sugar industry has That is language rendered a splendid service to Australia. The honourable member for Werriwa preSo far as the land-owners tended that the industry is fit only for black labour, and I may take it from his remarks that he is an advocate of black labour, so far as sugar growing in Queensland is concerned. This Parliament in its wisdom took the view that the industry could be carried on by white labour, and it has been abundantly proved that Parliament was right in taking that view. IA t the time when this legislation was brought in we had something like 10,000 Kanakas producing sugar in Queensland. To-day there are considerably fewer than He a r , hear! It 1,000. In place of the Kanakas we have white men working in the sugar fields. We have a population of nearly 40,000 It referred to the supported by the production of sugar. In addition to that, we are told by the Queensland Government that there is room for still greater settlement in the sugar-growing districts. There are large areas of land available for people desirous of taking it up for sugar production, so that within the near future we can look forward to becoming self-supporting in this respect. Yet the honourable member who has preceded me advocates that we should repeal the duty on sugar and allow Very many of them realize it to come in free. What would that mean 1 It would mean that sugar production in Queensland and on the Richmond River would be a thing of the past. It would not be possible for the farmers there to compete with sugar imported from abroad. Consequently, the Commonwealth would lose, because, after a l l , we all know that every inhabitant of the Commonwealth is a source of wealth, and, if we shut up avenues of support for 40,000 people in an industry that is capable of being extended to support as many more, it will certainly be a bad thing for an Australian Legislature to do. The honourable member's argument is purely a Free Trade one from start to finish, and if applied to any other industry would have equally injurious results. In fact, it would mean paralyzing hundreds of industries in Australia, and we should lose a considerable part of our population.

A permitted explosive is supposed to give off no fire at all, owing to the danger to life if an explosion of gas should occur. A testing station would, I believe, cost something like £10,000 a year to erect and maiutaiu. ill this direction at present. vious Government had it under consideration for at least twelve months, and promised that something should be done, but it had to be lef t over u n t i l the present Parliament met. ber say that the late Government promised to erect a testing station? ence of opinion as to whether the States or the Commonwealth should deal with the subject. wealth question, because explosives are used throughout Australia.

The present state of things is highly dangerous. We may, of course, go on for years without an explosion, but a serious one may take place at any time because of defective explosives being used in mines. The sooner the Government rises to the occasion and erects a testing station, the better for all concerned. There is another matter which I wish to I hope that the bring under the notice of the Treasurer. In the Old-age PensionsA c t there is a provision to the effect that a blind person In Australia we use explosives may receive a pension. The amount is 10s. per week. In New South Wales, in We have to accept tests made in fluences are exerted to induce blind persons to go into an institution in Sydney. The Commonwealth Government takes 6s. a week from the pension, thus reducing it to 4s., and blind persons are informed that if they go into the institution the f u l l amount will be paid. The hardship of the practice is this: If a blind person resides up country-say , 200 or 300 miles away from Sydney-it is unfair to expect him to go into the institution in the city, where he will be so far away from his friends. Nothing has been done insist upon a blind person who lives in The prebhe country coining into the institution in Melbourne. the Treasurer will be inclined to listen sympathetically to what I have to say on this matter. In New South Wales a practice the reverse of that followed in Victoria prevails. I quite agree that every blind person should be trained to do some work useful to the community. But while it is easy for a blind person living within easy distance of the instituI think it is a Commontion to make use of it , it is quite otherwise with persons living 200 miles away. should not be compulsory in any case. kind in hand to-day.

The Treasurer's Advance has been almost wholly required to finance works and buildings authorized by Parliament"" and in course of erection. I am sorry to say that there is a very small balance available at present. On other occasions we have had to grant large sums to the Treasurer's Advancef o r that very reason. I hope that there will be some means found by which these large sums may in future be otherwise provided. Works are going on; there is no vote of Parliament for the works, and therefore the money required has to come out of the Treasurer's Advance temporarily u n t i l we can get a grant. I find that in 1910-11, up |bo the 12th August, the Treasurer had £600,000 for this purpose. certainly, the amount was not so much; up to the 3rd Augusti t was £ 3 5 0 , 0 0 0 ; but I am told by the Treasury officials that there was the greatest difficulty in managing with the sum u n t i l a further advance could be obtained.

Sir JOHN honourable friend was not quite so generous as I think he ought to be. He said that I wished to hide something up, or to say as little as possible.

Sir JOHN FORREST I stated the credit balance at the beginning of the do not wish to year, and the expenditure during the year, and pointed out that there was a surplus of £213,000 between the expenditure and the revenue for the year. I added that to the amount brought forward at the beginning of the year, and said that there was £2,474,000 at the end It is because works of the year, and that it had gone to trust accounts. What more or less than that could I say? only thing referred to was the amount of surplus on the year. Sir JOHN FORREST I might have gone on to say, if I had so chosen, that if all the moneys voted had been spent, in stead of having a credit balance of £213,000 for the year, my right honourable friend would have had a considerable deficit-£600,00 0 odd. that. that £702,000 less than the amount voted for the Fleet was unexpended, £93,000 less on the military, £39,000 Last year, less on the Navy, £71,000 less on postal buildings, £9,000 less on telegraphs and telephones, and £ 2 5 , 0 0 0' less on lighthouse building in fact, there was £940,000 less expended than was voted. There were underdrafts to the amount of £940,000, and an overdraft of £81,000, so that £859,000 voted by Parliament was unexpended last year. That sum has to be provided for this year.

I would like to say a few words about the prospects of this year. It is too early to say much about the revenue, but I may mention that the revenue from Customs and Excise up to the 21st of this month has not been quite equal to that of the previous year. I do not take much notice of the figures for a small period like six weeks, and therefore it is too early to make an estimate. I think that so far as Customs aud Excise revenue is concerned, we are about holding our own, and I hope that we will continue to do so. These are, I think, the only points which have been referred to. As regards the blind, I wil l have the matter looked into.

There will be no loss of revenue, and we intended that there should be none. We propose to take action which will secure the revenue which the country should get, and the in struction to which I have referred is evidence of that. On the 2nd August, we attempted to make an arrangement with the mill-owners which would enable the growers to get the f u l l benefit of the repeal of the Excise at the earliest possible date. That arrangement could nqit be completed, and I gave verbal, and afterwards written, instructions for the preparation of a Bill several days before the honourable member for Yarra took action in this Chamber. I said, when the subject was brought up here, that before Parliament assembled an instruction had been telegraphed which was evidence that we intended to take legislative action to secure the Excise revenue to the country. able gentleman take action to that end before ? an agreement had been entered into between the Commonwealth and the Government of Queensland for the repeal of our Excise and Bounty Acts upon the enacting of certain legislation by the Queensland Parliament.

The position is jthis: We have repealed the Excise and Bounty Acts, as agreed upon with the Queensland Government, and intend now to ask this Parliament to impose taxation which will secure the Excise Revenue, and at the same time give the benefit of 2s. 2d. a ton to the cane-growers up to the date of the repeal. The action that we have taken has been dictated by our regard for the welfare of the growers.

They desired to receive the benefit of the difference between the amount of the bounty payable and of the Excise collected. The whole of the legislation enacted by this Parliament towards the close of last session was intended to achieve that end. It was intended to in sure that the grower should receive an extra 2s. 2d. per ton for his cane. The position is perfectly clear. If , as the Leader of the Opposition has suggested, we had deferred action t ill some future date, the grower in the interim would have been denied the benefit of this adthe Minister ditional 2s. 2d. per ton for his cane. some of the growers out of the 6s. 6d. per ton. held back only for about a fortnight, in order to enable a readjustment to be made, so that the growers might benefit from the beginning of the season. But upon all cane which has been delivered to the mills from the 25th July last the growers are getting the advantage of the additional 2s. 2d. per ton.

When I entered this Parliament I was called upon almost immediately to take part in an historic division, the quesThat tion at issue being, "" Shall we exclude coloured labour from the Commonwealth by direct legislation, or shall we endeavour to achieve our object by means of an educational test?"" A t that time it was pointed out by our leading constitutional advisers that if we adopted the method of direct exclusion we should offend the susceptibilities of other nations, and that, further, we should require Imperial assent to our legislation. There was an international aspect of the matter which we had to consider. My honourable friends opposite voted for direct exclusion, as did some honourable members on this side of the chamber. Honourable members opposite said that the education test could not be made effective. Hasi t been made effective ? If The suggestion has been made it be defective, why were they content for three years to administer a White Australia policy upon an educational test? Undoubtedly that test has proved a thoroughly effective method of securing the end which we had in view. In Queensland that test has been introduced into several Acts, and has proved effective. In the sugar legislation which was recently enacted in Queensland the Commonwealth method of prescribing this test has been adopted.

On this point I should like to make a quotation from a report -of the half-yearly meeting of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, which was held on the day after I brought this question before the House. port, the chairman, Mr Kater, M . L . C . , saidYou will have noticed in the papers a referlast season's sugar on which duty was not ence in the Federal Parliament to our company, in connection with the repeal of the Excise duty on sugar, and I may as well take advantage of your presence here to tell you the facts. When we obtained a copy of the proclamation issued on this subject, it was evident bond at the beginning of this season could to us that unless some further action was taken all the sugar produced this season before July 25th would be freed from duty, although the bounty was payable on the cane from which it was made, and the revenue would thus have to suffer. It will be noticed that Mr Kater makes no reference to last season's sugar, some of which was' also held in bond. refers only to this season's sugar. Minister should lay upon the table a statement showing the actual quantity of Australian sugar in bond at the time. Some ©f the desired information is obtainable from the public press. Wednesday gives the quantities in bond, whilst the Sydney Daily Telegraph about once a week publishes a statement showing the stocks in bond. When the papers are available it will be found that duty has not been paid on the whole of last season's sugar. bond right up to the day of the issue of the proclamation, yet Mr Kater proposes only to deal with this season's sugar. able member take these figures from the "" dirty, lying rags,"" as he calls the newspapers ?

295,Mr Tudor,"That is the point. NoLabour Government been as neglectful of sugar went into consumption-becaus e their duty as administrators of the public they could rightly say that all the sugar purse take in the legislation. a l l ; the honourable member reminds me of the old gramophone with one record. record \ There is absolutely nothing in the assertion that the legislation was defective. If it was so, and these honourable gentlemen knew it , then it was their bounden duty, as soon as Parliament met, to take steps to remedy the defect. They would have found every member of the House anxious to protect the revenue, because there are no parties in it when it comes to a matter of a fair, honest deal in protecting the revenue and in seeing that the taxpayers get their just dues. We know as to the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, but I am anxious to know what legislation will be introduced to compel the four or five other companies I mentioned the other day to pay Excise on the sugar affected by the proclamation of the Sugar Excise RepealA c t . refining companies ? other day when speaking-the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, the Millaquin Sugar Refining Company, Messrs. Gibson and Howes, Young Brothers, and John Drysdale think they will all pay? one or two of them. I am anxious to see the legislation by which we can compel them to pay. If the Attorney-General had a general retainer for John Drysdale, I can imagine him arguing that the whole -of the sugar had been freed by the proclamation of an Act of Parliament, and asking whether the Government could then come in and enforce payment of Excise on it . I believe the Attorney-General would have the best end of the stick in saying that the Government had deliberately forfeited this amount of revenue, and that there was no power to make the companies pay up once the had gone into consumption. anxious to see that legislation ? the House to-day with the hope that we would get through the SupplyB ill during the sitting, it was the Prime Minister, that we should adjourn as soon as the It is not a good record. B ill goes through, so that it does not matter whether I have a few words to say on it or whether any other honourable member speaks. For instance, the honourable member for North Sydney spent some time denouncing some of the hard-working men of the country as "" beer sparrers, spielers, whisperers, and tick-tackers."" I would like to know what company the honourable member has been keeping to become acquainted with all these nice, expressions. But I am anxious to see this proposed legislation, because I know it will be difficult to prove that the sugar has not gone into consumption, if these persons say it has, at £ 2 or £ 3 less per ton than they would have charged if they had had to pay Excise. They would certainly have a good case in Court. D o you mean other would reduce the price. I mentioned them the day, it does not affect the price of sugar one farthing to the retailer or the wholesaler. If there is one item in the Tariff which is kept right up to the amount of the protection, it is sugar, as has been proved time after time. No other monoTariff. They keep the price at 5s. or I am doubtful about 10s. a ton under that at which sugar can be landed in the Commonwealth. If German, F i j i , or Java sugar is landed at £14 a ton, less the duty, their price will be £ 1 9 10s. or £ 1 9 15s. They boast about it ; they advertise it right through the papers. Finally, dealing with this aspect, I repeat that I would like to see the legislation proposed to be introduced to ascertain how the Government intend to compel these people to pay once the sugar has been freed from paying Excise. I am sorry the member for Gippsland is not in the chamber, but I wish to point out to him the great amount set for th in the schedule for Contingencies.",40,Forrest M Y Right Revenue Was £1 353 000 More Than The

But the honourable member for Gippsland is reported to have saidHe would challenge any one to say he made a different statement at Swan Reach to what he had at Bairnsdale, and quoted figures showing items of expenditure totalling ^4,000,000 for which there was no adequate return. Sitting p.m. have much to add to what I said' before the adjournment on the. subject of the blunder made by the Government in connection with the sugar Excise. If any of the sugar refining companies are paying Excise into the revenue at the present time, it proves' that the Government made a mistake, and forfeited revenue to which they were honestly entitled. It is a most unusual course for the Colonial Sugar Refining Company to propose to make payments to the revenue because the Government were so neglectful of their duty as to permit them to retain Excise which they should have paid. We know that people occasionally send a few shillings or a pound or two to the Customs, Post and Telegraph, and Railway Departments as conscience money, but I think that no one has ever heard so f ar of conscience payments amounting to £100,000 or £200,000. I am anxious to see the legislation by which the Government propose to get this amount back. succeed. I do not complain, bement succeed or not, the result, from our point of view, will be the same. If they succeed, it will be proved that by t h e i r own act they .deliberately forfeited rethe House venue which they had a right to collect, and if they do not succeed it will provethat they are unable to collect money which rightly belongs to the Commonwealth, and which might have been rer covered if the Government had exercisedproper caution. gentleman is encouraging people to resist the Government. £7,980; mands made upon them by the Government.

I have advised the Divisional Returning Officer that, unless he is otherwise instructed, such persons should not be regarded as coming within the prohibited classes. I want to put this matter fairly to my honourable friend opposite. I know that he did not act out of any spleen or malice H o w can a presiding that was rankling in his besom. He was conscientious about what he d i d ; but here is a point I wish to put to him. Does he think that for all these years these huge monopolists should have bad the whole of tlie little pickings that flew by, thereby depriving clerks in the country towns, and fellows travelling round, of the ojDportunity to get a guinea or two at an election? Surely a man who has all his needs ought not .to grab everything! My honourable friends opposite have had I had forgotten that. for too long an opportunity to grab I do not everything. Colonel liy/BiE -Thes e terrible overseers are all great corporations; they are all mouopolies! the nicest gentlemen I have ever met were overseers, and some of the nicest were squatters.

The ex-Prime Minister has' stated that Australians are an honest people, and I was therefore glad to hear the honourable member for Darwin explain that no. reflection was intended to be cast on station managers and overseers by the electoral instructions which he issued, and to which reference has been made during this debate. The use of station homesteads for polling places is unavoidable in many country districts. Were they not so used, many bush workers would be unable to record their votes. The ordinary landowner, large or small, or station manager, does not desire to act as a Returning Officer, or in any other electoral capacity. For more than twenty years the office at the station homestead reside has been used as a polling booth, :md only once has any one connected with i he station acted as a poll clerk; on that occasion the bookkeeper so acted. It has lieen our custom to put Up the Returning Officer and his poll clerk, and to give 1 hem every facility for the carrying out '-f their duties, although we have knowD < hat a great many votes are recorded for I he other side. I protest against the gibes s'nd jeers of Labour members against the squatters. "" Time and chance happeneth to all men."" We are not all born squatters. Some of the station managers in :ny_ district were shearers only a few years :igo, and squatters were selectors. Many of I he squatters in Australia have risen fro m (.he ranks, and, as a class, the landowners are as honourable as any in Australia. It would not be true to say, as the ex-Prime Minister has said, that AusI think that honortralians are an honest people if the Australian station-owners, managers, and overseers were not honest they are so large and influential a body. We have different ideas of If those of us on this side who own land were to attack Labour members as we I am very sorry have been attacked, charging them with living on the game, with being union secretaries, and the like, they would bitterly resent it . We do not make these charges, however, and I do not think that they should be made in an assembly purporting to be the House of the NaE v e r y one tional Parliament of Australia. Pastoralists are essential to the welfare of the country, and are doing good work in outlying districts, where many of the men who live on Labour politics would not go. Having listened to the sugar discussion, I hope that we shall have. no more of it , and, as a new comer, I trust that no more will be said against the land-owners of Australia.

364,Mr Page,"As a matter of fact, I docountry electorates. These are represented by Labour men. I have been talking of the necessity for granting greater telephonic facilities in our outback areas ever since the inception of Federation, and I have no hesitation in saying that country representatives have not had a square deal in this matter. If the Government are sincere in the statements which are contained in their manifesto, the least they can do is to erect those telephone lines upon which the people of Western Queensland are willing to guarantee the Department against loss. There is one matter in particular to which I desire to direct the attention of the PostmasterGenerali n the hope that he,will look into it . It is the necessity for erecting a line midway between Charleville and Augathella, a distance of 27 miles. There is already a main t r u n k line running across the continent through Charleville and connecting the outside districts. When the coastal lines break down it is used to send messages through from Charters Towers to Sydney. The people there have offered to guarantee the Department against loss upon the proposed additional line. A f t e r corresponding for two or three years with the Department, and after having thousands of interviews w i th the Deputy Postmaster-General and with the Secretary to the Postal Department, I was assured that if I could .get the necessary guarantee the line would be built. after all these years of tribulation and trial, the officers had the audacity to tell me that the main trunk line, which carries only one wire, was not in a position to carry another wire for a distance of only 27 miles. I told the Deputy Postmaster General that if the Department had allowed the main trunk line to get into such a state it certainly was not fit to be used for the purpose for which it was being used. another wire were attached to it , it might assist in breaking down the first wire by inducing galahs to rest upon it . parrot, and they go about the country in flocks numbering thousands. But I have been in that country for t h i r t y odd years telephone wire; but because the route and 1 have never known them to break down a telegraph wire. This is a matter that I want the Postmaster-General to look into, because I can get no satisfaction from the officials in the different States. I had another experience which I might as well relate, because it shows that although we are a Federation in name we are not a Federation in reality. Upon the border of New South Wales and Queensland there is a town called Mungindi. It is situated in the electorate of Gwydir. Prior to the consummation of Federation there were two post offices there, one on the Queensland and the other on the New South Wales side of the border. That on the Queensland side has since been done away with , but the office on the New South Wales side of the border still remains, and is to-day a terminal station for the electric wire. The people made a request that telephone communication should be established between there and Thallon, a town 27 miles distant, to which a railway is built along the southern borders of Queensland. The Department in Queensland was quite willing to do its share, but the New South Wales branch would not agree to place an instrument in the office a short distance over the border, merely because the revenue would not be credited to the Department in that State. remedy. the position worse. The authorities in Queensland were prepared, as I have said, to do their part, but I had to wait three I got the guarantee, and then, months even for a reply to my letter to the Department in New South Wales. able member go to the honourable member for Gwydir about the matter? that he brought about the construction of the line. If he had not repeatedly in terviewed the Deputy Postmaster-General in SydneyI should not have got it to this The reply I received was that, if day. This shows that we have a Federation in name, but not in fact. Why should the Department pay any consideration to the imaginary boundaries between State and State? Then, again, there are many stations oh the border of Queensland and New South Wales which desire to be coupled up by means of the runs now in New South Wales and then in Queensland, as the river flows, the Department will not do the work. It is thus missing a good chance to secure revenue. The Postmaster-General's De-",47,Honourable Membebs Anothe R Squat

407,Mr Finlayson,"I can bring upcomplain about the insufficient expenditure on the Federal Capital. ister and the Treasurer never lost an opportunity to say these things. They spoke with one voice in Parliament about Labour finance, and with a different voice when they got before the people. If the Treasurer is correct in saying that there is an unexpended balance of £940,000 in the Treasury, what becomes of their argument in regard to extravagance ? The complaint to-day is that we did not spend enough, whereas outside they told the people that we spent too much. It seems as if it is almost impossible to please these honourable members. There are one or two other matters to which I wish to refer. One is the question of reciprocal trade between Australia and New Zealand and Australia and Canada. That is a subject of the utmost importance to this country. The ex-Minister of Trade and Customs was in negotiation, as we all know, with the Canadian Minister of Customs, who visited Australia in the early part of this year. The negotiations fell through. that was caused by the result of the elections. A t any rate, it seemed as if the ex-Minister of Trade and Customs was unable to negotiate without authority, and a new Minister of Trade and Customs had not yet been chosen. to call attention to a statement which has been made on the subject, and which, in my opinion, is neither overstated nor extravagant. the squatter friends of honourable members opposite, by the way, has declaredThat there is the greatest possible demand ducts, but under present arrangements such trade is going entirely to New Zealand. Australia does not decide to establish reciprocity and a steamer service she will give New Zealand a g if t of ^500,000 worth of trade in foodstuffs alone. Something ought to be done immediately with the New Soutfi Wales and the Commonwealth Governments. The time is propitious. I have already invited fhe attention of the Minister of Trade and Customs to this very important matter, and should like to know what is being done in regard to it? The weeks and the months are going by. land, and New South Wales particularly, as also to some extent in Victoria, who have spent a good deal of money in building up a very satisfactory and growing us did not trade with Canadai n certain lines of Australian produce. We can ill afford to lose that trade. Unfortunately, howT h e PrimeM in ever, through the lack of reciprocal arrangements with Canada and New Zealand, we are practically out of it at present. There are now sufficient motives to encourage the Minister of Trade and Customs to persevere; and I hope that before long he will be able to give us a satisfactory statement informing us that negotiations have been resumed, aud that we are likely to enter into a treaty at an early date. There is another matter to which I wish to invite the attention of the Minister. A few months ago the Dominions Royal Commission visited Australia, and the ex-Prime Minister made an offer of £500 to its chairman to secure the visit of. a representative of the British Cotton-growers' Association in order to advise as to the establishment of the cotton industry here, but up to now nothing further has been heard of the matter. I do not know if the Minister is prepared to give us any information. of the offer before. under our labour conditions? grown in Australia equal in quality to cotton grown in any part of the world. under Australian labour conditions ? that point. There is a belt of country MrA r t h u r Kidman, one of stretching across the greater part of north Australia, including not only Queensland, but the Northern Territory and Western Australia, where there is land of exceptional quality for cotton culin Canada for Australian proture. The cotton which has already been, If grown in northern Australia, and particularly in the district represented by the honorable member for Capricornia, has. been tested and proved to be equal to that grown in any part of the world, and in many cases superior. A sum of £ 5 0 0 was offered to the Chairman of the Dominions Royal Commission to bring an expert here to advise the Government as to the cotton industry. have you for making the statement?

I feel sure that every honourable member must have been dissatisfied and to some extent disgusted, that the cadets should have to train on the streets and vacant pieces of land. In some cases the cadets have actually got into danger, and some lads have died as the result of the injuries they received while drilling on the public roads. me, is entirely unnecessary, because in every town in Australia there are, i u connection with the public schools, reserves belonging to, and kept up by, the public, and I see no reason why these areas should not be available for drillin g he had taken action regarding the repeal purposes. Tlie return I got disclosed a remarkable state of affairs. South Wales, there are twenty-nine grounds now in use, while one has been withdrawn. In Victoria, there are three in use, and one has been withdrawn; in South Australia, there are two in use, and three have been withdrawn; in Western Australia, there are two in use, but none have been withdrawn; in Tasmania, there are none in use, bu t one has been withdrawn; and, in Queensland, there are four in use, and two have been withdrawn. Altogether, there are forty-one school grounds in use throughout Australia, and nine have been withdrawn, making fifty that have been in use. The reasons for the withdrawal of the grounds are given, and all assign misconduct. In some cases statements most uncomplimentary to young Australia are made. Personally, I think tliat the average Austrahad, he would not have made sugar free lian boy behaves himself as well as any boy in any other part of the world, and had sympathetic consideration been shown to the boys, there would have been no need to withdraw any of the school grounds from use. In some instancesI am not speaking without the bookpolitical influence has been at work, grounds being withdrawn because the authorities did not wish to assist the late Government in carrying out its defence policy. If this Government can secure grounds from its friends on the school If the Minister or his recommittees, I hope that it w ill do so. Boys should not be asked to drill in the streets, or be thrown on the kindness of some one who is willing to lend a paddock as a drill ground. I wish now to make all the statements made in connection with it, none was more damaging to the Government than that of the Minister of Trade and Customs this afternoon. It is unfortunate for us that Ministers decline to lay papers and reports upon the table until the censure amendment has been dealt with. Some papers have been laid upon the table, but Ministers w ill not produce those which would help us in discussing the matter that is now before us. I should like an opportunity to read the correspondence which passed between this That, it seems to Government and the Queensland Government regarding the sugar legislation. It has been reported in the press that there was such correspondence, but we are in the dark concerning ib. Last week, the Minister of Trade and Customs said that of the Bounty and Excise Acts just beI n New fore Parliament met, and to-night it slipped out that on the day before the repealing proclamation was issued, inquiry was made as to the quantity of sugar in bond, and it was found to be 32,074 tons, on which £128,296 of Excise was payable. Knowing that that amount of revenue was at stake, the Minister caused a proclamation to be issued making all the sugar in bond free of duty. country against loss. tinue to levy duty after the Excise has been repealed. Every honourable member knows that it w ill be only by the grace of the companies concerned that we shall be able to recover one penny of the Excise at stake. Had the Minister had as much regard for the revenue as he should have until he had got an undertaking from the companies that they would pay the duty on it upon withdrawing it from bond. I am certain that there would not have been any difficulty about that. The companies are not desirous of evading payment of just dues, and I do not blame them for the action they took. It is certain that",56,Honourable Membebs Anothe R Squat
431,Mr Hans Irvine,-He protected the,57,Honourable Membebs Anothe R Squat
432,Mr Finlayson,"Y o u cannot conthey anticipated the action of the Government. Last year, the production of sugar in Australia was only 130,000 tons, and the requirements of the country 226,000 tons, so that 96,000 tons had to be imported to make up the shortage. Why was it that on the 24th July, 32,000 tons of Australian sugar was in stock? Why were the companies selling imported sugar, and keeping Australian sugar in bond? They would not have done that had they not thought that there was a chance of the Excise being repealed. It was not necessary to repeal the Excise and Bounty Acts at the same time. The Queensland Government must have fel t that those Acts would not be repealed, because the measures .passed by the Queensland Parliament are so worded that I am sure the Labour Government, had it remained in power, would not have repealed the Commonwealth sugar legislation. One of the terms of the agreement with the Queensland Government was that the employment of coloured labour in Queensland should be prohibited. It is a mere quibble for the Minister to say that, had such a prohibition been enacted, the B i ll containing it would not have received the Royal assent. member's time has expired. DoI understand that the honourable member desires to avail himself of the additional time which is allowed him under the Standing Orders? mere quibble for the Minister of Trade aud Customs to argue that if the employment of black labour had been directly excluded by the Act it would not have received the. Royal assent, and that, therefore, a dictation test was imposed. Queensland statute-book Acts which specifically exclude Asiatics aud coloured aliens from employment in certain undertakings, and those Acts received the Royal assent. How many years ago? they were passed years ago is an additional reason for believing that the Royal assent would not have been withheld from the Sugar Cultivation Act , because the present K in g has been much more liberal in expressing his views upon these matters than have previous rulers. assent has been given to democratic measures which have almost surprised the people, because a few years ago it would have been impossible to have obtained that assent. What about our Navigation Bill? New Zealand could not get the Royal assent to the provisions of its Navigation B ill , and yet that assent has been given to our Navigation B ill , which contains even more drastic provisions. I would further point out that the dictation test will f a i l in its purpose unless we can depend upon the administration. That is where it will f a i l , because the administration of that test is now in the hands of those who all their political lives have been associated with what is known as the black-labour party. It is an easy matter to put a dictation test to any coloured alien that he can pass. If , for example, a Japanese presented himself, the officer administering the Act could easily impose a dictation test in Japanese. A dictation test is practically useless from the stand-point of safeguarding the sugar industry from the employment of coloured labour. ber give any instance of that? able member is doubtless thinking of what The honourable was said this afternoon to the effect that under our Immigration Restriction Act a dictation test is applied. B ut as that dictation test is applied by men who have no particular interest in any other part of the world, it is naturally applied in a It is a much more reasonable and expeditious manner. In this particular instance we set out to accomplish one thing. The payment of the sugar bounty and the imposition of the Excise duty were intended to accomplish only one object-to do away with the employment of coloured labour As a matter of fact, and to establish the sugar industry on a already has upon her white-labour basis. We wish to insure the continuance of that policy, and the Sugar Cultivation Act passed by the Queensland Parliament does not give us the guarantee that we had a right to expect. No wonder that the Queensland Government made section 1 of that Act This Act may be cited as "" The Sugar Cultivation Act of 1913,"" and shall commence and take effect on and after the date of the commencement of the Act of the Parliament of the Commonwealth intituled the Sugar Bounty Abolition Act IQI2.

450,,"But we kept in Mr HANS IRVIN E (Grampians)to which reference has been made by the honourable member for Kennedy and the honourable member for Brisbane, I have heard the ex-Prime Minister and members of the Opposition speak of the deficit which they found on taking office, and which they claim to have converted into a surplus. During the election campaign there were many references to the unex]3ended earnings received from the taxpayers which were placed to the credit of the Commonwealth. Members of the Labour party said that when they came into power they were faced with a deficit of £451,000, and the present Leader of the Opposition declared that he converted that deficit into a surplus of from £2,000,000 to £2,500,000. That, he said, would be the surplus shown at' the end of the financial year which closed on 30th June last. I have verified his figures, and know that they are correct. point that I .wish to make is that the right honourable gentleman never told the people of his great inheritance as the result of the expiration of the Braddon section in 1910. know that under the Braddon section of the Constitution it was provided that 15s. out p i every £ 1 collected from Customs and Excise should be returned to the six States which created the Federation. But neither the present Leader of the Opposition, nor any of his supporters, to my knowledge, referred to that fact, or to the expiration of that section. Of the small deficit of £451,000, a sum of £450,000 exactly was provided by the Deakin-Cook Government for old age pensions. The Deakin-Cook Government knew, when they were going before the electors in 1910, that although that deficit existed the Commonwealth, as the result of the expiration of the operation of the Braddon section, would in future receive from Customs and Excise a much larger revenue than had ever been obtained before. While the Fisher Government were in office-and I say, clearly and distinctly, that it was a period of misrulethe Commonwealth received from Customs and Excise over £16,000,000 more 4 than had been received during the administration of any previous Ministry. The Fisher Government also collected about £4,500,000 from the land tax which they introduced, making in all an additional revenue of about £20,500,000. And yet they talk about the small deficit of £451,000! the Commonwealth, and knew that within three years the Commonwealth would receive an additional £20,500,000, I should not worry much about leaving a small deficit of £450,000, more especially when the deficit, as in this case, was in curred in providing for national works, and in carrying out other national purposes. The Deakin-Cook Government knew, when they went to the electors in 1910, that the Braddon section was about to expire, and that a larger revenue would consequently be available to the Commonwealth. Honourable members opposite, who, in reality, are only delegates-delegate s of an irresponsible body outside Parliament-shoul d have been truth f u l in their statements^ They should have made reference to the expira-tion of the Braddon section; but in no newspaper published in Australia did I But the ever see any evidence that they had done so. What they did claim was that they were Heaven-born financiers, who had brought the country out of a state verging on r u in , and had converted a deficit The people of Australia into a substantial surplus. they did? .. Fisher Government during their three years of office practically ruined the country. The honourable member for Wide Bay, when Treasurer of the Commonwealth, in 1912, brought down a statement showing that he estimated to receive £20,422,000 iu that, the year of our greatest prosperity, and that the expenditure would be £22,681,541. In other words, in the year of our greatest prosperity he proposed to expend £2,261,541 more than he would receive. And yet the Labour party call themselves heaven-born financiers. To the individual their policy means increased taxation and a decrease in the purchasing power of the sovereign. The Labour Government undertook to perform great things, but we now find employment scarce and money dear. And what made money dear? The policy of the Fisher Government and their sup 1 porters. Money is dear all over the world; but in Australia, up to June, 1910, there was probably the cheapest money in the wide world, considering the size of the country.

I have said on the platform, and I repeat here, that in reality the Labour party and Government committed Australia, during their three years of No ; I support power, to a capital expenditure of over £100,000,000, which the taxpayers of Australia wil l have to provide.

475,Why Is Mr Lairdsmith,"I am told thatcoach when the Fisher Government took office, but no sooner were they in command than we found heaps of work put upon the various branches of that great Department, and it is surprising to me that they did as well as they have done. The administration of the Post and Telegraph Department has been criticised tonight, but I can say that in the district of tlie honourable member for Franklin more telephone work was carried out in three years by the Fisher Government than was carried out in nine years by previous Governments. Metallic circuits have been put in , transposed every quarter of a mile, giving practically a silent line from Franklin to Hobart, and through to Launceston. I have spoken from Port Cygnet to Launceston, and could hear the person with whom I conversed as distinctly as I can hear honourable members in this chamber. was I able to do so? It was because a metallic circuit has throughout the length and breadth of the island, which enables people now to converse on a practically silent line. The honourable member for Franklin seems to possess some fortunate way of dealing with the Postmaster-General, no matter on what side of the House he sits. He will admit that more telephone work has been done in his district than in any other electorate in Australia. done there. honourable member does, but he has had a fair share of work done in his district. The source of trouble in the Department seems to be that they have adopted a fixed specification for the whole of Australia. It does not matter whether a pole is to carry one or a dozen wires, the Department insists on one being erected much larger than the strain put upon it warrants, and that the ground shall be cleared for 20 feet around the bottom of all poles. practical experience that it is sufficient to clear 6 feet around a pole to prevent it catching fire, so long as the brush is cleared right away for that distance and is not left to dry in a circle round the pole. We find now that men are engaged in clearing 20 feet around each pole, and there are from twenty-five to twenty-eight poles to each mile. Work of this nature adds considerably to the cost of line [19] construction. I supervised the construction of one line, which was surveyed by my father and myself. 1 refer to the line from Circular Head to the Montagu. It was constructed over twenty years ago, through some rough country as well as plain country, and was carried out at a cost of £ 1 2 6s. per mile. I am informed that, at the present time, a similar line would cost from £2ti to £ 3 0 per mile. cheaper twenty years ago. very much cheaper, but the increased cost arises from the fixed specification for all lines. The engineer is adopting the ideas of engineers in the Old Country and in Canada, where, as honourable members are aware, snow settles on the insulators and wires and brings down the Why lines. Here we have no snow heavy enough to damage any of the lines. I been provided am of opinion that the Postmaster-General might safely adopt a more economical system of construction, and still secure very effective lines. The line I speak of running to the Montagu, was up for seventeen years before it was necessary for any of the poles to be replaced. It carried only one light line, and the strain was not very great. We require cheap telephone construction to open up the country, and should adopt cheap lines similar to that to which I have referred. I want a lot more I wish to appeal to the Postmaster-General to carry out the construction of the No doubt the line which I asked him to undertake soon after he came into office. I presented a petition to him from residents in a district called Ridgeway, in my electorate. If the work is carried out I feel certain that it will be immediately reproductive and a boon to the people. W it h reference to the payment of the hands engaged upon construction work, it is remarkable that casual labourers should be paid 8s. a day in Hobart whilst they are paid 9s. a day in Brisbane. The climate in TasI know from mania at this time of the year is very severe, and a man engaged on trenching in the stony ground of Hobart is entitled to the f u l l amount paid in any part of Australia. Again, I appeal to the Postmaster-General to provide the men engaged on outdoor work with overcoats. Interruptions of the service always take place in stormy weather, and the men have to leave immediately to carry ouf repairs. The Department is, apparently",64,Honourable Membebs Anothe R Squat

I feel sure that as soon as the Postmaster-General brought under his notice he will insist on coats being provided, because a generous man such as he is would not for a moment countenance the present state of things. I wish also to refer to the mail service between the mainland and Tasmania. Had the Fisher Government remained in office they intended to give us an up-to-date line of steamers running between the mainland and Tasmanian ports. Those steamers were to be owned by the Commonwealth. sent Government came into power practically nothing has been done. ments are published in the newspapers every few weeks to the effect that the Government intend to do something, but we never learn what they intend to do. When the right honourable member for Swan was on this side of the House he complained about the Treasurer not being prepared to spend money usefully. What is he going to do now he is in charge of the Treasury? Isi t his intention to give the company that has a monopoly in carrying mails between the mainland and 'Tasmania an extension of their contract with an increased subsidy? A t present, I believe, the company is receiving £13,000 per annum for carrying the mails. I believe it is intended to pay them an additional £2,000, making £15,000 in all. That sum would pay the interest on three new vessels equal to the Loongana. We should then have an up-to-date service, run for the convenience of the public. I am of opinion that we should have much cheaper fares than at present rule. A p parently nothing is to be done to improve the service betwen Hobart and Sydney. I understand that a large sum of money is paid, but the boats are not what they The present should be. A person wishing to travel from Sydney to Hobart has to book weeks in advance. In addition to that, I am in JOHN FORREST -Was it the late formed, passengers are sometimes made to pay cabin rates for steerage accommodation. That is most unfair. The shipping companies should be induced to put on an up-to-date service. I venture to say the day is not far distant when Hobart w ill become one of the principal shipping ports of the Commonwealth. A t the present time a wharf is being conmember structed which will be able to accommodate the great ocean liners. It is being built by day labour, and w ill be a credit I do, undoubtto the Marine Board of Hobart and to everybody connected with it . The Tashas this matter manian authorities are rising to the occasion in making provision for an increased traffic; but the shipping companies, with the monopoly that they enjoy, are doing nothing to bring about an improved state of affairs. I hope that the Government will do something in this matter. I can assure them that nine-tenths of the people in my electorate desire a Commonwealth line of steamers. Practically everybody is in favour of such a scheme. W h y not drop this party fighting altogether, and Since the presay at once, "" We will give Tasmania a Commonwealth line of steamers"" ? If Statethe Government did that they would make a name for themselves. I also think that it is most unfair that the sergeant-majors, a body of able men who are training our youths, should be called on to provide their own uniforms. Indeed, it would be unfair that they should be called upon to buy their own caps. The Commonwealth has a clothing factory of its own, and surely the Minister of Defence could make arrangements for these men to buy their clothes from the factory, even if they paid for them out of their own pocket. They w ill get them cheaper then thau they do now. Another matter which has come under my notice is that the best Area Officers-sergeant-majors-ar e being continually drafted into the office.

I find, to put it shortly, that there are several stages in the development of his mind on this question. First, his attitude is that of the secretary of a coal-miners union in Lithgow. This is what he stated, on the 9th December, 1904, had been his attitude as a union secretary. On page 7846 of Hansard, he saidThe honourable member for Newcastle referred to me as an old-time secretary of a trade union. The honourable member is quite right.

The honourable member is now the spokesman of these capitalists. For whom did the capitalists of Australia vote at the last election if not for him and those with whom he is associated ? And now, referring to the reply to employers. Answering objections to preference to unionists by employers' associations, the honourable member saidBut now let us see for a moment what this objection really is, and whether it is so formidable as it might appear in some quarters. I take up a criticism of the B ill by the'Builders' that occasionand Contractors' Association, and here the objection was put in a sentence :"" We also question the justice of imposing disabilities upon nine-tenths of the industrial community at the instance of the trade unions' ' tent' in order that the majority of the employees may be coerced into joining trade unions or becoming industrial Ishmaelites."" That is the self-same clap-trap that we had to-night from the honourable member for Grampians. The honourable member is effectively answered by this speech of his Prime Minister, which I would recommend him to read. The honourable gentleman showed that the employers desired freedom of contract which he controverted in unqualified terms. Dealing with the subject of free labour, he saysIt is recognised in unionist circles that unionshibboleths, either of liberty or protection, or ists should not work with free labourers. I. know a great many people who will not agree with that. to-day is this : a free labourer is regarded by the unionists as a menace to his wages, as a menace to his price. It is in order to secure his price that he has to sacrifice the free labourer. That is the reason why unionists very much object to work with free labourers, because the free labourer is only used, as a rule, by the employer in order to coerce the unionist to accept conditions which the unionist dislikes. That being so, under this B ill , the motive of the employer to employ free labour will be taken right away. The free labourer is never called into requisition at all, except in times of industrial trouble. Man for man, it is a recognised rule that the trade unionist is at least the equal of the free labourer in ability at his work. Therefore, it is not on account of superior workmanship that the free 'labourer is employed, but in order that he may be a menace to the unionist, who is employed for the time being, or in order to defeat him if he is out on strike. As this Bill is going to stop strikes, there will be no further motive on the part of the employer to take the free labourer under his protecting care. like to say, as the result of long experience in these matters, that if honourable gentlemen will think for a moment what is the object of the free labourer, and the effect of the free labourer upon the condition of the unionist, they will see a very good ground for dislike on the part of the unionist to the free labourer. I venture to say that the case for the unionist as against the free labourer was never put stronger than it was then put by the present Prime Minister. In referring to freedom of contract, he next combated the argument in its favour. The employers desire freedom to choose the non-unionist in preference to the unionist because the unionist increases wages, and is therefore a menace to the employers' profits. This is what the honourable gentleman said on We hear it in these words : that this B i ll is an interference with liberty-a n interference with the principle of freedom of contract. I often think that those gentlemen who make this objection must be very ignorant of our industrial historv. Thev must be very ignorant of the operation of this principle of the freedom of contract when they claim for it so many virtues and so many advantages. The industrial historv of this and every other country shows that, masqueradingunder this principle of freedom of contract has been some of the most ghastly and horrible slavery that this or any other country has ever known. Go to the beginning of this century, and read there a picture of the operation of this principle of freedom of contract. T. have here a volume entitled Industry in England, by MrH . de B. Gibbins. Anv one who will take the trouble to read this book will , I think, for ever after be very careful as to how he uses that phrase "" freedom of contract."" We are not here, I take it, to mouth anvthing else. We are here ""to investigate facts, and to see the bearing of them, and they are The reason why that takes place facts in the industrial life of this country. Then he goes on to picture how the employers have treated litle girls in the factories of England under this system of freedom of contract by working them seven, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, and eighteen hours a day. Here is an extract which he cited from the speech of a member of the House of Commons on this pointOur ancestors could not have supposed it possible-posterit v will not believe it true-that a generation of Englishmen could exist, or had existed, that would work lisping infancy of a few summers old, regardless alike of its smiles or tears, and unmoved by its unresisting weakness, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, sixteen hours a day, and through the wearv night also, t ill , in the dewy morn of existence, the bud of youth was faded, and fell ere it was unfolded. . . . . . Then, in order to keep them awake, to stimulate their exertions, means are made. I should use of to which I shall now advert, as a last instance of the degradation to which this system has reduced the manufacturing operatives of this country. Children are beaten with thongs, prepared for the purpose. Yes; the female of this country, no matter whether children or grown up-and I hardly know which is the more disgusting outrage-tir e beaten, beaten in your free market of labour, as you term it, like slaves. The poor wretch is flogged before its companions -flogged . T say, like a dog, by the tyrant overlooker. We speak with execration of the cartwhip of the West Tndies; but let us see this night -.in equal feeling rise against the factory thong in England. These are quotations from the utterances of the Prime Minister, who is now the mouthpiece of the employers of Australia, and these are the words in which he stated his case in favour of preference to unionists. Then he quoted Richard Oastler. He saidT am quoting this as a perfect picture of freedom of contract-the shibboleth which is being mouthed to-dav by all employers Apparently he has not forgotten the use of the same picturesque language that he used formerly, but it is not now used in defence of the rights of the working men, but in justification of the assaults made upon them by the Employers Federation. He continuedand I cannot but believe that those who mouth it so f ullv must be very ignorant of what it meant in its f u l l operation at the beginningof this century. Take a little female captive, six or seven years old; she shall rise from her bed at 4 o'clock in the morning of a cold' winter dav, but before she rises she wakes, perhaps. half-a-dozen times, and says, ""Father, is it time?

Homeward a""ain at night she would go. when she was able, but manv a time she hid herself in the wool in the mill, as she had not strength to go.

The «irl T am s-'eakinr of diVd: but ' she dragged on that dreadful existence for several years. This is the beautiful picture of freedom 'of contract that the honourable member for Parramatta put before the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales just before he entered this Parliament. A l though he had been a Minister in a Liberal Government, he still held fast to his faith in the doctrine of preference to unionistsa faith from which he is now drifting. Mr J. Ti. Calls. Much has been said about interference .with the liberty of the subject. The honourable gentleman then went on to quote John Stuart Mill upon the question of interference with the liberty of the subject. He saidWe cannot do better than refer to an authority which is more frequently quoted by the opponents of this measure than perhaps any other -a n authoritv whom they nearly always regard as being on their side. I refer to John Stuart Mill. I am going to quote a few sentences from his essay on liberty. Whatever other people may say of John StuartM ill , I disagree with him in many of his statements; but I recognise in him one of the clearest and most profound thinkers on these questions that our race has ever produced. This is what John Stuart Mill says : "" The object of this essay is to assert one very simple principle, as entitled to govern absolutely the dealings of society with the individual in the way of compulsion and control, whether the means used be physical force, in the form of legal penalties, or the moral coercion of public opinion. That principle is that the sole end for which mankind are warranted, individually or collectively, in interfering with the libertv of action of any of their number is self-protection. That the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized I will tell you what I have seen. community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. "" That,"" said the honourable gentleman, "" correctly describes the principle operating under this B ill . "" The principle of preference to unionists, where a unionist must be preferred to a non-unionist, is, according to the honourable member, based on the ground of preventing harm to others. He indicated that the purpose for which it should be rightfully exercised was to prevent harm to others, and that the warrant for interfering with liberty of action is to secure self-protection. There, again, we have the whole case in a nutshell-that there must be granted a preference to unionists in order to prevent that victimization of unionists which the honourable gentleman knows, from his long experience, takes place in industry. When an employer proceeds to engage labour, and has the chance of choosing a unionist or a non-unionist, does he care whether the preference goes in one way or the other ? stances that the preference goes to the unionist. Mr J. H . CATTS -In very few instances indeed. I have heard employers say that they do not care whether a man is a unionist or a non-unionist. We know, however, that the majority do care. The",68,Forrest Pro

MrJ . H . CATTS -The PrimeM in ister cannot say that at this time the unionists were not engaged in taking action for political purposes. time of the maritime strike, the unionists of Australia were advised to take political action. Mr J. H . CATTS -B y employers as well as by the press of Australia. It was said to them, "" W h y do you not take constitutional measures?"" but now that they are doing so, an effort is being made to smash them up. they must not take any action of a political character, although politics in Australia are the bread and butter of the whole of the working population. MrJ . H . CATTS -The amelioration of their condition, which has been gained in recent years in the Parliaments of the country, has been the result of advocacy of political remedies. The honourable member for Hume need not talk about agitators. He has travelled over New South Wales"" b a r r a c k in g "" and agitating for the farmers.

We commit these material interests to the hands of men to whom we are content to commit the issues of life and death. The honourable gentleman also saidNow you can say anything you like about what is possible under this B ill ; but when you D i d not the Workers' refer a matter to the decision of a Judge, whatever you may think of the opinion he may hold, it is assumed that he is competent to give a decision. But every one of these cases cited presupposes that the Judge is going to be a fool, and not an ordinarily intelligent man. Is not the very reason of inquiry to enable the A t the Judge to find out what is the measure of justice in the claim of either side? Yet the honourable gentleman is not prepared now to commit this matter to the Judge unconditionally. He insists that before it goes to the Judgei t shall be surrounded by political conditions which are dictated by the Employers Federation of Australia. I desire to now refer to the beneficial It is said now that character of unions. In the House a few days ago a question was raised as to. what the unions had done in the amelioration of the conditions of the great masses of the people.

Prime Minister starts out by making a statement, and then he uniformly sets out again to deny it , and one never knows when he has the Prime Minister. in the Court the other day. Mr J. H . CATTS The honourable gentleman would be pleased to tur n off this unsavoury subject. No doubt he does not like these convictions of his to be put forward. the statements he now makes in connection with his associates are not his convictions; he does not believe in them; it is absolutely impossible for a man in the maturity of his opinions to make such a speech without believing what he is saying. So we have the honourable gentleman slipping from point to point until he has boxed the compass. his train, and I am pleased to defer to his wish. on another occasion.

The Leader of the Opposition is not present, but a fortnight ago I asked him whether there was any possibility of making an arrangement with regard to taking the vote on the no-confidence motion. MrJ . H . CATTS -Why should there be an arrangement? reason that I think the country is now expecting a vote to be taken early, and I think the country has a right to expect a vote to be taken early.

I hope to be able to get to a vote on this question on Thursday night. It is very interesting to hear the Prime They are his convictions, and Minister get up with this exceptional display of dignity, and request that a vote be taken at a certain time. The Prime Minister is generally credited with the responsibility for conducting the business of the House, aud he can take a vote any time he chooses. It is in his hands. way it is done. takes up an attitude at twenty minutes to 12 on Tuesday night, and says, "" We expect that the division will take place at a certain time."" thing of the kind.

Hear the delicate-tongued, cultured Prime Minister1 The honourable gentleman is in charge of the business of the House, and can take a division at any time he chooses. I would remind the Prime Minister, and the press supporting him, that for every member from this side who has spoken there has been a member speaking on the Government side, and it has not been a waste-of-time debate.

The worse thing that can happen now is that the House may be counted out, and I can assure the honourable member we do not intend to count out the House. We are not looking for any divisions to-night. It is insinuated that we are desirous of delaying the business of the House. Aa a matter of fact, the Prime Minister is particularly desirous that every new member on his side of the House should have the opportunity of expressing an opinion, and, in fact, the Government side so far have had a majority of members speaking. I think the honourable gentleman should recognise that, and should keep it in mind when indulging in heroics about his desire to get on with the business of the country.
