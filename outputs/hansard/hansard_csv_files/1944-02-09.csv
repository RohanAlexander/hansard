His is a name which, as this House knows, is greatly honoured in Australia, as in more recent years we have had special occasion to remember. Sir George Fairbairn was a man, I always thought, of great simplicity of character and great generosity of mind, and devoted himself for many years to work in this country which was in the truest sense constructive.

Again elected to the Senate at the general election in 1928, he retired in June, 1935, following his defeat at the general election in 1934.

11,Mr Curtin (Fremantle,"Prime M i nthe Opposition) -In a sense, very few words are needed from me to support this motion, because Tom Brennan, as we ali thought of him, was extremely well known in both Houses of this Parliament to both senators and honourable members. He was very well known in the State of Victoria. He was very well known to his fellow members of the Victorian Bar, of whom I am one. He was at an earlier stage, very well known in the world of journalism. I venture to say that in each department of life in which he moved he earned, not only the respect of men, but also their permanent affection. He was a man who in reality possessed the most extraordinarily lovable qualities. I do not think that I ever heard him say a harsh word about anybody. He was certainly a man whose heart was entirely free of bitterness. Yet, representing Mount Leonora in the Legisall through his life, and long before he came into Parliament, he was a man of strong political views, and he worked unceasingly to promote the acceptance of those views by the people. In the courts of Victoria, particularly the criminal courts, he practised with very great success as an advocate, an advocate who combined learning with remarkable dignity and conspicuous honesty. He1 brought those qualities with him into the wider sphere of public life. I think that there is no man who ever encountered him in Parliament, whether he agreed or disagreed with him, who would not have said, "" ""Well, there goes a great gentleman 1917; member of the Joint Committee on who will always live up to the highesttraditions of whatever it is that he is pursuing"". That can be said with sincerity and said universally about Tom Brennan. He bore a name very well known in the politics and public life of Australia. I can pay him no greater compliment than to say that he added to the reputation of that name and that his was not the least contribution to its permanent remembrance in Australian affairs. of the Australian Country party) -On behalf of the Australian Country party, I express regret at the passing of the Honourable Thomas Brennan and record our sympathy with those left to mourn his loss, particularly the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan). Question resolved in the affirmative, honourable members standing in their places. Minister) -It is my sad duty to record the death of yet another former senator, the Honourable Patrick Joseph Lynch, who passed away at Perth, on the loth January, 1944. The former senator was a well known figure in the political life of this country, particularly in Western Australia which State he represented continuously in the Federal Parliament for a period of 32 years. He served first in the State Parliament, lative Assembly from June, 1904, until November, 1906, when he resigned. From June to August, 1905, he was State Minister for Public Works. Elected to the Senate at the general elections in 1906 he was re-elected at the successive general elections up to and including 1931. He was a member of the Royal Commission on the Fruit Industry, 1912-14; Vice-Chairman of the Joint Committee on Public Works, 1914-16; first Chairman of the River Murray Waters Commission, 1916; Minister for Works and Railways from the 14th November, 1916, to the 17th February, Public Works from July, 1923. to June, 1926; member of the Select Committee on the Standing Committee System, 1929-30; and President of the Senate from the 31st August, 1932, to the 30th June, 1938. He was defeated at the general election in 1937, retaining his seat under the Constitution, until the 30th June, 193S. The deceased gentleman, himself a picturesque figure, had a varied and romantic career both on land and sea prior to entering politics, and engaging in the steady and less eventful work of farming. His early roving doubtless served to equip him with a knowledge of, and sympathy with, his fellows which was later exemplified in his public life.

He was a firm friend, a man to whom one could turn with confidence for advice and aid. He gave to his country the best that was in him.

At these meetings, plans were made for operations during this critical year against Germany and Japan. These meetings were preceded by the conference between the Foreign Ministers of the United Kingdom, the United States of America, and Russia at Moscow in October, 1943, at which complete agreement was reached on co-operation in the prosecution of the war, and for the continuance of international collaboration in the post-war period. The Four-Power declaration on security-Chin a being also a party-and the establishment of a European advisory commission were events of the deepest significance. They are a manifestation of the realistic attitude of the great powers towards their responsibilities in the post-war period for the establishment and maintenance of peace and security. At Cairo, President Roosevelt, Marshal Chiang Kai-shek and Mr Churchill agreed upon future military strategy against Japan. Plans were concerted to bring unrelenting and ever-rising pressure against the common enemy, and the communique issued after the conference stated that "" the three allies will continue but have the most important results in to persevere in the serious and prolonged operations which are necessary to procure the unconditional surrender of Japan "". The political result of the conference was a declaration of the Allied purpose to deprive Japan of islands and territories which she had acquired by aggression. At the conference at Teheran, complete understanding was reached between President Roosevelt, Marshal Stalin, and Mr Churchill, on measures for the prosecution of the war against. Germany and for co-operation in the peace that will follow. The scope and timing of operations which are to be undertaken in Europe from the east, west and south wero agreed upon, and plans were coordinated and preparations made for the final defeat of Germany. These epoch-making conferences demonstrated the complete unity of purpose and close understanding of the United Nations, and the reaffirmation of their inflexible determination to wage the war until the final defeat of the Axis powers has destroyed whatever hopes the enemy had of securing a compromise peace. The pattern of victory can be discerned, but a stern and difficult task lies ahead, and there are many trials and sacrifices to be undergone before our work is accomplished. Mr Churchill has given an assurance that, on the defeat of Germany, every man, every ship and every aircraft that, could be moved into the Pacific would be sent and there maintained for as many years as were needed to make the Japanese submit. The despatch of a British services mission under the leadership of Major General Lethbridge to the South Pacific, South-West Pacific, and Indian theatres last year is indicative of the preparatory measures being undertaken by the United Kingdom Government for f u l l and effective co-operation against the Japanese. The mission investigated teohnical aspects of the arrangements for co-operation by British forces with the United States of America in the war in the Pacific, when the combined forces of the United Nations can be brought fully to bear against Japan. The mission paid a glowing tribute to the work of the Australian and American fighting men under difficult jungle conditions. Its visit cannot enabling the organization of participation by British forces with the minimum of delay when the time comes. A further development was the announcement in November, 1943, of the appointment of Lieutenant-General Lumsden as Mr Churchills' representative with the Commander-in-Chief of the South-West Pacific Area. The Government regards Australian co-operation with New Zealand as a vital necessity in the development of a regional understanding in the Pacific, and recently concluded a successful conference with New Zealand at which common principles were agreed upon for collaboration and co-operation now and",17,Minister For Supply An D Shipping Illness Of Mr Beasley Tempobab Y

The agreement which resulted from that conference is an important and historic document, and provides the basis for the development of a more extensive regional understanding with all our neighbours in the Pacific. During these sittings, the Minister for External Affairs (Dr. Evatt) will table the agreement. The last six months have marked a moderate cost, is a tribute to the soundsignificant turning point in the war in ness and thoroughness of the plans of the South-West Pacific.

Total Allied naval and air forces have played a notable part in these operations, and so effective has been their control of sea and air lanes that the Japanese are experiencing great difficulty in supplying their troops in the Huon Peninsula and in western New Britain.

Japanese shipping losses during January were 4 auxiliary warships, 24 merchant ships and 172 harges and small craft sunk, 9 merchant ships and 8 barges probably sunk, and 17 warships, 39 merchant ships, and 90 barges and small craft damaged. Battle casualties suffered by the Australian Military Forces since the beginning of the campaign in New Guinea and Papua to the end of January, 1944, were 10,470, of whom 3,290 were killed. The total casualties for the three services since the outbreak of war in 1939 to the end of 1943 were 66,930, of whom 16,480 were killed. Australian battle casualties in the war against Japan since the outbreak of hostilities on the 8th December, 1941, to the end of 1943 were 36,600, of whom 4,500 were killed, 7,500 wounded, 19,900 prisoners of war, and 4,700 missing. The intensive efforts which have been made by the services medical authorities to combat malaria have resulted in a substantial reduction of the incidence of the disease in New Guinea. Anti-malarial measures, including the extensive use of mosquito repellants, the imposition of a strict anti-malarial personnel discipline, and the maintenance of full supplies of anti-malarial drugs, are factors which have led to the success achieved in the control of the disease. However, the diffibeing carried out on a large scale by land, culties inherent in active operations under jungle conditions necessarily involve a considerable risk of infection by troops in the forward areas, but it is noteworthy that in the recent campaigns, the ratio of malarial casualties in the combat zones has been considerably lower than it was during the Papuan campaign. The civilized world has been horrified by the revelations, recently published, reof the United Nations' strategy of maingarding Japanese treatment of prisoners of war and civilians. As was announced by the Minister for External Affairs, a special commission of inquiry was set up some months ago to investigate Japanese war crimes against Australians in the South-West Pacific Area. Where atrocities are established, full details, together the Japanese perimeter of defence, exwith the names of those guilty of perpetrating them, will be submitted to the United Nations War Crimes Commission for record and subsequent punishment. Mr Curtin. So far as our own nationals are concerned, every effort is being made to obtain information regarding the conditions under which they are detained. Reports indicate that in some cases conditions are improving but that there is still much to be desired, and, in many cases, no information at all can be obtained. The failure of the Japanese Government to observe its international obligations calls for the most severe condemnation. The release of our kinsmen has always been a potent factor in the mind of the Government. Nothing less than the complete and final defeat of Japan will bring about the release of these captives. The constant aim of the Government has been to reduce the period of their ordeal, and it is hoped that the increasing weight of military assaults will bring to the Japanese military leaders a realization of their accountability and an amelioration of the lot of prisoners of waT. The United States landing in the Marshall Islands is a major development in the Pacific war, which is likely to have far-reaching consequences for the Japanese. The occupation of the Gilbert Islands in November, 1943, provided a springboard for this attack, which is the first offensive in the Pacific against Japanese territory. The operations are sea and air forces. As was announced in a recent communique, upwards of 30,000 marines and troops and more than 2,000,000 tons of naval vessels have been deployed. Casualties have been very moderate. All reports indicate that the attack is proceeding satisfactorily. The attack on the Marshall Islands marks an important stage in the implementation taining unremitting pressure against Japan concurrently with an "" a l l out"" effort against Germany. Already, Japanese attempts at consolidation in the Solomon Islands and New Guinea have been frustrated. The attack on the Marshall Islands is a new drive against tending from Burma through the Netherlands East Indies, New Guinea, Rabaul and the mandated islands, and is a foretaste of what lies ahead. Bases in the Marshall Islands will .bring the important Japanese naval base at Truk within range of United States heavy bombers. For some time now, a considerable proportion of -the Japanese fleet has been in hiding at Truk. The recent operations in New Guinea, New Britain and the Solomons did not draw the enemy out, but the nearer the United Nations approach to Japanese vital areas, the more eertain it is that the enemy must come out and fight for them. It remains to be seen whether he will be prepared to hazard a major naval engagement for the Marshall Islands. In the words of Rear-Admiral Turner, who is in command of the amphibious operations, "" The invasion of the Marshall Islands could be the main event of the Pacific war. Anything can happen now. We hope it does. We have never been readier."" For six and a j i a lf years, the Chinese people have maintained their stubborn resistance to the Japanese. Despite enormous difficulties, 'China continues to engage the attention of a substantial part of the Japanese Army. Aircraft operating from Chinese bases are inflicting increasing damage on enemy installations and shipping, but transport is the limiting factor. China's supply problems, although eased to some degree by the development of air transport from India, remain acute. In Burma, now a part of the South-East Asia command under Lord Louis 'Mountbatten, the Allied forces are exerting increasing pressure on the Japanese, both on land and in the air. The difficulties of the terrain are great, however, and we cannot look for any early spectacular results in this area. Although, as General Montgomery has pointed out, the Eighth Army advanced 700 miles in the three months from the 3rd September to the 3rd December, 1943, recent progress in Italy has been slow. Weather conditions have been most unfavorable. Another problem is supply. Methodical destruction by the Germans of port facilities, bridges and railways has placed a great strain on engineering and supply personnel. The landing of Allied forces on the west coast of Italy, south of Rome, is a fresh development of importance. It is, of course, Germany's aim to delay the Allied advance and tie down in the Mediterranean as much of the Allied strength as possible. The Allied aim is to extend its bomber line from the south as near to Germany as possible. When the time for the assault in the west comes, Germany will feel the concerted pressure of operations in the south and east also. During the last summer in Europe, the Red Army demonstrated its ability to drive the Axis forces back under summer as well as winter conditions. During the present winter, the Russian forces have not only maintained their great offensive south of the Pripet Marshes, but have also launched a new offensive in the Leningrad area. This attack, which was launched exactly one year after the lifting of the blockade of Leningrad, has broken through the strongest fixed defences established by the enemy on the Russian front, and Russian troops are now advancing into Estonia. In the salient below the middle Dnieper, Russian forces have achieved another notable success in the encirclement of ten German divisions, whose position is serious. The magnitude of the Russian achievements is illustrated by the fact that more' than 200 German divisions are fighting on the Russian front, and that for over two and a half years Russia has had to deal with by far the greatest part of the Axis forces in Europe. The weight of Allied air attacks from the west continues to increase. Reports of raids on German cities tell of enormous damage, which is having a very considerable effect on Germany's war potential. In addition to the physical damage inflicted, the air offensive has compelled the German Air Force to divert its fighters from the Russian front, has tied down a large part of the German anti-aircraft ground defences, and has made extensive demands on man-power to cope with air raid damage. Daylight attacks by bombers and fighters are inflicting heavy losses on German fighter aircraft. The German aircraft industry has been compelled to concentrate on the production of fighter aircraft for defensive purposes, rather than on bomber types. With regard to the invasion of Europe from the west, recent announcements regarding the appointment of Allied commanders make it obvious that Australia has been made secure as a base, developments are brewing. In tbe Atlantic, tbe U-boat menace buted to the improvement have brought may now be said to be under control. with them new problems.

In this result, the use air force in entirely new localities from of facilities in the Azores, made available those which would have continued to be by Portugal under the treaty of alliance, used had the Japanese been able to pin has been an important factor. While illustration attacks on merchant shipping have growing strength of the Allied forces fn diminished, the rate of sinkings of Australia, and the extensive demands for U-boats has also diminished from the camps, hospitals, munitions, equipment, very favorable results of August-October, food and other supplies, and repair and 1943.

An in the military realm is the The diversions and regroupings involve endless adjustments over the entire national economy. It is a far easier prorelief. The Government's problem has been tial requirements of the civilian populaservices which we can provide for the Allied forces. The limits of our capacity reserve of man-power to be drawn on in all cases fall short of the demands made upon them. The decisions of the Government in October, 1943, were taken after consideration of the recommendations of the Defence Committee regarding the strength and composition of the services, priority employment in the field of in a comprehensive review of the manpower position 'by the War Commitments Committee, and a submission by the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture regarding the Australian food programme. As was announced at the time, the Government decided that 20,000 men should be released from the Army by the end of June, 1944, in addition to normal discharges and temporary releases for seasonal work. It was also decided that 20,000 men should be released from the munitions and aircraft bloc over the same period, subject to certain set-offs in respect of new projects. Priority was to be given to the provision of 15,000 men for rural industry, and the pool of seasonal farm workers was to be increased. At the same time, the Government determined the rate of intake for the services and the strengths at which the armed forces were to be maintained. These strengths were, of course, related to the operational plans of the Commander-in-chief of the South-West Pacific Area. Action was also taken to review the munitions and works programmes of the services, with the object of ascertaining to what extent the man-power position could be relieved by adjustments in these programmes. Considerable progress has been made with the release of personnel from the Army in accordance with these de-cisions. Up to the 29th January, 1944, 16,217 applications for release had been received, of which 6,634 had been approved, 3,308 were under consideration, and 6,275 had been refused. In the great majority of cases in which release has been refused, the personnel concerned are in operational formations. We cannot afford to weaken units which are engaged or intendedto be engaged in active operations. As I have said, the maintenance of the fighting strength of the Army is the primary consideration, and the Government is determined that the Army shall not be treated as a to maintain civilian services at the expense of the offensive against Japan. In addition to releases from the Army, some 6,500 men have been released from the munitions and aircraft bloc since the lst October, 1943, to highdirect war production. As against this, however, increased employment in other sections of the munitions and aircraft bloc reduces the net releases to a considerably lower figure. As far as rural industry is concerned, it is estimated by the War Commitments Committee that since the lst October, 1943, more than 6,000 men have been added to the rural labour force by discharge from the services, release from the Army for rural work, or diversion by the manpower directorate. The conditions of rural employment, especially in the dairy industrv, give rise to special difficulties in anv attempt to increase the man-power available. Apart from the general shortage of experienced labour, it has been found that many farmers are unwilling to accept other than nominated personnel, which comprise, predominantly, sons and relatives previously employed on the farms. It is important to emphasize that no allocation of man-power resources between the various claimants can remain operative for any great period of time. Changes in the strategical situation and information in the light of actual experience, in regard to such matters as rates of production and consumption of commodities, casualties, discharges from the forces, and the like, make it necessary that there shall be a periodical review of the man-power situation at fairly frequent intervals. It is all a question of balancea little more or a little less in some directions-unti l the basic point of stability is established, and the pressure of stresses and strains is equally spread over the whole field of the national war effort. The War Commitments Committee, at the direction of War Cabinet, has recently made a fresh assessment of the situation, and this further review is at present receiving the attention of the Government. I need not add that General MacArthur has been kept fully informed of the Government's decisions on these important matters, and has expressed bis full agreement with the general principles laid down. He has also expressed his appreciation of the assistance he has received from Australia in the form of naval, land and air forces and the various classes of supplies, works and services. The scale of Australia's military effort will have an important bearing on our status at the peace table. It is of vital importance to our future that the part which we play should be such as to guarantee us an effective voice in the peace settlement. There is, therefore, a minimum below which our military effort cannot be permitted to fall. Despite the favorable developments I have described to-day, there is as yet no reason to believe that Germany will be defeated without the launching of an invasion from the west. The enemy has had a long time in which to prepare his defences against such an invasion, and experience has shown that a front of this kind cannot be opened without severe sacrifices of men and material. It seems clear that the climax of the war in Europe will be reached this year. When Germany is defeated, it will still take some time to mount an overpowering offensive against Japan. The Japanese are stubborn, tenacious foes, and they have had a long time to consolidate their position. Whilst we can be hopeful for the future, we cannot count upon an early or an easy victory. The sacrifices being made by our fighting men, and the sufferings of our troops who are in enemy hands, demand that we, on the home front, shall not relax our endeavours for one moment. Much has been achieved in the past, and the Government pridefully pays tribute to those who have worked so arduously, efficiently, and patriotically. The people of Australia now face a period in which the call is for endurance, unflagging zeal, and untiring concentration on fighting and working. WhatI have just said is intended to demand that there shall be devoted underline the situation that this country to the prosecution of the war the maxinow faces. We must have unrelaxed mum capacity of the nation and that effort, undiminished determination, and there shall be kept for civilian use Mr Curtin. the maximum concentration on the tasks of war. WhatI have told the House reveals, surely, that this year is one in which we are to seek on all fronts to mount the attack on a scale requisite to bring the war to the earliest possible, and yet victorious, termination. The task of invading Europe from the west involves a very great allocation of resources by the United Nations. If the invasion is to be successful, and if it is to be achieved at a minimum of cost, it must be undertaken in the strongest possible way. The more strongly it is mounted the more certainly will it achieve satisfactory results. For such a mounting, it must be clear that very great numbers of American and Dominion personnel must be based in the United Kingdom in addition to those already assembled there. That calls for the accumulation, in the United Kingdom, of the requisite resources and reserves. Therefore Australia has a task to perform in ensuring that anything it can do shall be done to strengthen the capacity of the Allied Nations to launch from the United Kingdom the invasion against Europe from the west. For the operations to be launched from the United Kingdom we cannot provide those things which we consume ourselves. Consequently, the minimum consumption of war requirements on the part of Australia will enable us to make the largest contribution that we can make to the attack which is being prepared in Western Europe against our enemies. Our maximum production must also be considered in conjunction with the energetic prosecution o£ the war against Japan. The gains that have been won against Japan are so important strategically that instead of losing grip of them we must extend our hold and advance our offensive. The decisions made at Cairo and Teheran involve the exertion of the maximum energy against Germanyconcentration on the defeat of Germany in the minimum time-concurrentl y with the most energetic waging of war against Japan. All these operations only the minimum requisite for the maintenance of the essential standard of life of the civil community. I believe that in this year we are entering upon the stage which will be the prelude to the termination of the war. The greater our endurance in this year, the more willingly we undertake the tasks of war, the greater our concentration on these tasks, the greater will be the resources that we shall be able to place at the disposal of our commanders to carry out the strategy and tactics that are desired. Certain of our Allies have been fighting for a long time. I have already mentioned the length of time that China has been fighting. The people of the United Kingdom, too, have been fighting for a long time. While the enemy has been using up his resources we also have been using up our resources, and it would be unrealistic on my part not to acknowledge it. Most certainly the people of the United Kingdom, in particular, have had to bear stresses and strains inseparable from the maintenance of their island home, not only for themselves, but also as a base which the United Nations could and must use. be held in order that it could be used as a base for the launching of a. vast force against Germany. That this has been achieved by Great Britain is a matter not only for admiration, but also for thanksgiving, for had that base not been held Germany would have won the war. the United Kingdom have been engaged in active warfare longer than have the people of Australia. I shall not go into details, but I say transport and efficiency, and an unquite firmly that, with many others in economic use of the total resources of this country, I have been concerned the Allies. about the ill distribution of wealth. I have seen the contrast between the conditions of those who have and the tion by saying that in this year, for the conditions of those who have not. first time, the United Nations are on the I have seen that too many go withoffensive in all theatres, and, because we out, much. But to-day I am concerned becomes even more vital; for if mistakes about what I consider to be the inbe made our operations will not be adequate distribution of the necessaries so successful as we would wish them of life among our kith and kin in Great to be and will involve losses of OUT Britain, our comrades in this great fighting men which could have been struggle. We in Australia owe it to avoided. No fighting man anywhere them and we should regard it as our privilege, to make our maximum contribution to their physical needs so that their stamina may be maintained and so that, having regard to what they have already undergone, they will be able to stand up to the physical ordeal that they must endure before victory can be gained. Any comparisons which can be made between what has been done in this country in the past and what is being done now are beside the point. The important thing for me to ask myself is, ""How much of meat, butter, eggs and other foodstuffs can I contribute towards my colleagues, my brothers as it were, in the United Kingdom ?"" If this nation desires to bring the Japanese war to the earliest possible termination it must, this year, make its utmost physical contribution towards ensuring that supplies requisite for the great attack from Great Britain on Germany shall be provided on the largest possible scale. If we do this we shall make more certain not only the victory against Germany, but also the earlier termination of the war against Japan. It is also true that, increasingly, forces are to be deployed from this base, that The United Kingdom had to this theatre is not being neglected but, indeed, is being used, for the most energetic prosecution of the war against Japan. Consequently, there will be more fighting men to feed in this part of the world than there have been hitherto. I do not propose to indicate the kind of forces that will come, and indeed are That is a fact. The people of already coming here. I merely say that it is our bounden duty to ensure that they will not have to bring with them anything that it is in the capacity of this country to supply; for that would be a waste of I conclude this review of the war situafor too few have had too are on the offensive, the task of war in the world should he sent to do a task without being assured that the maximum strength of the United Nations is with him and that there is no deficiency that could have been avoided. This is a year in which we can win all; but it is also a year in which we could incur most grievous losses and heavy casualties, resulting in a prolongation of the war, if we diverted from the tasks of war the maximum capacity of the nation, in order that we ourselves might have that which, in the present circumstances of the conflict, we have no title to expect. I know of no burden that the people of Australia are to-day bearing which is comparable with that of the people of China or of Russia or of the United Kingdom. I speak with knowledge of the facts. As we have no burden equal to that which they are carrying, and are asked to make no sacrifices equal to those which they will still be called upon to make, it surely is not too much to ask that every man and woman in this country shall regard this year not only as a year of fate but also as a year in which the measure of his or her devotion to the total cause will either shorten or prolong the struggle.

Their position is not opinion referred to the four leading counsel greatly different from that of those who by the National Debt Commission and the opinions given thereon by the four leading have suffered from bush fires. I refer to counsel ? 2. As, according to paragraph 12 of the the State who have had a complete crop report, from 1929-30 onwards up to and infailure. Throughout the wheat-growing clusive of 1934-35 deficits of the States were areas of Victoria the season has been financed by means of borrowings from the Commonwealth Bank under the security of Commonwealth treasury-bills on the basis of loans for purposes other than revenue deficits, half the normal quantity for that State. will the Treasurer state whether deficits from 1929-30 to 1931-32 of tlie State of Queensland amounting to £3,640,409 4s. 5d., being 1929-30, meetings, and it has been my duty to £723,184 17s. 4d.; 1930-31, £842,044 6s. 10d.; 1931-32, £2,075,180 0s. 3d., were financed under this advantageous arrangement? To-day, the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) supplied the following answers to my previous two years' wheat pools have questions:1. The opinions of counsel referred to were obtained for the National Debt Commission and are of a confidential character. It is been made. not considered desirable that these opinions sections are probably receiving a smaller be tabled but the Attorney-General is prepared to discuss them personally with* the right honourable member. 2. The deficits of the State of Queensland the matter is examined carefully, this will for the years from 1929-30 to 1931-32, inbe found to be strictly true. Very large clusive, were financed by that State from cash subsidies have been paid to certain other resources available to the State Government sections of primary industry. Those payand were not financed by means of treasury bills. I consider that the second part of the whose crops have utterly failed to carry reply discloses a most unsatisfactory state On without finance, there is a definite need of affairs. The Auditor-General has that the Minister take whatever steps certified as to the correctness of the report are available to him-and there are steps of the National Debt Commission, which that he can take-to ensure that a subsets out in no uncertain language that stantial sum shall be provided to tide the whole of the deficits of Queensland them over by way of a grant, not a loan from 1929-30 to 1933-34 were financed by means of treasury-bills. Yet, in his reply to me to-day, the Treasurer, referring to the State of Queensland, said that the deficits were financed, not by the means outlined in clause 12 of that report, but out of unexpended loan have an opportunity to deal with that aspect later. My point now is that the two statements are irreconcilable. Both cannot be right. This unsatisfactory direct the attention of the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Scully) the wheat-growers of the north-west of very light and, broadly speaking, the crop harvested this year is approximately Those wheat-growers have held many send to the Minister a number of communications asking for a grant to assist them to carry on until next year.

If ments are justifiable and right, but in view of the inability of the wheat-growers",34,Pabton Tomato Cbop
109,Mr Wilson (Wimmera) [9.48],"Iwhich will have to he repaid with interest. Another proposal advanced some time ago, which would have met the situation, was the equalizing scheme which it was hoped would have heen introduced in the name of the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture. Under it provision would have heen made for an equalizing factor, the holding back from time to time of a part of the payments on excess wheat to provide for a stabilizing income in the years when crop returns were light. I hope that that will be seriously considered and adopted in the future. In the meantime, however, I ask that prompt action be taken to deal with this situation. These people, who constitute a large proportion of the wheat-growers of Victoria, are in urgent need of finance to carry on during the current years. Correspondence that is reaching me is a clear indication that the Mortgage .Bank Department of the Commonwealth Bank is operating unsatisfactorily to applicants Indeed, I should very much like to see the figures indicating how many people have applied for loans and how many have received them. It is true that the department has not been functioning very long, but it is equally true that the people have been waiting a long time for facilities of this sort. believe that the majority of applications have been' refused. There are several features in regard to the refusal of these loans which are inexplicable to me. In some cases, no reason at all is given by the bank except a broad statement that it was not satisfied with the security offered. instances the applicant would ask how much short of requirements he was, the idea being that the difference might be found from some other source and a long term loan obtained in that way. But the department, as a matter of policy, has decided that it will not give the information. I think that that is wrong and unfair, and I should like the Treasurer to have a look at that and, indeed, at the whole policy of the Mortgage Department. It appears to me to be operating on too conservative lines. People who have applied, and whose properties are well known to me and, in Mr Wilson. my opinion, represent ample security, have Been refused a loan. I leave the subject for the present. At a later stage I shall have something prepared on proper lines and I shall give more information, but, in the meantime, I ask the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) to look into the matter in order to see if some more liberal policy can be adopted. I direct the attention of the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) to the extraordinary conditions obtaining under the regulations dealing with real estate transactions. I have received a letter from an estate agency in my electorate. I will not divulge the names in public, but I will let the Treasurer have the names and the facts later. It is of public importance that some attention be given to the extraordinary circumstances governing this one section of the community. I have three cases selected at random that I think the Minister should know something about. I propose to give examples for financial assistance. of two big purchases and an ordinary purchase in order to show how the regulations are administered. The first concerns the sale of a property of twelve flats and two garages. The purchase price was £11,750. A valuation was made by a recognized valuer at £12,000. It was presented to the delegate of the I Treasurer. Negotiations extended over about three months. I ask the Treasurer to note that period of time and compare it with the short space of time subsequently when a sale was effected. In the first letter, the prospective purchaser was asked the amount of war loan bonds he possessed. In the second, he was asked In some of those how much property he owned. The prospective purchaser, a, business executive, was instrumental in his company subscribing £20,000 to the Liberty Loan. He owned a home worth £2,800. His wife owned two shops at Burwood. On the 8th November, 1943, the delegate of the Treasurer rejected the sale on the ground that he owned too much property and that too much margin was provided for the vendor. I can understand the delegate of the Treasurer taking that stand. I cannot, however, understand his subsequent action with regard to the sale of this property, because, when the property was placed on the market, it was instantly",35,Pabton Tomato Cbop
110,Mr Harrison (Wentworth) [9.53].,"snapped up by a wealthy firm whose name I will give to the Treasurer. The priee was £11,750, as it was previously in the rejected transaction. The margin of profit to the vendor remained the same. Yet, although the delegate of the Treasurer rejected the sale in the first instance any property whatever. He wished to because it gave too great a margin, when it was taken up by a big firm which, as I will subsequently prove, has acquired an enormous amount of property, the question of profit did not enter into the transaction. It must be noted that the decision in the first instance took three months and in the second instance only a matter of a few weeks. The second case is somewhat similar. hood was by means of investment. As The property consists of twelve flats and he could not work he was obliged to earn two garages and is in my electorate. The an income from investment in order that purchase price was £11,750. The sale he might not become a liability upon the was rejected for similar reasons. community. His daughter is the widow Immediately the property was placed on of a soldier who was killed at E l Alamein, the market it was again snapped upI and, surely, he was a person who particularly direct the attention of the should have been given some measure of Treasurer to this, because it is important consideration in the purchase of this pro-by the same firm as that which purperty. Her husband had made the chased the first property. This transsupreme sacrifice for his country. These action also was completed within a period facts were made known to the delegate of a few weeks. The total amount of the of the Treasurer, and the contract was two sales which were effected by the same presented to the Treasurer on the 25th company was £23,500. Prior to these October, 1943. The man was informed sales, this company had purchased a that he would be required to subscribe large block of flats in my electorate; and £1,400 to the war loan. He told the delemy informant has told me that the purgate of the Treasurer that all he poschaser of these flats had bought property sessed was a life assurance policy the surworth about £70,000 within the last six render value of which was £700; and he months. The procedure in both cases requested the Treasurer to accept that was facilitated because the purchaser had amount as an adequate subscription to subscribed approximately £250,000 to the war loan. His request was refused. war loans. If this policy is to be continued, we shall find big financial institutions investing large sums of money purchase the property? in war loans and, at the same time, taking out large sums in real estate' investments. The Treasurer must agree that some of a certain amount of money. He enthing is wrong with a regulation which deavoured to obtain an overdraft from gives an unlimited charter for the purthe bank in respect of the amount of chase of real estate to a big firm because £700 which he proposed to invest in the it has large holdings and is able to inwar loan, but the bank informed him vest large sums in war loans. This will that it was prevented from lending money mean that real estate will become vested on the security of war bonds. Subin the hands of big monopolistic concerns sequently he appealed to the delegate of to the exclusion of small investors. A third case which.I now propose to for permission to purchase. Had the cite reveals how difficult it is for a perwealthy firm which I mentioned preson to acquire a property for investment viously again come forward to purchase because the existing regulations are interthis property on the open market, I have [2] preted to the last dot by the delegate of the Treasurer. This is the case of a block of four flats and four garages situated in my electorate, the purchase price of which was £3,750. The man who sought to purchase it did not own buy the property as a home and an investment for himself and his daughter, who also did not own any property. The father had come from New Zealand twelve months previously, where he had been under medical care as we'll as in Sydney. He possessed medical certificates issued by doctors in New Zealand and Sydney to show that he was totally incapacitated.

WAR LOANS. 1943, the honourable member for Watson 1943, t he r i g h t honourable member for ( Mr Falstein) asked the following D a r l in g D o w n s ( MrF a d d e n ) asked the question, without notice:In view of the fact that the Treasury allows brokerage to banks and brokers who collect subscriptions to war loans, w ill the Treasurer say whether expenses are allowed to municipal councils and other organizations entrusted with the raising of allotted quotas of loans ? It is the practice of the Treasury to pay commission to members of the stock exchanges, and to banks, for the services given by them in connection with the raising of war loans. This is payment for services which are a part of the normal business of these people, and where services are provided in this way it is customary for the Government to pay for of war loans is less than the rate allowed the first £5,000 of an application, and and other bodies have undertaken to assist the Government voluntarily in raising money to meet war expenditure, and they have, for quite a considerable I deeply appreciate what these various organizations have done and are doing; members of these bodies, and to support their committees themselves.

I am now in a position to f u r n i sh the following answers to the righ t honourable member's questions:1. The opinions of counsel referred to were obtained for the National Debt Commission, and are of a confidential character, l t is not considered desirable that these opinions be tabled, but the Attorney-General is prepared to discuss them personally with the right honourable member. 2. The deficits of the State of Queensland for the years from 1929-30 to 1931-32, inclusive, were financed by that State from cash resources available to the State Government, and were not financed by means of treasury bills. 1943, the honorahle member for Griffith ( Mr Conelan) asked the following question, without notice:Will the Minister for Bepatriation request the Cabinet to give favorable consideration to the .proposal that ex-servicemen of the last war, who have gone blind since the last war, should have their affliction accepted as a war disability, in the same way as tuberculosis contracted by ex-servicemen since the last war is accepted as a war disability? I informed the honourable member that consideration would' be given to the matter raised by h i m . I have now had an opportunity to look into the question, and find that for some years special consideration has been afforded under the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act to sufferers from pulmonary tuberculosis. deemed justifiable owing to the infective nature of that disease, and the wish of the Gommonwealth Government to parti cipate in a tangible manner in a national effort for the prevention and eventual elimination of that scourge. Moreover, the view is strongly held that persons so suffering may be said to be at a disadvantage in the community when seeking employment, even after the disease may have been arrested. The question raised by the honourable member for G r if f it h cannot be considered by itself. It is related to the very much larger problem of the acceptance for war pension and medical treatment purposes of all disabilities which may become manifest in an ex-soldier at any time connected w it h war service. This matter has heen raised on many occasions during the last twenty years, and the attitude adopted by past governments has been that acceptance of this principle would mean the breaking down of the whole stmcture of the Repatriation Act and the basis of war pensioning. Therefore, the Government is not prepared to introduce legislation for the automatic acceptance of blindness in soldiers where there is no possible connection w it h war service. If blindness is not related to war service, it is a matter for social legislation altogether apart from that of repatriation.
