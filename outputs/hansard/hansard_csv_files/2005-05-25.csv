230,The Speaker,"Order! It being 8 pm, McDowall in Brisbane, Qld.(4) calls on the Australian Government to recognise the debt that all Australians owe to Australian merchant seafarers for the contribution they have made to the defence of this nation, particularly their role in the allied victory in World War II. (Notice given 25 May 2005.) Wednesday, 25 May 2005 ----Whaling Dental Health sues that are of grave concern to the people in my electorate of Richmond. These are issues that they have brought up with me on many occasions. The first one is relates to the senseless whale slaughter that we are seeing at the moment by the Japanese. So many constituents have contacted me about this issue, and there has been a huge reaction to this petition. It is time the Howard government acted to stop the slaughter of whales in Australian waters. Australia’s Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act is very clear: whaling in the Australian Antarctic Territory is illegal and it is time the government enforced its own legislation on this. These precious and defenceless animals must be protected. The migration we are now seeing of whales has a huge impact upon ecotourism in my region. So people have environmental and also tourism concerns. As a community, we are going to stand united in telling the Howard government that we want some action on this. In this petition we are demanding that whaling activity stops occurring in Australian waters and that immediate steps are taken to prosecute boats detected slaughtering whales and that the Minister for Foreign Affairs applies diplomatic pressure on Japan to stop this. The Howard government must take immediate action to ensure that Australia’s opposition to the proposed expansion of whale culling is clearly conveyed to all members of the International Whaling Commission. This is a major issue within my community, and as a community we will keep telling John Howard to take some action on this. It is just not acceptable to do nothing. The Howard government has been completely negative on this matter, and John Howard cannot simply feign shock and horror, given that his government has looked on while Japan has increased its whaling. The other petition I wish to speak about today is another huge issue within my community and relates to public dental care. I launched this petition about four weeks ago, and so far about 1,000 signatures are on this petition. People are constantly contacting me about this issue. Dental health is a huge issue, particularly in my electorate. We have 25 per cent of people aged over 65. It affects their general well-being. People are waiting two years to get dentures. They are unable to eat. It is just outrageous. This is a federal responsibility. It is in the Constitution. The Howard government must take action on this. It is outrageous that people cannot eat; it is outrageous that elderly people’s health is absolutely suffering. It is a federal responsibility; it is in the Constitution. The Howard government cannot ignore the people of Richmond who are so desperate to get their teeth fixed, and that is why thousands of them are going to be signing this petition. We will take the fight to John Howard to restore the federal funding for dental health he took out in 1997. It is outrageous that this keeps happening. I am getting calls every day from elderly people in tears because they cannot eat. They have got to wait over two years for dentures.

231,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Ir Causley) Took The Chair At 9.40 Am,,168,Statements By Members
232,Mrs Elliot (Richmond) (9.40 Am),"I am speaking today about two petitions on two iswhen she is referring to members she should refer to them by their seat or by their title. Whaling members of my electorate. Jasmyn Newton, nine years old, of Tomerong, had something on her mind. Like many of us, the youngster was worried about what she was hearing and seeing in the news. Like so many others on the South Coast, Jasmyn took particular notice of one story: the item about Japanese plans to increase whaling numbers. Instead of interpreting what Jasmyn had to say, I will simply read her short but concise letter: Dear Mrs Gash, My name is Jasmyn Newton and I am nine years old. I saw a news headline on Ten that Japanese people are shooting and killing whales. All the whales around our area are protected for one … so I think the Japanese should stop. They should find something else to make soap out of. I have gone around my local area and gotten some people to sign my petition: “Save the Whales”. I hope that you can take notice to this letter. Yours sincerely, Jasmyn Newton The South Coast of New South Wales can proudly include itself as part of the nation’s booming whale-watching industry. It is an industry that has grown through hard work, education and community support. It is also an industry that relies on whale populations being protected, studied and understood. Associate Professor Peter Harrison from Southern Cross University best spells out the potential impact of Japan’s proposed actions. He told the ABC recently: The potential threat is also significant in terms of our humpback whale population ... A resumption of significant amounts of lethal scientific whaling or commercial whaling could seriously threaten its ability to recover to pre-whaling population. The key issue here is that population has not recovered as such ... it’s probably still about one-quarter of its natural size. It also presents a problem in terms of Australia’s $300 million whale-watching industry. About one-and-a-half million people are estimated to watch whales ... be that on commercial whalewatching vessels or along the coastline ... and the economic significance of that to some of the coastal communities ... where people migrate to ... is very significant. So, if you have an increase in numbers of humpback whales being taken ... that could have serious implications for the recovery of the whale population and ... therefore ... the ongoing expansion of the whale-watching industry. I could not concur more with the words of Professor Harrison. But it is the words of young Jasmyn of Tomerong we must make sure that Japan hears: ‘They should find something else to make so soap of.’ I urge all local members to place petitions in their offices and to be heard loud and long in the media about these stomach-churning outrageous killings.

235,Mr Bowen (Prospect) (9.46 Am),"I want to once again bring the House’s attention to theformer proprietor of Challenge Export and Import. In 1998 Mr Haj, promoting Australian exports, sold $180,000 worth of fruit to a company known as Future Trading in Kuwait. Mr Haj did not receive payment for these exports and consequently he went out of business. You might say that is the risk of business and that there is nothing more that can be done, but there is more to this story. Future Trading was owned by Sheikh Sabah Mohammed al-Sabah, a member of the Kuwaiti royal family, one of the world’s richest and most powerful families. Sheikh al-Sabah continues in business as Chairman of the Sabah International Foodstuff Group. It is of course outrageous that a hard working small business man from Western Sydney trying to promote exports has gone out of business because a member of a royal family refuses to pay his bills. I have written several times to the Kuwaiti Ambassador to Australia, His Excellency Mr Nasser al-Muzayyan, imploring him to take action to ensure that the Kuwaiti royal family pays its debts. I have had one phone call in response to all these letters and I have received no formal reply. The phone call simply informed my office that the letters had been forwarded to Kuwait for consideration. Frankly, I regard this lack of response as an insult to the institution of the Australian parliament. I regret to say that it appears that the Kuwaiti government has forgotten that Australian service men and women fought for the liberation of Kuwait just 15 years ago. I again call on the Kuwaiti government and the Kuwaiti ambassador to ensure that action is taken by the royal family and the government of Kuwait so that justice is done for Mr Haj. I also call on the Australian Minister for Trade, the Hon. Mark Vaile, to make representations at the highest level to his counterpart trade minister in Kuwait to ensure Mr Haj is paid for his goods so that he is able to return to business and that justice is done. Student Union Fees Many of them have had to move away from their parents’ home for the first time, in many cases to go to the capital city, to live closer to their university. Many are faced with rent bills for the first time. Many find difficulty juggling the ordinary everyday problems of running a household along with their education studies and also the requirement of a part-time job. They do not need the added, unwelcome situation of having to find money to fund a student union. Many student unions-or student guilds, as some are called-are requiring all students to fork out between $100 and $600 per year to join their organisation. It is a compulsory fee, and any decision by a student not to pay the fee is met with threats of dire consequences. In the past, students who have declined to pay student union fees have been threatened with having their enrolments cancelled. Other students have been told that failure to pay student guild fees may lead to their tertiary results being held back. Tertiary students spend countless hours with their books, burning the midnight oil, to give themselves the best chance of good grades. They sacrifice hours of sleep, they often sacrifice good grooming and many sacrifice good eating practices. But the students see those as worthwhile sacrifices that will pay off in the long run. After all, a good education comes first. But this is not the case as far as the student unions are concerned. For the unions, the fees come first. The fees are compulsory and they come with the threat to the student to pay up or else. It is akin to the old days of racketeering: the standover men with their dark suits, dark sunglasses and shaved heads paying an MAIN COMMITTEE",169,Statements By Members

Also, of course, the compulsory funds paid by students are often used for political purposes for which the students have no sympathy. All this is about to change. Students should no longer be forced to pay good money to become members of student unions, and from 2006 this will be the case. Tertiary students already face enough challenges and worries in meeting the trying demands of the tertiary education. They should not have the added burden of scraping together the money to pay their union fees. Unions claim that they provide important services for the students. In some cases this might be true, but in many other cases this is not the case. In any event, students ought to have freedom of choice. It is important to recognise that in a free and democratic society people should have the right to join a union or not to join a union. I think it is broadly accepted in the community that this ought to be the case with industrial unions and, clearly, I think it ought to be the case with student unions as well. ions. If you do that you are being antidemocratic and I think that in 2006 that will be an entirely inappropriate situation. The government intends to use its mandate given at the last election to ensure freedom of choice for students. Voluntary student unionism is a really important issue and I support and commend the minister. (Time expired) Pontian Genocide of the 82nd anniversary of the Pontian genocide. May 19 was set aside by Pontians all over the world as a memorial day. I was lucky to be invited to attend the Pontian Brotherhood of South Australia to hear and join the descendants of the proud Pontians who commemorated and remembered their ancestral roots and scars. The commemoration paid tribute to over 350,000 Pontian people who were brutalised, suffered, starved and died of exhaustion by the imposed long marches or through beatings and executions in Asia Minor. The Pontians are a group who lived in Asia Minor for thousands of years until the tragic Greco-Turkish war in 1922. The Pontian survivors after the war found themselves refugees all over the world. Some found themselves in Greece or in the former Soviet Union, while others were dispersed all over the world. Many have made their homes in Australia, and in South Australia we have over 4,500 Pontian Greeks. To ignore the brutal events and the atrocities committed against the Pontians is to bury the truth in the past and forget it forever. I believe that the story must be told, the events must be recalled and what happened must be remembered as a lesson for the future so that it is never repeated. We owe it to all the people who died and paid the ultimate price with their lives never to forget their suffering. The commemoration paid tribute to over 350,000 Pontian people who were brutalised, suffered, starved and died of exhaustion through the imposed long marches or through beatings and executions. Their voices and outcry of horror can still be heard today and we should never forget them. I believe that it is now time for governments all around the world to acknowledge and recognise the tragic events suffered by the Pontians and to accept responsibility for what happened. This recognition is needed to put the matter to rest and to enable the healing process to begin. MAIN COMMITTEE",170,Statements By Members

They have learned well that the survival of their culture depends on mutual respect for mankind and human rights among all peoples. The traditions and customary values and their recollection of their history are central to their identity, and in multicultural Australia the Pontian Hellenes found an environment favourable for the maintenance and promotion of their culture. To this end they created the Pontian Association, and in 1958 it was created in South Australia. To make their interest more effective, they formed the Pontian Federation of Australia 20 years ago. The organisation, formed originally in the 1950s following the influx of Greek migrants during that time, was established to celebrate and retain the culture and social traditions of the group and to pass them on to their descendants. The association will celebrate its 50th anniversary in 2008 following its formal incorporation in 1968. I am proud to say that its headquarters are in the western suburbs of Hindmarsh, and many members live in the electorate of Hindmarsh. (Time expired) Fleming’s Nurseries of a great success story of a family business in my electorate of Casey. I speak of Fleming’s Nurseries, who with their Fleming’s Nurseries float won gold at the Chelsea Flower Show in London late yesterday our time. Members will know that the Chelsea Flower Show is the most prestigious flower and garden show in the world. Last year Fleming’s Nurseries won the silver medal, and this year, after much hard work, they were able to top that and win a gold medal. Fleming’s entered the show this year with two partners, Jack Merlo, an award-winning young garden designer, and Total Landscape and Construction, a professional landscaping firm. The float was an adaptation of the best-in-show garden from the Melbourne International Flower and Garden Show earlier this year. The Flemings funded the cost of travel and the cost of construction of the garden personally out of the business, and for them to win that medal overnight is a great boost not only for Monbulk and the Yarra Valley but also for Victoria and Australia. Fleming’s Nurseries is a family owned business based in Monbulk, in the electorate of Casey. For the directors, Wes and Graham, whom I know well, and Don and Dawn, their parents who started the business many years ago, it is a tribute to their great effort and their dedication to their profession that they have come out with the gold medal. I also want to pay tribute to the staff of Fleming’s Nurseries, whom I have come to know reasonably well over recent years, particularly Leanne Gillies, who had a major role in helping to organise the logistics of getting to London and running the show successfully, and all of the staff who went along on the trip. The commitment of Fleming’s Nurseries to the Chelsea Flower Show was very much about putting something back into the business that they have worked in for many years and about developing trades and providing an avenue for young people to have a professional development in the horticultural industry and in nurseries. That Don and Dawn Fleming were prepared to put up their own money to do this to showcase Victoria, to showcase Australia and to show that Australia is very much at the leading edge when it comes to this industry I think is a real tribute to them.

Second Reading Debate resumed from 10 March, on motion by Mr Truss: That this bill be now read a second time. Amendment (Rice) Bill 2005 amends the Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Act 1999, and the opposition will be supporting its passage through the parliament. The bill increases the maximum allowable levy at which the operative rate of the rice levy can be set from $2 per tonne to $3 per tonne. It requires that the operative levy be set by regulation instead of by ministerial declaration, and it requires that the levy on rice varieties be declared by regulation rather than by ministerial declaration. This measure has the support of the industry. It was requested by the industry and the government is complying with that request, with the rider that the levy moneys be allocated and used in accordance with the levy guidelines that the Commonwealth imposes on all rural industries that raise research moneys through levies and the Commonwealth makes a contribution. It is very important that these levies are put on production to sustain over time a research effort that in return brings considerable economic benefits to the industry. This is an industry that has been quite clever in the way that it has raised and used its research funds. Indeed, some of the outputs from that research effort are quite staggering. This is an industry that is somewhat misunderstood by the general community, and I note the presence in the debate today of the honourable member whose electorate covers the Leeton and Griffith area. I was in her electorate quite recently and I do apologise for not popping in for a cuppa, but we had a full program and I am sure that she was as busy as I was. Certainly it is an industry that is somewhat misunderstood generally by the Australian community, and I think it is important that when these larger debates on water and environmental issues occur in the community they are conducted from an informed perspective so that people are in command of the facts of the matter and that the industry’s achievements are acknowledged. Nobody doubts that we have significant environmental issues, and water is front and centre, but it is important that when those debates take place they occur in a climate in which people do understand the importance of these particular industries to rural and regional Australia. As I understand it, some 8,000 people are employed in this industry and most of those are employed in rural and regional Australia in electorates such as that of the honourable member for Riverina. The important thing to understand is that this is an industry that has grown to a productive out-turn of about $800 million. Significantly, about half of that, $400 million, is from exports. That is a sizeable and significant contribution by one industry to Australia’s export efforts. We have heard a lot of debate recently about the state of Australia’s level of international debt, and of course the particular industries that are largely export focused play a very important role in the overall export effort. MAIN COMMITTEE",172,Statements By Members
241,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Ir Causley),Order! In accordance with standing order,173,Primary Industries Excise Levies Amendment Rice Bill 2005
242,Mr Gavan O’connor (Corio) (9.57 Am),"The Primary Industries (Excise) LeviesThe interesting statistics on the rice industry give us some insight as to where the research dollars have been spent, being in line with community expectations that industries become more water efficient. Over the last 10 years this particular industry has achieved some 60 per cent savings in water efficiency. That is a quite staggering statistic when you think about it. The industry has been asked by government and the community to walk down a particular path, so it has levied its production, turned its research effort to improving water efficiencies and delivered to government and the community. That fact ought not be lost on those who engage in environmental debates in this country. I note, from the research programs that the industry has put on the table, that over the next 10 years it is hopeful of achieving a further 40 per cent gain in water efficiency. That is to be commended. We are now in the era of smart farming and if you are going to farm smart you need information, you need research and you certainly need support from government. I am pleased that this industry has received support from previous Labor governments and from this one. I note another important point, particularly when we talk about the clean food debate-that is, that this is a particularly nutritious product. IfI can lay my hands on the information, I have a statement that I came across that I think many people in this parliament might care to take on board. From a health point of view, rice is low in sugar, total fat and saturated fat. It is cholesterol free, contains negligible amounts of salt and has no additives or preservatives. It is suitable to include in a diet for those watching their weight or on cholesterol-lowering diets. I am not a walking advertisement for the rice industry, let me tell you. Mrs Hull-You should be! matters. The honourable member for Riverina, who has rice growers in her electorate, can be a little more partisan! There would be a few people around this place who ought to read that statement and change their diets to rice. We are entering an era where the Australian community is becoming more conscious of its health. It is becoming more demanding and it requires clean food. Of course, this is an industry that is delivering in that way. For example, chemical usage on rice in Australia is the lowest in the developed world, thanks to a ‘unique rotation system utilising natural biological controls’. That is a statement from the rice industry itself. It was published in the International Year of Rice 2004. When we discuss the role of food in nutrition and indeed health, you do not have to be a genius to understand that getting into nutritional foods will, at the end of the day, improve the health status of Australians and lead to a lower burden on the health budget. It seems fairly logical to me. When we start talking about the value of industries to the Australian people then perhaps we ought to start factoring in some of these sorts of issues because the Australian consumer does have a choice in this era, when we trade in rural commodities around the world. It does have a choice between a product that might be grown in another environment overseas where producers are not so stringent about the use of chemicals and an Australian product where chemical usage has been reduced progressively over time to deliver clean food and a better environmental outcome. Direct investment in research and development by this industry is around $18 million, and it is largely directed to maintaining the industry’s competitive advantage in areas such as irrigation, crop protection, continuing product development and crop breeding. The product development issue is an interesting one because this is an industry that has really taken to innoMAIN COMMITTEE",173,Primary Industries Excise Levies Amendment Rice Bill 2005
243,Mr Gavan O’connor,"In the position that I hold, I have to be quite impartial in thesevating and putting innovative products that consumers have obviously taken to into the marketplace. You can go into the supermarket and get a bag of rice-perhaps you might not look at the label to see where it comes from-or you can get a specialised product, value added and packaged in rural and regional Australia, that meets your consumption needs. It is a very innovative industry with regard to its marketing and the strategic use of these research and development funds to get better outcomes for the industry. There is another statistic that I found very interesting, and that is the return on investment. The net benefit of investment of $11 million to the triple bottom line was estimated at $292 million. Of this return, 59 per cent came directly to rice producers and 41 per cent reflected the share of benefits estimated to flow to a range of measurable environmental and social dimensions of rice production. So here we have a triple bottom line assessment that indicates that from an $11 million input some quite staggering economic benefits flow. The honourable member for Riverina is here and she will follow me in this debate. In her electorate there are whole rural communities dependent on this industry, and they have been hard hit by the drought. As I understand it, some of those areas are in their third season of drought, and this has impacted quite significantly on production. The normal rice crop has historically been about $1.3 million tonnes. This year, as a direct result of the drought, that will reduce to 358,000 tonnes. That has already led to a drop in the industry’s rural and regional work force of 8,000 people. Some 200 workers have lost their jobs overall. The latest job losses were in February when 75 people lost their jobs. The industry has been able to keep the mills operating in the face of this drought situation but, as in all industries and enterprises, these resources are being stretched to the limit. Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, being a former minister for agriculture and coming from a rural and regional area, you would appreciate that the drought not only impacts on farmers but extends into the value-adding chain. In that situation, the livelihoods of many rural and regional Australians-not just farmers but people in the towns-are severely affected by the flow-on effects when the mill is not able to put through the volume of production and process the rice, and people lose their jobs. In making these comments I appeal to the wider community to not engage in hysterical debate when these issues of water are discussed. We do have a very important debate in Australia on water, but let us not lose sight of the fact that that debate has to be honest and has to acknowledge the contribution that industries are making to the conservation of the productive land base and the efficiencies that have been achieved in the usage of water. Any industry in Australia over the last 10 years that has improved its efficiency and achieved a 60 per cent reduction in water usage ought not to be pilloried for that effort. I would like to go into some households in urban Australia and look at their water usage over time. There would be many households that have not achieved 10, 20 or, at the outside, 30 per cent reduction, let alone the 60 per cent achieved in the rice industry, with a goal of a further 40 per cent improvement over the next 10 years. That is a substantial achievement. The interesting thing about this industry is that we are dealing with very enterprising and innovating farmers. The industry, like other rural industries-I will not mention them-is able to take its research effort and get it onto the ground quickly. That is, farmers are quick on the uptake because they understand that they need to make these efficiencies. Their industry survival in the long term depends upon it. At the heart of their long-term survival is the research MAIN COMMITTEE and development effort. There will not be an activation of this maximum research limit that they are lifting from $2 to $3-the subject of this bill at this point-but when the industry does recover and the rains come and production does increase it will enable the industry to replenish its research and development resources and stay on the front foot. The opposition will be supporting this legislation through the parliament. Probably the one thing we agree on in this House is that the rice industry is an example of success that other industries should be encouraged to follow. An illustration of its success is that the returns it brings back to the grower, the returns it brings back to the community and the returns it brings back to the nation are absolutely significant. I rise to speak today in support of the Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Amendment (Rice) Bill 2005. The bill amends the Primary Industries Excise Levies Act 1999 to increase the maximum allowable rice research and development levy rate from $2 to $3 per tonne. The rice industry has played an important role in strengthening communities within my electorate. Rice was first grown in Australia in the 1920s in Leeton and Griffith. This industry has grown enormously. It now supports 63 regional towns, mostly located in southern New South Wales. The majority of the approximately 2,500 rice farms in Australia are owned and operated by Australian families. Our research indicates that for every dollar a rice farmer makes, $5 goes back into our local communities. TodayI have a particularly difficult task, because this morning I woke to the sounds of ABC outlining that rice is the thirstiest crop in Australia. They headlined the fact that it is a very water-thirsty crop. ThenI came into the House and I picked up my copy of the Australian, and here we have this report entitled ‘Thirstiest crop: 21,000 litres of water to produce one kilogram of rice’. My blood started to boil. Is there only one person in this place who is prepared to tell the truth, to outline the significance of the rice industry and to support it? I would have liked to have seen more people in this House today speaking up on behalf of this great industry. What we have here is a story with headline proportions, but it only tells part of the story-as it always does. It is the most frustrating thing in my life in this House: the partially told story of the rice industry. We do not have the story of one of the greatest vertically integrated industries in Australia providing the best returns to the Australian people; we have this article saying that it takes 21,000 litres of water to produce a kilogram of rice. I would like to put some facts into the debate in this House. I think that we need to understand clearly what the rice industry is about. The member for Corio quite rightly recognised that the rice industry has reduced its use of water. It has improved its water use efficiency by 60 per cent in the last 10 years. That is a great measure for any industry, but it continues to change its practices and to breed new rice varieties that improve on this. We did breed a new variety of rice and it was launched in early 2003. It is also designed to reduce water usage by a further 10 per cent. We have information prepared by a water education foundation in California that indicates that rice is one of the smallest users of water when you look at water use per typical home serving of uncooked food. From growing to preparation, rice requires less water than beef. Beef uses approximately 4,663 litres of water for an average typical home serving uncooked. Chicken uses 1,250 litres of water for an average home serving uncooked. Pasta uses 136 litres of water for an average size serving uncooked. Where do we have rice? Rice uses 59 liMAIN COMMITTEE",174,Primary Industries Excise Levies Amendment Rice Bill 2005
244,Mrs Hull (Riverina) (10.13 Am),"It is a pleasure to follow the member for Corio.tres of water for your typical home serving uncooked. Is this not a distortion of the facts when we read our own super headline in the Australian today, spoken obviously with ignorance rather than information, with only part of the truth? Let us look at the whole process from start to finish. Water use may be one of those areas of concern in the initial growth of rice, but when you look at all of the manufacturing and value-adding components of rice you see that rice is a dry value-adding component. There is no water used. All of our rice is value added in Australia, in the Leeton mills and Leeton plants. We are the largest shipper in Australia of branded product. We do not ship our rice out in bins and create jobs elsewhere in the world; we are creating jobs and value adding right here in Australia. It is an important fact to remember that our Australian rice farmers sow another crop of grain directly into the soil after harvesting their rice. That means that the water remaining in the soil is used to grow a second crop, such as wheat, oats or canola. Rice farmers are effectively getting two crops out of the one unit of water. But do we see this written up in headlines? No, not at all. Rice farmers are the most efficient growers. In agricultural and natural resource terms, this is one of the most efficient and productive rotations used in agriculture today. With research, industry regulations, farm management practices and a commitment to environmental initiatives, our Australian rice farmers are clearly dedicated to ensuring our natural resources are utilised in an efficient and an environmentally friendly manner. Also, I indicate that not just any farmer can convert their farm into a productive rice enterprise. The industry has strict regulations-one of the only industries, and a leading industry that should be followed by other industries-that ensure that the highest growing standards are maintained, with minimal impact on the environment. Rice can only be grown on approved soils. I wish other crops could only be grown on approved soils. No more than one-third of a rice farm can be sown with rice at any one time. We do not have this in the headlines in the Australian today; nor do we have the truth of the rice industry. No, we just have speculation and headline grabs. Severe penalties are imposed if water use exceeds the industry target requirement. It is a very, very regulated industry, an extraordinarily responsible industry and an industry that competes in the most subsidised, supported industry in the world. Rice industries across the world are getting in excess of 80 per cent subsidies, and our growers are competing in those markets. Our growers are competing effectively and efficiently in those markets, and we should be proud of this industry. I am proud of this industry. It is obviously not a popular industry; there are only two speakers on this issue here today. But I am very proud and it is a dashed popular industry for me. I am not even popular in my electorate when I support rice growing. But it is the lack of understanding of the rice industry that creates this perception and the misconceptions. Headlines like the one in the Australian newspaper today really do exacerbate the problems for this industry that I so proudly represent. question?

247,Mrs Hull,"Yes.the member for Riverina says the consumption of water is to produce a kilo of rice. If it is not 21,000 litres, what is it? but I can certainly take it on notice and provide you with that. But I do have Californian education statistics. For us to have a typical home serving, uncooked, of rice, we use 59 litres of water as against 4,663 litres to produce a typical home serving of uncooked beef. I will take that question on notice and provide that information to the member for Melbourne Ports. I will continue to talk about this great industry. As I have said, our Australian rice growers have developed an innovative program designed to meet national environmental requirements, and certainly they are adhering to that. Rice growers and various government agencies and organisations have come together and collectively agreed on a pathway to environmental excellence. The program they have designed, Environmental Champions, aims to combine the many and somewhat complex regional environmental requirements into a streamlined, userfriendly process. Farmers will be recognised for their achievements and for these environmental benefits as well. We are making an enormous effort to return environmental benefits. Environmental Champions offers rice growers the tools to be innovative, and to look for environmentally friendly ways to improve their productivity and profitability while at the same time ensuring a legacy for their farms and their industry. A significant amount of activity is taking place to ensure continual environmental improvements. There is considerable biodiversity on rice farms. Rice farms have never been recognised in Australia for their biodiversity. When I was in the parliament of the European Union, just some 2½ years ago, its agricultural committees recognised the rich biodiversity of rice farms. Rice is subsidised simply because of the biodiversity value it provides to Europe’s wetlands and its contribution to wetland activity. Rice farms are a haven for all sorts of plants and animals. In fact, the rice regions of Australia have become part of the East Asian Australasian Flyway Zone, an international flyway corridor for the migratory journeys of many bird species, including water birds, that would otherwise not be seen in this part of the world. Rice bays and irrigation channels are an ideal home for insects and animals, including tortoises and frogs. Research has shown that around 40 billion frogs are found on rice farms throughout the Riverina alone. The endangered Southern Bell frog relies on the rice industry for its survival. The farm landscape also includes remnant vegetation that provides homes for many different species of animals and insects. The industry recognises that human activity has an impact on the environment and that agriculture is partly responsible for a decrease in the biodiversity of regional Australia. Thus the industry has developed a strategy aimed at enhancing and improving the biodiversity on rice farms and in surrounding areas. The rice industry has done more than most industries to ensure the environmental protection of Australia’s earth. Certainly we do not get any of the credit that is due to us. All we get are headlines like the one on the front page of the Australian today. SunRice is our mother company, the marketing company, of rice. Out of the top 20 food companies in Australia, only six are Australian owned, and SunRice is the largest Australian owned processed food exporter. That is absolutely significant.

249,Mrs Hull,"I do not have with me the figures to produce a kilogram of rice. I am sorry,heavily subsidised overseas rice market in which my growers and marketers compete, cannot afford to be one of the thirsty crops, not getting sufficient return for the dollar. The Australian rice industry has to produce at the lowest cost purely to survive-and survive it is. Our industry is recognised worldwide. We feed 40 million people a day. When I was in Papua New Guinea just before Christmas, with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, I visited the Trukai distribution centre that was distributing rice as a staple food to Papua New Guineans. I was proud to see the way my electorate’s rice is thought of, and how much we contribute by providing this staple form of food to the many people right across these islands. Rice is an affordable and nutritious food, as the member for Corio pointed out. It benefits not only consumers but also the rice farmers and their communities because the other nutritious foods on their table are there purely as a result of the income that rice provides. Rice provides a very good income for its communities. I want to talk about the global warming effect. I do not think people understand how much the rice industry is involved in all other very important areas for the Australian environment. We know that the earth is covered by a blanket of gases which allows energy from the sun to reach the earth’s surface. Most of the heat is radiated back towards space but some remains trapped by greenhouse gases. I raise this because this is also mentioned in the appalling article on the front page of the Australian today. Human activity has meant that the trapped gases are rising in concentration which means that more of the sun’s heat is trapped in our atmosphere. This is having an impact on global climatic conditions. Like any farming enterprise, rice farms contribute carbon dioxide to the atmosphere through fuel and energy consumption-we recognise that. In rice farming, methane is also considered to be a contributor to greenhouse gas emissions and is produced by bacteria in the anaerobic environment. In lesser quantities, nitrous oxide is also produced-we recognise this. Our Australian rice growers recognise their contribution to the global warming effect and have developed a greenhouse strategy. Tell me all the industries that are lauded throughout the Australian community which have their own greenhouse strategy. In conjunction with the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation, the Australian rice industry has developed a comprehensive strategy which identifies the main contributors to greenhouse emissions and develops strategies to reduce these emissions. An innovative electronic scorecard has been designed, allowing farmers to input their production data and calculate their emissions in a typical year. Measures can then be implemented to reduce these emissions. The processing side of the rice industry has also implemented measures to reduce greenhouse gases produced in the milling and packaging processes. The rice industry again demonstrates its innovative and proactive approach, leading the way in Australian agriculture with the development of the scorecard and the strategy. This industry levy is required to continue that vital and important work. The ongoing drought continues to impact on the agricultural sector throughout my electorate of Riverina. The rice industry has not been immune to the effects of this drought and is facing its third year of production downturns. The quantity of rice grown has been reduced, thus reducing the levy being collected. I support this industry levy being raised, simply so that this continual work will ensure environment and community stability in my electorate and ensure that people are not being misinformed by articles such as the one on the front page of the Australian MAIN COMMITTEE newspaper today, to which I totally object. I would be quite happy to have Mr Cullen and the Australian newspaper come out and look at my industry and put a value on its actual worth, not to talk out of ignorance with only half the story. thank the honourable member for Corio, who has indicated opposition support for this legislation, and particularly the honourable member for Riverina for her contribution to this debate. Indeed, I congratulate the honourable member on her well-argued and passionate defence of the rice industry. I very much share her annoyance at the article on the front page of the Australian newspaper today and the distortions that a study of this nature creates for a proper and sensible debate about the usefulness and importance of Australian agricultural industries. For some time. I have been expressing concern about the decline in urban sympathy for rural Australia, a lack of understanding of our rural industries and why they matter so much to our country. It is disappointing that a scientist from the CSIRO is joining this anti-farmer crusade. One would expect that the Australian newspaper will now give equal coverage to the defence of the rice industry, and to the speech today by the honourable member for Riverina, at the top of the very front page of the newspaper tomorrow to put some fair and reasonable balance into this debate. I guess it is a forlorn hope that the Australian newspaper might actually want to fairly cover an issue of this nature, but it is important that the facts be properly put before the Australian people. but can you tell me how many litres of water it does take to produce a kilogram of rice if the front page of the Australian is wrong. erina. Another study has suggested that less than 60 litres of water is required to provide a rice serving for an average Australian meal. There is a vast difference between 60 litres per serving and 21,000 litres per kilogram. I think that demonstrates that the science is anything other than exact and that those sorts of issues need to be appropriately acknowledged when presenting opinions of the nature publicised so extensively in the Australian today. The honourable member is rightly picking on the Australian, because they put it on the front page but, as usual, the usual suspects, such as the ABC, have been quick to follow up on these sorts of issues and make similar comment. The rice industry has made a significant contribution to Australia. It is important to note that, unlike the rice industries in most of the other parts of the world, the Australian rice industry pays full price for its water. If in fact rice were not an efficient and effective user of water, rice production would have ceased in Australia years ago; they would have gone onto something that delivered better returns for the purchase price of the water. Unlike other countries that generally give their water to the farmers for nothing, Australia has a cost-recovery system. So the rice industry, whilst it uses significant quantities of water, is able to do that in MAIN COMMITTEE",178,Primary Industries Excise Levies Amendment Rice Bill 2005

256,Mr Truss,"I was impressed by the statistics so instantly quoted by the member for Rivan efficient and effective way, and it does so in a way that competes with other industries that may perhaps use less water but are able to produce less as a result. I think the record of the rice industry in their use of water is worthy of comment in relation to their savings programs. Few industries have done more to reduce the amount of water they are using. The research and development of their undertaking is likely, in due course, to develop varieties that will have a lower call on water. Indeed, the dream in which there will be no need to have paddy fields at all to produce rice may one day come to fruition. That is why legislation of this nature is of particular importance, because it underpins the progressive work that the industry have already done and ensures that they will have adequate resources to continue their research and development program. I think the rice industry are conscious of the fact that they are subject to more scrutiny than any other industry in relation to their water use, and I commend them on the public way in which they have responded. Their environmental credentials stand well in comparison with almost any other industry in Australia, and they deserve credit for their actions in that regard. Turning back to this bill, which is about research and development, I think the comments made by the honourable member for Riverina certainly reflect the importance of research and development. The Australian government shares that view, and we have a strong record in encouraging sustainable rural industries through research and development investments under the matching funding program, which this government committed to at the last federal election. The government is also mindful of the need to encourage rural industries to structure their R&D systems in a way that maximises the benefits of R&D investment to the levy-paying producers and the wider community. It is in this context that the government was happy to support the rice industry’s request to amend the legislation to allow for more flexible management of its R&D program to ensure the long-term viability and sustainability of both the program and the industry, which has used innovation to remain internationally competitive. The rice industry is currently facing financial pressures as a result of several years of drought having delivered record low water entitlements. Consequently, the resulting sharp reduction in rice production has meant that the flow of levy funds to the rice industry R&D program has decreased far in excess of what normal management strategies could have been designed to cope with. In seeking to assist the rice industry to manage its R&D activities, the purpose of this bill is twofold. It will increase the maximum allowable rice R&D levy from $2 to $3 a tonne and it will replace the way the operative levy rate is enacted and move associated levy administration issues from ministerial declaration to regulations. This change will provide a greater level of accountability back to parliament than the current arrangements and brings the levy arrangements to the rice industry into line with arrangements for other agricultural sectors. It should be noted that the bill will not actually change the rate applied to the collection of levies from the industry, which the legislation refers to as the ‘operative rate’. The industry will need to come back with a proposal to change the current operative rate under the new maximum cap that is consistent with the government’s levy principles and guidelines. Key to this is the need to demonstrate industry support for changes in the operative levy rate, and I understand that the rice industry is currently progressing this process. This measure is in addition to the government’s decision in April to grant full EC assistance to rice growers in the MAIN COMMITTEE Murray Valley who have been impacted by the last three years of record low irrigation entitlements. This EC decision will provide assistance to eligible rice producers for a period of 24 months. To date, 155 rice producers have received prima facie assistance worth close to three-quarters of a million dollars. This is the first time that an irrigation industry like rice has been successful in obtaining EC assistance and it demonstrates the government’s concern that the ongoing drought is impacting on a wide range of rural industries. It is also an illustration of the way in which the government has sought to reform the EC process over the years to make it more responsive to the needs of a wider range of industries. It is not just rice producers who are receiving EC for the first time under this government. We have never really delivered EC before to intensive agricultural industries. I do not think that it has ever gone to irrigators in industries like the dairy industry or horticulture. So we have worked to achieve reform. As I mentioned yesterday in question time, we have not got much cooperation from the states in achieving that reform and so we have acted unilaterally. I noted yesterday that a list of press releases I had put out over the years chronicling those reforms was ridiculed by the opposition, and I think that demonstrates that Labor in Canberra are no different from Labor in the states. They do not really have much concern for drought-stricken farmers and have not shown any willingness to respond to the emerging issues which inevitably occur when you have the worse drought in our nation’s history. I trust that this bill, which enjoys the support of industry, will help industry to continue its record of innovation over the longer term. In conjunction with EC support, which will assist the rice industry through this period of drought, I trust that the industry can plan for the future confident in the knowledge that they have the support of the government in endeavouring to achieve their objectives. I commend the legislation to the committee. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment. Second Reading Debate resumed from 11 May, on motion by Ms Macklin: That the bill be now read a second time. Ms GILLARD (Lalor) (10.44 am)-I foreshadow that it is my intention to move at the conclusion of my speech on the Health Legislation Amendment (Australian Community Pharmacy Authority) Bill 2005 a second reading amendment which deals with the current negotiations between the government and the Pharmacy Guild about the fourth pharmacy agreement and what appears to be the Howard government shaping up to break yet again an election promise. The Howard government once again is not being transparent about its dealings with others. The Howard government is failing to conduct investigations in a timely manner and walking both sides of the street in the course of these negotiations by saying diametrically opposed things on different days. MAIN COMMITTEE I should make it clear that we are supporting the bill before the House. The bill amends the National Health Act 1953 and currently provides for the establishment of the Australian Community Pharmacy Authority, known as the ACPA, whose role is to consider applications by pharmacists to supply PBS medicines and make recommendations as to their approval. In making its recommendations, the Australian Community Pharmacy Authority must comply with the pharmacy location rules, which are determined by the Minister for Health and Ageing in accordance with the act. The provisions for the pharmacy location rules, and indeed for the Australian Community Pharmacy Authority itself, will cease to operate after 30 June this year. Obviously that would be a matter of deep concern when there have been no new pharmacy location rules drafted to take the place of the current rules and where the work of the Australian Community Pharmacy Authority in reviewing those rules and making recommendations about new rules remains undone. Consequently, the government has rushed this bill into the parliament to amend the act so that the Australian Community Pharmacy Authority can continue to operate until 31 December. A commitment made in the third community pharmacy agreement-that is, the agreement that the government has with pharmacists about the dispensing of PBS medications and the payments that flow in respect of that dispensation-is that the Pharmacy Guild of Australia, together with the government, undertake a joint review of the pharmacy location rules. Given that is an agreement of five years standing and there is a commitment in that agreement to have a review, you might wonder why it is that the government was not able to get the review completed in a timely way. That is just the Howard government when it comes to health. The Howard government will respond to a political crisis in health. For example, before the last election the government was suffering very badly in the eyes of the community because of its complete failure in health, its attempts to destroy Medicare and its pressure to ensure that bulk-billing rates collapsed. When the government needed to respond to those sorts of political pressures, then it did act. But, in all of the day-to-day things that really need to be done to make sure that our health system works and important impending issues are addressed, we know only too well that the minister for health never reacts. The time lines slip; things do not get done. Like with many other government ministers, press releases might come and go but substantial outcomes are not achieved. This is another example of where that has happened. Despite a five-year agreement and a commitment to have a review flowing from that agreement, you cannot manage to get yourself organised to get that done in a timely way. So here we are before the House dealing with a desperate extension to give them another six months by extending the deadline from 30 June to 31 December 2005. We know that the review will take place during those six months, and the explanatory memorandum to this bill states that the extension will enable the government to consider the findings and recommendations of the joint review of pharmacy location rules. I note that in fact the work of that group was leaked to newspapers recently, which again just goes to show a competency issue or perhaps something even more machiavellian about what is going on in relation to the review of pharmacy location rules, but as a matter of substance the job has not been done and consequently we have the extension being sought. I also note that the bill makes a technical amendment to the Health Legislation Amendment (Podiatric Surgery and Other Matters) Act 2004 to correct a misdescription. That act was enacted last MAIN COMMITTEE year and enables private health insurance funds to cover hospital expenses for people receiving podiatric surgery. Once again, people might wonder why the minister for health cannot bring a correct bill into the House. Clearly he cannot, so we are once again being forced to tidy up his errors, through this bill which includes that tidying up. Apart from the description of the bill and the work it is going to do in extending the time line for this review by six months, we need to examine the whole course of conduct by the Howard government of the negotiations with the Pharmacy Guild for the fourth pharmacy agreement. It is due to come into operation on 1 July this year, so we are in a phase when the third pharmacy agreement is winding down-it comes to an end on 30 June-and it is the obligation of the government to negotiate a new agreement with pharmacists to start on 1 July. If we look at the process that has gone into the negotiations on the fourth agreement, we see on display two very clear themes when it comes to the Howard government and health. One of these themes is that this government will say anything before an election and give any promise-indeed give any rock solid, ironclad guarantee it thinks will get it a vote-but then, after the election, what do we see? We see those promises smashed. That was true of the Medicare safety net. We had Minister Abbott’s famed rock solid, ironclad guarantee that the Medicare safety net would not be changed and we saw that undertaking smashed after the election and the minister’s credibility smashed as well. He has been exposed as someone who will say and do anything before an election to try to get a vote but will not honour his word after the election. If only it was only the Medicare safety net, but it is not: it is a series of other things in health. Even today we are calling on the government to do the right thing and honour the commitment it gave before the election to put $30 million in new funding into the better outcomes for mental health program, which enables GPs to offer mental health assistance. It particularly provides assistance in rural and regional areas where often the only person who can offer any mental health assistance is the local GP because other health services are not available. We have heard the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and the member for Riverina wax lyrical about their love of farmers in the context of the last bill. You would think that, if they really wanted to do something about this professed love of farmers at a time when farmers are under acute pressure because of the drought and when we know many are therefore struggling with mental illnesses including depression, this government would manage to honour its word and put an extra $30 million into the better outcomes for mental health program as promised. But of course it has not done that-the budget papers show that it is $18 million short of the commitment-and that is another example of Minister Abbott giving his word before an election but after the election his word smashed and his credibility trashed. That has happened in relation to better outcomes for mental health as well. And it is well on its way to happening in the context of the pharmacy agreement. We know that before the election the Howard government, fearing the campaign power of community pharmacists-their ability to hand out leaflets, brochures and petitions in their locations in suburban shopping strips and regional towns and centres across the nation-was willing to issue any promise the Pharmacy Guild wanted as long as the Pharmacy Guild did not embark on a campaign against the government. So the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, wrote to every community pharmacist a letter full of reassurances, particularly those as to the status of comMAIN COMMITTEE munity pharmacy, stating that it was not the government’s intention to have supermarkets compete with community pharmacists in the provision of PBS medication. The government was prepared to issue a very big, glossy promise before the election in a nice letter on letterhead signed by the Prime Minister, but what has happened since? Interestingly, the government was still in reassure community pharmacists mode when the minister for health opened the Pharmacy Guild conference on 4 March this year. His address is reported in the Guild Gazette under the heading ‘Fourth Agreement concerns addressed’ with a very nice photograph of the minister. There we have the description-and these are the words of the newsletter-that the minister ‘gave a reassuring address’. As late as 4 March this year, the minister was still, when it came to community pharmacists, in reassurance mode, in full bedside Tony mode-he was going to take their pulse, he was going to put a cold compress on their heads and he was going to make sure that they got every reassurance they wanted. Many people would think the minister being in bedside Tony mode might be an extract from a horror movie, but obviously it has reassured some and it was the minister’s purpose when he was at this conference to reassure the Pharmacy Guild. So, of course, the minister looking earnest, as he sometimes does, said things like, ‘Pharmacy is one of the great caring professions.’ pharmacists, you are not only saying that in the party room but saying it on the floor of the House of Representatives and surrounded by a battery of TV cameras. But we will wait and see where you are post the negotiation of the new agreement. The minister says, ‘Pharmacy is one of the great caring professions.’ This is the minister in reassuring mode: Based on this standing and the profession’s commitment to public benefit and recognising the excellent relationship shared by the Guild and the Government, the Minister reiterated his intention to protect traditional community pharmacies. He said while he had nothing against supermarkets like Woolworths and Coles, he saw an important distinction between general retailing and pharmacy. Mr Abbott said: Community pharmacy has a well-established culture of professionalism, while the culture of Australia’s general retailers did not appear appropriate when dealing with potentially dangerous drugs. Mr Deputy Speaker, to facilitate the working of the Main Committee I have been advised that it might be desirable to move my second reading amendment at this stage. It encapsulates a number of the things that I have been talking about. I move: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for: (1) failure to conduct the negotiations over the Pharmacy Agreement in a timely fashion; (2) failure to provide transparency about these negotiations and the savings the Government is seeking to achieve; (3) ‘walking both sides of the street’ by commissioning reports that undermine current pharmacy arrangements and simultaneously rejecting the findings of these reports; and (4) getting ready to break the Prime Minister’s pre-election commitment to community pharmacy”.

258,Ms Gillard,"Exactly, and I hope, when the minister breaks his word to communitythe debate. Is the motion seconded? was an unusual way to proceed. IfI can continue to address the second reading amendment and of course the bill itself: on 4 March we have the minister in reassurance mode, but something very strange started to happen some time after 4 March. On 16 May the minister was still offering reassurances to people that he is absolutely convinced about community pharmacy. Running in the newspapers there has been a report dealing with the question of profitability of community pharmacy and, obviously, the minister is asked by members of the press to comment on that report. On 16 May under the heading ‘Govt ‘sceptical’ about supermarket pharmacies’ in an AAP report the minister is quoted as saying: A confidential government analysis of the regulationsthat is, the regulations that prohibit the opening of a new pharmacy within 1.5 kilometres of another pharmacyleaked to a Sydney newspaper today, found pharmacies’ profits had doubled in the past 10 years but they had failed to pass on the benefits to customers. Mr Abbott today stood by the government’s support for community pharmacies, saying he was “sceptical” about an argument to open up pharmacies to greater competition. “The government’s position is that we support community pharmacy, we are sceptical about some of the claims made for opening up pharmacies in supermarkets, and certainly we changed the location rules last year to specifically prevent new pharmacies co-locating with supermarkets,” he told reporters in Sydney. “We are sceptical about pharmacies in supermarkets; we think there is a strong argument for having a different culture of retailing for potentially dangerous drugs than for general merchandise.” So we had the minister in reassurance mode in March and on 16 May. Mr Deputy Speaker, you might be a person who can exercise his mind about this in a very intelligent way and come to a conclusion, but if a government report has contended that the profits of pharmacists have escalated in a major way that causes one to ask: who would have leaked that report to the newspapers? One suspects that, if it had been provided to the Pharmacy Guild, it is very unlikely to be the Pharmacy Guild that leaked it to the newspapers, because clearly they would not think that such a report being in the newspapers would be in their interest. It seems to me that if the government has the report and the pharmacists have the report, and it is adverse to the interests of pharmacists and ends up in the newspapers, then maybe by a set of logical deductions you might think that the government leaked this report. Even if the government did leak this report-and we are very short on alternative suspects-on 16 May the minister was still in reassurance mode and still loved community pharmacists. The minister must have had a conversion on the road to Damascus between 16 and 17 May. Something clearly happened to him overnight, because on 17 May he was reported in the newspapers as saying a diametrically opposed thing. This time he was asked to comment on a report in the Daily Telegraph headed ‘Fatal chemist delay for vital medicines’. There was a suggestion from the Pharmacy Guild that if a new agreement were not properly concluded by 1 July, or if an agreement unfair to pharmacists were concluded by 1 July, it might have major MAIN COMMITTEE",185,Health Legislation Amendment Australian Community Pharmacy Authority Bill 2005

260,Mr Danby,Most fervently. I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,186,Health Legislation Amendment Australian Community Pharmacy Authority Bill 2005
261,Ms Gillard,"Thank you for facilitating that, Mr Deputy Speaker. I do understand itimplications for the timely supply of drugs to patients. The Pharmacy Guild is reported as making statements to that effect. Minister Abbott says: I think the important thing is for themthat is, the guildto focus on what they think is the most effective way of distributing thatthat is, drugsrather than trying to frighten the general public. If chemists did not want to accept the pay deal, the Government could find others who were prepared to dispense subsidised prescription drugs. But something a little bit odder happened in relation to all of this. It goes from odd to odder. We know that the supermarket chains are interested in having pharmacies within supermarkets and they are prosecuting their case to government that this would be an effective way of distributing medicines. You would expect that. It is part of our democratic process that businesses, community groups and others who think they have a case to make come to government and make a case. In the course of prosecuting its case, Woolworths commissioned a report from ACIL Tasman-the consultancy group which models economic questions and which consults on economic questions. Woolworths commissioned this group to produce a report demonstrating the potential savings that could be made if PBS medicines were able to be dispensed from pharmacists within supermarkets. So they prepared a report. The report was then put into the public domain. A series of claims about potential savings were made in the report and, as you would expect, the Pharmacy Guild responded to those claims. Interestingly, I have a letter from Roger Corbett, the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of Woolworths Ltd, in which he refers to the ACIL Tasman report and makes the following statement in relation to it: The information in this report was prepared earlier this year at the request of the Federal Minister for Health& Ageing, Tony Abbott. It was presented to him one month ago to provide additional background during the Government’s negotiations for the Fourth Community Pharmacy Agreement. We subsequently provided copies at their request to certain other ... Government members. Isn’t this all very interesting? It is reminding me a great deal of the Medicare safety net-the minister out there in full reassurance mode before the election and in full reassurance mode after the election. As late as 16 May, he was in full reassurance mode. Despite being in full reassurance mode, under the waterline, under the table, he was saying to the supermarkets: ‘Get me a report that shows the savings. If you could get that in, thanks.’ And they did. From 16 May to 17 May, it is a Saul on the road to Damascus conversion. He has gone to bed as Saul and woken up as Paul, and there he is in the newspaper with a diametrically opposed view to the one he gave 24 hours before about pharmacists in supermarkets. By 17 May, he was threatening the Pharmacy Guild and community pharmacists that he would find others to dispense PBS medication. And we know who those others are-they are the supermarkets. So we are in a situation here where you have to ask yourself: ‘What is going on?’ There are a series of possible explanations. Explanation No. 1 is that the minister is doing what he has done so many times before in health-he is preparing to break a pre-election commitment. It MAIN COMMITTEE might not have been described as ‘rock solid, ironclad’, but it was in a letter from the Prime Minister. He is preparing to break a pre-election commitment-explanation No. 1. Explanation No. 2 is that the minister has no idea what he is doing from day to day. He is able to say within 24 or 48 hours two diametrically opposed things and not realise that he has said them. That is an explanation which has some attraction for me, but I think the ‘getting ready to break an election promise’ is probably a better explanation. I think there is something behind the ‘getting ready to break an election promise’ explanation. Yet again, whilst we might be talking about health and, yet again, whilst we might be talking about something as important as the dispensing of vitally needed prescription medicines in a timely way to people in Australia, throughout this vast nation-which is of course a very difficult job; it is a different thing to be able to get your medication when you are living outside Oodnadatta from living in the CBD of Sydney; so we are dealing with the very important health issue here of getting access to medicines in a timely way-there is some evidence that, like a lot of other areas of health, it is actually not Minister Abbott who is pulling the strings. DoI have evidence to suggest that on other major health issues it was not Minister Abbott who was in control? Well, I certainly think I do because during the election campaign the government announced PBS savings, a new measure in health, which clearly was not generated by the minister for health but was generated by Finance. We know that with the breaking of the Medicare safety net commitment the minister for health was overwhelmed by Treasury and Finance. We know that where he has been directed to find cuts in other aspects of health, he has danced to the tune of Finance. I suspect that the story behind the story is that there is a big blue within government about the fourth community pharmacy agreement and there is pressure from the minister for finance, and possibly the Treasurer as well-because the Treasurer has a certain view about undercutting Minister Abbott’s credibility-to find major savings in the Pharmacy Guild agreement and to open the door to supermarkets if that can generate savings. I think that is what is going on here. It would be very interesting to get a cogent explanation, if that is possible, from Minister Abbott about these things. My suspicions about who is in control were heightened when it came to my attention that at the last minute, on 4 May, the minister cancelled a meeting with the Pharmacy Guild. Ms Hall-What date was that? Guild representatives flew up for it and then turned around and got the next plane back. So if government ministers conduct themselves like that every day, showing that sort of arrogance and petulance towards busy people who are coming to see them, it is a revelation. AndI thank the member opposite for the revelation that the Howard government seeks to treat people with that kind of contempt. The other explanation of course is that Minister Abbott is not in control; he is getting his marching orders from elsewhere and he did not know what he was going to say to the Pharmacy Guild representatives on that date. He had no idea what version of the so-called truth he would use on that day and so to avoid the embarrassment of being in a meeting where he did not know whether he was Arthur or Martha, at the last minute he pulled the plug on the meetMAIN COMMITTEE",186,Health Legislation Amendment Australian Community Pharmacy Authority Bill 2005
262,Ms Gillard,"That was on 4 May. The meeting was cancelled so late that the Pharmacying. We might want an explanation from the minister for health about how all of that has happened, as well. How does this all matter to Australians? It matters in the following ways. Australians have a right to expect that their national government deals with health policy issues in a competent and timely fashion. They have a right to expect that negotiations about something as important as the delivery of PBS drugs around Australia are conducted in a timely, courteous fashion and with transparency. None of those things is happening. They are entitled to know whether the Prime Minister and the minister for health have, yet again, said one thing before an election with a view to doing another thing after the election. I understand only too well the issues about PBS sustainability and I understand the need to make savings on the PBS and in relation to the supply chain. I am certainly not saying to this parliament that the Pharmacy Guild should get everything that it asks for. Clearly, there should be tough negotiations conducted to ensure that medicines delivered through the supply chain end up in the hands of consumers at the best possible price-and at the best possible price to taxpayers as well, in terms of how the government subsidises them. But you do not conduct a rational set of negotiations like this. It is inherent in negotiations that your word is your bond and what you say is the truth. We cannot look at this set of negotiations and say that that is occurring. side I feel I must add a few matters by way of rebuttal. For a start, we did responsibly lift the levels on the safety net. You will recall that our original plan was to have $500 and $1,000 limits but the Independents, as I understand it, would have held up the bill had we not initially agreed to that. The fact that that was not sustainable shows that the government is right on its toes. It also shows that we are responsible and that we want to retain the safety net. Ms Gillard-Excuse me, Mr Deputy Speakerseeking to ask a question? Ms Gillard-Yes, I am, Mr Deputy Speaker. asked? that is so self-righteous about the safety net did not even have any safety net in its policy-no safety net whatsoever, then or since, and with the promise of abolition. Of course, this depressing machiavellian scenario that the member for Lalor painted today, in which every little twist and turn that the minister seems to participate in has to be viewed through the prism of some sort of impending doom, is rubbish. The Minister for Health and Ageing and both sides of the House know that pharmacies have to be monitored very closely. If costs are increasing at about 14 per cent a year and you do not monitor these costs then you are left with one of two things: you end up with a blow-out-like the one of some $10 billion the opposition had left us when we came to office in 1996-or, alternatively, you have to start cutting medicines from the PBS list, and none of us wants that.

268,Mr Neville,"Not at this stage of my contribution. I find it galling that the oppositionThe Health Legislation Amendment (Australian Community Pharmacy Authority) Bill 2005 offers us an opportunity to consider a range of issues affecting the day-to-day operations of the health care sector. This bill amends the act to provide for the pharmacy location rules and their administration by the Australian Community Pharmacy Authority to continue to operate until 31 December 2005. This is necessary because a joint review is currently being undertaken by the Commonwealth and the Pharmacy Guild of Australia in accordance with the commitment made in the third community pharmacy agreement. While this review is expected to report before 30 June 2005, the government needs time to consider the findings and recommendations of the review and, hence, the need to extend the existing arrangements until 31 December. This also means that the existing pharmacy location rules will remain in effect until that time. As the Australian population ages, there is no doubt that our local chemists are taking on more and more responsibility and a more diversified role in cities and towns. Today there are 5,000 community pharmacies scattered across Australia. We find them everywhere, from city and regional shopping complexes to provincial city and suburban streets and small country towns. My respect for the Pharmacy Guild of Australia and for pharmacists in general is well and truly on the record, along with my admiration for the professionalism and services performed by community pharmacies throughout the country. I do not want to see the profession reduced to being an adjunct to supermarkets. I for one am pleased that this review into pharmacy location rules is taking place and that there will be a good length of time for the government to consider the report. As I am a representative of regional Queensland, it should come as no surprise to members here today that I have a great interest in the location of pharmacies and the restrictions which are currently enforced. I believe an anomaly exists in the methodology used by the Australian Community Pharmacy Authority when assessing geographical location and the allocation of pharmacies. I have no argument with the general principle of restricting the unbridled proliferation of pharmacies. Nor do I have any problem with the use of a formula to decide those locations. But I do believe there are anomalies in the current methodology and, in the end, pharmacy services should be about people, not about formulas. I understand the necessity of having set criteria which must be met before a pharmacy, which supplies PBS subsidised medications, can relocate or be opened. Ms HallMr Deputy Speakerask a question? Ms Hall-Yes, I have a question, and it is on what the member just said. Ms Hall-Maybe if you hear my question first and then I am happy if you decline it. not choose to do so.

274,The Deputy Speaker,"The member for Hinkler may proceed.must be met before PBS subsidised medications can be sold and pharmacies can be opened or relocated within a community. But in the case in point certain areas can slip through the net. I cite North Bundaberg in my electorate of Hinkler. North Bundaberg is separated from the rest of the city of Bundaberg. Traffic has a choice of two bridges to cross the river, whilst pedestrian movements are restricted to one bridge alone. There are roughly 4,300 people in North Bundaberg, which of course is not enough to demand a pharmacy in its own right. The suburb is fairly diffuse in nature with five different clusters of housing and a floodplain between the older and newer sections. For this reason, the ABS has spread its statistical local areas over seven collection districts and, because there are fewer than 8,000 residents in any one of these SLAs, the community does not meet the criteria under section 60 of the pharmacy location rules. Quite frankly, the 8,000 in one SLA rule can only be satisfied in closely settled metropolitan areas or large provincial cities. It takes no cognisance of a small provincial city situation. North Bundaberg’s dilemma is exacerbated by the fact that a further 12,000 people from the Burnett shire pass through North Bundaberg to access pharmacy equipped shopping centres and areas and the southern part of Bundaberg city. As it stands, this area of approximately 16,300 people does not, and cannot, have a pharmacy in the most logical locality, because North Bundaberg itself, as the crow flies, is 1.5 kilometres away from existing pharmacies. I understand that this was reduced from a twokilometre straight line distance in 2002, but I believe it should be revisited to take account of incidents that have arisen in places like North Bundaberg. This is a problem which cannot be reconciled under the existing guidelines. I believe this is a prime example of the need to look at the location rules. In a nutshell, there is a suburb and a river with two bridges. The suburb has no pharmacy and is not likely, even with a new shopping centre being built, to satisfy the rules to have a pharmacy. I suggest to the Australian Community Pharmacy Authority that if there is a barrier, like a river or a train line that might have a crossing down each end-as the crow flies, the pharmacy might be quite close to the other side of the river or the train line but a considerable distance in real terms-that should be grounds for exemption. I am pleased that the government has delayed proceeding on this matter as it will give me time to press the case more fulsomely. Of course, I am not suggesting that the government allow pharmacy distribution to take place willy-nilly and, therefore, undo the work of the Pharmacy Restructuring Authority, which was established in 1990 under the Keating government. I support the broad principles of what the Keating government sought to achieve. The whole point of the PRA was to achieve more efficient distribution of pharmacies while maintaining the balance between efficiency and access and the containment of the cost of dispensing the PBS drugs. Between 1990 and 1995 the PRA oversaw the closure of 630 pharmacies, the amalgamation of 64 and the approval of 72 new pharmacies. I now turn to another part of the bill which deals with an amendment to the Health Legislation Amendment (Podiatric Surgery and Others Matters) Act 2004 because of a misdescription. Although the amendment represents a minor technical change, I take the opportunity to encourage the government to go further with its support for podiatrists in general and surgical podiatry in particular. Podiatrists play an important part in maintaining individual mobility MAIN COMMITTEE",190,Health Legislation Amendment Australian Community Pharmacy Authority Bill 2005
275,Mr Neville,"I understand the necessity of having the set of criteria. I know the criteriaand independence by alleviating painful foot conditions, particularly in people over 65. In fact, 85 per cent of people over 65 require a range of podiatric services, covering prevention, diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation of medical and surgical conditions of the feet and lower limbs. The latest report into the Australian podiatry sector, Podiatry labour force 1999, shows that Australia’s ageing population drove demand for podiatric services. Logically the demand for podiatric surgery will continue to grow as our population continues to age. The podiatry work force has increased in line with that growing demand. In the eight years between 1991 and 1999 there was a 43 per cent increase in the work force numbers-much greater in growth than physiotherapy or optometry in terms of labour force numbers. At the last count there were 2,011 working podiatrists in Australia. On the other hand, the Australian Podiatry Council reports that there are only around 20 podiatric surgeons operating in Australia, and their services are restricted to private hospitals and a single public hospital in Adelaide. Surgical podiatry has been around for some 27 years. Podiatric surgery is a specialised area of podiatric practice, with qualified surgeons having undertaken postgraduate training in medicine and surgery and successfully completed the requirements for admission to the Australasian College of Podiatric Surgeons. In the formative years of the discipline, students have to travel to the US, generally Canada, for their degrees. They are accredited under state and territory legislation subject to stringent professional and surgical standards and they are highly experienced in their profession. Bearing these facts in mind, I find it incongruous that surgical podiatry attracts neither Medicare rebate nor significant recognition from the private health insurance sector. There are parallels here with the earlier recognition of oral surgeons. Up until 1995, when the profession moved to an MBBS degree sector, oral surgery was recognised for Medicare and health insurance purposes. This important evolving discipline was not penalised, whereas podiatry has been. The National Health Amendment (Prostheses) Bill 2005 gave our health insurance funds the choice to pay the theatre fees, bed costs and for prostheses for people with appropriate bed cover as a minimum. As it stands, private health insurance organisations can choose to cover these services but only to the minimum standard. They also have the option of covering a percentage of the professional fees of the ancillary table but there is no compulsion for them to do so and, despite the government’s urging, most do not. Worse still, the professional fees of the surgical podiatrists themselves, the anaesthetists and the costs associated with them for podiatric surgery, do not attract any medical rebate whatsoever. Surely, with Australia’s ageing population and the growing demand for podiatric surgery, we need to be offering more extensive cover for elderly Australians. The Productivity Commission recently reported that one in four Australians would be aged 65 or more by 2044-45, roughly double the current rate. Logically, we should be preparing for the future health needs of these people sooner rather than later. AlthoughI commend the government for the steps taken to lend further support to podiatric surgery under the Health Legislation Amendment (Podiatric Surgery and Other Matters) Bill 2004, I would like to see it taken further. The bill would have the opportunity to address listing podiatric surgery on the Medicare benefits schedule. Our health system is in some ways comparable with those of the US and the UK, where podiatric surgery is well recognised and well supported. In the US, foot surgery is more comMAIN COMMITTEE monly practised by podiatric surgeons than orthopaedic surgeons and has parity with them. It is recognised under their Medicare system and their Medicaid system, which supports individuals with low and limited incomes. In the UK, podiatric surgery is regularly performed in both public and private hospitals. It is part of the National Health System, and surgical podiatrists have consultant status. In Scotland, the discipline of surgical podiatry is about to be recognised by none other than the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh. The fact that, on the whole, podiatric surgery is restricted to private hospitals in Australia and not covered by the Medicare Benefits Schedule means that our public patients face considerable out-of-pocket costs, if indeed they can access the discipline at all. This means that older Australians-those who most frequently require that type of treatment-face the added burden of cost when considering their health care expenditure. Why is this the case when podiatric surgery is a highly successful and cost-effective treatment? It makes no sense. It is not as if these and allied skills are widely available; nor is there a plethora of orthopaedic surgeons, and certainly not in regional areas. Full rebate recognition widens the option not only for the vulnerable aid section but for all Australians. While I do not subscribe to conspiracy theories, one is inexorably drawn to the conclusion that there is some deliberate obstruction or subtle pressure to see that the profession is held in a rebate limbo. This is not acceptable. One wonders if the time has not come to start naming names and the funds that are not cooperating. I appeal to the Minister for Health and Ageing and the Medical Services Advisory Committee to reflect on these points and, when podiatric surgery comes under consideration for listing on the Medicare Benefits Schedule, I ask that they give it every consideration. I commend this bill to the House, albeit that it only contains minor amendments, with the qualification that I would like to see surgical podiatry recognised by both our public and our private health sectors, thereby delivering Medicare rebates and/or private health insurance coverage to patients requiring podiatric surgery, particularly those who are aged and disabled. Ms HALL (Shortland) (11.32 am)-I would like to endorse the last comments of the member for Hinkler. There is definitely a need to look at surgical podiatry. It would benefit many of the aged people whom we all represent in this parliament if there were recognition through their Medicare payments and if the private health insurance companies decided to support such measures. I also join with the member for Hinkler in appealing to the Minister for Health and Ageing. If my support for his dealings with the minister will help in any way, I am happy to give it. Sometimes we can agree on things. I believe that it is a cost-effective way to deal with the issue and deserves to be supported. The main part of my contribution will be directed towards the pharmacy agreement. It is most unfortunate that we are debating the Health Legislation Amendment (Australian Community Pharmacy Authority) Bill 2005 in the House today because it is all about the fact that the government was not able to get its act together and negotiate the agreement with the Pharmacy Guild of Australia prior to the time that the current provisions lapsed. The legislation provides for the extension of time of that agreement from 30 June to 31 December 2005. I sincerely hope that it can get its act together to conclude it by then. Obviously there are some competing interests here, and I agree with the shadow minister that there is probably a bit of a blue within the Liberal Party about this. We have all been contacted by our local pharmacies, which I will talk a little about in a moment. I think the minisMAIN COMMITTEE ter, the Treasurer and members of the government are hell-bent on pushing pharmacies into supermarkets. But they should be very careful about that because it will not necessarily develop the savings they believe it will, and I would encourage them to look at some overseas examples before they go down that track. This is a government that tries to walk both sides of the fence, and the fact that it has tried to walk both sides of the fence sees us in the Main Committee today debating a six-month extension. In speaking to the amendments put forward by the shadow minister I have to say that this issue definitely has not been dealt with in a timely fashion. The next point that the shadow minister made was about the lack of transparency. We on this side of the House get so frustrated because every piece of legislation and every decision is made behind closed doors. There is no transparency, there is no open government and there is no taking the people of Australia into their confidence, rather it is deals done in the back room which all of a sudden come out and are placed before the parliament. While we are talking about health, one of the issues that I think is very hot at the moment is the Podger review. It has been lost somewhere within the government annals, and we wonder when it will be released. The Podger review is one that members on both sides of the House are very interested in; we are interested in learning the recommendations of Podger. But I think it is like this issue and there is a bit of a disagreement within the government. But we will see what happens there. I believe a government is beholden to be transparent, to share negotiations with the parliament and with the people of Australia and to involve the parties that are subject to this negotiation, rather than at the last minute to throw something on the table and expect us to agree to it and expect the community to go along with it. We have the situation where people are being told what to do; they are being told to like it or lump it. Consequently, what happens on many occasions is that we are presented with bad legislation. This is a classic example of a government walking both sides of the street. Look at the fact that it has commissioned reports all over the place-it was interesting to hear the shadow minister say only a few minutes ago that Woolworths CEO Roger Corbett had indicated that he had been asked by Minister Tony Abbott to prepare a report and that that had led to a turnabout in the way the minister views the whole situation. As I mentioned a moment ago, I have been contacted by pharmacies in my electorate. I believe that pharmacies play a vital role in each of our communities, particularly in regional and rural areas, because quite often they are the frontline health provider. They provide over-thecounter information to people when there is not a doctor available. Certainly in my electorate, with its great shortage of doctors and inability of people to access an appointment with their GP, people have had to rely more on their community pharmacist. Having that personal service devolved to a supermarket and having a situation where you can no longer go along and see your community pharmacist I think would be a great loss to communities in Australia. I understand that the government needs to look at cutting costs. It is a government that has been faced with a blow-out in the cost of pharmaceuticals, but I have to put on record that that blow-out was known on 27 September, and I was really surprised when the previous speaker, the member for Hinkler, tried to abrogate responsibility on behalf of the government. He is an honourable man, but to try to mislead the House by saying that it was something that came about after the election I found quite disappointing. He is a man of fine character and a man MAIN COMMITTEE who, I believe, always tries to put things in a correct light, but on this occasion he did not, because that was known on 27 September. I will leave it to the House to consider that matter. The government is really hedging its bets here. There has been an increase in the cost of pharmaceuticals, but that is no surprise. We have known that was happening for some time. But the way the government has gone about solving the problem is very second class. The government is looking to make substantial savings in the area and, even though the Prime Minister and Tony Abbott made commitments to community pharmacies, their promise to give this profession protection is going to be one of those many non-core promises that we on this side of the parliament have become so accustomed to seeing. minister that he will ever deliver on a promise, and I am afraid I have to say that to the pharmacists that I speak to. On Saturday, I was speaking to Willie, who is the pharmacist from Lake Munmorah in my electorate. Willie comes from Scotland and he has been a pharmacist in the UK. He has worked under a system where pharmacies were allowed to operate within supermarkets. He said to me that the government is deluding itself if it thinks it can maintain the same quality of service that is provided to people at the moment and if it thinks that the cost cuts that it expects will be delivered. The government really needs to look at this very seriously. It should not rely on a letter from the CEO of Woolworths, Roger Corbett. Rather, it needs to look at overseas experiences. We know that the government is very sympathetic to deregulation, but it should be very careful about it and look at what has happened in the US. It is interesting to note that in the US, which has a very deregulated pharmacy sector, it has been found that only 42 per cent of American adults received any verbal advice about their medicines, and in only 19 per cent of cases did pharmacists advise of possible side effects. Here in Australia, you go into a pharmacy, you are given your medication and the pharmacist talks to you to point out side effects which could occur. On one occasion, I was given very good advice from a pharmacist about foods I could eat with a particular medication. One of the foods the pharmacist suggested I did not eat was a food I ate regularly. The consequences of my eating that food would have been that I would have ended up in hospital very sick. That is the kind of advice you get from your community pharmacist and that is the kind of advice we want to protect. We want to ensure that the people of Australia, whom each and every one of us in this House represents, get quality advice. It is also interesting to note that in the US the rate for hospital admission due to medical misuse is approximately twice the rate in Australia. To my way of thinking, this does not look like the way to go. We on this side of the House have said on many occasions that Australia’s Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and health system is looked at as being one of the best in the world. Unfortunately, this government is eroding many of the very fine aspects of our system. Pharmacies are not another milch cow that the government can get money from. Pharmacies are an institution within Australia. Pharmacies are there to provide the kind of support that each and every Australian needs and deserves. If this government goes down the track of deregulation and pushing pharmacies into supermarkets, it will be just like going along to buy MAIN COMMITTEE",191,Health Legislation Amendment Australian Community Pharmacy Authority Bill 2005

You will hand your script over the counter, it will be given to you and you will not have the same care, treatment and advice that you can get at the moment. It is also interesting to know, when we look at the agreement, that it was introduced at a time when the Howard government and the PGA were engaged in negotiations over the pharmacy agreement. Whilst the sensitive negotiations were being conducted behind closed doors, a lot of discussion was taking place in the media. I have discovered that this government will float something in the media to see what sort of response they get from the community. If it is not too bad, they will go down that track. If it is somewhere in the middle, they will try to negotiate their way around it. This issue has been very prominent in the media. Players on all sides have been involved. The drug wholesalers were worse than the AMA and the government have been walking both sides of the fence, ever vigilant in not making a commitment. This government needs to look at what will truly benefit Australian people, at what will deliver the best health outcomes to Australians. This is not about saving money. It is important that we look at ensuring that all legislation takes account of financial implications. The bottom line is that this is about the health of Australians and about delivery of the medications that Australians need. It is about ensuring that they get the correct advice when they receive medication from a pharmacist and it is about making sure that we have a state-of-the-art pharmaceutical scheme in Australia. We do not want this government and this minister to further dissipate our health system and go further down the track of pushing us towards the American system where they have twice the number of admissions to hospital of people who have problems through not following advice. I call on the government to do the right thing and look after Australia’s interests by ensuring that the pharmaceutical agreement is delivered on time in June, taking into account the needs of the Australian people. derful industries against much attack mostly in the media, which has been trying lots of times to distort the real truth and real issues surrounding these industries. Firstly today it was defending the rice industry and now I have to stand and defend community pharmacies. In doing so, I would like to acknowledge the Health Legislation Amendment (Australian Community Pharmacy Authority) Bill 2005. I welcome this bill into the House simply because it will amend the National Health Act 1953 so that the Australian Community Pharmacy Authority and the pharmacy location rules that are currently in place will remain in effect until 31 December 2005. That will provide benefits to all people because, given the decisions and things that have been raised in the media in the last few months, the industry will have time to certainly refute many of the allegations that have been targeted towards community pharmacy. So it is with great relief in fact that I rise to acknowledge the Minister for Health and Ageing’s sensible actions in putting this bill into the House to enable this process so that all aspects of community pharmacy, including location, are able to be continued and to provide security until 31 December in order for everything to be put on the table for discussion. In my speech today supporting community pharmacy, I wish to bring to the House’s attention that I have had reason to be up on my feet many times-and in conducting many conversations and interviews in my electorate over the past five years-supporting community pharmacy and its value, given the intentions and actions that we have seen in past times to try to deregulate this very important rural and regional component. I have always railed against any attempts at deregulation, and I rail against deregulation right now. At an Australian MediMAIN COMMITTEE",195,Health Legislation Amendment Australian Community Pharmacy Authority Bill 2005
278,Mrs Hull (Riverina) (11.50 Am),"It appears today is the day for my defending two woncal Association breakfast some months ago, I had cause to bring the AMA to task over some of their comments at that breakfast, and particularly over some of the comments in material that they had circulated. In fact, the Australian Medical Association had advised me: The Government pays out more than $5b in contributions to the PBS and pharmacists take 33% of this on the way through. In correspondence to me dated 7 March and received by me on 14 March, the Federal President of the AMA, Dr William Glasson, said: This is a huge sum of money. We cannot allow it to continue to grow as the PBS total expenditure figure grows. It needs to be determined in a competitive environment. The money that is saved can be returned to the PBS in the form of new listings or fewer restrictions on existing listings. I then had to write back to the federal president of the AMA and say: You have stated that pharmacists take 33% of the $5 bill contribution to the PBS; it is my information that this is incorrect. I understand that in 1990 the figure was 36.4% and in 2004 it was 20.7%, whilst manufacturers and wholesalers have increased their share from 63.6% in 1990 and to 79.3% in 2004. I went on to explain to the president of the AMA: Since the three agreements have been in place the gross PBS margin before expenses has gone from 36.4% in 1990 to 21.1% in 2003. The gross margins have fallen every year yet costs on average have increased by 8% per year, this is double the rate of inflation. I would like to clearly articulate that, while figures can be bandied about in all areas, some pharmacists have provided me with some very valuable information. In a basic sense, it is about how well pharmacy has fared under the three agreements. Overall, they tell me, pharmacy gross margins before expenses in 1990 were 36.4 per cent. In 2003 they were 31.2 per cent. I want to talk about the PBS, which is the topic of conversation here. The PBS gross margin before expenses in 1990 was 36.4 per cent and in 2003 it was 21.1 per cent. It has been reducing, as opposed to the media hype and campaign that we have seen in the last few months saying that pharmacies are getting an enormous whack. In fact, it is reducing all the time. The PBS gross margins have fallen every year since 1985, so the minister’s past and present support for community pharmacy is well realised. It is something the pharmacies are doing, beyond the call of duty and well in excess of the PBS gross margins, that is providing security and comfort, particularly in regional communities. There have been large increases in the average expenses per pharmacy. The average total expense increased by over 32 per cent in the first three years of the third agreement. Since the start of the first agreement, expenses have increased by an average of eight per cent per year; again, this is more than double the rate of inflation. Community pharmacy facts also tell me where the PBS dollar goes. They tell me that the remuneration for the manufacturer/wholesaler before expenses per PBS prescription is fairly significant. It was 7.98 per cent in 1990 and 28.39 per cent in 2004. It is when I look at pharmacy remuneration before expenses as a percentage of average prices and manufacturer/wholesaler remuneration as a percentage of average price that I see a difference. It was 36.4 per cent for pharmacy remuneration in 1990 and 20.7 per cent in 2004. The manufacturing and wholesale remuneration was 63.6 per cent in 1990 and 79.3 per cent in 2004. The community pharmacy share of the PBS has fallen from 36.4 per cent in 1990 to 20.7 per cent in 2004, while the manufacturers and wholesalers have increased their share from 63.6 per cent in 1990 to 79.3 per cent in MAIN COMMITTEE 2004. Rather than community pharmacies getting this huge increase, the facts that they have provided to me indicate that the reverse is true. Some of my pharmacists have put some issues to me in writing, and I will quote some of their comments. One of them says: The campaign of lies and misinformation being spread in the media to discredit Pharmacists and the Pharmacy Guild remind me of the lies before the HIH crash. If they succeed many Pharmacies will close and I will be pushed out onto the age Pension. Another pharmacist writes: It should be stressed that private prescriptions account for only 5% of all prescriptions dispensed & each pharmacy is able to make a business decision as to what mark-up is charged. This is an extremely competitive part of the market and I doubt whether mark-ups at the level claimed by the ACA are being charged. … … … As for the other 95% of prescriptions (those covered by PBS) the mark-up is set at a maximum of 10% & reduces to 4% for higher-priced items. Those are not the sorts of figures that we read in the media coverage on this issue. The pharmacist goes on to say: With regard to the further “additional patient charge” of up to $3.36, this amount is contained in the Third Guild/Government Agreement. The important point to be made with regard to this extra charge is that its effect is to keep prices down for prescriptions under the maximum co-payment. If this charge was to be removed, as the ACA demands, there would be no constraint on pharmacists charging what they like for what in fact are private scripts. That is five per cent of the market, remember, not the 95 per cent. The pharmacist goes on to say: So rather than reducing prices in this area, they are more likely to increase, at the consumers expense. … … … I am sure that this is not what the ACA is wanting. Another of my pharmacists wrote to me and indicated that he has great concerns about any cuts that might be made to pharmacies’ bottom lines. This pharmacist lists some of the questions the pharmacy will have to address about what to cut: Free home deliveries to the elderly? Reducing their independence and ultimately putting greater costs on the healthcare system? Subsidised Webster packing services? Thereby increasing incorrect use of medicines, again putting greater costs on the PBS and/or health-care system? The three trainees it employs? Thereby adding to skill shortages and unemployment benefits costs? The number of pharmacists it employs? ... Our pharmacy acting as a Diabetes Australia sub-agent? This entails extensive counseling and supplying of diabetes management with no remuneration to our pharmacy. There is no remuneration for fulfilling that very important service for diabetes. These are things that we find in community pharmacy every day. The pharmacist also asks whether the pharmacy should cut: MAIN COMMITTEE The stocking of high cost-low use medications to reduce its exposed to out-of-dates? Thereby reducing the accessibility to medications. The number of trading hours? The final hour’s trade of each day is unprofitable but our pharmacy remains open to meet the needs of patients when doctors are running behind schedule. These are issues that pharmacies are confronted with every day. Another of my pharmacists wrote to me: For many years our gross profit has been falling each year as our expenses rise, no matter how well we try to buy our stock. If margins are further reduced you can expect to see pharmacies close (disastrous in one pharmacy towns)it would be a disaster in my one-pharmacy towns, I can tell youand staff dismissed or not replaced and services diminish, eg we lose about $6000.00 per year in providing the Government funded NDSS scheme for diabetics. The increasing cost of the PBS is not due to Pharmacy but the listing of many expensive drugs on the PBS. He goes on to say that the drought is certainly having a negative effect on his business. Another of my pharmacists says: I have growing concerns at the misrepresentation about the Pharmacy Guild (and the practice of community pharmacy by implication) by the media, and other organizations, including the AMA. This seeming smear campaign is unfounded. I can only hope that the misinformation provided by the ACA (ie pharmacies charging 75% mark-up on private prescriptions) is seen for what it truly is, blarney. I have in the recent past worked in many pharmacies across NSW and can say that never have I seen such a high mark-up employed. Another of my pharmacists says: Pharmacists provide many services to the public that we are not reimbursed for such as counselling about medications and self-limiting conditions; blood pressure, glucose and cholesterol level monitoring; Webster-pakswhich, as we all know, are dose administration aidswhich all aid to improve the health of the average Australian and assist with reducing doctor and hospital workloads, thereby reducing costs to medicare (through reduced patient visits for simple conditions). We all recognise that, particularly in rural and regional areas. As I said, I took on the AMA over my inability at times to attract doctors for my communities. That is a very important issue as well. Another pharmacist says: My business and the security of my customers rely on a strong distribution network of PBS medicines supplied by full line wholesalers. Anything that threatens this relationship is irrational ... The wholesaler’s provision of the full range of PBS medicines and the Guild agreement form the basis of the country’s medicine policy. The PBS system would break down if this chain were broken. The costs of providing the infrastructure to deliver and store dangerous or cold chain pharmaceuticals would be prohibitive if this had to be borne totally by the pharmacists themselves. It is not feasible for full line wholesalers to provide PBS medicines to rural and regional NSW as it is. Under this proposal we run the risk of losing this community service once and for all. MAIN COMMITTEE I will read from a letter from a student studying at the very successful pharmacy course at Charles Sturt University. Of course, we all knew that we could not attract pharmacists outside the ‘sandstone curtain’-perhaps one or two of the many pharmacists that were graduating from sandstone universities would be attracted to rural and regional areas. Since Charles Sturt University in Wagga Wagga started offering pharmacy, we have retained about 39 out of the 42 pharmacists that have studied and completed their degrees through Charles Sturt University. We have retained them in rural and regional areas, proving my contention that if you provide opportunities for them to train in rural and regional universities you will retain them in rural and regional areas. This student says: I am writing to you as I am extremely concerned about the current hostile climate toward my future profession. In the past two weeks pharmacists have been the subject of several negative and belligerent press reports regarding our profession and unwarranted barbs from political organisations such as the AMA and Choice Magazine. I am writing this letter to put a human face to the importance of the success of the Guild-Government negotiations over our Fourth Agreement. As a final year pharmacy student at Charles Sturt University I am being taught to be patient-focused and to always put our patients’ health first. What price can you put on this? I ask you: what price can you put on this? Society knows pharmacists are the most easily accessible health professional, and we don’t charge for this service. In a rural setting, pharmacists are often the first point-of-call due to the lack of General Practitioners and other health care professionals. It is a service we are trained for and provide willingly, however if the current push towards deregulation goes ahead, then I fear that the public will suffer dramatically from the changes. The media is currently trashing my future profession with no regard to the consequences. I think that sums up the very good reasons why we must resist at all cost this apparent move to have pharmacies in our supermarkets. We have to establish a healthy respect for pharmaceuticals so that only trained people administer pharmaceuticals. Unless we have that healthy respect from the public then we are going to have an ever-burgeoning blow-out of the PBS. The public need to recognise, as they do when they go to a doctor, that there is a trained professional to deal with their ailments professionally, and we have to continue to pursue public recognition of pharmaceuticals as a specialist dispensing process. If you sit these pharmaceuticals within any area in a supermarket, the respect that you need for pharmaceuticals as something that you use only with the advice of your doctor and qualified and highly trained people will diminish. They will be overused, as many of our products on supermarket shelves are. I will continue to resist any push towards deregulation of pharmacies, particularly community pharmacies. But I also say that I respect and appreciate the minister’s great commitment to ensure that community pharmacies are treated with respect and dignity. brief contribution to this debate. The legislation that we are amending here is to extend the provisions of the pharmacy location rules to operate beyond 30 June to 31 December. This is necessary as there is continuing discussion about the fourth community pharmacy agreement between the industry and government and it is an opportunity for us to reflect upon the state of the pharmacies as part of the health sector. I think that it is important to reflect, as other MAIN COMMITTEE",196,Health Legislation Amendment Australian Community Pharmacy Authority Bill 2005
279,Mr Jenkins (Scullin) (12.11 Pm),"I thank the committee for this opportunity to make ahonourable members in this debate have done, that this should be looked upon as a professional service. One of the things that concerns me from time to time is that, because the PBS is really very much dependent upon the drugs that are listed and the cost of those drugs, we get so tied up that that is the only element considered in the provision of medicines to the Australian public. The endpoint, where a script has been written out by a medico, is of course when that script is dispensed at a local pharmacy. That is a professional act of a person who has undergone great training. Any remuneration that person gets should reflect the professional input. One of the difficulties we have sometimes is that, because it has been intertwined with the cost of the medicines, the cost of pharmaceuticals that are dispensed is often forgotten. When we have a debate about discounting from wholesalers and the like, whilst I understand the importance of that to the economics of the way in which a community pharmacy operates, I hope that it is not overly stressed as being of importance to the way in which we look at the service provided by the pharmacist. It is that service that the Australian public pays for as part of the overall PBS. It is the pharmaceuticals that are important with the value adding of the professional service that is made by a pharmacist herself or himself. That was the reason I wished to intervene. In my discussions with people, along who hold positions within the Pharmacy Guild and with community pharmacists in my electorate, I have been concerned that that may have been ignored. It is exacerbated by what I believe to be an unnecessary furphy in relation to the setting down of the fourth community pharmacy agreement, and that is the supermarkets’ drive to get access to dispensing pharmaceuticals as part of the whole range of goods that they have. I say to that push: it is no use mounting an argument that the actual pharmaceuticals, the medicines, are another good placed on the shelf in a supermarket. That is not the argument. The argument is about what would be required by supermarket chains to ensure that the same professional services provided in community pharmacies are made available. The heads of those supermarkets have to get their heads around that comparison and not the comparison that pharmaceuticals, as a good on the shelf, can be looked upon the same as a can of baked beans or a box of cereal: by comparing margins. That is a nonsense and it undervalues the fine work that pharmacists do in their community. Much has been made in this debate about the free services provided by pharmacists sometimes not being recognised. The overall agreement has to recognise that a lot of these services go unrewarded in a direct sense. They are part of the very effective chain of community pharmacies Australia has developed in the overall health service it provides to the public. It was not my intention to delay the committee in the discussion of this bill, but yet again to take the opportunity to stress the importance of professional input as a factor in the way the government-any government; I am not having a go at the present government in this casecomes to these types of agreements. Anybody who was around during the second agreement-it may have been the first-understands the political pain the Labor Party took at that time. In the only partisan part of my contribution, I note that I have not yet seen the same amount of heat placed under the coalition. But I hope that it is not required, and that this agreement can come through. However, it is important that we recognise that everybody has to take a share in looking closely at the PBS. I understand the difficulties for the government as this portion of our health budget becomes larger. OftenI wish we did much more detailed MAIN COMMITTEE economic analysis of the savings that result from having such a successful PBS. In this argument, that is another aspect that we do not develop enough. In the present discussion about this agreement between the pharmacists and the government it is important that from the outset we recognise the professional input of pharmacists. That should be utmost in the minds of those seeking to ensure that pharmaceuticals are made available at an affordable cost to the Australian public. The contribution of pharmacists should not be undervalued. pm)Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank you for the opportunity to sum up the debate on the Health Legislation Amendment (Australian Community Pharmacy Authority) Bill 2005. On behalf of the Minister for Health and Ageing, Mr Abbott, I thank those members of the House who have made a contribution to the debate. I note the erudite contributions of the member for Hinkler and the member for Riverina on our side of the House and the contributions of the members for Lalor, Shortland and Scullin on the opposition side of the House. This is a very simple bill. As the House would understand, the government is currently in negotiations with the Pharmacy Guild and others with respect to the Fourth Community Pharmacy Agreement. Those negotiations are not yet complete, but the Third Community Pharmacy Agreement runs out on 30 June. In order to facilitate a continuing set of arrangements that benefit pharmacies and consumers and the government beyond 30 June, it is necessary to pass this small technical bill to extend the deadline to 31 December 2005. That is what this bill achieves, and it seeks to do nothing more. I obviously reject the pious amendment of the opposition, which seeks to attach to a technical bill a matter of public policy debate. I commend this technical bill to the House. Question agreed to. Original question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment. Hon. Sir Johannes (Joh) Bjelke-Petersen KCMG Debate resumed from 12 May, on motion by Mr Abbott: That the House take note of the document. resumption of the debate on the condolence motion recognising the extraordinary contribution of Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen to Queensland and Australia, we are discussing the life of one of the most remarkable people in Australian political history. Sir Joh dominated the Queensland scene for two decades and was truly the father of modern Queensland. While his social and political views were proudly conservative, he was aggressively progressive in his approach to life and to the development of Queensland. As Premier, he transformed the state and championed its development. He vigorously supported the establishment of the state’s mining industry with its associated new towns, rail lines, airports and other infrastructure. He believed in tourism and enthusiastically promoted the state and encouraged the development of tourist MAIN COMMITTEE",200,Health Legislation Amendment Australian Community Pharmacy Authority Bill 2005

281,Mr Truss (Wide Bay,"Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (12.20 pm)-Onresorts and attractions. Despite the cries and objections, including some from his coalition colleagues, he abolished death duties and began the sun-belt surge of retirees to Queensland. Sir Joh never spoke with greater passion than when he was reporting on the list of major new projects coming to Queensland. He was famous for measuring the state’s progress by observing the number of cranes working on the Brisbane skyline. He was always prepared to back people with innovative and progressive ideas. In the end, some of those people did not deserve his support, but others brought massive development, new jobs and new technology to Queensland. He realised that a truly progressive state also needed to provide better social services. So he built new schools, universities, hospitals, stadiums and art centres. Sir Joh was constantly the subject of criticism from the capital city media and the academic intelligentsia and to this day many of these people have sought to entrench in history their somewhat jaundiced version of his contribution to Queensland. He achieved his extraordinary political success by appealing beyond the experts direct to the people. He always told it as he saw it, not in eloquently composed orations but in a style that real people understood and appreciated. He connected with ordinary Queenslanders, who believed that he was also fighting for them when he was fighting for Queensland. Under Sir Joh, Queenslanders started to believe in themselves and Queensland became the can-do state. The Brisbane Commonwealth Games were the best ever, and when other states said they could not manage Expo 88 Sir Joh was quick to volunteer Queensland. It was a golden era and created the foundation for future generations of progress and development. Sir Joh believed passionately in Queensland and the rest of the world simply had to take notice. The people of Kingaroy and district were intensely proud of Sir Joh and re-elected him as their member of state parliament, with ever-increasing majorities, for 41 years. To this day, the town of Kingaroy and Sir John are synonymous. Sir Joh was born in New Zealand, but he lived most of his 94 years on the family property Bethany near Kingaroy. His poor beginnings as the son of a Lutheran pastor helped build the character and determination which powered his life. His childhood poliomyelitis left a characteristic limp which seemed to strengthen his resolve to battle hard irrespective of adversity. Sir Joh was also innovative, owning one of the first tractors in the Kingaroy district and then equipping it with lights so that he could work into the night. He built a peanut thrasher and travelled around the farms as the fledgling peanut industry became established in the region. His contract business extended into scrub clearing when he bought an ex-army bulldozer. Sir Joh was a pioneer in aviation, particularly agricultural aviation. He once had a fleet of 16 crop-dusting aircraft. Much of his future success as a member of parliament and as Premier came from his unique capacity to travel the length and breadth of the state as a pilot, landing in many remote country towns that had never previously seen a state leader. He had an enthusiastic campaign to build airstrips across the country. Many country towns and, in particular, Aboriginal settlements in northern parts of Queensland had airstrips built during that eraairstrips which, of course, have been vital to maintaining those communities in the years ahead. He always worked hard and seemingly tirelessly. He gained great strength and confidence in the security of his Christian faith. He taught Sunday school and was a lay preacher, even MAIN COMMITTEE after he became Premier. A conservative also in the church, Sir Joh keenly pursued the church’s mission outreach and took a particular interest in the Aboriginal communities, especially in Northern Queensland where the Lutheran Church had provided pastoral and community care. When Joh met and married Florence they created a wonderful home, but the union also began a formidable political team. Florence provided extraordinary political support and was widely referred to locally as the ‘de facto member for Barambah’, taking care of local needs while Sir Joh was busy on wider tasks. When Florence’s own political career began in the Senate, all of Australia quickly learnt that she was also a wonderfully able political representative on her own account. For me, it was a special privilege to grow up with the Bjelke-Petersen family in the same town, the same community, the same church and the same political party. I had the privilege also of being Mayor of Kingaroy for the last seven years of Sir Joh’s premiership. Even though Sir Joh and Lady Florence were always on the state and national stage, they always remained friends with everyone in their home community. They met with queens and prime ministers but still had time to help in the local church, to work with the P&C and to do what they could to help people in need. Sir Joh always had his critics in the city and other parts of Australia, but he enjoyed enormous local support. The budgets for his state election campaigns were only a few hundred dollars, but he still commanded huge majorities. I have vivid memories of the big crowds who would come to Barambah National Party meetings just to hear Joh talk for hours about the events of the past weeks and months. How many newspaper scoops were missed because the major newspapers were never there? Towards the end of his 19 years as Premier, Sir Joh’s opponents became more intense and frustrated by their inability to succeed in the ballot box. As Peter Beattie said at Sir Joh’s funeral, he had the remarkable distinction of never having been defeated by either the people or the National Party. As so often happens with these terms of office, they end because of the arrangements internally. The politically driven Fitzgerald inquiry strayed way beyond its terms of reference in a determined attempt to discredit Sir Joh but, in the end, came up empty. It is one of the tragedies of Queensland politics that Sir Joh’s career was to end with such bitterness and legal expenses rather than the praise and honour that was really due to him. Even in failing health in later years, Sir Joh never lost his enthusiasm to pursue more major projects in Queensland. In one of my last conversations with Sir Joh he was still arguing the need for a major new airport project between Brisbane and the Gold Coast. I was with Sir Joh only a couple of hours before he died-with his family, hymns playing quietly in the background and his son-in-law, Noel, reading Bible passages. The quiet courage of the family certainly was evident and made its impact on all those who were around. In one of our hymns there is a final sentence which says ‘God grant a Christian death’. This prayer was certainly answered for Sir Joh in his last days. I extend my sympathies to Florence and to his wonderful family. Kingaroy has certainly lost its most famous son. More than a decade after Sir Joh’s retirement, one of the Brisbane newspapers that had always been a critic of him during his lifetime conducted a poll amongst MAIN COMMITTEE its readers and, overwhelmingly, readers chose Sir Joh as the greatest Queenslander of all time. For me Sir Joh was a political hero and a mentor. I admired his courage, his determination, his hard work and his willingness to stand up for what he believed was right, even in the face of derision and ridicule. Despite his physical frailties and hardship, he was strong, committed and successful. He is the greatest ever Queenslander because more than any other he made Queensland great. ister Assisting the Prime Minister) (12.30 pm)-I choose to speak in this condolence motion because I was one of the chooks of the parliamentary press gallery in Queensland, at various times interviewing Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen and at various times being an audience to one of his great orations and the way he fed the chooks. On the first occasion I was trembling and, with enormous trepidation, went into the executive building to the press conference room that Allan Callaghan, his press secretary, had established for people to hear his comments. Plenty of ‘Don’t you worry about that’ were always offered to many of the questions that perhaps many of us would have attempted to answer. I must say that, in honest reflection on Sir Joh, I agree with Minister Truss: he certainly was a great Queenslander by any measure. I had the opportunity from the 20 or more years ago when I first met him to the six or seven years ago when I last spoke with him to confess that I had a love-hate relationship with him. As a member of the Queensland Liberal Party you could imagine nothing else. He thought it was a bit of chuckle that I at least said to himand I mean this most sincerely-that there were some enormous moments of great conduct for which Queensland and Queenslanders owe an enormous debt to Joh, but there were some enormous moments of poor conduct that those around him conspired to deliver and whom he, to his enormous credit as a person who defended people close to him, chose to defend. I do not think the Leader of the Opposition distinguished himself well in his contribution to the condolence motion in the main chamber of the House. He was talking about defining moments. As tempted as I am to say that I hated being caught every Friday afternoon in street marches in Queen Street in Brisbane when you could drive down it, I was so pleased that Sir Joh put an end to them and built the Roma Street forum and said, ‘Go and protest there. We can have free speech. Have your discussion there but don’t shut down the traffic.’ The power dispute in the mid-1980s was an enormously defining moment, when a bit of common sense and some good government ensured that the power stayed on and that those thugs in the leadership of the unions could not hold Queenslanders to ransom. I suspect that his greatest defining moment was the way he helped to bring down the Whitlam governmentMr Brendan O’Connor interjectingMilner instead of Dr Mal Colston. It would be interesting for the member for Gorton to realise that Dr Mal Colston was Labor’s nominee on that occasion. So Sir Joh played a key role in the crisis which ultimately brought down the Whitlam government. Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen had an enormous amount of personal strength and influence. As the member for Wide Bay, Minister Warren Truss, rightly pointed out, he brought enormous simple strength to what he set out to do and you were either with him or agin him. On the failing side of things, he had a blind spot about a public accounts committee-a belief that it was some sort of left-wing conspiracy to be accountable to the people through the parliament.

283,Mr Hardgrave,"and the way he nominated Albert Patrick Field to replace Bertieironic, when you look back on it, that had it been put in place it probably would have prevented so much of what ultimately led to his downfall. Indeed, there is a lot of poor writing of history by those who profess to be journalists in this nation today in the way they are colouring public opinion against a man who achieved so much of the growth that we have in Queensland and indeed, through it, in Australia today. Sir Joh Bjelke Petersen’s personal failings, therefore, would extend to the fact that he trusted a lot of people we could rightly describe as spivs, who gathered themselves around him. The last occasion that I saw him was in 1998, ironically at a Liberal Party fundraiser, I want to put on the public record. He was there helping to raise funds for his friends, the Deen family of Brisbane. The Deen brothers had one of their sons running as a Liberal candidate in the state election that year. Sir Joh assured me that under great tall trees often grow weeds. And there is no doubt that weeds grew under the great tree of Bjelke Petersen. Those same people seem to infect and inhabit the halls of power in Queensland today, and the current state government will no doubt find that the spivs that are their friends will bring them down as well. The people of the mid to late 1980s got a little overexcited, and the 1986 state election, which was a resounding success for Sir Joh and his party, built off boundaries that were very suspect. In his Working the System book, Dr Peter Coaldrake, an academic, noted that I as a journalist had asked a question of the then commissioner in charge of the electoral redistribution that year about the settlement of Wujal Wujal. This was an Aboriginal settlement that was excised completely; a line was drawn around it and it was attached to the seat of Cook because within the legislation was a requirement that Wujal Wujal be attached to the seat of Cook, which voted Labor. This, of course, protected the marginal National Party seat of Barron River. That was the way the system, which he had inherited from his days of watching the Labor state government prior to the change of government in 1957, operated. It was the gerrymander that was refined so well, particularly by the National Party, after the Liberals left government. Sir Joh’s enormous power broke my party’s heart in 1983. It was Sir Joh who actually tore up the coalition agreement between the Liberals and the Nationals by his refusal to accept Terry White as his deputy premier. Yet it was the Liberals who have to this very day in public discussions seemingly copped the blame for the break-up of that coalition, because it was Sir Joh’s ability as a very practical, straight-talking politician to garner so much support behind his argument against so many others. It is important to note that he rightly deserves credit for many things, but it is credit that he should rightly share with others, and I think history should reflect that good partners in government with him, from Sir Thomas Hiley through to Sir Gordon Chalk and Sir William Knox, established so much of the economic strength of Queensland today. The establishment of coal rail freight charges as tax deductible commodities, which saw the Commonwealth essentially subsidising Queensland’s bottom line through those arrangements, was done by people like Tom Hiley, Sir Gordon Chalk and Bill Knox. All three of them are gone and all were great Liberal Party leaders. Between them, they managed to keep things working very well. It is important to know that Sir Joh Bjelke Petersen almost lost his premiership in 1974, the year of the great Labor Party rout, when the Labor Party state team was reduced to just 11. MAIN COMMITTEE Tom Burns, former Deputy Premier, was the one and only person able to lead the party after just two years experience in the parliament. Labor lost their leader that year, 1974-Perc Tucker in Townsville-and Joh almost lost his premiership because a few thousand votes across a handful of seats almost delivered the majority of non-Labor votes to Liberal Party candidates. The refining of the electoral boundaries to favour the National Party ahead of the Liberal Party really did become a work of art after the strength of Sir Gordon Chalk left the scene in l976 and brought Joh into the enormous sense of folklore and prominence of power. It is important to note that, ever since Sir Joh has gone, Queensland has really been without strong leadership on the non-Labor side of politics. That Peter Beattie tries to style himself as some latter-day Joh is part of the sort of farce and irony that still is Queensland politics. Parliament in Queensland is still perverted by the Fitzgerald inquiry. The member for Wide Bay was right to say that it extended its remit to try to inquire into allegations of corruptionallegations of corruption borne out of investigations made by people in the media. I must say that when I was working for both the Seven Network and the ABC I was one of those who did countless stories about levels of police corruption and genuine concerns about failure of proper accountability. I was hanging around in all sorts of places at all sorts of hours of the night with film crews and tape recordings to put to air and to publicise matters that should never have occurred but did. Yet the Fitzgerald inquiry’s only great scalps seem to have been political. They sent a constituent of mine, Leisha Harvey, to jail for hair care cosmetics. They sent Don Lane to jail because he happened to drop in to visit his property after going out and visiting railway workshops in part of south-east Queensland. When you reflect upon it, these were all absolutely bizarre and were in fact a pathetic indictment of how far Fitzgerald went. I and those opposite have criticised the boundaries during the Bjelke-Petersen era. What is even worse is that the boundaries in Queensland today are far more corrupt than they were then. The boundaries today reflect an enormous amount of variation. In my own electorate we have seats that go from 28,000 to about 16,000, all within the metropolitan area of Brisbane. The seats favour the Labor Party, as it stands. The Electoral and Administrative Review Commission, established out of Fitzgerald, established so-called fair boundaries. I know the current Queensland government have an exaggerated number of seats within the Queensland parliament and I do not think Queensland is necessarily very well served at all as a result. The role of parliament, which the Liberals sought to reform all through the 1970s and into the 1980s and over which they paid an enormous political price, was not reformed out of Fitzgerald. I believe the role of parliament was always at the heart of what could have preserved and endorsed the tremendous legacy of Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen. But I do stand in the final equation to praise this man because of the strength of vision and personal determination he brought to the task. I do not think, as a Christian, he would have seen himself as perfect. To be fair, I have offered some observations about what I saw as some of his flaws-but flaws perhaps based on his own strength. The fact that he was used by people about him should not be dismissed as an irrelevant aspect of reflection upon him. We all know and love Lady Bjelke-Petersen, Flo, whom I tremendously admire. I got to know her when I was a staffer working for David MacGibbon in the Senate. Her office was just two doors down. She was always charitable and available, and she was a very strong advocate for Queensland. As I said earlier, the last time. I saw him, Sir Joh and Flo got together MAIN COMMITTEE with Jim Killen, my predecessor in Moreton, to support the Deen family in 1998. And it was right that George Deen, one of the Deen brothers famous for working so closely with Joh, suggested a statue in Kingaroy. It was very appropriate. It just shows you that there was an enormous amount of great regard and loyalty for this man. He cast a giant shadow. He deserves high praise. I suspect that his family are at some sort of peace knowing that we are all in this place reflecting upon that. In my final words in this motion I want to pay an enormous tribute to Flo. Lady BjelkePetersen showed an enormous amount of dignity in the way she conducted herself at a time of enormous personal distress. Her generosity and the way she made herself available to people are very typical of the way the Bjelke-Petersens actually did conduct themselves. I have one last lovely story that I would like to throw in. A film crew from Channel7 in Brisbane came back after having, as they often did many days a week, flown the chopper up to land near Bethany near the house at Kingaroy to talk to Sir Joh, who was always available to the media. Despite his reluctance on accountability through parliament, his accountability through the media was unbelievable. Every journalist had his phone number. He would take the call morning, noonthese days, unfortunately, given the way the world is. It was a different era then. Sir Joh made himself available. The chopper flew up there, landed and the journalists had a chat to him. Flo was there that day-she was not in the Senate at that point-and a brown snake was seen wriggling across the yard and the crew said, ‘There’s a snake!’ Without batting an eyelid, Flo went over and grabbed a shovel that was standing beside the tap outside the house and just killed the snake. I know, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, you would have no problems with that. But at the end of the filming the film crew focused on that particular shovel. It was quite shiny and it had an inscription on it. It said: ‘Presented to Johannes Bjelke-Petersen on the occasion of the turning of the sod-Iwasaki Resort, Yeppoon, Queensland.’ They were very down to earth by every measure. They were very Queensland. We will certainly miss him and lament his passing and we acknowledge the many great things he did for the best state in Australia. Go the Maroons! to some of the statements and then to sit here and listen to my good friend the member for Moreton giving some recollections about Sir Joh. I was only a couple of years old when Sir Joh came to power as the Premier of Queensland. At the time our family was dominated by political debate. My grandfather was a slaughterman for the local butcher shop and he was a staunch union man and a staunch Labor Party supporter of the old school. My uncle was a primary school headmaster-hardly a headmaster at the time as it was a two-teacher school in the place where I grew up. He was in the new style of Labor, in what I suppose you could say was the right wing of the Labor Party. My dad was the local postmaster, JP and also deputy fire chief of the tiny country town of Baralaba where we lived. He was a staunch Queensland National. In my youth we had a lot to do with family. We were either visiting my grandparents in Biloela or visiting my uncle at Fangool, or they were visiting us at Baralaba. Every weekend was dominated by political debate and the pros and cons of the Bjelke-Petersen government. MAIN COMMITTEE",205,Condolences

286,Mr Tollner (Solomon) (12.45 Pm),"It has been fantastic to sit in my office and listenMy dad and mum were both very staunch and strong supporters of Joh. In a lot of ways that had a great influence on me. Certainly I would have to thank Joh Bjelke-Petersen for instilling in me a desire to be involved in the political process. When I grew up in Queensland things were certainly nowhere near as harsh as they were when Sir Joh grew up. But I remember celebrations when a new party line would go out, because my dad was the postmaster and there were big celebrations in the town. A lot of that was driven by the Bjelke-Petersen government. In our area, everywhere we looked there were dams, there were roads, there were power stations, there were coal mines-all of it driven hard by the Premier, Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen. These days we talk about infrastructure shortfalls in Australia and not enough money being put into maintenance of vital infrastructure, but that was certainly not the case in those days with Joh Bjelke-Petersen at the helm. He drove infrastructure. I note that in Queensland there has not been a new dam built since Joh left government. There were other great debates at the time. My good friend the member for Moreton has just mentioned the Iwasaki resort. At the time. I was going to school in Rockhampton and people were talking about Yeppoon as ‘Jappoon’, that we were going to be ‘invaded by the Japanese interests’. It dominated debate all along the coast of Queensland, up to Cairns and further. Certainly where I was ‘Jappoon’ was a commonly used term and ‘we were selling out the country’. When you go there now you see very few Japanese at all. It is a huge tourist resort that is enjoyed by many Australians and many international visitors. I think the Japanese used that particular resort for around 10 to 15 years and then moved on to build other resorts. Now it is a vital piece of tourism infrastructure in the Central Queensland area. When I was going to school-I have never seen anything like it-Joh would visit the town and people would line the streets all the way from the airport, waving and cheering. It was like a major rock star had arrived or the Queen was visiting. It was a really great thing and, inevitably, we would have a holiday from school and all the kids loved it. I left Queensland in 1988 to head for the Northern Territory, where I have lived since. It was heart breaking when Mike Ahern pulled on Sir Joh and toppled him from power. It was the end of an era-an era of unrestrained development, of pro enterprise government, something that we have not seen in Australia since, where there was reward for effort. When I got to the Northern Territory I instantly fell in love with it. Our Chief Minister at the time, Marshall Perron, was from the same mould as Joh Bjelke-Petersen-on a much smaller scale, of course. The Northern Territory was still undeveloped. I looked into the history of Northern Territory governments, and I came across people like Paul Everingham, Steve Hatton, Shane Stone and others, who modelled themselves on the way Joh Bjelke-Peterson operated and tried to build infrastructure: roads, dams, schools and the like. One of the things that attracted me to the Northern Territory was the gung-ho, can-do attitude that was displayed there, the same attitude that was displayed in Queensland throughout my childhood years. I do not want to go on too much, merely to reflect on what it was like growing up in Queensland under the Bjelke-Petersen government. It was the end of an era when Sir Joh left and a very sad time for me when he passed. I would like my comments to be noted. MAIN COMMITTEE",208,Condolences
287,Japanese’ And How Horrible It Was That ‘ Mr Bjelke,"Petersen is giving away all this land to the debate on this condolence motion on the death of Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen. I am very fortunate to represent the electorate of Blair, of which Kingaroy is an important component. The electorate of Blair has many different communities within it. Kingaroy stands out as being unique. One of the things about Kingaroy is the dominant presence of Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen. The town in many ways mirrors his values, his desires and his aspirations. All of those qualities are overwhelmingly positive and good. That really struck home to me when I went to the Kingaroy Show this year, which happened to take place only two days before Sir Joh’s funeral. In marked contrast to the years before, the whole demeanour of people had changed. People were quite shaken by the sudden departure of someone who had been one of the major names of Kingaroy anywhere in the world-‘That is where Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen is from.’ The whole presentation of the town, the whole feeling of the town, was different. We have the former mayor of Kingaroy here. He would know that many of the attitudes in that town come back to the Joh Bjelke-Petersen outlook. Kingaroy is a town with an overwhelmingly strong tradition of family and community support. The way in which the Kingaroy High School community pulls together and works together makes that school one of the greatest high schools we have anywhere in Queensland. brother is involved directly in that school community. I am just saying that it has an outlook that fosters children and fosters a sense of the future and a sense of wanting to go forward that is unparalleled anywhere I have travelled. It is something that people from outside need to look at more closely and use as an example. Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen was a colossus. He remains a colossus. His achievements and his mark on Queensland will exist for always, and people in our state will always use that as the benchmark for the future of our state. Are we going forward? Are we going back? The hallmark will be the achievements that happened in the Joh Bjelke-Petersen era. I have come across Sir Joh at many different times and in many different capacities in my life. One of the first occasions I remember was while I was working as a young reporter at the Rockhampton Morning Bulletin when there was a flood. The previous speaker, the member for Solomon, referred to how Sir Joh came to town and it was like a rock star was visiting. On this particular occasion, the whole of Depot Hill, which was one of the very low-income areas of town, was completely flooded. Sir Joh hopped in this little punt that was pursued by another punt full of all of us reporters, and we chased each other across Depot Hill. Honestly, people in their high-block houses, with water halfway up the blocks, were falling out their windows to say hello to Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen. And he was waving back at them and saying ‘How you going’ and being very positive. He had an attitude and a demeanour that reached out to people and, on occasions like that, it really came across that not only was he good at promoting development within the state and building a stronger and more resilient economy in Queensland but also he was good at that grassroots feeling-the feeling that people had of wanting to reach out to him and his reaching out in response to them. A large part of that comes from his family itself. Lady Flo Bjelke-Petersen is probably one of the most wonderful women you could ever meet. In the time since I have been the member for Blair, I have often spoken to Flo and she has always had a positive word. She has always MAIN COMMITTEE",209,Condolences

290,Mr Cameron Thompson,"The minister would know that, of course, because hisbeen very nice to me. Almost without exception, apart from this year, when I went to the Kingaroy Show, I would see Flo there and we would sit out for the opening of the show and she would always speak to me positively about the direction in which the government was going. Her feeling, much like Sir Joh’s feeling, for the local region was all locked in-the family locking in with the community, locking in with the direction of the state and locking in with the direction of the country as a whole. I have never seen a situation where people had such an all-encompassing kind of view that had the relativities right, where the core building block was the family, and it was very much in evidence in the way Sir Joh approached the world and is very much in evidence today in Kingaroy. And long may it remain so. I also ran across Joh during the SEQEB strike. It was later on in my career as a journalist, and I ran across Sir Joh during that period. The absolutely fearless leadership he imposed at that time was really the thing that captured the imagination of Australia about Sir Joh, because there were elements to that which would have cowed most politicians anywhere. Only Sir Joh had the strength and the foresight to be able to absolutely push through that and then to win the overwhelming support of Queenslanders because of it. During that period, and prior to it, many people in my own party had problems about it and scrapped and what not from time to time with Sir Joh, but his constant direction throughout that period gave Queenslanders a real insight into leadership that will always remain with them. They will forever be looking for that kind of leadership whenever they go to the polls again. It leaves a mark on Queensland and on the people within Queensland. The passing of Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen is the end of an era. It was very sad. The turnout in Kingaroy was such that many thousands of people appeared in the square. You just would not believe you could see such a sight in Kingaroy. The town turned itself inside out with people everywhere, with their hearts on their sleeves, surrounding the Town Hall. I have never seen such a statement of community and such a statement of support. It was a fabulous occasion and, after all the slanging matches over the years about Sir Joh’s legacy, that was really the bottom line: it was his community, it was his town, it was his family, it was his state and it was his country saying what a wonderful achievement it was of that man over all those years and how much we are indebted to him because of it. Debate (on motion by Mr Barresi) adjourned. Main Committee adjourned at 1.01 pm MAIN COMMITTEE Vitamin and Mineral Supplements Guidelines (Question No. 1244) Ms Corcoran asked the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, in writing, on 10 May 2005: (1) Can the Minister confirm that Codex Alimentarius is considering the adoption of new guidelines for Vitamin and Mineral Supplements at its meeting in July 2005 and that the Australian submission on the proposed guidelines includes the statement that Australia will not be bound by the guidelines. (2) Will the Minister explain Australia’s position on the guidelines being considered by Codex. (1) The 28th Session of the Codex Alimentarius Commission, to be held in July 2005, will consider the draft Codex Guidelines for Vitamin and Mineral Supplements for final adoption at Step8 of the Codex procedure.
