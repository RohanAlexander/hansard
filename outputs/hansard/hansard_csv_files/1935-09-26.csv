Beet Sugar Industry. Indicated By Responsible People In Vic","toria, that the Commonwealth is preventing the erection of a beet sugar factory at Warrnainbool in that State? misunderstanding in Victoria regarding the beet sugar industry. The Commonwealth has never pi'etended to have legal power to prevent the expansion of the beet sugar industry. It has, however, a definite responsibility for ensuring export markets for the surplus cane sugar production and for maintaining adequate settlements in the vulnerable northern areas of Queensland, where cane sugar is produced. The Commonwealth necessarily takes an Australian view of this problem as compared with the more parochial view-point of the Assistant Minister for Agriculture in Victoria. If it is right and fair for butter and dried fruit producers to share pro rata the domestic and export markets, .as State parliaments have recognized by legislation, it is equally proper that the beet sugar industry, if it is to expand, should share equally with the cane sugar industry the unprofitable export in order in proceeding to debate a matter in answer to a question without notice. not able to prevent any expansion of beet sugar production in Victoria. I point out, however, that, at a conference of Ministers of Agriculture of the various In addition there is a possibility of strong States, held in June, 1929, the following objection being taken to the closing of resolution was adopted:That, if a State is growing any produce area, and some additional expense may sufficient for Commonwealth consumption, and be involved in improvement of alternative for which it is difficult to find a profitable roads to remove these objections.

PORT ADELAIDE RIFLE RANGE. the alkali industry is shortly to be established at Port Adelaide on a site formerly occupied by the rifle range. Has the Defence Department been able to secure another site for the rifle range ? Under date, 14th January, 1935, I mperial Chemical Industries of Australia and New Zealand Limited, intimated to the Commonwealth that the establishment of the alkali industry in Australia was under consideration and stated that an area of ground in the vicinity of Port Adelaide appeared to be suitable for the purpose of the production of salt. The area includes the Port Adelaide rifle range property and application was made for the rifle range lands to be made available for the purposes of the company. The attitude of the Defence Department to the application was that there would be no objection provided that a new range with a similar equipment of targets and of a like potential capacity as the existing range were provided on a satisfactory site. At the instance of Cabinet the question of an alternative site for a rifle range was investigated by representatives of the Department of the Interior, the Department of Defence and the company, and, after an exhaustive search the only site which would be acceptable was located at Parafield. The estimated cost of acquiring the ground and constructing a rifle range thereon is:£ Acquisition of land, &c. .. 26,400 Erection of buildings, targets, fencing, roads, &c. .. 30,500 56,900 some of the roads which run through the be required from the State or from some",18,Setup

The Supplementary Convention is additional to the Extradition Treaty of 1873 with Austria, which applies to Australia and territories under the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth. It provides that extradition may be granted in respect of any crimes or offences other than those set out in the treaty of 1873, for which according to the laws of both of the High Contracting Parties for the time being in force, the grant may be made.

Bay) [3.34] -Last evening the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) made a scathing attack on the ex-Attorney General( Sir John Latham), and excused himself on .the ground that rumours were current that the Government had committed itself to the appointment of that gentleman to the High Court Bench. The honourable member said he felt called upon to view the record of Sir John Latham during his membership of this Parliament, and then proceeded to make, unfortunate mis-statements of fact and some most discreditable references to Sir John. He did so, he said, to show that Sir John Latham was not a fit and proper person to occupy the High Court bench. He also said that that distinguished gentleman was incapable of efficiently filling such an office. A third reason he gave why Sir John Latham should not he even considered for the position was that he was biased against the workers for certain reasons which were outlined. BecauseI corrected a statement made by the honourable member in the course of his speech, he challenged me to take up the cudgels on behalf of Sir John Latham. I feel that the record of our former colleague, and also his political integrity, are "" permitted "" them to leave the country. so clearly set out in public documents in the various departments of the Public Service that there is no need for me to say anything on this score. The record of Sir John Latham is as a beacon to those who aspire to an honourable career in the service of their country. This is well realized, not only hy members of this House, but also by the community at large. comes to the administration of the law in challenged. one way for the rich and in another way for the poor. Latham has always been held in the highest repute; but his standing in the community was never higher than when he retired voluntarily from both the Ministry and the membership of this Parliament. I believe that Sir John in his career rather than have perpetrated a single injustice to any section of the community. When he retired from his high office, it was for private reasons. I propose to deal in detail with the statements made by the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward). His first charge against the ex-member for Kooyong was that he had taken certain action against the Australian Seamen's Union to bring about the deportation of Messrs. Walsh and Johnson. The honourable member said that Sir John Latham was Attorney-General at the time of those hoped-for deportations, and when I corrected him on that point, he said that I would not be able to deny the truth of certain statements which he then proceeded to make regarding the association of Sir John Latham with the Abrahams case. The honourable member alleged that the Abrahams brothers were allowed to rob the Government, and so the public, of huge sums of money, and were also able to escape nunishment, as well as the payment of their just dues, because of the protection afforded them by the then Attorney-General. He said that although the Abrahams brothers were charged with having defrauded the Government they were first allowed to escape the payment of their taxes; and, secondly, two of the three brothers were allowed to leave Australia. He even added that the Commonwealth Government had actually so. addressing my remarks to sensible people, and I hope to convince them that these statements are quite untrue. Possibly certain ideas of this nature have gained credence because statements similar to that of the honourable member for East tice Starke's opinion?

39,Mr Rosevear,"What about Mr Jusdid not know why the Abrahams brothers were being prosecuted. possible that he did not know; but I propose to explain the reason for the action taken against them. When I contradicted the statement of the honourable member for East Sydney that the two Abrahams brothers were "" permitted "" to leave Australia, he repeated his statement, and I believe that one or two of his colleagues said "" Hear, hear "". The honourable member alleared that although proceedings had already been instituted against these persons, the Government, withdrew the charges. He then went on to accuse Sir John Latham of culpability in this regard, and he made his attack with a good deal of venom. He did not even put in a saving word for .the personal honour and integrity of the absent gentleman whom he was attacking. I am not particularly concerned about the political significance of the remarks of the honourable member, for the Hansard record of various discussions that have occurred on this subject are quite sufficient to demonstrate beyond question the entire honesty of Sir John Latham's actions as Attorney-General. But as a private member of this Parliament, and particularly as a member of a party different from that with which Sir John Latham was associated, I think it fitting that I should say a few words in defence of the personal honour of this gentleman. In concluding his attack, the honourable member for East Sydney saidIf the honourable member for Wide Bay wishes to take up the cudgels on behalf of Sir John Latham let him explain to the community why these persons were granted immunity from prosecution. Following upon the discussion last evening, I made a careful examination of the records relating to this case. The facts are that the firm of Abrahams brothers was somewhat notorious, and was long under suspicion of cheating the revenue by evading taxation. The Government and the Taxation Department were well aware of the situation, and did everything possible to keep the firm's affairs under keen scrutiny. Proof of its wrong-doing was, however, hard to find. But the investigations of the officials of the Taxation Department were persevered with, and were carried back as far as 1918, and at last they brought good results. It was necessary to examine the financial affairs of 28 separate individuals, seven companies and twelve partnerships in an endeavour to estimate the exact amount of taxation which the Abrahams brothers should pay. Even then no entirely satisfactory evidence was obtained upon which the law could be set in motion. The Crimes Act passed in 1926, offered assistance by providing power for the issue of search warrants in stich eases. The Attorney-General, through the Taxation Department, exercised this new power, and caused a forced search to be made of eight houses and offices occupied by the offending parties and their agents. Where force was necessary to make a thorough search, it was used by the authority of the Attorney General, who considered that the most extreme steps were justified in the public interest. The evidence obtained by means of these searches established definitely that there had been fraud in understating the incomes of these persons, and that there had also been a serious evasion of taxation. The next step was to expose and punish the offenders, vindicate the law, and secure the amount of money owing to the Commonwealth. The direct prosecution of the offenders was rendered difficult, and all the circumstances of the case were complicated by reason of the fact that the two principals had left Australia before the raid was made on their various offices. The contention of the honourable member for East Sydney that there was a criminal prosecution was not true. under the Income Tax Assessment Act. the Abrahams brothers left Australia before the raid was made on their offices. The Government made no mistake in dealing with the guilty persons. Penalties were imposed totalling £266,000 on a tax evasion proved at about £90,000, the total amount due by the defaulting taxpayers thus being about £354,000. than that was owing. get all the facts by degrees, and the recital of them will carry a complete refutation of the charges made by the",22,Supply Bill No 2 1935 36

The Abrahams brothers were believed to be liable to further taxation and penalties, covering a period as far back as 1918, but the lapse of time made it hard to obtain proof of the allegations. Ultimately, an agreement was reached with-certain representatives of the brothers mation ? that an amount of £500,000, representing penalties, taxes that had been evaded, and disputed assessments should be paid into the Treasury. agreement not to prosecute these persons for conspiracy. The two principals and seven other defendants were publicly exposed by court proceedings; but any attempt to reach the Abrahams brothers themselves by way of criminal prosecution, sueh as that referred to by the honorpoor. able member for East Sydney, would have involved great delay and enormous expense, and the result would have been uncertain. If that course had been followed, all other proceedings for the recovery of the money due must have been held in abeyance, and the whole matter might have been delayed for years. an extradition warrant ? other action than that taken by the then Attorney-General on behalf of the Government would probably have been ineffective. As it was, the action taken resulted in a windfall of £500,000 to the Commonwealth Treasury. launched criminal prosecutions would have involved the country in enormous and futile legal expenses. expenses is not considered when members of the working class are involved. Latham undoubtedly acted in the very best interests of the whole community. I remind honourable gentlemen, further, that he did not act entirely on his own initiative in this matter, but had the assistance of the Commonwealth Solicitor-General, the Crown Solicitor, and also five other eminent counsel-Si r Edward Mitchell, K . C , Mr Owen Dixon, K . C , Mr Dixon Hoarder, Mr Robertson, and Mr Gorman. This array of legal talent, having considered all the circumstances of the case, came to the conclusion that the best interests of the country would be served by the acceptance of £500,000 from the Abrahams brothers. A criminal prosecution was not launched because the principals could not be located. honourable member obtain all this inforrecords of the various decisions at the time when the action was taken. The There was and is no honourable member said that Sir John Latham, as Attorney-General, allowed the Abrahams brothers to leave the country, and then he sought to convey the false impression that, so far as Sir John Latham was concerned, there was one law for the rich and another for the I remind honourable members that everything possible was done to prevent the Abrahams brothers from leaving Australia. Instructions were issued to passport officers, and to the various branches of the Customs Department, that on no account were these men to be allowed to leave the country. That they eventually did succeed in leaving was due, not to the action or desire of the Attorney-General, but to the venality of a. public servant who was, no doubt, corrupted by the Abrahams brothers. poor unfortunate public servants. To have merely stating what the public servant in question himself admitted. A Customs officer named Gabriel admitted that he had assisted Emmanuel Abrahams on to a vessel on the 1st February, 1928, and that he also saw Emmanuel's brother on board a vessel on the 7th December. This public servant was an inspection officer of the Customs Department, whose special duty it was to watch the interests of the Commonwealth, and, in this instance, to safeguard the interests of the Attorney-General's Department and of the Treasury. He was charged with improper conduct and suspended; he appealed, but his appeal was dismissed, and he was discharged from the service. Therefore, it cannot justly be said that Sir John Latham was in any degree responsible for the escape of those men, and he did what was undoubtedly the best thing in the interests of the Commonwealth by accepting, on behalf of the",23,Supply Bill No 2 1935 36

These facts give a very different impression of the case from that which the honourable member for East Sydney sought to convey. member has exhausted his time. honourable member objects I shall take my second period. The honourable member made a further attempt to besmirch the reputation of Sir John Latham by misrepresenting the facts in connection with the John Brown case. He tried to convey the impression that Sir John Latham, in authorizing the withdrawal of the prosecution against John Brown, was again administering the law for the rich in a way different from that in which it was administered for the poor. Honourable members must have very short memories if they do not recall the history of the John Brown case. Sir John Latham, not being satisfied that there was a strong case against John Brown, authorized the Crown Law authorities' to obtain outside legal opinion on the question. That opinion was to the effect that there was a prima facie case against John Brown, and a prosecution was authorized. sentatives of the unions interviewed the Prime Minister( Mr Bruce) in Sydney, and asked him to arrange a conference with the owners because they wished to put forward a proposition for the taking over of the mines by the men. Mr chance of success of this conference; did he Bruce conveyed to the Attorney-General by telephone the desire of the union representatives, and pointed out that the only way in which a conference could he arranged was to withdraw the prosecution. the suggestion, as he would probably have done if he were in favour of one law for the rich and another for the poor. This is what he stated in the course of a speech in this Parliament describing the negotiations:No objection can be taken to my submission of tlie matter to counsel for their determination as to whether there was a prima facie case on tlie evidence, nor to my acceptance of their recommendation in favour of a prosecution, in view of that fact that, in their opinion, there was a prima facie case. In a matter in which political considerations are more or less involved, it is wise for the Attorney-General to obtain absolutely independent external advice. Eventually a summons was issued, and! the subsequent events are described by Sir John Latham as follows:Some days elapsed, and the Prime Minister, who was in Sydney, communicated by telephone with me in Victoria. He informed me that a new position had arisen in regard to the coal situation. It is necessary to understand that at this time it appeared that a l l the resources of conference had been exhausted, that there was no chance of getting any f u r ther by conference, or even of holding a conference. It was in such circumstances t h a t the prosecution was instituted. In the course of this telephone conversation, the Prime Minister told me that the miners had a proposal which they said would probably commend itself to the owners. It was something entirely new, and they were actually talkin g of getting the mines going by consent in the following week. The proposal of the miners depended upon certain estimates as to costsand profits of the mines, and the imion representatives wanted to have another conference with the owners. The Prime Minister told me something of the nature of the proposal, and it depended almost entirely upon financial' considerations. Then he went on to say t h a t the difficulty was that the prosecution against John Brown was pending, and that the owner© would not go into conference with a prosecution hanging over their heads, since the essent i a l thing in that prosecution was the profits which the mines were making. He asked me for my opinion of the situation. I reThen the repreplied that very special circumstances would 1 be required to j u st i fy the withdrawal of a. prosecution when once it had been instituted.. I also said that there were obvious political difficulties in the way, because the motives of the Government would be in many quarters-' misunderstood, and in many quarters misrepresented. I asked him what was the real think that there was any real chance of themines starting work again if the conferencewas held. . . . I was in the country at the time,, and was specially sent for to the telephoneand spoke from my place in the country.

I had already discussed with him some of the difhcuties in the way of a successful prosecution, and it seemed to us that the success of the prosecution was doubtful. I expressed the view that, having regard to the thousands of men out of work, and the detrimental effect of the hold-up of industry, it would be difficult to justify preventgive up his profession in order to accept ing the holding of the conference . . . member's time has expired. This discussion appears to be revolving round the subject-matter raised last evening by the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr ""Ward) when he dealt with the probable appointment of Sir John Latham to the High Court Bench. It is high time that the Government gave this House some indication as to what its intentions are with respect to this matter. The present is the only opportunity that honourable members have to discuss this appointment, because immediately Sir John Latham, or any one else, is appointed to the High Court Bench, the forms of this House will prevent any discussion on the qualifications of the person so appointed. There is not the slightest doubt that, week by week, during the last eighteen months, the anti-Labour press has been canvassing the appointment of Sir John Latham to the High Court. During that period, as may be seen from a study of Hansard, on every occasion on which this matter was raised by honourable members on this side of the House following press reports relating to it, we were told that it was not the intention of the Government to make such an appointment; and, as a matter of fact, Sir John Latham, as the then Attorney-General, himself indignantly denied that the Government had any intention to appoint him to the High Court. Prior to the last election he retired from politics after having stated in this House that he intended to do so in the interests of his professional practice because politics were taking up too much of his time. He added that he intended to devote the whole of his time to the practice of his profession at the bar. But now we find very definite statements being made that it is the intention of this Government not only to appoint him to the High Court Bench, but also to make him Chief Justice of that tribunal. Sir John Latham who ostensibly retired from politics in order that he might devote the whole of his time to the practice of his profession, for which reason he abandoned his political activities, is apparently prepared to this appointment! said so. so, and many people associated with this Government are saying the same thing. is saying that ? Treasurer ( Mr Casey) so desires, he will have an opportunity to tell this House definitely that it is not the intention of the Government to appoint Sir John Latham to the High Court. Distinct proof has been forthcoming to reveal unhealthy and unsavoury intrigues directed towards securing the resignation of the present Chief Justice, and, according to press reports, this end has at last been achieved. The press, which as I said before, had been canvassing this appointment for Sir John Latham during the last eighteen months, has now selected that gentleman as Sir Gavan Duffy's successor. Despite the hedging of the Assistant Treasurer on this matter, I claim that it is the definite intention of the Government to appoint Sir John Latham a Chief Justice to the High Court of Australia, and I challenge him and every other Minister in the present Cabinet to deny that emphatically. The Assistant Treasurer and the honourable member for Wide Bay( Mr Bernard Corser) appear to be indignant because this matter has been referred to, and they have sought to make it a personal issue. They claim that because of service in this House, Sir John Latham's name should not be mentioned at all in connection with this matter and that his capabilities for the position which he now seeks to fill should not be questioned. According to them also, the fact that Sir John Latham has had a lifelong association with politics and naturally must be biased politically, should not he questioned. I remind honourable gentlemen who take up such an attitude that Sir John Latham himself, at one time, very scathingly attacked the",25,Supply Bill No 2 1935 36

62,Mr Rosevear,"If the Assistantappointments of Mr Justices Evatt and McXiernan to the High Court ou the ground that they were biased politically, if to-day it is wrong for the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) to attack an impending appointment, then it was wrong for Sir John Latham previously to attack those appointments. Apparently right or wrong in such mutters depends upon who are the a tracker*, and who are the attacked. The honourable member for East Sydney attacked this proposed appointment on four grounds, the first of which is the political associations formed by Sir John Latham. Nobody can question the fact that Sir John Latham must he biased politically; I give him every credit seemed to be based upon a conspiracy, for loyalty to his particular party. Neither can any honourable member question the further charge made by the honourable member for East Sydney, that Sir John Latham, during his period of service in this chamber, used his parliamentary privileges to make damaging references to the Industrial Workers of the World, men whoso liberty had been at stake owing to perjured evidence. Yet, ' it is such a man this Government proposes to appoint to the highest position on the highest legal trisurrounded the departure of the Abrahams bunal in llio land, although he so far forgot the first principles of British jusnow submitting is not one expressed by tice, that he used his privileges in this House, when the liberty of men was at stake, to make prejudicial references to them regarding certain grave charges with which they had been confronted. Irrespective of his party associations, any man who would take up such an attitude is not a fit and proper person to be Chief Justice of Australia. The next point raised by the honourable member for East Sydney dealt with the administrative decisions made by Sir John Latham when he was Attorney General in the United Australia party Government. spoke of the corrupt settlement of the Abrahams brothers' case. Although the Abrahams brothers were self-confessed criminals, and despite the fact that a special guard was kept over them, and that the Government of the day had amassed a great quantity of evidence against them, they were able to leave this country. Defenders of Sir John Mr Jtoseeenr. Latham say that these men could not be brought back to this country, and that a case could not be made out against then, because only one of them remained here. If that be the truth, I ask what has become of the effectiveness of our extradition laws, which anti-Labour governments in this Parliament have only too readily invoked in political cases when it suited its ends. The Government of the day could have invoked these laws to deal with the Abrahams brothers. Consequently the excuse that they could not be brought back to Australia and charged, will not hold water. tice _ Starke said that the whole case and asked why Abrahams brothers had not. been prosecuted for conspiracy under the Crimes Act which, I remind honourable members, Sir John Latham was so fond of amending in order to provide a dragnet law that would enmesh all working class organizations. There is no doubt that, when the Crimes Act was invoked against any working class organization, none of the accused was given any chance to leave this country in circumstances similar to those which brothers. The view of the case I am any Labour party supporter, or by any person who can be accused of being biased politically; nor is it the opinion of the honourable member for East Sydney, who cited it. during his speech last night. It is the opinion of Mr Justice Starke, who saidThe whole case seems to he based upon conspiracy. Why they w i ll not prosecute for conspiracy I should like to know. The honourable member for Wide Bay elaborated on the preparations which were made to prosecute the charge against Abrahams brothers. Despite The honourable member those preparations, the Abrahams brothers escaped. I remind the honourable member for Wide Ray that if, as he contends, it is wrong for the honourable member for East Sydney to express the opinions he has expressed on this matter, it must also be wrong for Mr Justice Starke to have commented as he did on this case. Conversely, if Mr Justice Starke was right in making his comments.",26,Supply Bill No 2 1935 36
63,When Dealing With This Case Mr Jus,"then the honourable member for East Sydney must be right * in his criticism of Sir John Latham's inactivity in this case. The honourable member for East Sydney also criticized Sir John Latham's action when Attorney-General in withdrawing tlie prosecution against the coal-owner, the late Mr John Brown. criticism is supported, not only by persons associated with the Labour party, but also by the opinion expressed at the time by the late honourable member for Fawkner, Mr Maxwell. I have on many occasions heard the late honourable member defending the judiciary and the legal profession in this chamber, and no one in this Blouse can deny that he was transparently honest, in such criticism, or that he would fail to express a candid opinion of 'a member of this Parliament, whether that member was his friend or foe. In a letter which appeared Maxwell saidTim announcement by the Prime Minister, reported yesterday, that in Olderto promote peace in -the coal industry proceedings against John Brown had been withdrawn comes. I have no hesitation in saying, as a painful shock case launched by the then Attorneyto every member of the Ministry. In my opinion, respect of persons by those charged with tlie duty of enforcing the law is a much greater menace to the stability of the Commonwealth than open defiance of the law by those who object to it . As a Nationalist member of Parliament and as a lover of even-handed justice. I desire to dissociate myself from and to publicly record my protest against the action of the Ministry in abandoning proceedings :i'iaiiist Mr John Brown, which had been instituted by the Attorney-General( Mr said that one of the most remarkable Latham) on grounds which, in his opinion, warranted a prosecution. Such, an opinion expressed by such a man must be valued by honourable members, yet the honourable member for Wide Bay contradicts the contention advanced from this side of the House, that the Government was not justified in withdrawing this prosecution against the late Mr John Brown. The honourable member for East Sydney said that the Government's policy was based on one law for the rich and one for the poor. He contrasted the withdrawal of the prosecution against John Brown with the treatment meted out to the Timber Workers Union and its officials, including the honourable member ""for Melbourne Ports( Mr Holloway), who were associated with that particular lockout. On that occasion, the only solace afforded to the honourable member for Melbourne Ports by the Government was a sympathetic reference by Mr Bruce about "" Poor old Holloway "". But the £.1,000 fine imposed on the union had to be paid. On the evidence of honourable Such members opposite, John Brown was a wealthy law-breaker, but was allowed to go scot-free. The honourable member for East Sydney then dealt' with the question of the prosecution of Jacob Johnson and showed clearly that after that prosecution had taken place the Labour movement in New South Wales became possessed of sworn affidavits by ex-Crown witnesses that they had committed perjury. member's time has expired. able member objecting, I shall take my second term. These sworn declarations by certain important Crown witnesses indicated that they were prepared to swear that in the original General( Sir John Latham) they had given periured evidence. Despite the presc"" -iion of all this material in which Crown witnesses recanted their couri evidence and admitted perjury, the Attorney-General refused to permit an inquiry to be held into the circumstances surrounding that corrupt evidence. Further, the honourable member for East Sydneyfeatures of the whole case was that between the time when these men were prosecuted and the demand by the Labour movement for an inquiry, certain vital papers connected with the case disappeared from the files of the Attorney General's Department. Further evidence of the reactionary bias of Sir John Latham is to be found in his abolition of trial by jury in the Federal Capital Territory. This gentleman, who, during a lifetime of service in various interests settling the differences of employers and employees in the courts of Victoria, and, as Attorney-General of the Commonwealth, prosecuting those who'violated the law, was himself responsible for the violation of a decision of",27,Supply Bill No 2 1935 36

67,Mr Rosevear,"The point I am sentence is an abuse of the process oi theby Sir John Latham, but also criticizing his method of presenting the case against the organizations and classing it as an abuse of the processes of the court. I think the honourable member for East Sydney, in his summing up of the situation, was fully justified from every point of view. He was justified in raising a question which has been dragged through the press of this country for the last eighteen months. Nothing lowers the prestige of the highest legal tribunal in Australia more than the knowledge that appointments to the Bench have been made a matter of political intrigue and political patronage. Nothing brings the High Court more into contempt than public belief that appointments made to it are not above suspicion so far as politiamount of 20s. a week. I do not know cal and public bias is concerned. I could not understand how the Assistant Treasurer could declare last night that the statements of the honourable member for East Sydney were not worthy of a reply. The charge definitely called for a reply. During the last eighteen months the possibility of Sir John Latham's political appointment to the High Court has been freely mentioned in the press. The Government has not taken the people into its confidence in regard to this matter, and the honourable member for East Sydney was thoroughly justified in taking up the attitude he did last night in comparing Sir John Latham's treatment of working-class organizations with that he meted out to wealthy individuals Avho fell foul of the law. Any defence we have heard of his actions up to date has been paltry and merely eyewash. The Assistant Treasurer can, if he thinks fit, justify the appointment. He can set the public mind at rest by declaring that the suggested appointment is right or wrong. Nothing will do more to damage the prestige of the High Court in the eyes of the public and create more disrespect for this institution than the manner in which intrigue has been indulged in for the purpose of displacing the present Chief justice and replacing him hy a political puppet such as Sir John Latham, who because of his political bias, and his sponas an instruction to the Government to soring of one law for the rich and one for the poor, because he amended the Crimes Act with a view to suppressing the working-class organizations, and because of his general attitude of political bias in this chamber, is not a fit and proper person to be elevated to the high office of Chief Justice of the High Court. I believe that an action against certain working-class organizations in this country will eventually find its way to the High Court. That, possibly, is one of the reasons why Sir John Lathamis being promoted , to the position of Chief Justice, in order to override the opinions of others who might take a more unbiassed view of the case. I support the amendment moved by the Acting Leader of the"" Opposition with regard to the restoration of invalid and old-age pensions to the former what justification the Government can plead for not having acceded to this request long ago. When the emergency legislation was introduced in 1931, not only every member of the Labour party who supported it, but also practically every other honourable member sitting behind the Government to-day pledged himself that at the earliest possible moment when the financial position of the country warranted it the cuts in the invalid and old-age pensions would be withdrawn. member's time has expired. Mr E. J. HARRISON (Wentworth) [4.35] I regret the turn that this debate has taken. Instead of addressing themselves to what is obviously a very important amendment, honourable members opposite have been content to indulge in persdnalities. Repeatedly, they have urged the necessity for the restoration of the old-age pension to £1 a week and the reduction of the hours of labour. [Quorum formed.] The opportunity is now presented to them to discuss those very matters, yet they prefer to make an attack upon a gentleman who has rendered signal service to this country, and would grace the High Court Bench.

68,The Chairman,"The honorablehours of labour. It is not his intention that the Arbitration Court shall be approached by either employers or employees, with a view to its determining the practicability of instituting a shorter working week or of ascertaining whether such a change would be in the best interests of industry. [Quorum formed.] The honourable gentleman would have the Government, compulsorily reduce hours. He must know that such action would be ultra vires the Constitution. The Commonwealth alone may not make that change, hut it could do so in conjunction with the States. In common with other honourable members, I regard this subject as one of the first magnitude. The gradual improvement of labour-saving machinery has been responsible for unomployment, not only in Australia, but also in every other country, which cannot be counteracted by any other means than a shortening of working hours. But it is not sufficient to say that hours shall energies became devoted entirely to the be shortened by compulsory action; there must be a thorough examination of every aspect of the matter. Office, in which Australia is represented, held such an inquiry. Mr E. J. HARRISON -Some persons who consider that the reduction of working hours is essential are able to advance arguments which apparently brook no denial. There is, however, another school of thought which considers that such a step would be detrimental if applied in any one country, and not made general internationally. Those who have studied the matter know that the question of technological unemployment has to be viewed from many angles. Opposition pointed TO one industry that would seem to give force to his argument-the Extraordinary figures can be quoted in regard to that particular industry. wonder whether the honourable gentleman has considered the employment which was brought about by the change-over from the manual to the semi-automatic production of bottles ? bottle-making industry. MrE -T. HARRISON -If that is so, the honourable gentleman has been incorrectly reported. In the beginning, bottles were hand blown, but later the demand for the production of a cheaper article in larger quantities resulted in the production of semi-automatic machinery, and that opened up a large field of labour. The operations of allied industries also were given a great fillip. Instead of retarding industry, the production of semiautomatic machinery created a definite demand for labour. The printing industry had a similar experience. Those who can recall the hand-setting of type will realise the advantages of the linotype machine. The cheapening of the printed word increased production and brought about a considerable improvement in the labour market. There was also a very marked effect educationally. Wider avenues were opened up to those who sought to enlarge their educational attain ments. There was also brought into being an immense army of persons whose teaching of arts and crafts. Every advance leads to the opening up of more avenues for employment. The motor car and rayon industries, with their countless subsidiaries, provide an immense amount of employment. Arising out of the extraordinary increase in the volume of employment of technicians and the like, brought about by the so-called labour-saving machinery, there was imposed a higher standard of living, which demanded certain services. Those services were provided, and there has been a definite change-over from technical employment to employment in the services themselves. Notwithstanding the change that has been brought about by the developments following the increased mechanization of The Acting Leader of thy industry, there is still a definite lag in employment. bottle-making industry.

International action affecting only the members of the League of Nations would undoubtedly lead to an accentuation of the disorders due to economic nationalism from which we are now suffering. A further concentration of production within the borders of specific countries must mean the raising of tariff barriers, and this would lead to misunderstanding and dispute. I contend, therefore, that international action to reduce the working week would be dangerous unless it were accompanied by similar action to standardize wages. Costs are determined by wages, as well as by working hours; and the standard of living, the population factor and economic conditions generally have a. great deal improved. Two years ago taxation remisto do with the fixation of wages in various sions to the extent of £9,000,000 were countries I have already said that arbitrary action by this Parliament to attempt to force industry to adopt a shorter working week would be ultra vires the Constitution. It would also be dangerous to a competitive country like Australia, in that it would jeopardize our standard of living and increase the tendency to unhealthy economic nationalism. I feel that we must give consideration to the definite lag in unemployment figures, not only in respect of pre-depression days, but more importantly in consequence of the introduction of iabour-saving machinery. Highly desirable as the reliefof unemployment is at the moment, before anything like a complete absorption of labour can be assured, a great deal -more consideration must be given to the whole circumstances of industry than is possible in a debate of this description. A better understanding must be arrived at between the nations of the world before a shortenbe satisfied for the remainder of theiring of the working week can he really successful. In the absence of this desirhave heard a good deal lately about theable state of affairs, a shortening of the working week would undoubtedly adversely affect both the primary and secondary industries of this country. support the amendment of the Acting Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Forde). I was associated with the Government which introduced the first financial emermembers, and in 1933 the statistics obgency legislation into this Parliament, and I remind honourable members that that serious step was accompanied by a promise, endorsed by the party then sitting in opposition, that, immediately the budgetary conditions of this country improved, steps would be taken to restore our pensioners to their former standards, and to help, to the greatest possible extent, people who were without any regular work or income. The Opposition party of that day is the Government party of to-day; but, although the budgetary position has improved to such an extent that large refunds and remissions of taxation have been made to wealthy interests, the lot of our pensioners and the workpeople of this country generally, and particularly of the unemployed, has not been granted to wealthy citizens of Australia ; but very little was done at that time to provide employment for the hundreds of thousands of our people who were out of work. The rate of the invalid and old age pension should he immediately restored to £1 a week, and the Government should at once take steps to put into operation a scheme of national insurance against invalidity, old-age and unemployment. I now come to a consideration of the problem of unemployment. The honourable member for ""Wentworth ( Mr E. J. Harrison) has just delivered a speech, thekeynote of which was despair. According to that honourable gentleman there is very little hope for any of the aged or young unemployed people of this community ever' obtaining work, while the outlook for our young men and women is also dark and gloomy. It appears to the honourable member that thousands of our citizens must make up their minds to lives with the dole or sustenance. Wereturn of prosperity and the necessity for developing the great natural resources of this country, but very few constructiveproposals have been advanced by the Government or its supporters. Thecensus of 1933 undoubtedly revealed a deplorable state of affairs in AustraliaOnly 58 per cent, of the trade unions in this country register their unemployed tained from this source showed that",31,Supply Bill No 2 1935 36
71,Mr Riordan (Kennedy) [5.0],"I106,000 people were out of work. We were astounded, therefore, to find that, according to the census of that year, 480,000 were unemployed, and an additional 27,000 were either on the dole or receiving sustenance, making 507,000 people of sixteen years of age and over who could he said to be without permanent employment. Even taking the Statistician's present figure of 77,000 unemployed, and adding the difference revealed between the 1933 figures of the statistician, and the census officer, we find men should without delay pass legislathat 366,000 people are unemployed in this country. That is alarming. people of Australia are capable of producing great wealth, and there is much room here for development. It has been said times .out of number that we cannot possibly hold this country unless we people it. I am therefore entitled to ask what the Government proposes to do to cope with the grave situation that faces it? The Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) has promised to appoint a royal commission to inquire into unemployment, but that is tantamount to shelving the problem. We have asked that the working week should be reduced in order that additional employment may be provided; but the honourable member for Wentworth considers that this is impracticable. That story has been told right through the ages, yet we have had successive reductions of working hours from 56 to 48, from 48 to 44, and, in some cases, to 40. In the State of Queensland the -statutory working week is now 44 hours, and it is the only Statei n the Commonwealth, and the only place in the world, where that obtains. Yet Queensland is the most prosperous State in the Commonwealth, and has the least unemployment. More than half the employees in -Queensland are working only 40 hours a week, and no one can say that industry in that State is bankrupt as a result. In 1929, an administration holding the same political views as the present Commonwealth Government was returned to power in Queensland. repealed the legislation providing for a 44-hour working week, and re-introduced the 48-hour week. result, thousands of government employees were thrown out of work, business languished, and there was general distress throughout the community. The percentage of unemployment rose to 28 per cent. Then, in 1932, the Labour party regained office, and restored to the statute book the legislation providing for a 44hour week. Before very long those who had been displaced from employment were again in work. It is a fact that the volume of unemployment is greater in those States where the working week is 48 hours, than in Queensland where it is only 44 hours. The Commonwealth Parliation fixing the statutory working week at The 44 hours or even at 40 hours. I know that some doubt exists as to whether the Commonwealth has power to pass such legislation; but, if it were to do so, I do not think that any State government would challenge its action. Another means by which we might attempt to solve the unemployment problem, is by raising the school age from fourteen years to sixteen years. During the period from fourteen to sixteen years boys could attend secondary schools and study such subjects as farming, trades, &c, so that they would be equipped to earn their living when they went out into the world to seek employment. At the present time, thousands of boys leave school every year at fourteen years of age, are thrown on the employment market, and have very little chance of ever finding anything to do. In addition, it would be advisable to fix a retiring age of 60 years. That, however, would involve the making of some provision for the support of those who retired at that age. The Government, instead of expending its surplus revenue on the appointment of royal commissions, should devote it to the institution of a scheme whereby a man, upon attaining the age of 60 years, would be able to apply, not for an old age pension, but for superannuation, which would be his by right and not by charity. I had hoped that the Government would institute a more extensive public works It immediately policy. The Assistant Treasurer ( Mr Casey) has told us that an amount of £8,000,000 is to be made available for As an immediate the prosecution of public works; but of this, I think, £3,000,000 has been earmarked for debt-adjustment purposes. That leaves only £5,000,000, which is not luucli more than is usually allocated for public works. There is a considerable accumulation of work which might be undertaken immediately. For instance, many long-standing applications for telephone extensions await attention, but there seems little prospect that anything will be done. If , in the opinion of the Postal Department, a service is not likely to pay, those applying for it are asked to guarantee the cost of its provision. Recently, the people of Longreach asked for a telephone service between that place and Stonehenge. Unfortunately, the new service, if provided, would not serve a great many people, although it would serve practically as many as can be settled in the area. Moreover, they are graziers who produce wool, the most valuable commodity that Australia has for export. The department, however, asks that the people themselves shall pay for the cost of constructing the line. A person who lives in the city area can have a telephone installed for £2, after which he pays ouly for his calls, which amount usually to not more than £4 or £5 a year; but the man in the out-back who wants a telephone installed, is compelled to pay so much a pole for the construction of the line, then rent for the service and a call fee as well. That is a reversion to the old system of guaranteed railways, which the Labour party abolished years asro. It is high iime that f he guaranteed telephone service was also abolished. There is little prospect of inducing men to settle in the out-back unless reasonable communications are provided. It should at least be made possible for settlers to summon medical assistance when it is required.

Mr Rinrthiv. Unless something of the kind is done, such areas will continue to be sparselj populated for a long time to come. desire to associate myself in all sincerity with the sentiments expressed by the Acting Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Forde) in moving his amendment, in so far as it refers to his desire to restore old-age and invalid pensions to £1 a week. He also proposes that the working week be shortened as a means of providing employment for those who are out of work. However, I point this out: Such a motion, coming from the Acting Leader of the Opposition, whom we may reasonably expect to possess a proper sense of responsibility, should be followed by some adequate explanation of the means by which the necessary funds are to be obtained. The honourable member was himself associated with the Government which was faced with the unpleasant duty of reducing old-age and in\ olid pensions. I join with him and with every other honourable member in regrpffiug the circumstances which caused that Government to take that action. He should recollect that the government of that time was forced to make the reduction because of the financial exigencie? of the moment. The budget which was introduced the other day projects only n very small surplus for this financial year. Therefore, we may reasonably expect the Acting Leader of the Opposition to inform us as to how the extra revenue of £1,420,000 necessary to restore pensions, is to be obtained. I am surp. that he did not wish the committee to regard his speech merely as so much propaganda, but that he wished to be taken seriously. That being so, since he",33,Supply Bill No 2 1935 36
72,Mr Mcewen (Echuca) [5.15],"Imember, found it inevitable to place added costs and taxes upon the basic foodstuffs and clothing of .the people. And in the absence of any constructive suggestion from honourable members opposite, we must assume that the mover of the amendment desires the Government to secure revenue from a similar source in order to provide sufficient funds to enable it to restore the pension to the full rate of £1 per week. With every other honourable member in this chamber I should like to see that restoration made, but I believe that before an honourable member occupying such a responsible position as that of the Acting Leader of the Opposition makes the suggestion he has now made he should regard it as obligatory upon himself also to furnish suggestions as to the means by which the Government could finance his proposal. It is estimated by the Government that at the existing rates of penthe standard of living which honourable sions a sum exceeding £12,000,000 will be necessary to meet the pensions bill for the current year. The proposed restoration would involve an additional expenditure of £1,420,000 per annum. I close my remarks on this part of the amendment by repeating that honourable members can only conclude that the amendment has been moved as a means of propaganda. If the amendment is to be taken at its face value, the mover is not possessed of a proper sense of responsibility. This is indicated by his neglect to suggest ways and means to raise thv necessary additional revenue. Dealing with the second portion of the amendment-the suggestion that hours of labour should be reducedI associate myself wholeheartedly with the sentiments embodied in such a suggestion, but I view with caution any move which comes from a party which has at all times advocated higher wages and a reduction of the hours of labour for a certain section of workers, whilst it has shown itself callously negligent of the interests of another section of workersrural producers and rural workers. It is a party which has never shown, at any rate in the State in which I reside, any disposition whatever to secure shorter hours or higher wages for rural workers. Consequently, I believe that this amendment can only be regarded ns a gesture to secure shorter hours and higher wages for a certain favoured section of the workers of this country, namely, the members of the industrial unions of the cities. I am as anxious as any other honourable member that hours of labour should be reduced, but I am also anxious to see them reduced for rural workers and not, merely for one favoured section. Under the interlocking system of tariffs, based upon reports of the Tariff Board, and the awarding of wages by the Arbitration Court, the exporting industries of this country cannot at, present undertake the added burden of costs that would inevitably fall upon them should a shorter working week be adopted generally. The whole financial structure of this country is based upon the stability of those export industries. We have incurred a heavv burden of debt overseas and to maintain members opposite claim is so necessary for our people, there must be a. substantial importation involving overseas debt obligations. We can pay for those essential imports only by establishing and encouraging healthy exporting industries. To-day, these industries are in a precarious position. Certainly they are not able to bear any additional burden of costs such as would result from a general shortening of the hours of labour. T suggest that before we contemplate such a change, which I am as anxious as any other honourable member to see effected, it is necessary to place all workers, rural workers as well as those engaged in secondary industries, upon a common level. I do not desire to reduce the workers in secondary industries to the level upon which workers in rural industries find themselves to-day. Wholeheartedly, I desire to see the standard of living of the rural workers raised to that which is enjoyed by those who now have the protection of Arbitration Court awards. But as that can be clone only by giving to those engaged in rural industry a measure of protection equal to that now enjoyed by those engaged in secondary industries, the only apparent means of achieving that end is the establishment of. a home-consumption price for the products of exporting industries. Then only shall we be able to view in its proper perspective the possibility of bringing about such reforms as a general reduction of working hours and an increase of the basic wage. I believe that the progressive development which will be brought about through human ingenuity in industry will enable us to reduce hours, but I do not hold the view that such action should be taken merely in the interests of one section of workers at the expense of another section. Weshall have to adopt a proper system of planned economy. Already, we have developed a system of protection, the benefits of which are now being, enjoyed by workers engaged in organized secondary industry. I agree with such a policy, but we must complete the circle by providing a corresponding degree of protection for those engaged in our exporting industries. When we have established a planned economy .by these means, and have accelerated the progressive evolution of our banking and currency systems in this country, we shall be better able to increase wages and reduce hours of labour in industry. The evolution of our banking and currency systems has lagged, but the responsibility for that lag cannot be placed entirely upon the system itself; some responsibility for it must be taken hy those people that contrast would not be apparent in who, by the advocacy of wild-cat schemes, have caused a conservative outlook generally in monetary matters. When we have brought about a planned economy and have developed The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN. The honourable member's time has expired. support the amendment. Last night, right at the very door of this Parliament in the capital city of the Commonwealth, between 400 and 500 people gathered clamouring for work, a large portion of the assembly being women with children in arms. Standing in the cold, these people appealed to this Government to find employment for them and their bread-winners. One of the most urgent of. many works which might be put in hand within the Federal Capital Territory is the construction of a modern local hospital. The present public hospital at Canberra is out of date. Recently, I had an opportunity to visit a clinic established under the supervision of' Sister Kenny by the present Labour Government of Queensland. While the Minister for Health has been going around the country making very nice speeches, very little effective work has been done by the Commonwealth Health Department. Clinics along the lines of those conducted in Queensland under the supervision of Sister Kenny should be established throughout the Commonwealth to deal with infantile paralysis. I remind honourable gentlemen opposite that there is an economic side to this matter, because the relief of each victim means that the Commonwealth will be relieved of another claim for an invalid pension. Appearing in the budget is an item of £100 to be devoted to maternal and infant hygiene, and alongside that item appears an item of £11,100 proposed to be voted as a subsidy for the eradication of cattle tick in New South Wales and Queensland. Such a contrast, I submit, must strike honourable gentlemen. Clearly, it shows that this Government considers the eradication of cattle tick a more important matter than the preservation of human life. figures are only part of the Estimates; a study of the ful l Estimates. ter is' not attempting to tell me that this Government is effectively providing for infant hygiene, or that it has established clinics to do this work? Twelve months ago, the Government talked of establishing such clinics, but nothing has yet been done. Almost a year ago, this matter was discussed in this chamber. Several hundred pounds is being spent in fitting out a clinic in the Royal North Shore Hospital. I have seen crippled children being treated in Brisbane at a clinic established by the Labour Government of that State under Sister Kenny, and remarkable results have been obtained. I have received particulars of individual cases from the mothers of children who have been treated there. During my visit, two mothers from New South Wales interviewed Sister Kenny and Dr. Rowntree with a view to having their ehildren treated there, but as the Queensland Government defrays the cost of maintaining the clinic, it was decided that children from another State could not be admitted. Of course",35,Supply Bill No 2 1935 36

75,Mr Mulcahy,"Surely the Ministhe mothers returned to New South ""Wales with their crippled children, and were broken hearted. I understand that if a woman's husband receives more than £247 a year, she is not entitled to receive the maternity allowance. A case has come under my notice in which the husband, whose salary is £248 a year, has a net income of only £230; yet his wife has been refused ""the allowance. I have received a letter from this lady in the course of which she statesI risked my life by not employing a doctor to assist me at the critical moment in order to minimize expenses, hoping to have the bonus to pay the nurse. I am now obliged to deprive my children of necessary nourishment in order to pay a few shillings each pay to the nurse for her services. We witness the spectacle of an important and respected Minister declaring far and wide with ment nowadays to issue ejectment orders pathetic emotion that child-birth is rapidly diminishing, and beseeching and-imploring the mothers of the Commonwealth to do their duty in order that the white race may not perish. I shall forward the communication to the Minister dealing with these matters. Last session I mentioned the case of tubercular soldiers, many of whom have unsuccessfully applied to the Repatriation Department for war pensions. The Minister for Repatriation ( Mr Hughes) promised that the applications of these men would be carefully examined, and if it could be proved that their disability is due to war service, they would receive favorable consideration. Sincei t is impossible for the present tribunal to hear every application, I suggest that a tribunal should be established in each State. The way in which returned soldiers generally have been treated by the Government is disgraceful. Recently, a most distressing case was brought under my notice. A young man who went to the war in 1914, and returned in 1916, owing to war wounds, received a pension of 30s. a week. After spending a few months in Australia, he was sufficiently patriotic to re-enlist. On his second return from the front in .1917 he was sent to the Prince of Wales Hospital, and he received his discharge. Both legs and a portion of one hand had been amputated owing to war injuries. He has endeavoured, without success, to obtain a war pension. He was brought into my office by being carried on the back of another returned soldier. It was one of the saddest spectacles I have witnessed. This case is now being handled by my colleague, the honourable member for Cook( Mr Garden), and I hope that the department will see that this unfortunate man, and others in a similar plight, are given more sympathetic consideration than has been shown to them in the past. It appears to me that the tribunal which hears their applications, and the medical officers employed by the Government, do everything possible to deprive them of justice. Many of them are not in a fit state of health to go before the tribunal and submit their cases. Probably a larger number of purchasers of war service homes are to be found in my electorate than in any other. It seems to be the custom of the Governagainst, or to intimidate, those occupants who are backward in their payments. worse landlord in Australia. the depression, the War Service Homes Commission was turning occupants of these homes out into the street, many property-owners in Sydmey told their tenants that they could remain in the dwellings until they had obtained employment. [Leave to continue given.] Apparently the Government has no policy for the relief of the occupants of war service homes. I did not know until yesterday which Minister was in charge of the department. Last session we were told by the Assistant Minister( Mr Hunter) that the honourable member for Calare( Mr Thorby) had gone to Europe to inquire how ex-soldiers were treated abroad. I was.informed on the 24th September that the honourable member for Calare is the Minister in charge of the department. I have no complaint to make about him in that regard, but I contend that the Government has done nothing to prevent the ejectment of the occupants of these homes. I have a record of the payments made to the department by a purchaser whose payments have been kept up regularly. He has been in occupation of his homefor ten years and nine months. He borrowed £821 Is. 9d., and after making prompt payments for the whole of that period still owes £732 6s. 5d. What hope",37,Supply Bill No 2 1935 36

78,Mr George Lawson (Brisbane),"surrendering their pensions. tion the Government, in order to convince the invalid and old-age pensioners that it was sympathetic towards them, inserted a scale in the 1933 act, providing for a rise or fall in the -amount of the pension in accordance with the rise or fall in the cost of living. It is indeed fortunate for the invalid and old-age pensioners that the cost of living has increased to such an extent as to provide for an addition of 6d. a week to their pension as from July last1 I believe that, in inserting the scale in the act the Go; vernment was of opinion that the cost of living was on the down grade, and that the pensions would not be increased at all. The amendment is phrased very cunningly-in such a way that the rate shall not rise beyond £ 1 a week. We on this side of the House claim that the rate of pension should never be determined on a cost-of-living basis. When the pensions legislation was first introduced, the amount provided was considered to be just sufficient to maintain the pensioners. But £1 a week is totally inadequate to meet the needs of invalid pensioners. Those of us who have come into contact with invalid pensioners know that, in the majority of cases, they are compelled, as the result of their illness, to seek medical assistance, and have frequently to purchase special foods in keeping with the nature of their illness. These heavy demands. upon their pensions make it difficult for them to exist. I sincerely regret that the Government has not seen its way clear to restore to the old-age pensioners the ful l pension of £1 a week. As has already been pointed out by other honourable members on this side of the House, many .millions of pounds have been remitted to wealthy sections of the community, while the invalid and old-age pensioners have been left to live practically on charity or small contributions from relatives. I desire now to refer to the administration of the pensions legislation in Queensland. In doing so I want it to be understood that I do not attach any blame to the officers of the administration branch of the Pensions Department. I say, however, that a thorough investigation should be made into the methods adopted in connection with the examinaI n addition of the applicants for invalid pensions. Some time ago I brought several cases before this House with a request that the system adopted in connection with the examination of invalid pensioners should be inquired into. I suggested that a referee doctor should be called in to settle claims where the Government medical referee's diagnosis differed from that of the applicant's medical practitioner. I went to considerable pains to ventilate specific cases on the floor of the House, but unfortunately my efforts proved futile, and I was unable to achieve any improvement in the methods adopted. I desire now to mention the 'case of a youth 21 years old, who unfortunately is now deceased. I bring this matter forward to demonstrate the lack of sympathy extended by the medical referee in examining an applicant for an invalid pension. This young man applied for an invalid pension in January, but his application was rejected by the medical referee on the ground that he was not totally and permanently incapacitated. Immediately after the examination he was admitted to the Brisbane General Hospital, where he was an inmate for some time, and that precluded him from approaching the department or the medical referee. At the expiration of six months I was successful in having this man re-examined. He was re-admitted to the hospital on the day after the examination, and three clays later I received a communication from the Pensions Department to say that, in the opinion of the medical referee, he was not totally and permanently incapacitated. On the following day I received a telephone message from his parents to say that he had died on the previous night. This unfortunate youth had never been able to work, and his father was only able to obtain relief work. That is only one of the many cases of this nature which have been brought to my notice. It discloses that the medical referee is not giving sufficient consideration to the applications which come before him for invalid pensions. I trust that the Government will deal with this matter more sympathetically, and that greater attention will be given to appli-. cants for invalid pensions. The Brisbane branch of the Red Cross Society has a tubercular soldiers' home named Ardroyne at Corinda, in -which tubercular soldiers who have not been able to secure a war pension from the Repatriation Department are accommodated. Their claims have 'been rejected because they cannot prove that their disability is -due to war service. There are thousands -of returned soldiers suffering from this disease who were passed as medically fit, but contracted the disease as the result of -war service, yet cannot produce sufficient evidence to prove their case. [Quorum formed.'] The Red Cross Society is also -conducting a small factory at Kangaroo Point, Brisbane, in which a number of returned soldiers who cannot find employment are undertaking light work, for which they receive a few shillings, which enables them to purchase medical requirements. Recently the Queensland Government decided to construct a bridge over the river from Kangaroo Point to Petrie Bight, and in order to do so has resumed property at Kangaroo Point, including that on which the Red Cross factory is situated. been demolished, and the men who worked in it are now out of employment. The society, which is finding it difficult to earry on owing to lack of funds, has asked the State Government to provide another site on which to erect its factory. It is the function, not of the State Government, but of the Commonwealth Government, to provide such a site. The Commonwealth, authorities own a property at the rear of the new Commonwealth buildings now in course of erection in Adelaide-street, Brisbane. Sitting suspended from 6.15 to 8 p.m. stand that the Defence Department still occupies an old building situated on Commonwealth land at the rear of the new Commonwealth offices in ANZAC Square, and that it is used merely for the storing of old military equipment. It would be an easy matter for the Government to make that building available to the Red Cross Society for the establishment of a factory. I urge the Minister to give serious consideration to that suggestion. Representations have been made by a While I am pleased to know that the returned soldiers' organization in BrisGovernment intends to appoint a royal bane to the War -Service Homes Departcommission to inquire into this matter, ment to have communications such as I believe that already it has sufficient insurance renewal notices posted to occuinformation at its disposal to effect the pants of war service homes in sealed envelopes.

The organization complained to the Deputy Commissioner of War Service Homes in Brisbane and received what it regarded as an unsatisfactory reply. It was as follows:May 13, 1035. Dear Sir, Adverting to your communication of the 30th ultimo, I desire to inform you that, as the only information on the insurance renewal notices issued by the commission is the certificate number and premium payable, it is not considered that the notice is of a confidential nature and therefore it is not proposed to vary the procedure as to the issue of these. At the request of the league I personally communicated with the Deputy Commissioner, and received a reply which was satisfactory neither to myself nor to the organization concerned. It reads:June 20, 1935. Dear Sir, The factory has, therefore, Following upon your personal representations in regard to the despatch of renewal notices by the commission in unsealed envelopes, I desire to inform you' that this matter was referred to the War Service Homes Commissioner as it was one which affected all the States in common.

I should like the Assistant Minister to give serious consideration to this matter and to instruct the Deputy Commissioner to accede to the request which has been made to him. I have listened attentively to the debate and particularly to the speeches of the honorable members for Wentworth ( Mr E. J. Harrison) and 'Echuca( Mr McEwen), relating to the reduction of the number of working hours.

The honourable member for played the traditionally conservative attirepresentation of me and my actions is tude by expressing approval of the sentiment and then resorting to the use of the qualifying "" but"". He recalled to my mind the fight that the Labour party made for the 4.4-hour working week. Before that was instituted, every capitalist newspaper denounced it and claimed that it would result in the closing down of factories. The introduction of the principle had the reverse effect; it resulted in would be a standing disgrace to this Goan increase of the productivity of labour. [Quorum formed.] Opponents of the 44-hour week said that Australian industry would be overwhelmed by the competition of European and Asiatic countries. Instead of the adoption of 44 hours as the standing working week proving a handicap to industry, it is admitted now by everybody that this country's interests were served by it. The good results that attended that reduction would accompany a further reduction to 40 hours. I wish to touch briefly on the subject of the restoration of the invalid and old age pension to £1 a week. When Australia was experiencing the full blast of the economic blizzard, and salaries and social services had to be reduced, the then Prime Minister( Mr Scullin) declared that the curtailment of pensions was the hardest task he had to undertake, and he made the definite promise to this House and to the people that when the budget was balanced there would be a complete restoration of payments to invalid and old-age pensioners. That promise has not been honoured although this Government has in the last few years remitted no less a sum than £7,000.000 to the rich land-owners of this country. The only The honourable member for increase of benefits to invalid and old-age pensioners has been an insignificant 6d. a week due, not to the goodwill of the Government, but to an increase of the cost of living. I hope that the Treasurer will soon give serious consideration to proposals for a complete restoration of pension payments. Another matter to which I invite attention is the reported intention of the Government to appoint Sir John Latham Chief Justice of the High Court in succession to Sir Frank Gavan Duffy. I doubt that any person in Australia has been subjected to more abuse than I have during the last 30 years. The person chiefly responsible for this consistent misSir John Latham, the former Attorney General, who, for several years, took advantage of every opportunity to attack me in every way.

His excuse on that occasion was that if he had taken legal action, he would have been charged with vindictiveness.

84,Mr Garden,"The present Highknow because I spent a few days in gaol over the dispute. A few years ago I was taken to court no fewer than four times at the instance of the ex-Attorney-General, and I repeat that, because of his known bias towards the .working class movement, he is unfitted for a position on bhe H i g h Court bench. We all recall also the prosecution launched against Jacob Johnson and the Seamen's Union, and we remember, too, the reasons given for the withdrawal of 'the prosecution against John Brown, the millionaire coal-owner, and a political friend of the Government of the day. But I wish particularly to emphasize his bias in connection with the Abrahams case. Mr Justice Starke, one of the H i g h Court Justices commenting upon that case, saidI t is plain on this material that the defendan attempt to defraud the revenue, nothants operated together and possibly with others systematically to defraud the Commonwealth. Sir Edward Mitchell, who appeared in that case, urged that it would be difficult for the Government to prove the offence, and Mr Justice Starkei n reply saidThat is not for the Attorney-General to decide. Tbat is for tbe jury to decide. They (the Abrahams brothers) might think that it was well worth £500,000 in preference to being prosecuted criminally . . . You first arrive at a compromise and then you ask the court to inflict penalties which you have inflicted yourself . . . In addition, it looks very much as if there was an understanding that these people would not be prosecuted . . . It looks as if not much attention had been paid to the injury done to the public. If a private citizen did this there might be something said. Why were they not charged with conspiracy under the Crimes Aet? In marked contrast to its action in that case, the Government of which Sir John Latham was a member, operating provisions of the Crimes Act, threw into gaol many persons, and the onus was upon them to prove their innocence. Although the Abrahams brothers had acknowledged their guilt, the General made a compromise with and withdrew the action. Mitchell, replying to the question asked by Mr Justice Starke, said they were not charged with conspiracy because, in the circumstances of the case, as the facts were ascertained after the Taid and on the certificate of the Attorney-General, it was determined that there was not a sufficient chance of getting a conviction before a jury. Mr Garden. To that Mr Justice Starke repliedA reasonable inference would be that they might have been committed to gaol. Sir Edward Mitchell saidThere was evidence at the time these facts were discovered from which there may be a strong inference drawn, but subject to great difficulty of proof. To that Mr Justice Starke repliedThat is not for the Attorney-General to decide. That is a matter for the jury . . . If some such action had been taken at the instance of Mr Lang, when he was Premier of New South Wales, we should have heard all sorts of allegations about what Labour was getting out of it . But. because the Attorney-Generali n a Nationalist federal administration agreed to a compromise with persons guilty of ing was said about it . member has exhausted his first period. the committee I shall take my second period now. forgets that Sir John Latham is an honest man. his private l if e ; in his political lif e he was extremely biased. As I have said, I was arrested many times at the instance of the ex-Attorney-General. On one occasion I was charged with a certain offence, although I was able, subsequently, to prove that I was not where I was alleged to have been when the offence was committed. There is really no occasion to make an appointment to the H i g h Court Bench, and there is no reason why the Chief Justice should not be selected from the present judiciary. Honourable members will probably recall that, when D r . Evatt the Scullin Government, supporters of this Ministry, who were then in OpposiAttorneytion, said that there was no justification them, for the appointment of additional judges.

89,And Mr Mctiernan Were Appointed By,"Brown, the wealthy colliery proprietor, over the lockout of coal-miners in 1929. Dealing with that incident, the Melbourne Herald, which certainly is not a Labour paper, made this statement in its issue of the 9th April, 1929THE HAN D OF LATHA M AN D THE VOICE OP BRUCE. It will now be asked what new facts or circumstances have induced the Government to withdraw the prosecution. We fear that in suspicious quarters it may be suggested that the altered circumstances are that Parliament is now in recess. It will be suggested that the proposal to prosecute Mr John Brown served a very useful political purpose. It will be suggested that subsequently in the Cabinet or in the party room it was considered impolitic to sool the law on to a wealthy mine-owner who might be a contributor to party funds. Andi t will be suggested that the Prime Minister was instructed to take the first favorable opportunity of getting the party out of the awkward position in which it had been landed by the legal enthusiasm of the Attorney-General. The Adelaide Register of 11th A p r i l also referred to the matter. Honourable members who represent South Australian constituencies w ill readily admit that that paper was never a supporter of the Labour party. Yeti t published the f o l lowing paragraph:In the case of Mr John Brown, the Federal Government has committed an amazing and even inexcusable blunder. In a democratic country nothing is better calculated to provoke intense feeling than the suspicion that there is, in reality, one law for the rich and another for the poor. The Government should not have launched a prosecution against an eminent and influential employer, except on an adequate basis of truth. But, once set in motion, the law which recently penalized the lumpers and timber-workers should have been allowed lo take its course. The Melbourne Age, which sometimes supported the Scullin Governmentperhaps on a fifty-fifty basis-discusse d the matter on the 12th A p r i l in the f o l Australia was in the trough of a great lowing terms:Astonishment caused by the sudden withdrawal of legal proceedings against Mr John Brown, coal-ownei, is developing into intense public indignation. It is certain that no other Australian Government has, in recent years, so foolishly or brazenly exposed itself to the onslaughts of its opponents or subjected the loyalty of its fair-minded supporters vernment took office . it found itself to such severe strain as the Bruce-Page Ministry has done by this single set. To use the conference and the possible embarrassments of one of its constituent elements as a smokescreen will satisfy only those ready to defend the pact Ministry at any sacrifice. The com[9] munity's sense of justice has been affrontedj its faith in the administration of the law has been shaken. The Sydney Bulletin observedThe Bruce-Page Ministry made a silly mess of its .dealings with the coal baron, Brown. The Australasian also made some caustie comments on the subject. Every one of these newspapers is opposed . to the Labour movement, and yet they all stated that the action of the Government implied that there was a law for the rich and another for the poor. If Sir John Latham should be appointed Chief Justice of the High Court, I maintain, from our experience of him, that he will serve the interests of the rich employers of this country. No poor man who appeared before him could expect to receive justice. Those of us who are familiar with his ""make-up"" realize that he cannot now change the basic principles of his life. He is bitter and vindictive, and no poor man or worker could expect to receive justice from him. It will be a scandal if he is elevated to the Chief Justiceship.

Four years ago depression. Things have improved somewhat since then, and for this the governments which have succeeded the Scullin Ministry have taken all the credit.

91,Member For Echuca ( Mr Mcewen]),"had to be restored to a healthy condition; metaphorically, the Scullin Government planted and watered the tree, but this administration has picked the fruit. The present Government has not taken one courageous step, or squarely faced any one problem that has confronted it. The drastic action taken by the Scullin Government in. squarely facing up to its duty brought ignominy upon it, the stigma of which I and other members of that Government will carry for many years. Let me briefly recall the circumstances that faced that Ministry. In May of 1931 the administration learned that by the followwere introduced into the pensions legising month it would not be in a position to pay 17s. 6d. a week to old-age pensioners, and would be able to afford to pay not more than 12s. in the £1. That applied to pensions, the salaries of public servants, and to other governmental expenditure. position called for the drastic action which I have since justified many times in this House and I have no need to repeat the defence of it on this occasion. When the invalid and old-age pensions were reduced .the then Prime Minister and also the Leader of the Opposition gave assurances that directly financial conditions improved, pensions would be restored to their former level. It was promised that in this respect pensions would take precedence over public service salaries and other expenditure which had been subjected to the emergency reduction. That undertaking certainly should have been honoured long before largesse was handed out to the rich land-owners. As we stood for that restoration in 1931 so we continue to advocate it to-day. We ask the Leader of the Government to keep faith with our pensioners, and to remember the solemn pledge he made to them four years ago. In 1931-32 just before the Labour Government successfully floated the internal conversion loan of £560,000,000, the Leader of this Government and the Minister for External Affairs in another place, gave press interviews in Melbourne, in which they stated that the Government's proposals were tantamount to repudiation, and would result in financial chaos. Nevertheless, the Scullin Government proceeded with the undertaking, and eventually brought about the biggest converMr A. Green. sion loan in our history. As a result of that triumphant enterprise the Lyons Government in the year after the Scullin Administration left office reaped the benefit a surplus of £1,314,000. Despite this surplus, and the promises made to them, our pensioners-the indigent poor of this country-were denied their only request that, as old soldiers of industry, they should be permitted £1 a week on which to live. Although there was this big surplus an additional £1,000,000 was taken from the pensioners by the odious and onerous property provisions which lation, and made it impossible for them to leave their homes to their children, many of whom had provided those homes. The surplus in 1932-33 was £3,500,000, but still the Leader of the Government failed to keep his This dire promise. I honestly believe that when he gave his undertaking in 1931 he was prepared to give effect to it, but powerf ul interests which are at the back of every anti-Labour government of Australia decreed otherwise. When these interests say "" march "" the governments concerned have to march; when they say "" j u m p"" the governments must jump. Instead of making restoration to oid-age pensioners, the Government reduced the federal land tax, although there had been no increase in the rate of this tax since it was first instituted by the Labour Government led by Mr Andrew Fisher. This tax was imposed on owners of properties of ' an unimproved value of more than £5,000. No farmer in Western Australia has ever had to pay federal land tax. If a man with a block of an unimproved value of £10,000 has made improvements to the amount of £5,000, without which it would be of little use to him, he does not pay a penny of land tax. The reduction of this tax did not help the struggling farmer; but benefited the owners of large estates, although it was originally introduced for the purpose of breaking up big estates, and had been most successful in this respect. The largess distributed among wealthy landowners by this Government has been wrung from the old and indigent. The Government had another surplus in 1933-34, and a further reduction of taxation was made to the advantage of the land-owners. By this time this section of the community had benefited by remissions of taxation, and otherwise, to an amount equivalent to the full sum required to restore the pension to the former figure of £1 a week. The Commonwealth had a surplus last year of £711,000, but still the pensioners received no relief. It is estimated that the current financial year will end with, a surplus of £1,000,000, May of this year, 11 per cent. Germany out of which we are told that the Government will remit £510,000 to certain classes of taxpayers, instead of fulfilling its pledge to the old-age pensioners Hitler regime Germany is looking after by restoring their pensions. The reason given by the Government for remitting to the wealthy section of the community taxation amounting to over £9,500,000 is that it wished to make it possible for them to provide more employment. The Prime Minister has the habit of throwing bouquets at himself, ad nauseum, and of claiming credit for the better conditions in Australia in comparison with those in a number of other countries. United States of America as a country in which the unemployment problem was more acute than in Australia; but he did not mention that it was in the throes of a depression unequalled in the history of the world. Bad though the position may be in the United States of America, it can at least be said for its President that he has tried to work along national lines in an effort to improve conditions, and has not been content merely to remit taxation to the moneyed members of the community. courageous enough to increase taxation and to shorten the hours of the working week. I do not say that his efforts have been entirely successful, any more than have the efforts of the leaders of the German nation; but these men have at least shown a willingness to work along national lines. That is what the Labour party stands for. member has exhausted his first period. able member wishes to intervene I shall take my second period now. The Prime Minister quoted from the Statistician's returns to show that the number of persons unemployed in Australia for the second quarter of this year was only 18.6 per cent, of the population. I admit that that is a big reduction from the figures of 1931, but the right honourable gentleman forgot to say that in 1932, six months after his Government came into office, the trough of the depression was reached. In Canada the proportion of unemployed to the total population is 15.9 per cent., and in Germany in has in operation a scheme for the employment of large numbers of youths in forests and on farms. Even under the its youths, whereas in Australia nothing is done for 50,000 of the 100,000 youths who leave school each year and can never hope to find employment. Last January the Prime Minister claimed to be greatly concerned about our unemployed lads, but he has done nothing for them. The honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Curtin) said that the Minister for Commerce (Dr. Earle Page) had a weakHe instanced the ness for incubating fresh ideas. The right honourable member is a rival to the Prime Minister in the art of saying things that mean nothing and of making promises which are not kept. Unemployment is not nearly so big a problem in Denmark as it is in Australia, the proportion of unemployed to the population there being 13 per cent, or 5.6 per cent, less than in this country. In Japan the proportion is under 5 per cent., and in the United Kingdom 13.1 per cent. Australia is lagging behind other Mr Roosevelt has been countries, notwithstanding that in the wool market it has practically a monopoly and enjoys many other advantages. The honourable member for Echuca with being unconcerned about the unemployed on the farms. The honourable member should know that the great need of the farmers is a compulsory wheat pool. He should know, also, that within three months after it came into office the Scullin Government met the representatives of the farmers in conference, and later had a bill prepared by a legal gentleman in the Wimmera district with a knowledge of wheat-farminga measure unequalled among its kind.

94,( Mr Mcewen) Twitted The Labour Party,"who is also the leader of the Country party in this House, has not said one word in favour of a compulsory wheat pool, notwithstanding that, according to the president of the Country party in New South ""Wales, the majority of the farmers of that State and of Victoria and Western Australia desire it. Had the right honourable gentleman been in earnest, he could have had a wheat pool in operation to-day, and thereby saved the farmers from being fleeced as they now are. Unfortunately, the farmers of this country are not affiliated with any organization which is really concerned with their welfare; they have linked themselves with people with whom they have A number of their so-ealled representatives merely seek big jobs for themselves. At the beginning of last season the price of wheat in Australia was about 2s. Id. a bushel. The banks expressed the fear that the price would drop, and forced many farmers to sell their stocks of wheat. Last week wheat was quoted at 3s. 3d. a bushel, but the growers did not gain. this country have benefited by Is. 2d. a. bushel at the expense of farmers who were forced to sell their stocks. The taxpayers have been asked to provide £4,500,000 in order that the farmers may be given a bounty of 7£d. a bushel for their wheat; but, as the big wheat-buyers have taken 8d. or 9d. a bushel from the farmers, the actual growers of the wheat have sustained a loss of about 1-Jd. a bushel on the advanced price. One well-known wheat-grower in South Australia arranged to sell a quantity of wheat in the Old Country at 3s. 3d. a bushel through one of the wheat organizations with which he is allied. ceived news that the wheat had to be handed over to a certain wholesale buyer in South Australia at that price. He retained about 1,000 bags of wheat, and, later, when he tried to sell it, he was able to get only 3s. a bushel for it from the same Avholesale buver. That was because he was in the hands of a buyer who was out to fleece the farmers. The farmers will continue to lose in this way until there is in existence a pool controlled by themselves. Mr 4.. Green. [9.0] -Everybody , I think, sympathizes with the old-age pensioners, but we must admit that, in view of the present purchasing power of money as compared with what it was when the pensions were reduced, old-age and invalid pensioners are not in nearly so bad a position as are the thousands of retired railway workers, police, teachers and others, who draw pensions from the various superannuation funds established by the State governments. These persons paid money into superannuation funds in expectation of receiving certain stipulated pensions upon their retirement. Then in pursuance of the Premiers plan, their pensions were reno , interest in common. duced by 20 per cent., whereas those of old-age and invalid pensioners were reduced by only 12^ per cent. So far as I in this Parliament know no effort has yet been made in any State to restore the amounts by which superannuation pensions were reduced. The reason, of course, is that the State governments are not in a position to make the restoration; and the Acting Leader of the Opposition knew when he put forward his proposal, that, even if he had a majority in both Houses of The wheat-buyers of this Parliament, he would not be able to put it into effect. Any attempt to do so would merely tend further to emphasize the existing disparity between the positions of those who look to the Commonwealth Government for bounty, and those who must look to the State governments. In 1930, the year before Commonwealth pensions were reduced, the weighted average of the cost of living index, according to the returns of the Commonwealth Statistician, was 978. In the year when the reduction was made the average was 852, taking the four quarters of the year into consideration. Later he reThis year, the figure is' higher than it has been at any time since 1931, having risen from a low level of 792 to 810.

Green) referred with much eloquence and some heat to the amount of unemployment existing in Australia, and compared it with the unemployment in Germany,' Japan and Russia. I am surprised that any honourable member of his age and experience should quote those countries as examples for Australia to follow. If the Commonwealth were to spend relatively as much money' in keeping men under arms as is being spent by the governments in Germany, Russia and Japan, we should have no unemployment in .this country at all. I doubt whether there are any other three ..countries in the world in which such large percentages of the manhood of the community are taken off the labour market -and placed under arms. The honourable -member quoted Great Britain also ,as a .country in which the percentage of .employment was less than in Australia.

Not one State government can afford to make such restoration without further increasing its already alarming deficit.

If this amendment is carried, it is to be taken as an instruction to the Government;(a) That this House desires to increase the rate of invalid and old-age pensions to £1 a week; and (b) That the Government take steps to ensure progressive reductions in the number of working hours and increases in living standards commensurate with increased powers of production due to the mechanization and speeding up of industry.

No less than £8,500,000 will be set aside this year for defence purposes. sure a considerable reduction of that amount can be made, and what is saved could be paid into the pensions fund. Certain restorations of salary are to be made to public servants, including those receiving £2,000 a year and more; yet money cannot be found to restore to the old-age pensioners the 2s. a week which was taken from them. is a disgrace to the Government, and those members who support this policy are not even honest, because I believe that, in most cases, their private convictions are that the pensions should be restored. the pensioners represent, for the most part, the pioneers who opened up the country, who made sacrifices, and who, throughout their active lives, contributed their fair share in taxes to the revenues of the country. The pension is not a charity or a dole, but something to which the aged are justly entitled. The basic wage paid' to single female workers in New South ""Wales is £1 17s. per week, in Queensland £1 19s., in South Australia £1 lis. 6d., and in Western Australia £1 18s. Id. This is little enough, but if even the authorities believe that these sums represent the minimum upon which a single woman can feed and clothe herself and provide shelter, then the claim of the pensioners for £1 a week cannot be denied. Before the Government makes any restitution of salaries to highly-paid officers in the Public Service, or makes any tion to the wealthy sections of the community, .pensions should be restoredto the old ' level of £1 a week. Probably, if the pensioners had a greater voice in the affairs of the community, the Government would take Mr Clark. more notice of their claims, but evidently they are regarded as a small and uninfluential section, which Ministers can afford to ignore. The right honorIn regard to defence, we have able the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) claims that Australia to-day is enjoying an era of prosperity. It seems to me, however, that the greatest prosperity is in the joy-riding and sight-seeing departI maintain that this money ment. Recently, the Prime Minister, accompanied by a large contingent of Ministers and officials, tripped overseas, and the results obtained by Australia have not been commensurate I am with the cost. .The honourable the Attorney-General( Mr Menzies) has endeavoured to explain the achievements of that delegation insofar as it obtained Empire preferences for Australian meat; but, as the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Rosevear) pointed out last night, this matter had already Such a situation been dealt with by the Ottawa Conference. Consequently, it cannot be justly claimed that the delegation which went overseas recently can show results commensurate with its cost to this country. Before concessions Avere made in the budget to They must recognize that any other section, restorations of former payments to those least able to fend for themselves, such as the pensioners, should have been provided for. In this respect the Government has acted in a brazen and heartless manner, and I hope that even at this late stage it will consider the claims of the pensioners, which have been voiced by their various organizations throughout Australia. [Quorum formed.] As the Government has been able to show a. surplus, and proposes to spend much of its available money upon defence, in remissions of taxation to wealthy sections of the community, and in increasing the salaries of the "" brass hats "" and largesalaried employees of the CroAvn, it should, at least, give to the pensioners the consideration which was promised Avhen the pensions were first reduced. The Prime Minister has stated that, in view of the present prosperous conditions in further reduction of taxaAustralia, the people should cease to talk about the depression. The right honourable gentleman may feel that this Government can overlook the misrepresentations which its representatives made to the people at the last election, and probably because of hi3 oAvn salary he may not feel any effects of the depresment, the matter of instituting a shorter sion; but that is no reason why the people working week should be one of the first suffering from the depression should concerns of this Government.

106,Mr Mahoney (Denison) [ 9 . 3 2 ],"INaturally the only way to eliminate unemployment is to provide work for those who need it. The economic conditions of the workers of Australia should not be regulated in accordance with the conditions prevailing overseas. If there is to be any alteration of standards of living, the standards now observed in older countries should be raised to the Australian level. International Labour Conference recommended that the nations represented should not purchase the goods of those countries which refused to improve the economic conditions of their workers. All must contribute to the economic wealth of the community; otherwise the social -structure must collapse. It is suicidal to have a dole system in operation side by side with an enormous pensions bill. While the unemployed in the cities are being supported by. the dole, the Government is also handing out money to farmers; but the day of reckoning must come. Every man and woman must be given ah opportunity to work and live under decent conditions. The crisis through which we are passing is not a financial one; it is due to the loss of markets. Australia could produce in one year enough wool and wheat to clothe and feed its people for twenty years, yet millions of people throughout the world are starving, millions of bushels I realize that the debate is not restricted of wheat are being eaten by mice and rats! machinery to carry out an extensive programme of reproductive public works that are essential to the welfare of the nation. The Commonwealth Bank, the Loan Council, and the Arbitration Court should operate in conjunction for the revival and expansion of industry; but the party in power is controlled by the financial interests of this country, which are content to see city workers and primary producers sorely suffering. Beference was recently made in this chamber to the unemployment position in Canberra. There is no prospect of steady work being provided in this city, and the army of unemployed increases. As there are no factories, and no farms on which the idle men can be absorbed, the only work that appears to be offering is the hoeing of weeds in the parks and gardens. The. Government has brought about economic chaos, and it is in a state of fear. Ministers must realize that their present policy is a hopeless one. This wretched position has been brought about by the war debt of £400,000,000, which posterity will have to stagger under for 100 years. The Government has reduced the taxes of wealthy' land-owners, of whom from 40 to 60 per cent, Quite recently, the are to be found in the cities, while refusing to grant an extra 2s. a week to the invalid and old-age pensioners, who, by reason of their lives of toil, have made it possible for the wealthy to enjoy their present affluence. I remind the Minister for Defence that it is time he put the defences of this country in a position to protect its citizens against the attacks of invaders. But I am against sending young men out of this country to fight in other lands. If there is any fighting to be done for the preservation of the lives of the women and children of this country I shall do it here in Australia, but not in other parts of the world. I would take no part in any war outside of Australia nor would I vote a shilling for its prosecution. port the amendment moved by the Acting Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Eorde). In the discussion of a measure such as this to any particular subject, and like other Australia has the necessary honourable members. I desire to bring before the House a number of complaints. I desire first to bring under the notice of the Minister representing the Postmaster-General a complaint regarding the mail delivery to Quorrobolong. It seems most remarkable that the mail route now being followed has remained the same since pre-federation days, when postal facilities were provided by the State governments. The Cessnock mail contractcovers deliveries to Kitchener, which is within five miles of Quorrobolong. The whole of the mail route for the South Maitland district goes through West Maitland, East Greta and then through Kurri Kurri to Cessnock and various other towns. Requests have been made that the Quorrobolong mail should go through the Cessnock route, and that the present method of delivery should be discontinued.

107,Mr James (Hunter) [9.46],"I supEast Maitland, the mail could be delivered at Quorrobolong, via Cessnock, much more expeditiously. The present procedure is very uneconomic, and I feel sure that the postal authorities are not cognisant of the development that is taking place in the great mining areas in the South Maitland district, otherwise they would be prepared to accede to this request and give the people of that district better mail facilities. Some time ago I wrote to the department suggesting that. a postal inspector should be detailed to inquire into this matter. This was done and I accompanied him over the route in question. He was amazed, and remarked that I was actually showing the department its job. I feel sure that that officer would recommend the adoption of the suggestion of those people. week has been given back, but, apart from It is true that there are other towns covered on that nineteen miles journey from East Maitland to Quorrobolong, 'but they also could be catered for through l i u r r i Kurri.

From Kurri Kurri to .Buchanan, through Standford Merthyr is only about three miles; to Mulbring through Pelaw Main, five miles; Mount Vincent about seven miles, and Brunkerville about ten miles. I desire now to refer to thp amendthe pension has been placed on the ment dealing with invalid and old-age basis of a charity. I ask the Government pensions.

But Premiers' plan was adopted, Mr James. pensioners would have restored to them the cuts made in ' their pensions as soon as the finances permitted? We all remember that eighteen members of the Labour party refused to support the Premiers' plan, and that it was only with the aid of honourable members now sitting behind the Government the financial emergency legislation was passed by Parliament. As a result of the passing of that legislation the pensioners suffered a reduction of 2s. 6d. per week in their pension. The first Lyons Government brought about a further reduction of 2s. 6d. per week, and enacted the property clauses which resulted in the taking away of properties from the relatives of pensioners after their death. The last cut of 2s. 6d. a that, the most helpless section of the community-the old pioneers of this country, who have borne the heat and the burden of the day in the development of this country-ha s received no benefit in proportion to that received by others who are less deserving. When the first Invalid and Old-age Pensions Bill was introduced in 1908, it was said that the pension was being given to the people as a right and not as a charity. But what is the position to-day? Every one knows that country was hardship upon invalid pensioners and totalling approximately from relatives of pensioners, some of that not so many people were affected by the other provisions -which I have mentioned. Very few invalid children living with their parents apply for pensions. I have already mentioned the case of a man of 44 years of age, living with his father, who was aged 68 years. Because the old man had a few pounds in the bank and a property apart from the home in which he resides, not only was he denied the pension, but the son also. Under section 52M regulations were framed providing that, before a child was asked to make a contribution towards the pension of his parent, he could be in receipt of an income of £6 aweek as a married man, with provision for a further allowance of £50 for each child, plus a liberal education allowance, and an allowance for unemployed children. I brought forward concrete cases in which invalids living in the homes of their parents, whose income has been only £4 5s. a week, have been refused the pension, despite the fact that there have been other children in the family apart from the applicant. At that time. I was endeavouring to have deleted from the act the two paragraphs of the sections to which I have referred. If the Assistant Treasurer ( Mr Casey), who opposed the suggestion I submitted, will not delete those paragraphs, will he allow the same concession to parents housing an invalid son or daughter as he allowed to single or married men tinder section 52M? This section was repealed because the Government realized that thousands of persons who were being asked to contribute were affected, but comhonorable member for Bendigo, Mr paratively few were affected hy sections 22h and 17/6. It appears that section 52M was repealed solely because thousands of votes were involved. member has exhausted his time. committee, I shall take my second period now. supported the repeal of that section. a pensioner with a son in affluent circumstances who would not assist me voluntarily I would tell him to go to hell rather than receive money which he was forced to contribute for my maintenance. I now wish to refer to the probable appointment of Sir John Greig Latham as Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia. I am opposed to political appointments to the judiciary, and particularly to the elevation of this gentleman, who has been instrumental in framing many of the harsh laws which have been invoked against the working class. I. refer more particularly to the Crimes Act, which is one of the worse measures on the statute-book. Although actually there may not be one law for the rich and another for the poor, because the law is the same for both, too much discrimination is shown in its administration. Reference has already been made to the Government's action in connection with the Abrahams brothers case, and the Kidman and Mayoh ship-building contract. Honourable members will recall the illegal lockout which occurred on the Newcastle coal-fields in 1929-30, when, following a long debate in this chamber, a prosecution was launched against Mr John Brown. Hansard records that a debate on this subject, which commenced just before midnight on the 22nd March, 1929, was continued until 2.30 a.m. the next morning. During the debate I had the support of the sons, the honourable member for Wannon. Mr Rodgers, and the honourable member for Fawkner, the late Mr Maxwell, all of whom were anti-Labour men. Later that morning, when the House resumed, an inspired question was asked by the Hurry, as to the action the Government proposed to take against the coal owners. The Attorney-General, then Mr Latham, stated definitely that the Government had completed investigations, and that a prosecution would be launched against Mr John Brown. That decision was satisfactory to the miners, but during the Easter recess the prosecution was withdrawn and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, Mr Theodore, in moving a motion of censure, asked why the Government had changed its tactics. The House was informed that the prosecution had been withdrawn to clear the way for a free and open discussion at a conference to be held in the Sydney Town Hall, to be presided over by Sir Wallace Bruce. The Prime Minister, Mr Bruce.",52,Supply Bill No 2 1935 36

According to a statement by Mr Reesj general president, and Mr Davies, the general secretary of the miners' organization, which statement was read in this chamber, the miners denied emphatically that any such agreement had been reached by the members of their organization, or by any of the affiliated unions concerned in the dispute. They may have been under the impression that the withdrawal was only of a temporary nature. But even had the miners agreed the Government was not justified in withdrawing the prosecution when a breach of both the Crimes Act and the Industrial Peace Act had been committed. The Attorney-General at that time, Sir John Latham, on the other hand, did not hesitate to prosecute the timber-workers, the waterside-workers and the seamen. When these organizations were involved Sir John Latham became like a ferocious tiger, but when John Brown was concerned the prosecution which had been launched was withdrawn because the Government realized that he was one of its supporters. the honourable member charge the Scullin Government, of which he was a supporter, immediately after the elections, with having failed to prosecute John Brown, and with having thereby received £1,000 from the miners under false pretences ? political career I have never departed in any way from the policy upon which I was elected, irrespective of whether the Government has been one that I was returned to support, or one that I was pledged to oppose. I have always rung true, and the honourable gentleman knows it. deny that. to exercise the greatest care in its choice of the gentleman to be appointed to the position of Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia. That high, important, and honourable position should be filled by a man who eapnot be said to have exhibited bias at any time. There is conclusive proof that Sir John Latham, when Attorney-General, showed bias against the working class. The intellectual qualities of the present justices of the High Court are undoubtedly superior to those of that gentleman. They have given years of unblemished service, and naturally aspire to the highest position offering. Are not their claims greater than those of a political hireling? The position has been surrounded by a veil of mystery. Upon his return to Australia, the present Attorney-General( Mr Menzies) was interviewed by the press concerning the rumoured appointment of Sir John Latham. He then claimed to have no knowledge of the projected retirement of Sir Frank Gavan Duffy. That gentleman apparently had announced his intention to retire; but when he was asked to comment on the statement of the Attorney-General, all that he would say was that he supposed that Mr Menzies was right. I urge the Government to give due consideration to the matter. We want even-handed justice to be meted out to the people of this country. The Chief Justice has not only a deliberative, but also a casting vote. A man who has shown such bias as Sir John Latham is not a fit and proper The amendment which the Acting Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Forde) has moved puts forward two propositions for the consideration of the committee. The first is, that the time has arrived when the original rates of pension payable to those whose applications under the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act were granted shall be restored to them; that is to say, the reductions that have been effected in their rates shall be cancelled. I consider that the budget statement which the Assistant Treasuier ( Mr Casey) read the other night furnishes adequate grounds upon which to justify, so far as that section I do not of the community is concerned, the removal of the last of the impositions which they had to suffer because of the financial crisis.

I put it to him that that does not completely present the position. Some of the States have made a partial restorainvalid and old-age pensioners do pay. tion. In any case, I put this to him and to the committee: A 20 per cent, deduction from a pension which ranges from about £4 to £5 or £6 a week is definitely a less hardship upon the recipient than a 12£ per cent, deduction from a pension of £1 a week. case the man has paid for his pension. to the Parliament at the time when the reduction of the rate of old-age pension from £1 to 17s. 6d. a week was agreed upon, that only onerous circumstances of governmental finance justified the course which Parliament was then taking. It was, I think, definitely understood, both in the Parliament and in the country, that immediately the finances recovered, not completely, but sufficiently adequately the Government proposes to use money to permit of the restoration to this section of the community, the Parliament was under a solemn and indeed a powerful moral obligation to restore what had been taken under the pressure of a grave national emergency. The budget statement shows that in 1930-31 the direct taxation imposed by this Parliament upon the Australian community produced £18,660,000. It must be confessed that the payment of that amount in that year imposed a very serious strain upon the payers of direct taxation. In the fiscal year that has just at stake. Land is capital. The owners closed the amount realized from direct taxation was £11,500,000, a reduction of £7,000,000 compared with the year in which the cut in old-age pensions was made. I put it to the committee most definitely that it would be far easier to obtain £18,000,000 through the. medium of direct taxation this year than it was in tial flats erected on land valued at from 1930-31. Yet, as a matter of fact, this Parliament is asking the payers of direct taxation to contribute to the revenues of the Commonwealth, not £18,600,000, but only about £11,500,000. That is a definite improvement of the position of that section of the community. Direct taxation is fair taxation. It bears only on those who have incomes subject to the rates imposed upon them. Invalid and old-age pensioners are not subject to this class of taxation, so they have not benefited from the reduction in rates. Rut Parliament has, in the meantime, greatly increased indirect taxation, which Por example, they pay the sales tax on flour and all other forms of indirect taxation which have risen from £31,750,000 in the year in which pensions were reduced, to £47,250,000 in the year which has just closed. Thus the payers of direct taxation, who to-day are in a much are being relieved of a great amount of the taxes imposed upon them, while those who are least able to bear the burden, namely, the great mass of the people, are being forced to pay the greatly increased indirect taxes. While there has been surplus after surplus in the accounts of the Commonwealth, the restitution of this 2s. 6d. a week to invalid and old-age pensioners has been delayed, not because the country cannot afford it, but because which was formerly paid to the pensioners for other forms of expenditure. This is the truth of the matter. The Government this year intends to increase enormously the provision for national defence. I do not offer any objection to that at this stage; I am, however, reminded that the demands in respect of federal land tax have been enormously reduced, and I submit that, in the event of a great national conflict, it is the land of Australia that ,is most of properties affected by this class of taxation are to be found, not in our farming areas, but in the capital cities of the Commonwealth. They are the owners of the great newspaper offices, the great banking institutions, and the pala£100 to £1000 a foot. I submit that as these great city properties are insured against fire and other commercial risks, they should also be insured against war, by the only reasonable and justifiable way, namely, the levying of a fair land tax, the revenue from which will be a definite contribution towards the expenditure necessary for the preservation of security.",55,Pabkhill Di D Not Person To Hold That High Office
118,Mr Archie,,56,Cameron I N The One Better Position To Meet Their Obligations
119,Mr Curtin,"It was quite obviousThis Government has reduced that class of taxation while at the same time it professes its inability to finance the amount required for the restoration of invalid and old-age pensions to £1 a week. I submit that the total involved is not sufficient for the Government to withhold this act of common'justice from our pensioners, having regard to the romantic story of national recovery which the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) and the Attorney-General( Mr Menzies) relied upon the day before yesterday in their rejoinder to the motion of want of confidence moved by the Acting Leader of the Opposition. Either the defence which those Ministers made to our attack on that occasion was unjustified by the facts, or the refusal of the Government to pay this additional 2s. 6d. a week is motivated not by the financial position of the country, but by considerations which I hardly like to mention. I do not accuse the Prime Minister or members of his Ministry with a lack of humanity; but I submit that the full restoration of pendirection and I should not have risen at sions would, in itself, be a definite conthis late hour to speak in this debate tribution to an improvement of the unemployed problem. If this additional 2s. 6d. a week were paid to our pensioners intentions. The House should he taken they would buy with it more consumable goods; they would be able to live in better rooms, and would enjoy a slightly increased measure of the ordinary frugal requirements of subsistence. The attitude of the Government would suggest that it believes it is unnecessary and undesirable to increase the ability of our pensioners to purchase more of the requirements of life. The argument of the honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron) that the purchasing power of pensioners is greater to-day than it was some years ago may be true, but it does not conform to the history of the system of pensions. In other years when the purchasing power of money was declining there was a distinct reluctance on the part of the Government of the day to increase the rates to pensioners. I know that eventually they were increased; but I know also that, as in the case of wages, increased pension payments always lagged behind the rising tide of prices and it was not until commodity prices became so high that it was impossible to maintain Mr Curtin. pensions at their then declining purchasing power, that Parliament agreed to increase the rates. hypocrisy! The honourable member consistently supported the Government. that reduced pensions and imposed high tariffs. the Minister for Defence should become so excited. I can only attribute his mental perturbation to the fact that my indictment is unassailable. Linked with the attitude of the Government towards the pensions is its attitude to the second part of the motion, which deals with the important question of unemployment in its technical aspect, due to the displacement of labour owing to the mechanization of industry, and the need for an adjustment of the hours of labour. We have reason to believe that the Government contemplates action in this but for the fact that, so far, we have had no indication of the Government's into the confidence of Ministers j n respect of this important matter. Does the Government intend to institute an inquiry? If so, what will be its nature, what interests will be represented, and under what circumstances is it to be conducted? I have in my hand the summarized report of the In ternational Labour Office dealing with this important subject. It is quite clear, from a perusal of this document, that most countries, other than Australia, have made a searching examination of this problem which so vitally affects civilization. It would appear that no matter what is done the changes that take place so rapidly in industrial struc tures throw men out of work weekly in large numbers, with the result that established industries become obsolescent long before new industries can be evolved to take up the displaced labour. Meanwhile mass purchasing power suffers. Thus the sporadic and anarchical characters of our civilization becomes not only increasingly pronounced but indeed intolerable. This position should not be borne by the statesmen of this or, indeed, any other country.",56,Cameron I N The One Better Position To Meet Their Obligations
120,Mr Abchdale Pabkhill,What,57,Cameron I N The One Better Position To Meet Their Obligations
121,Mr Curtin,"I am astonished that 1 hope that before this debate closes the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons), who is now in the chamber, will be good enough to tell us what the Government intends to do in respect of this perplexing and very difficult problem of the adjustment of working hours. I will do the Government the credit of assuming that at least it has not been idle in respect of this matter; but the time has arrived and, in fact, is overdue when Parliament should be furnished with a clear statement on the subject from the head of the Government. port the amendment of the Acting Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Porde), and emphasize his request that the rate of the invalid and old-age pension shall be increased at once to £1 per should be introduced forthwith to provide for a 40-hour working week. When the pension rate was reduced four years ago, we were told that it was a financial emergency measure and we were promised that immediately the finances improved, the Government would restore the pension to the full £1 a week. The honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron) has said that the pensioners are much better off than many other sections of the community. This reminds me that I read many years ago'in a little volume the following verse:No matter how bad your case is There are thousands that are worse: If you are riding in tlie ambulance Be glad its not the hearse. And if you go to prison, You must swallow your manly pride, For there you'll get a little to eat While thousands starve outside. Apparently that is the philosophy of the honourable member for Barker. Prior to Easter, when it was intimated that in consequence of a variation in the cost of living the rate of the pension would be increased from 17s. 6d. to 18s. a week, I asked the Assistant Treasurer ( Mr her pensioner boarders at l is . 6d. a week Casey), who may be Treasurer next week, whether the extra 6d. would be paid to the inmates of government institutions, asylums and hospitals. He said that he could not at the moment say what would be done, but would make inquiries into the matter. I waited for some time for information on the point. As a matter of fact I thought East Sydney( Mr Ward) referred to the the 6d. was being paid to these inmates. reported intention of the Government to As I did not. get any definite word from the TreasuryI inquired from the Under Secretary of .the Treasury in New South Wales( Mr Kelly) whether the Government of New South Wales was receiving 13s or 12s. 6d. a week in respect of the pensioners in its institutions. That was three days before the date fixed for the payment of the increase. Mr Kelly told me that he had received no advice on the subject. I then communicated with the Treasury officials in Canberra, and asked them for information. I believed that the Government would carry out the near-promise made by the Assistant Treasurer. A t the same time, I assure the Government that it will get no bouquets from me. The Government can do no good in my eyes. I week, and that legislation believed that the Assistant Treasurer had made arrangements to pay to the inmates of the Old Women's Home at Newington, the Old Men's Home at Lidcombe and the Old Men's Home at Liverpool the extra 6d. a week. But the Treasury officials informed me that that had not been done. I then went to the permanent head of the Pensions Department and asked for information on the point. I was informed that the Government would adhere to the provisions of the act and pay 5s. a week to each pensioner inmate of these institutions. I understand that the State governments have not asked for the extra 6d. a week. Apparently the added cost of living is not so noticeable that they need it to meet their expenses.

I regret that I was not a member of this Parliament when Sir John Latham began his political career; but I accept the statement of the honourable member for East Sydney that the right honourable gentleman is class-conscious and classbiased, and totally unfitted for the judicial his summing up, said, "" I hesitate to say position to which he aspires. Honourable members may remember the trial in Sydney in 1916 of twelve men belonging to the Industrial Workers of the World. They were first charged with sedition, but later the charge was altered to one of conspiring, by illegal means, to get Tom Barker out of goal. They were convicted, but subsequently the Government of New South Wales appointed an independent judgeJudge Ewing-to try them. He found them not guilty, and said that the case was a "" frame-up,"" and that they had been convicted on perjured evidence. In an inquiry into the conduct of Street, His Honour spoke scathingly of some members of the police force, particularly Inspector Mitchell, a person named Scully, the Goldsteins, and ""Poddy"" MacAlister. It was disclosed in. evidence that ""Poddy"" MacAlister, who gave evidence against the accused men, was at a place in Moss Vale when Sir George Fuller, the then leader of the Liberal party in New South Wales, said, "" If we can get these twelve men convicted we will win conscription, and then we will win the State election.""

Referring Attorney-General and Prime Minister to the evidence of the police, Mr Justice in charge of the Crimes Act( Mr Street said that he could not understand Hughes) visited all parts of Australia why Inspector Mitchell should tell such stating that the men were guilty before ugly lies. receiving suits of clothes from the Goldney-General in the Government of New steins. The police who gave evidence South Wales, Mr Hall, did precisely against the twelve, members of the the same thing during the conscription Industrial Workers of the World were campaign. Those men were not tried given suits of clothes and Stetson hats until after the conscription referendum, by the Goldsteins, while a number of pigs were also distributed among them. The police denied the receipt of these gifts;, but railway porters swore to the delivery of the pigs, and a tailor gave evidence that clothes which he had supplied tocertain policemen had been paid for by the Goldsteins. Mr Justice Street, in. definitely that the police conspired together to commit perjury, but I am of the opinion that they did."" It was upon evidence of that kind that the twelve men were convicted. One of them, Donald Grant, has been a friend of mine for twenty years. He was sentenced to imprisonment for 45 years by Mr Justice Pring, who, when delivering sentence, said that he would temper justice with mercy !In a speech in Parliament on the 28th January, 1926, Sir John Latham, then. Mr Latham, saidIn Sydney the position became very serious; lives were lost, and many buildings were burnt down, rendering strong action necessary. the police by Mr Justice One man named Tom Barker was sentenced to six months imprisonment, because he wrote "" Parsons and politicians, go to the trenches; workers, follow your master."" Those remarks were supposed to be prejudicial to recruiting. I cannot see how that would be prejudicial to recruiting. Why should not the workers follow their masters? If the workers .wait to follow the politicians to the trenches there will be no war. I advise the workers, when the war breaks out, to link themselves with the politicians, and they will never approach the firing line.

But the people realized the horrors of conscription, and New Queensland, compassed the defeat of the conscription issue. coming war breaks out, no doubt the Government w ill again endeavour to force conscription on Australians, and members of this House w ill take the platform as in the old days when they used to refer to the Huns as despicable men who carried babies on their bayonets through the streets of Belgium, or broke into the Louvain Convent and committed unspeakable atrocities. An y one who declares that statements of that kind are not true w ill doubtless be haled before the court, and sentenced to six months' imprisonment.

I now desire to know from what source this coal and that used by the Department of the Interior is purchased, and what price is paid for it . -Members on this side wish to be informed whether adequate provision has been made for their hotel accommodation in Canberra, in view of the fact that the Hotel Canberra is to be privately leased, and the Hotel Kurrajong is closed to us. I submit that the other hotels are inconveniently situated for our use. Of course wo are perpared to pay for our accommodation, as we have done in the past. Hotel Canberra has undertaken to provide accommodation for all honourable members. pay 7s. 6d. for a bed at the Hotel Canberra, and consider that quite enough for anybody to be charged. be very dissatisfied if the lessee is to be free to increase the present rates. for the Interior) [11.20] I desire to remove any apprehension from the mind of the honourable gentleman who has just resumed his seat with respect to the results that may flow from the leasing of the Hotel Canberra. I assure him that the lessee has given an undertaking that preference,' will -be extended to members of Parliament, so far as the provision of accommodation is concerned. With regard to the tariff to be charged, I feel sure the honourable member will not have any cause for dissatisfaction. In a very short time there will be considerably more hotel day. There will also be more competition. shortly be begun, and when they are completed, honourable members will be able to get accommodation at hotels other than the one in which they are at present residing. Hotel Canberra charge the present tariff to honourable members ? specific answer to that, but honourable members will be able to get accommodation at reasonable rates, and they may even be agreeably surprised. I do not think we need worry very much about the cost of accommodation in view of the fact that Parliament has met only 39 days out of 365. I desire, however, to refer to the long periods which elapse between the adjournment and the meeting of Parliament. During the last two or three years, Parliament has not met as frequently as it should.

If Parliament is to remain closed, as in the past, there will he no necessity for these salaries to be Members will provided. In this country to-day there is a tendency to get away from parliamentary discussions of important matters that should be considered by the representatives of the people, and for a small minority forming the Cabinet to operate a form of dictatorship. Honourable members generally have no opportunity to ventilate grievances which they desire to bring under the notice of this House, and reforms which they believe to be urgently necessary.

138,Mr Ward,"I am endeavouring to attend the Melbourne Oup or the Sydney Show. There are many matters which should be discussed but for which notime is allowed. As an illustration of the attitude of the Government, only this week, although Parliament just resumed its sittings after an adjournment, of several months, Government members were anxious to rush away to their homes. They asked the members of the Opposition to agree to complete the consideration of this bill by 6 o'clock this afterkeep their hotels "" exclusive"", they ennoon in order that they might catch the evening train to their homes. The only reason why the House is now sitting is because the Opposition rejected the Government's proposals. Ministers know that if they were to get away from Canberra to-night they would have to gag this legislation through and they feared press criticism of such tactics in view of the fact that they had closed the House for so many months. As a member of Parliament I take my position seriously. I represent an important constituency. other members, I do not say that I represent all sections of the community; I represent the workers-in my opinion, the most important section in the community. wish to discuss in this Parliament concerning their welfare, and the Government should give us an assurance that the elected representatives of the people will be given opportunities to express their views, and that Parliament will remain open so long as members desire to ventilate grievances on the floor of this House. In regard to hotel accommodation for honourable members, the Minister has given to us his personal guarantee. may have given it in good faith, but if he is so sure that honourable members will be well catered for and that accommodation will be available at reasonable rates, why should not that condition be embodied in the lease contract? yet been signed. an undertaking that such a clause will be inserted in the contract? believe that members of Parliament are provided with free accommodation when they come to Canberra, and some of them are amazed when they are told that we have to pay such a high tariff for accommodation. They say "" Why not go elsewhere?"" not realizing the conditions in this city. I do not know what the intentions of the lessees may be in this instance, but there have been cases when the lessees of particular hotels, providing they are getting sufficient patronage, have limited their accommodation to certain classes of people. In a desire to courage the patronage only of members of aristocratic clubs. Labour members want a guarantee that some provision will be inserted in the lease, to assure to them good accommodation on reasonable terms. Mr E. P. HARRISON (Bendigo) [11.28] -Included in the latest list of additions to the Parliamentary Library are numerous books which I believe should not have been added to the collection. Amongst them. I find-The Emperor Gains; Green Fields and Unlike some Fantasy: an open-air book; Skipper My Chum: and other true dog stories; Sea Birds Simplified; Thirty Years with the Philippine Head-Hunters; Psyche and Eros: Romeo and Juliet: two poems; The There are many matters we Modern Rake's Progress; Reminiscences of an Octogenarian; Robert Bruce, King of Scots; A Modem Sinbad; "" Tommy"" : "" B ill of No-Man's L a n d "" ; A Parson's Daughter. There are also several publications relating to psychology, which may or may not be interesting. A recent addition is a book on etiquette which, I fear, has not been read by many honourable members. The Library Committee should provide books useful to us in our deliberations, He particularly those dealing with international affairs, and in that way assist us to understand many of the problems with which Australia is confronted. the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr E. F.

Books which may assist us in our deliberations in this chamber are provided, but certain classes of light literature are also made available for our use when travelling or during our leisure moments in Canberra. It is the responsibility of the Library Committee to cater for all tastes. The honourable member suggested that there should be more books on international affairs, but I have a very shrewd suspicion that if additional works of that nature were provided he would wish to censor them. Provision is made in the schedule for salaries and payments in the nature of salaries and general expenses in connection with the Parliament. It is a scandal that the attendants at the Federal Members' Rooms in the capital cities are paid such low wages in comparison with the rates received by men performing similar work in Canberra and elsewhere. men in charge of these rooms have to exercise a great deal of tact in interviewing transmit telephone and other messages, and generally carry out important duties. I know that this matter can be discussed more appropriately when the Estimates are before the committee, but as restoration is being made to public servants in receipt of high salaries, it is the duty of the Government to give more consideration to these lowly-paid officers. The amount provided in this schedule for the maintenance of members' rooms in capital cities, including furniture, and salaries of attendants is only £1,150 which I know is for only a portion of the year. We have a very efficient staff in Sydney attending to the requirements of honourable members, and I trust the Assistant Treasurer ( MrI ask the Minister representing the MinisCasey) will inform the committee that the Government intends to increase the remuneration of these officers who at present are shockingly underpaid. If they are at a dead-end with small prospect of promotion, their status should be Improved, and their salaries increased. support the plea of the honourable of the British authorities to communicate member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) on behalf of the attendants at Federal Members' Rooms who are receiving very little in excess of the basic wage. As these men have to exercise considerable care in interviewing callers, handle valuable correspondence, and generally to undertake work of an important character, they are entitled to a higher remuneration than they now receive. 1 trust that the Government will give immediate consideration to this reasonable request. support the remarks of the honourable members for East Sydney( Mr Ward) and Darling( Mr Clark), on behalf of the attendants at Federal Members' Rooms. The work undertaken by the officers in Sydney is of a responsible nature, and should be more adequately remunerated.

It is but natural that honourable members should watch these matters very closely, and wish to have supplied to them the most authentic information. Either the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) or the Minister for External Affairs should also furnish information concerning the Imperial Defence Committee. I have read in the press, but have not been advised officially by the Minister for External Affairs, that a body termed the Imperial Defence Committee has been set up overseas, and that Australia is to-day represented upon it. No one has yet been informed as to what its particular functions or powers may be, or as to how far the Government has committed Australia in regard to its decisions. The people are entitled to a knowledge of these matters, and Labour repre^ sentatives in this House desire to be placed in a position to advise their constituents of what is occurring. I know that governments adopt the policy of not telling the people too much. present case, however, very grave issues are involved. Australia may have been committed to participation in war, should that occur, and it is necessary that the general public should be re-assured on the point. The withholding of information from the elected representatives of the people, who have to rely upon press reports of events overseas, is nothing short of scandalous. the Government will treat this matter as it should be treated; that at the earliest possible moment it will make available for the perusal of honourable members the information it has received or will make frequent statements in this House in regard to what is happening. The Prime Minister should also state definitely and exactly to what he has committed this country. We have heard a good deal about conferences overseas in regard to meat, beef, wool, and wheat; but so far nothing has been disclosed of the secret conferences in connection with war preparations, and the foreign policy of the Government. We are entitled to know exactly how far this country is expected to co-operate with Great Britain in the event of war with some foreign nation. We are not asking for special consideration, but merely for information which is in the hands of the Government. Parliament is the place where these things should be made known. Question put.
