B ill presented, and read a first time. Minister and Minister for Defence) I regret to inform honourable members of the death of Mr Samuel Dennis, a former member of this House, which occurred in Melbourne on the 28th January. The late gentleman was elected to the House of Representatives for the D i v i sion of Batman at the general elections in 1931, and was defeated at the general elections in 1934. I was not a member of the House during the period that he occupied a seat, consequently I had not personally made his acquaintance; but I know of his work, and of the high personal esteem in which he was held by his fellow members. It was, however, more particularly in the sphere, of local government that Mr. Dennis gave outstanding service. He was for 36 years a member of the Northeoto Council, and twice during that period occupied the position of mayor. He represented the council on the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works for many years, and acted as vice-chairSI February, 1945. man of the board. He was also closely associated with church and sporting club organizations, and his loss will be severely felt throughout the district in which he resided. Our sympathy goes out to the widow and family of one who has left behind a valuable record of public service. I move That tin's House records its sincere regret at the death of Mr Samuel Dennis, a former member of the House of Representatives for the Division of Batman, places on record its appreciation of his meritorious public service and tenders its deep sympathy to his widow and the members of his family in their bereavement. the Opposition) I second the motion. As the Prime Minister( Mr Curtin) has pointed out, the great bulk of a long period of public service rendered by the late gentleman was rendered in municipal politics; though he was in this House for",9,Appropriation Act 1945 46 Mo 33 Of 1945

How many war-time foodstuff contracts have been entered into with the United Kingdom Government? 2. ""What was the total supply of each commodity in each contract for which the Commonwealth Government committed itself? 8. By how much did the supplied commodity exceed or fal l short of the contract? T he answer to the honourable member's questions is as f o l l o w s : The supply of foodstuffs to the United Kingdom has in many cases been arranged as purchases of exportable surpluses. Therefore, it may more satisfactorily suit the honourable member's purpose if answers to his question bo set out as follows:Nnaar -A t the outbreak of war the British Government arranged to purchase all the 7 POOL. exportable surpluses of sugar from the Dominions and Colonies, and to allocate it iu accordance with the needs of the United Net at Nations.
