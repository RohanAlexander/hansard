Wednesday, 10 March 2010 ----Swan Electorate: Brightwater Oats Street Brightwater Oats Street home in East Victoria Park in my electorate of Swan. Brightwater Oats Street provides a wide range of specialist services for people with brain injury and other neurological disorders. The care is focused on helping clients achieve their often difficult journey back to independent living after discharge from hospital. The program has been running since 1991 under the direction of its CEO, and 2009 Western Australian of the Year, Dr Penny Flett. Last week it was fantastic to be able to meet three of the graduates of the program, and I would like to share some of their stories with you today, as they give a good idea of the inspirational work of Brightwater and the dedication of the patients. Stuart MacPherson sustained a brain injury 15 years prior to coming to Oats Street in 2008. When Stuart came to the centre, he was still suffering from the effects of his brain injury. He needed to relearn how to budget, how to plan and how to focus on tasks he was undertaking. Stuart also needed assistance to relearn general social skills, something that is commonly lost after a brain injury. I notice the member for Cowan, an ex-Defence Force person. Stuart was also ex-Army, so he had lost his job with the Army. But in July 2009 Stuart left Oats Street and he is now living independently in the community, although he still receives some support from Brightwater. I know he was going for a job interview on Monday, so I hope he was successful with that. I also met June Litton, who arrived at Oats Street having spent the first four months of her recovery as a patient at Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital and the Shenton Park Rehabilitation Hospital. June was determined to return to the workforce, and commendably she secured a job as a cleaner at Oats Street while still a client there. Thanks to the support of Brightwater and June’s determination, she now lives independently whilst continuing to work for Brightwater. The final story I want to read is that of Gail Pilton. In February 2008, Gail was found unconscious in her garden by her son. She had suffered a brain haemorrhage, and she spent seven months as a patient at Royal Perth Hospital before moving to Oats Street in September 2008. Undergoing brain surgery to prevent any further brain damage, Gail continued to have problems with her memory as well as planning and problem-solving skills. Gail’s progress at Brightwater means that she has now moved into her own unit in Manning. I would like to congratulate all the staff and graduates at Brightwater Oats Street for their dedication and care and the professionalism that they show. I understand that the board and senior management team are looking to redevelop the site at Oats Street. According to the group, the facility and building are now more than 40 years old and are costly to maintain and operate. The group wants to create a modern purpose-built complex. A recent $277,000 grant announced by the state government should help it to get close to achieving that, and I implore the federal government to look at helping to fund them as well.

64,Mr Irons (Swan) (9.30 Am),"Last week I met with the staff and graduates of theGorton Electorate: Gorton Young Leaders Awards that we would all agree that it is important to encourage and support young people who demonstrate a commitment to their communities and to active public leadership. It is for this reason that last year I established the Gorton Young Leaders Awards. The Gorton Young Leaders Awards recognise local young people who have shown an exceptional commitment to public service, specifically through involvement in voluntary work, student leadership or community service. I am extremely pleased to inform the House that the electorate of Gorton has produced some outstanding young leaders who have demonstrated a commendable level of commitment to their communities and to greater public life. The achievements of these leaders were diverse, ranging from sporting accolades and volunteer work for a refugee-tutoring program to charity work for the Victorian bushfires relief fund and the St Vincent de Paul Society. Sixteen former year 12 students from across seven schools were awarded a Gorton Young Leaders Award for 2009. The winners are as follows: from Brimbank College, Yvonne Masaga and Konrad Sosnowki; from Catholic Regional College, Sydenham, Breanna Slattery, Justin Sepe, Steven Mazziol and David Szostak; from Copperfield College, Linda Sahakian and Daniel Viviers; from Deer Park Secondary College, Rosa Solomon and Rhys Lawler; from Keilor Downs Secondary College, Angela Pereira and Ryan Buhagiar; from Marian College, Adora Tran and Angela Lieu; and, from Taylors Lakes Secondary College, Michelle Pollacco and Thomas Yankos. Last month I had the great pleasure and privilege of meeting these young leaders at a morning tea that was convened in my electorate office in Keilor. I would like to thank my electorate staff for providing that opportunity. It was a great event. It allowed us to discuss their efforts-not only what they do in the curricular area of school but also what they do in the extracurricular area: providing support in the community, as I said, and involving themselves in very important altruistic initiatives. I look forward to charting the progress of these young leaders in the years ahead. I am sure the House will join me in congratulating them on their efforts and wishing them well in the future. Indeed, if the Gorton voters allow me, I certainly look forward to acknowledging the 2010 Gorton Young Leaders Award recipients in about a year from now. It is a magnificent tribute to the efforts of those young people as well as a tribute to their parents and families. In the end, it is important that as local leaders we acknowledge such good work, and for that reason this type of award will continue, I hope, for many a year.

Until recently his wife, Nanette, was employed by a local insulation company, Albury Wodonga Total Insulation, but due to the government’s rushed and ill-devised scheme-about which we heard from the finance minister that the government did not have time to cross the Ts and dot the Is-and its subsequent panicked withdrawal, Nanette was put off, as were many other workers.

When the government pulled the rug out from beneath the insulation industry, the then minister, Mr Garrett, made an assurance that compensation would be delivered to those affected by the withdrawal of the program. The government assured those affected that the compensation would be fast tracked and made available immediately, but when Nanette went to Centrelink to access compensation payments she was told that it would be 13 weeks before she would receive any form of payment. Mr and Mrs Storey, who are both 61 years of age, are working as hard as they can to try to plan for their retirement-after all, they have been told that they have to work longer. They are responsible people who have been honest, hard workers for their whole lives. Nanette is now out of work and without any form of income for 13 weeks. I have written to the new minister responsible seeking an explanation as to why it will take 13 weeks for Nanette to receive any payment and why it was claimed that these payments would be fast tracked if they would take more than three months to receive. When Mr Rudd and his ‘kitchen cabinet’ were thinking about ways to throw away as much money as possible, as quickly as possible, they neglected to think about the real impacts of a poorly thought out, poorly monitored and poorly implemented program on hard-working Australians. (Time expired) Werriwa Electorate: Hospitals change to Australia’s health and hospitals system since the introduction of Medicare. This announcement was certainly welcome in my electorate, where local people had been saying for some time that the Australian government needed to take some responsibility for health and hospitals in our community and that they required real change. We have heard the concerns and now we are acting on those and attempting to deliver a better, more coordinated and targeted health system. We are trying to end the bickering between levels of government. It is important across south-west Sydney to know precisely what the Rudd government’s national health and hospital network will mean for local hospital and health services. The simple question in this situation must always be: do people want a better health system? It is simple. We know that no hospital system and no health system is ever going to deliver a perfect result all the time, but as a nation we can do better. Doctors and nurses in my local community are saying to me that they want us to provide funding certainty into the future so they can get on and do their job in delivering better health outcomes for their local communities. The important thing to remember is that this plan will be nationally funded, meaning that more money will be available to meet rising health costs. Significantly, and very importantly, services will be locally run. We will empower local doctors and nurses with local expertise to make important decisions about local health initiatives. They will become more efficient and operate with less waste, and that will help to free up the resources to deliver more services and beds. MAIN COMMITTEE",120,Constituency Statements
67,Mr Hayes (Werriwa) (9.39 Am),"Last week the Prime Minister announced the biggestDoctors and nurses are backing these reforms. The Australian Nursing Federation and the AMA are publicly supporting the Prime Minister for taking responsibility for major health reform in this country. I note with some interest that both my local newspapers, the Campbelltown Macarthur Advertiser and the Macarthur Chronicle, are reporting that local doctors have broadly supported the federal government’s proposed takeover of hospitals. I also note the comments of the state MP for Macquarie Fields and local paediatrician, Dr Andrew McDonald. He said: This has been a very positive move from Kevin Rudd… This was also supported by the New South Wales pre-eminent paediatrician, Dr Michael Freelander. Professor Brad Frankum from the University of Western Sydney medical school said: I think most people believe a reform is long overdue so I’m supporting reform, in particular reform that attempts to break down the barriers between state and federal. This was certainly borne out by the most recent Nielsen poll, which showed 79 per cent of voters were backing this system, whereas in New South Wales it was even stronger at 85 per cent. We are determined to take real action and make real changes to the hospital system for the better of all Australians. (Time expired) Paterson Electorate: Hospitals page of the Daily Telegraph. The headline read ‘The hit list-Revealed: the 117 health services at risk of closing’. The article by Simon Benson read: THIS is the list of 117 NSW hospitals senior health clinicians claim will struggle to survive under Kevin Rudd’s health reforms. It went on to say: All are currently block-funded and considered financially unviable under the Federal Government’s plans for a pay-for-service model. They don’t perform enough medical procedures to fund their own existence. In my electorate, the target hit list includes the Gloucester Soldiers Memorial Hospital, the Bulahdelah Community Hospital, the Nelson Bay District Hospital and the Dungog Community Hospital. The report by Simon Benson went on: NSW Health officials, including some of the country’s leading surgeons, claimed more than 100 NSW hospitals were at risk of becoming financially unviable under what is known as a casemix-or activity-based-funding. Professor Bob Farnsworth, chair of the Sydney Illawarra Area Health Service’s health advisory council, said Mr Rudd’s reforms were “appalling” and “potentially a disaster” for NSW. “It is taking healthcare in NSW back 20 years,” he said. It gets even worse. John Deeble, the co-architect of Medicare, was quoted in an article in the Sydney Morning Herald today as saying that the $50 billion reform package was ‘largely spin’.

68,Mr Baldwin (Paterson) (9.42 Am),"Last Friday my constituents awoke to read the frontI am very concerned. The hospitals in my electorate, those small regional hospitals, are important for the health benefit of our community. They are important for the employment and economic viability of those small communities, and they are the essence of community spirit. This Prime Minister and Premier Keneally need to come out and rule out any closure of hospitals in my electorate. What we will see is a consolidation into the John Hunter, Maitland and Mater hospitals and that will have a dire effect. I do not think that this Prime Minister nor the Premier of New South Wales understand what it is like to sit in an ambulance and travel for an hour and a half to the closest hospital-which is what could happen if they shut down these hospitals in my electorate. I am calling on the Prime Minister and the Premier to be strong. If ever I saw evidence that they wanted to put more pressure on the major public hospitals, I saw it last night when, again, there was the push to push through the Senate the private health insurance rebate reduction scheme. What they should be doing is alleviating the pressure on public hospitals, and you will not do that by closing down the small regional and rural hospitals in areas such as my electorate.

Blaxland Electorate: Urban Theatre Projects Blaxland Electorate: Bankstown Arts Centre is a good news story! Bankstown has produced some of Australia’s greatest sporting champions: John and Ilsa Konrads, Steve and Mark Waugh, Ian Thorpe, Jeff Thomson and Len Pascoe. What is less well known is that it has produced some of Australia’s most talented artists: Bryan Brown, Human Nature and AC/DC are all Bankstown boys. It is also the home of Urban Theatre Projects, a first-class theatre company telling stories of the suburbs-gritty, reallife, outstanding work-and taking them to the world. Their latest production is called The Fence. In November, the parliament came together to apologise to half a million Forgotten Australians-men and women who grew up in orphanages and institutions, abused, mistreated and forgotten. The Fence tells their story-the story of people who do not know how to love because no-one ever loved them; people who do not know how to be parents because they never had them. The title for the play was inspired by a man who went into an institution at the age of four. All he remembers of the next 12 years is the fence that kept him in. It is powerful, painful and compelling. I want to thank the artistic director, Alicia Talbot, and the executive producer, Michelle Kotevski, for bringing this important story to the stage. Their work will help ensure that the light that we have shone on a dark chapter of Australia’s history is not allowed to dim. At this year’s Sydney Festival, The Fence played to near sell-out audiences. Now they are hoping to take it around Australia. The international arts community is also taking note.

They have also been asked to make a new work for a Korean festival and, much closer to home, a new work here in Canberra. All of this has been achieved from a small office in Bankstown and a storeroom with no air conditioning that doubles as a rehearsal space. Fortunately, this is about to change. Work is now underway on a $5.8 million Bankstown arts centre, and I am glad to say that half the funding for that project comes from the Rudd government’s economic stimulus plan. When it is completed in November the centre will house under one roof for the first time the Bankstown Arts Society, the Bankstown Theatrical Society, the Bankstown and District Lapidary Club, the Bankstown Youth Development Service and, of course, Urban Theatre Projects. The site of the arts centre used to be the Bankstown Olympic pool, where champions like John and Ilsa Konrads once trained. It is kind of fitting, then, that Urban Theatre Projects will be based here, producing world-class theatre and helping forge for Bankstown a reputation for excellence in the arts-something long overdue. Greenway Electorate: Hospitals tals in my community. My local community is deeply concerned that the Prime Minister’s announcement of last week could threaten services at Springwood Hospital, and the Sydney West Area Health Service. The Daily Telegraph last Friday exposed the threat to health services in the Blue Mountains. It singled out Springwood Hospital as one that would see major funding cuts and potential closure under the Rudd government’s so-called health reforms. Under the proposed casemix funding model, the same fee will be paid for procedures performed in Springwood as in Sydney. This means that hospitals that are already underresourced and communities on the outskirts of cities, like Springwood and Katoomba, will struggle to make ends meet as they battle with uncertain projected income and with paying for more equipment and medical supplies. Services at these hospitals are already overstretched, and access to services has been cut. We see it in Katoomba Hospital, which has no maternity unit. Women are having to travel to Penrith and, while travelling, are giving birth on the side of the road. This is unacceptable in the 21st century in Greater Western Sydney and particularly in the Blue Mountains. People living on the outskirts of large cities travel far enough already. They should not be forced to travel further for essential health services. These grave weaknesses have already been proven by other states that tried this funding model and turned their backs on it 10 years ago. It is not viable. It was not a viable option then and it is still not a viable option for many hospitals now. It is severely disappointing to see that there is only one line in an 82-page document with detail about the impact Labor’s proposal will have on hospitals such as Springwood and Katoomba, proving that they are still a city-centric government and have spared no thought for people and residents living on the outskirts of large cities and for regional and rural communities that already have underresourced hospitals and less access to services. In the case of emergencies-for example, a quick birth-somebody giving birth to a baby that is going to be very rapid has no access to such a service in the Blue Mountains. I call on the Prime Minister to rule out any closure or cut to services at Springwood Hospital or in the Blue Mountains and to give a guarantee that funding to already under-resourced MAIN COMMITTEE",123,Constituency Statements

Bishop Kevin Manning Bishop Anthony Fisher OP Kevin Manning and the installation of Anthony Fisher OP as the third bishop of the Diocese of Parramatta. Kevin Manning served as bishop of the diocese for the past 13 years. As one of seven children growing up in Coolah, his devotion to the Catholic faith and his calling to the priesthood manifested themselves early in his life. Bishop Manning left school at the age of 14 to work and help support his family, and it was these early experiences of hardship and the desire to share what little one had with those who had nothing that informed Bishop Manning’s deep sense of social justice. Having entered the priesthood and trained at St Columba’s at Springwood, Bishop Manning was selected to complete his training in Rome and was ordained there in 1961. As Bishop of Parramatta, he helped to shepherd the diocese to an era of continued growth at a time when religious worship nationally has trended downward. In my own community, I was pleased to recently attend the blessing of a new church at Glenmore Park, Padre Pio, one of the last official ceremonies Bishop Manning presided over in his role. He also made clear statements about the moral trajectories of public policies like Work Choices, which he famously characterised as ‘an inherent affront to human dignity’, and he sought to outstretch a hand of friendship to other faiths, particularly the Muslim community, saying, ‘All people have a single origin; we are all children of God.’ He also oversaw the construction and dedication of the new St Patrick’s Cathedral in Parramatta after the old cathedral was gutted by fire in 1996, and it stands as a testament to the strength of the diocese during his tenure and hopefully for decades to come. I would like to thank Bishop Manning for his decades of tireless dedication to his flock, and I wish him well as he retires to Glenbrook. Bishop Anthony Fisher OP was installed as the third Bishop of Parramatta, and I had the honour of attending his installation mass last week at St Patrick’s Cathedral. Bishop Fisher comes to the role with a wide range of life experience. A former lawyer with Clayton Utz and dux of St Ignatius Riverview, Bishop Fisher answered his calling after backpacking around Europe and through the Holy Land in 1984. He joined the Dominicans and was later ordained in 1991. An author and academic, Bishop Fisher completed a doctorate of philosophy at Oxford University and lectured at the Australian Catholic University. As well as serving as a parish priest, Bishop Fisher has taken on important roles in the church’s activities, coordinating the World Youth Day celebrations in Sydney in 2008. Just as famous, I am told, for his cooking as for his scholarship, Bishop Fisher is the youngest bishop in Australia and will preside over one of the youngest, largest and fastest growing dioceses in the country. I know that all Catholics in the diocese welcome Bishop Fisher to his new leadership role, and we look forward to the important contribution he will no doubt make over the coming years.

73,Mr Simpkins (Cowan) (9.54 Am),"I recently visited Whitfords Volunteer Sea Rescueis one of three volunteer groups, together with Sea Search Fremantle and Cockburn Volunteer Sea Search and Rescue, that are contracted to provide first-responder rescue services off the coast of the greater Perth area. With almost 100 members, the group is the largest and one of the busiest volunteer sea rescue groups in WA, performing approximately 300 rescues each year. Of those members, not one is in a paid position, yet they undertake regular weekend duties and are often on call. The volunteers of the group perform their duties as crew on the boats, radio operators, support and administration personnel as well as trainers. Apart from their core task of being first responders for rescue, in a related task they also keep track of boats that have logged on with them to check that they all return as planned. This task keeps the radio operators in their operations centre very busy. The Whitfords Volunteer Sea Rescue Group also conducts training courses including the obligatory recreational skippers licence and coastal navigation courses. The Whitfords Volunteer Sea Rescue Group is something of an institution in the northern suburbs of Perth. Many a boat owner has come to appreciate their dedicated service to the community, and I know they are highly regarded. It was recently reported that there was almost a 50 per cent increase in the number of call-outs for the Whitfords Volunteer Sea Rescue Group during the first part of the summer boat season. This demonstrates the need for a professional and highly effective rescue service, and this is provided in the northern suburbs by the Whitfords sea rescue group. These increases in call-outs also underline the need for such services to be sought only in true emergency situations and never as a hoax. Unfortunately, Scott Bradley Pike, a hoax caller in October 2009, cost the general community and sea rescue services a great deal of time, effort and money by pretending to be a boat owner in distress. He was found by the police and in January he was sentenced to six months jail and a fine of over $50,000. This will be a warning to those who may be tempted in the future to endanger lives and waste resources by diverting emergency services from their duties when there is no emergency. The Whitfords group is run on a very tight budget, receiving some funding from the state government, but it also generates revenue for operating expenses from the conduct of sausage sizzles, the sale of radio call sign memberships and other activities such as running training courses. It should be remembered that the fuel for the boats and other overheads have to be paid for out of the funding grant and these sorts of fundraisers. In my visit I met the commander, Geoff Sparrow; Joss Dwyer, the OIC of Operations; and a number of the volunteers. I would also particularly like to thank Roger Howell for organising my visit and a demonstration on one of the boats. The Whitfords Volunteer Sea Rescue Group is a highly dedicated and committed team. On behalf of my constituents I thank them and I honour them for the great job they do. Bass Electorate: Australian Youth Forum Ms CAMPBELL (Bass) (9.57 am)-I wish to speak today in relation to the Australian Youth Forum. The AYF is run by the Rudd Labor government as a communication channel between the government and young people aged between 15 and 24 years as well as the organisations that work with, for and on behalf of young people. I had the pleasure of having Minister Kate Ellis in Launceston on 1 March to hold the second Youth Forum in the country within my electorate of Bass. The Launceston forum engaged young people and the youth MAIN COMMITTEE sector in an ongoing public debate and opened the floor to getting input on important local issues and practical solutions that will affect young people’s lives now and into the future within the electorate. The AYF engages young people through the AYF website, and also in person at forums of this type within the community and through community activities. It brings young people, the youth sector and the Australian government closer together and gives young people the opportunity to be heard. On this note, I would particularly like to mention Emma Malouf, a participant at the forum from St Michael’s Association. Emma is an amazing young woman who at this particular forum had the courage of her convictions to stand before a room of her peers and fellow youths and admit to once being a bully to her sister. Furthermore, she said that from her own experience of bullying at school due to her disability she realised what her sister must have gone through. This was a reflective moment in the forum where a lot of those present were extremely proud and open about their experiences. In closing, I would like to thank Minister Ellis for coming to Bass at my request for a second time and hosting the Youth Forum. I would like to thank those present for their input and contribution on the day and I would also like to thank Rick Martin, who ran the event absolutely amazingly. The youth of today are indeed our future and I believe we as elected representatives need to continually engage and encourage them to voice their concerns and opinions. The AYF is effective in doing this and I commend the forum to all members of parliament and recommend the AYF as a real opportunity for everyone in this House to engage with young people so that young people and their voices can be heard. time for members’ constituency statements has concluded.

The coalition supports this bill. It builds on measures that we put in place in government to ensure that Australian Antarctic Territory is protected, that it is guaranteed not just for the present generations but for generations many decades and centuries down the track. Antarctica is a place of majestic beauty, and it is a joint responsibility of all sides of this House to take steps to protect it, to ensure and to guarantee that Antarctica will remain a pristine wilderness for generations and centuries hence. This particular bill does a number of basic, simple things. It is not an enormous bill in and of itself, but it aims to amend the Antarctic Treaty (Environment Protection) Act 1980, a Fraser government bill, to broaden the definitions of flora and fauna protected and not permitted to be brought into Antarctica. In essence the key amendments are these: firstly, to give authority to the minister to include invertebrates as specially protected species, and it prohibits invertebrates being taken from Antarctica; secondly, it broadens the definition of certain natural organisms; thirdly, it increases the safeguards of specially protected species-for example, the amendments tighten the permit system for introducing organisms into Antarctica; and, MAIN COMMITTEE",125,Constituency Statements

75,Mr Hunt (Flinders) (10.00 Am),"It gives me great pleasure to rise to speak on the Antfourthly, it strengthens offences relating to accidental introduction of non-native organisms by visitors to Antarctica. This adds a layer of additional protection to those already in place under the original Fraser government legislation. The broader context is this: the Antarctic Treaty and the Madrid protocol set out the fundamental basis for an international cooperative regime for the preservation, maintenance and long-term protections for the great Antarctic continent and the waters around it. Australia is one of 12 original signatories to the Antarctic Treaty. It was signed in Washington on 1 December 1959; it came into effect on 23 June 1961. Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Chile, France, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, South Africa, the UK, the US and the USSR were all signatories. The aim of the treaty was to protect Antarctica from environmental harm and not allow the continent to be the object of international discord, and those objectives have largely been achieved. The governing body of the treaty, the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting, meets annually. It continues to sign new parties with 47 parties now signed on, which includes the 12 original signatories and 35 acceding states. Only 28 of these signatories are permitted to participate in decision making. Against that background, I want to make it clear that we believe that the system has been working well. We are proud that the original international program was signed by a coalition government-the Menzies government-and that the legislation was brought in by the Fraser government and we are happy to add to and support the measures outlined in this bill. However, I would note that there is one element of discord-that is, prior to the 2007 federal election the Labor Party’s policy was: … Labor… will support World Heritage listingfor Antarcticaworking with other nations to give Antarctica the environmental status it deserves. Questions were raised at the time as to whether or not there was serious intent behind that proposal. On1 May 2006 Anthony Albanese, then shadow minister for the environment, issued a statement entitled ‘Make Antarctica a World Heritage Area, not a mine’. The statement said: A Federal Labor Government will support World Heritage listing … Not long after the election the policy was changed on the Labor Party website to: … Labor will work to further strengthen the Antarctic treaty system, with particular emphasis on enhancing environmental protection. The express, clear and absolute election promise was dropped. That sounds and feels like what has occurred with the more high-profile issue of whaling. The policy exists there in name-but the intention has been abandoned, the delivery has been abandoned and it will never occur. In June 2009 Senator Wong, representing the minister for the environment, stated in response to questions from Senator Bob Brown: … the benefits of a World Heritage listing have already been achieved or exceeded in Antarctica through the international agreement that comprises the Antarctic treaty system. Nothing had changed since prior to the election. The policy was a fraud upon the Australian people. It was not the reason the election was won or lost but it was part of an ongoing and systemic pattern of misleading in relation to environmental issues. We have seen the collapse MAIN COMMITTEE of the Home Insulation Program, with enormous human consequences; the collapse of the Green Loans Program; the termination of the solar rebate program, in direct breach of an election promise; and the express, clear and absolute breach of the election promise over whaling. It is important to point out to the House-this issue has not been widely known-that the Labor Party, prior to the election, promised that it would support World Heritage listing. It did so largely in response to the work of Geoff Mosley, a former head of the Australian Conservation Foundation, a person who is passionately committed to the long-term future of the Antarctic Treaty as well as the Antarctic wilderness area. The Labor Party made a promise that it never intended to keep. It broke that promise after the election. The very least that could happen is that it could apologise to Geoff Mosley. I note that in June 2009 there was a Senate motion calling on the Australian government to ‘pursue the lead role towards inscribing Antarctica on the World Cultural and Natural Heritage list’. The coalition supported the motion. The Labor Party opposed the motion. It was the very thing that they demanded and promised prior to the election; it was the very promise that was broken after the election. That is simply to put in context the pattern of misleading and deceptive conduct. However, this bill is a positive bill. We support it. I commend it to the House. Ms PARKE (Fremantle) (10.08 am)-I rise to support the Antarctic Treaty (Environment Protection) Amendment Bill 2010, which is designed to ensure that Australia’s legislation conforms to the revised international obligations contained under Annex II to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty. The protocol deals with the conservation of Antarctic flora and fauna. Essentially, this bill imports into Australian domestic law the more stringent protective arrangements contained in the international agreement known as the Madrid protocol. It is worth noting and celebrating the fact that Australia was the principal architect of this agreement, which significantly improves the protection afforded to Antarctic biodiversity. As the minister has indicated in relation to this bill, the important amendments it contains have the effect of adding a new provision that enables the minister to declare invertebrates as specially protected species and to set restrictions on the taking of native invertebrates; strengthening the existing protections for specially protected species; making the existing permit system more robust in order to tightly control any authorised introduction of organisms into the Antarctic; and updating and sharpening the offences that exist to ensure people take even greater precautions against the inadvertent introduction of exotic organisms into the Antarctic. This includes creating several new offences such as the offence of the accidental introduction of microorganisms, or indeed any organism brought to the Antarctic other than as food. Australia has long regarded the Antarctic as a region with which we have a special connection and therefore a special relationship and duty of care. There continues to be a strong sense in the community that Australia has a natural stewardship role when it comes to the Antarctic and that we exercise this role both on our own behalf and as a nation acting cooperatively in the best interests of all people and all living things. That is what a universal commitment to biodiversity conservation is all about. Australia’s modern role as one of the chief protectors of the Antarctic dates back to the middle of last century, by which stage several nations had established permanent research stations on the icy continent. The Antarctic Treaty was developed out of the International GeoMAIN COMMITTEE physical Year 1958-59 project, a multination research initiative focused on Antarctica and binding together the work of those national research stations. The treaty itself was signed on 1 December 1959 by 12 nations that had been active in that effort: Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Chile, France, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, South Africa, the United Kingdom, the United States and the USSR. The agreement covers everything south of 60 degrees latitude, and it is one of those documents remarkable now for its clarity, brevity and durability. In six pages and 14 articles the treaty requires, among other things: that Antarctica should be used exclusively for peaceful purposes; that there be a guaranteed freedom to conduct scientific research on a cooperative basis, including the exchange of scientific personnel and the free dissemination of research data; that there be no nuclear explosions or disposal of radioactive waste in Antarctica; that there be an observer and inspection regime to ensure treaty compliance; that parties give advance notice to one another of all expeditions; that signatory nations meet periodically to discuss measures to further the objectives of the treaty; and that parties observe both the stipulated settlement procedure and the established mechanism by which the treaty can be modified. This agreement, which entered into force on 23 June 1961, can be acceded to by any United Nations member state, and it currently has 47 signatories. Its potency as an international instrument is demonstrated by the nearly 40 years of cooperative consensus decision making that have evolved from the treaty and through the work undertaken in the annual Antarctic Treaty consultative meetings. From both the treaty and this meeting process have flowed a range of further agreements and a set of related organisations, which together are referred to as the Antarctic Treaty System. Those subsidiary agreements themselves include the Agreed Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora, adopted in 1964 to protect native animals and plants, to restrict the taking of birds and seals by the application of a permit system and to prevent the introduction of non-indigenous organisms; the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals, an agreement which establishes conservation standards for any hunting of seals, which thankfully did not resume in the 20th century and does not occur there now; and the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, adopted in 1980 in response to the unregulated fishing of krill, a key species within the Antarctic marine food chain. Importantly, this convention relied upon an ecosystem approach to rightly consider the Southern Ocean as a biosphere, consisting of an integrated set of species and marine environment conditions. This agreement continues to govern the sustainable fishing of wholly marine species in the Southern Ocean. The last component of the treaty system is the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty. This was adopted in 1991 to ensure that the full range of Antarctic protections was brought together in a consolidated, comprehensive and legally binding form. The protocol designates the Antarctic as a natural reserve devoted to peace and science. It prohibits mining, it requires that all proposed activities be subject to prior assessment for their environmental impacts and it requires that contingency plans for use in responding to environmental emergencies be developed. It is in the annexes to this protocol to the original Antarctic Treaty that detailed provisions for the protection and conservation of the Antarctic are contained. Annex II updates the rules specific to the protection of flora and fauna, and it is from annex II that the amendments in this bill derive their substance. MAIN COMMITTEE All that taken together is probably not the most fascinating narrative ever heard in this place, but such is the painstaking form and plain substance of human agreement at the international level. It is important stuff. It may not sing off the page, but agreements like the Antarctic Treaty constitute the black-and-white, multilateral commitment to clear and enforceable conservation standards. You would be hard pressed to find a better method and means of achieving international observance of agreed environmental management and preservation practices. This bill and these amendments are therefore a further important instalment of Australia’s participation in a very successful protection of the continent of Antarctica and of the Antarctic region as a whole. It is a conservation system that we have been a part of since the beginning and in which we have been an active and effective advocate. I commend the Minister for Environment Protection, Heritage and the Arts and his department for their excellent work in advancing the cause of Antarctic environmental protection. In this context a number of achievements from the reported year 2008-09 are worth noting-namely, the fact that through the International Polar Year cooperative research structure Australian scientists participated in 72 of the 228 endorsed research projects; that as the current conveners of three of the four working groups established by the advisory committee on the conservation of albatrosses and petrels, the department continued the work to address taxonomy issues and the gathering of seabird data in relation to population status and trends; that Australia secured an update to the Antarctic protected area management plans for Mawson’s Huts; and, finally and most significantly in relation to this debate, that it was at the April 2009 annual Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting that, in addition to tabling eight working papers and four information papers, Australia led and saw the resolution of the revision of Annex II to the Madrid protocol, which is the basis for the enhanced flora and fauna protections contained in this bill. It was the end of an eight-year process and it was an achievement that we should all recognise and celebrate. There is no doubt that we are living in a time when the pressure of human life on the environment that sustains us is taking a serious toll on the natural resources and biodiversity of planet earth. The growing human population is matched by an increasing draw on resources per head of population, and this inevitably spells danger for forests, for wetlands and for coastal and marine environments, and so it puts at risk all life that depends on those environmental systems. This includes human life. In recent decades the global community has come to focus more keenly on those things that we cannot help but share-the atmosphere, the oceans, the climate-as our growth as a species reaches a point where we test the limits of those commonly shared environmental conditions. As we particularly test the capacity of our oceans, our atmosphere and our climate to absorb our demands and our impact without detrimental consequence for life on earth, human and non-human alike, we confront the need to overcome an attitude which we have heard expressed in this place, an attitude that says we should not compromise our own consumption or seek to lessen our own impact unless other nations do so first. It is a recipe for inaction; it is not a recipe for the status quo because there is no status quo. There is only a steepening decline in the quality of our environment and in the biodiversity of our planet. It is a recipe for disaster. I have said before that I believe we as a civilisation are moving to an era that will be characterised by how we transcend the limitations inherent in a system defined by the autonomy MAIN COMMITTEE and primacy of the nation-state and by the rising and falling hegemonic balance between so called superpower groups. It may be that coming to regard one’s own time as the tipping point or knife edge of some critical point in human history is a conceit that every generation tends to form. YetI think it can be said without exaggeration that we are living in a period in which citizens and their governments will need to find the means to further overcome the current intrinsic resistance to global cooperation. It is one thing to say that multilateral institutions and processes are imperfect, a proposition nobody would dispute; it is another thing to say that the improvement of these institutions and processes is unnecessary and that our engagement and the effort to improve them to give them strength is unimportant. Next year in June the Antarctic Treaty will mark its 40th birthday. In the knowledge that international agreements are fragile things, the treaty allowed at the outset for any party to instigate a review of the agreement at the end of 30 years. Yet in 1991, rather than revising or weakening the treaty as it was, the parties instead reaffirmed the strength and necessity of the agreement by adopting a declaration that recorded the shared intention to maintain and further develop the operation of the Antarctic Treaty System. Few agreements have functioned as consistently well as this treaty in terms of promoting its objectives and presenting a model of this kind of multilateral cooperation. It has been noted by others that the Antarctic Treaty System represents one of the most effective sets of international agreements in operation today. Thanks to this system of cooperation, Antarctic research and monitoring has allowed the international scientific community to see and anticipate certain key atmospheric and climate trends. The ozone layer deterioration is an example, and our response to that problem would not have been as timely and effective without that science. Thanks to this system of conservation, Antarctica, one of the seven continents on earth, remains a fundamentally pristine natural environment and an environment free from both military hardware and territorial conflict. This bill is a relatively small and incremental piece of the Antarctic conservation mosaic, yet with its passage, which I strongly endorse, we will put in place another well-calibrated set of provisions to protect this crucial and beautiful part of the planet. arctica’, who died on 28 February 2010 in his ninety-eighth year. As described in the obituary in today’s Canberra Times, Mr Law was: … lecturing in physics at Melbourne University in 1947 [when he] became aware that the Australian Government, egged on by Sir Douglas Mawson, had established the Australian National Antarctic Research Exhibition to build meteorological and scientific stations on Heard and Macquarie islands in the sub-Antarctic and to reconnoitre the site for a permanent station on the Antarctic mainland. The government was looking for a chief scientific officer. He instinctively grasped that this mix of high adventure and science was tailor made for him. By 1949 [Phillip Law] became the acting officer in charge of the Antarctic Division… and directed its operations for the next 17 years, personally leading 28 voyages to Antarctica during which he … chose the sites and established bases at Mawson, David and Casey on … ice-free locations. Astonishingly, he also: … used the annual resupply voyages (despite being chronically seasick on every voyage) to explore 5000km of unknown coastline, and a million square kilometres of Greater Antarctica.

76,"Before I Finish, I Would Like To Pay Tribute To Phillip Garth Law, A Man Known As ‘ Mr Ant","Mr Law used to say that he was ‘one of the last people in the world who’s had the joy of new exploration’. Phil[lip] Law took a great interest in the living conditions of [people] on the Antarctic stations … [ensuring] there was a comprehensive library of … literature and popular novels, a gramophone and … records … [and] a formal dinner held every Sunday night [with wine]. He never stopped pushing the Australian government to properly resource Antarctic programs. He also wrote a number of books, including Antarctic Odyssey. Phillip Law remained interested in the Antarctic all of his life. His wife, Nel, who died in 1990, was a teacher, artist and writer. She was the first Australian woman to set foot on Antarctica when Mr Law took her, amid some controversy, in 1961 and she took the opportunity to do some paintings while down there. Phillip Law was decorated for his life’s work with a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1961, the Polar Medal in 1969, Officer of the Order of Australia in 1975 and Companion of the Order of Australia in 1995. He said about Antarctica: I think anyone who’s been to Antarctica becomes absolutely obsessed with the beauty and grandeur and magnitude of it all … and those rare moments of discovery when I landed on quite unknown shores and raised the Australian flag, and said ‘Here we are for the first time.’ I am grateful to the Canberra Times for providing this very lovely story about Mr Law. Australia and indeed the world owe a great deal to Phillip Law and his love of the Antarctic. He certainly deserves the title ‘ Mr Antarctica’. Dr WASHER (Moore) (10.22 am)-I rise to support the Antarctic Treaty (Environment Protection) Amendment Bill 2010. I have had a long-held interest in the Antarctic and had the privilege to visit there, at Minister Garrett’s invitation, in early 2009. The minister is in the chamber and I would like to thank him for that invitation. It was the end of what was a polar year-it was actually two years, so it should have been called a bipolar year-where Antarctic and Arctic scientists cooperated to do a lot of research. I was horrified to find the extent of acidification of the oceans of Antarctica among the problems of climate change. Australia claims 42 per cent of the Antarctic as its own territory. This claim constitutes six million square kilometres of the land mass. We also lay claim toA division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 10.24 am to 10.40 am which constitute 21 per cent of Australia’s marine jurisdiction. With these claims Australia has a serious commitment to its responsibility in ensuring the sustainable management of that territory. I believe that this is an important piece of legislation which gives effect to our newly revised obligations under annex II to the Madrid protocol as outlined in Measure 16 (2009) of which Australia was a principal architect. The bill amends the Antarctic Treaty (Environment Protection) Act 1980 to give the minister the authority to include invertebrates as specially protected species and prohibits the taking of invertebrates from Antarctica. It also broadens the definitions of organisms and increases safeguards for specially protected species. In support of these powers there is a strengthening of offences relating to accidental introduction of non-native organisms into Antarctica by visitors to Antarctica. This is increasingly critical as the impact of tourism to Antarctica needs to be managed in such a way as to limit MAIN COMMITTEE",132,Antarctic Treaty Environment Protection Amendment Bill 2010
77,Dr Washer,"We also lay claim to 2.9 million square kilometres of the Southern Oceanthe damage to this important continent. Australia has a proud history in the support of the broader Antarctic treaty system. It was one of the original 12 signatories to the 1961 Antarctic Treaty and has long supported the protection of that natural environment. Australia has had a continuing commitment to the strength and effectiveness of this treaty which aimed to protect Antarctica from environmental harm and to ensure that the continent did not become an object of international discord. This treaty is one of the world’s most successful disarmament agreements and is still supported by 75 per cent of the world’s population. Antarctica was reserved for peaceful purposes, scientific research and international scientific cooperation, and we can be proud of the part we have played in the ongoing development of legislation supporting the original ideals. As a result of our being a signatory to and supporting this treaty the Antarctic Treaty (Environment Protection) Act 1980 was enacted to strengthen scientific cooperation, to ensure environmental protection, to support the conservation of plants and animals and to preserve historic sites, to participate in information exchange and to assist in the conduct of appropriate tourism activities. Australia has been a world leader in science and research in Antarctica for nearly 100 years since Sir Douglas Mawson, one of Australia’s greatest explorers, led expeditions south. Australia will be gearing up to celebrate the centenary of his exploration of Antarctica between 1911 and 1914 and our resulting claims of territorial ownership. This bill further demonstrates our commitment to be at the forefront of international efforts to ensure the protection of this critical natural environment. As we see the effects of climate change it will be even more important that we legislate to ensure the greatest possible protection of this significant territory. The continent is significant to discovering climate change knowledge through the icesheets which can provide information critical to contemporary research. This bill under consideration is another step in ensuring the continued health of Antarctica’s flora and fauna. Through this bill Australia continues to support the stability and security of this significant area of our global environment. I commend this bill to the House. Arts) (10.44 am)-in reply-I thank the member for Moore for his comments and also acknowledge the remarks of my colleague, the member for Fremantle, identifying the long and proud history that Australia has had in relation to the Antarctic. It is this government’s profound conviction that it is important to hold the comprehensive protection of the Antarctic environment as one of our highest priorities. The Antarctic Treaty (Environment Protection) Amendment Bill 2010 before us now implements in law Australia’s obligations which have resulted from the review of annex II of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, the Madrid protocol, which this government and previous Labor governments in particular have provided significant support and input to. The fact is that Australia was the principal architect of the Madrid protocol, which established Antarctica as a region which would be subject to comprehensive environmental protection-a natural reserve devoted to peace and science. It is a considerable and significant achievement in our international political history. Successive Australian governments have recognised the importance for the protection of the environment to have that comprehensive component. I am particularly pleased that the opposition has commended this legislation. It is a reflection of our strong view that it is appropriate for us to continue with the existing regulaMAIN COMMITTEE",133,Antarctic Treaty Environment Protection Amendment Bill 2010
78,Mr Garrett (Kingsford Smith,"Minister for Environment Protection, Heritage and thetory framework in relation to both our domestic and our international obligations in respect of the Antarctic generally. I just make some final observations as I conclude. It is my very strong conviction that as more countries take an active interest in the Antarctic it is important for Australia to continue to play a leading role in efforts to realise both the global benefits of Antarctic science and also the urgency of continued environmental protection. We have a number of countries increasing research activities in the Antarctic in recent years. Additionally, the number of tourist visitors landing in Antarctica has expanded from some 12,000 in 2000-01 to around 33,000 in the 2007-08 Antarctic summer season. So clearly there is increasing interest and increasing pressure on the Antarctic continent and as a consequence our desire to see its adequate protection is strong and great. Whilst the purpose of this bill is to extend protection of Antarctic native flora and fauna, it remains the case that we are committed to advancing Australia’s strong interest there through continued funding of the intercontinental air link; developing our logistics capability to work more closely with those who are active in the Antarctic territory, including undertaking things like medivacs during this season on behalf of other countries; an inspection program under way whereby under the treaty itself Australia has and will continue to inspect the stations and activities of other countries in East Antarctica; and finally the development of a 10-year science strategic plan which seeks to encourage, guide and focus Antarctic and Southern Ocean research, delivering the maximum benefits to Australia and the international community as we seek to meet the global challenge of climate change, ocean acidification, population growth in the area and population pressures on the Antarctic generally, and the demands that the world has for food and energy security-the increasing human footprint on the Antarctic continent itself. This bill represents a necessary and important step in our ongoing protection of the Antarctic, and I commended to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time.

Main Committee adjourned at 10.50 am MAIN COMMITTEE Air Weapons Ranges (Question No. 1185) Mr Baldwin asked the Minister for Defence Personnel, Materiel and Science, in writing, on 4 February 2010: (1) Have any studies or reviews been conducted in the 10 years from 1 January 2000 investigating the ongoing viability and usefulness of Defence (a) air weapons ranges, (b) training areas, and (c) practice areas, including the Salt Ash Air Weapons Range (SAAWR). (2) Have alternatives to Defence weapons ranges, training areas and practice areas, including the ternatives accepted or rejected. (1) Yes. (2) The Defence Strategic Training Area and Ranges Review is the most recent and significant review of ranges. However, this document is classified and details of the findings can not be publicly released. Air Weapons Ranges (Question No. 1186) Mr Baldwin asked the Minister for Defence Personnel, Materiel and Science, in writing, on 4 February 2010: What considerations are made with respect to the selection of land for use as an air weapons range. Selection of an air weapons range needs to consider the following criteria as a minimum: Operational constraints such as characteristics of aircraft, training requirements, target requirements, noise, operating costs, range from the mother base, air safety requirements and air corridor requirements. Physical and environmental constraints such as topography, infrastructure, general land use (mining, forestry etc), population centres and environmentally sensitive areas. Australian Defence Force: Cadets Scheme (Question No. 1208) Mr Robert asked the Minister for Defence Personnel, Materiel and Science, in writing, on 9 February 2010: What has been the Government’s response to the ‘Review of the Australian Defence Force Cadets (ADFC) Scheme’ (Defence Force Review Panel, Canberra, 20 November 2008), and what action is being taken concerning paragraphs 2.8.7 and 2.8.8. The Government commissioned a review of the Australian Defence Force Cadets Scheme in June 2008 to make recommendations on actions required to improve the scheme to ensure that it is achieving its specific objectives in an efficient and effective manner. In May 2009, the Government accepted the Defence response to the review, agreeing to 30 of the 48 recommendations.

Instead, an alternative model was adopted which sees the intent of this recommendation preserved through changes to formalise and enhance the governance and accountability structure for the Cadet Scheme while preserving the administrative responsibilities vested in the Service Chiefs. The Vice Chief of the Defence Force, through the Cadet, Reserve and Employer Support Division, is responsible for coordinating implementation of the Review recommendations relating to governance, compliance, assurance, reporting and audit, development of joint policy and a shared services approach to areas such as IT, administration and business processes. Significant progress has been achieved in establishing a cadet governance framework through the creation of a hierarchy of strategic guidance committees and several crucial single issue working groups. Defence’s Management Audit Branch is to conduct an audit of aspects of the ADF Cadet Scheme commencing this financial year, including financial compliance, the adequacy of the processes of allocating funding to Cadets, the effectiveness of Cadet information technology systems and Occupational Health and Safety issues related to Cadets, including facilities and firearms.
