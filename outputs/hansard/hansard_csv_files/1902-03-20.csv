12,Sir William Mcmillan,"I ammind my right honourable friend committed the initial .blunder in stating that out of the volume of imports from oversea we should, owing to the protectionist character of the Tariff, have to deduct at one swoop the sum of £5,000,000. I protested against any such attempt to force the industrial life of Australia. I pointed out most clearly that we could not bring about such a change for many years to come, under any protectionist Tariff. The result has been that instead of tlie Treasurer being required to draw his revenue from imports valued at £21,000,000, hqhashad nearer£30,000,000 worth upon which to levy duties. The total imports into the Commonwealth from beyond the seas in 1899 were about £32,000,000, and deducting the narcotics and stimulants and' the imports on which fixed duties prevailed, it is as clear as poswhole position must be regarded as more or sible, as I stated to my right honourable friend, thatweshouldhaveabout£30,000,000 worth of imports upon which ad valorem duties might be levied. The basis of the whole scheme of finance was that after excluding the duties on narcotics and stimulants, and the fixed duties levied under, I think, Division IV . , there would be at least £30,000,000 worth of imports to operate on with an ad valorem duty of 10 per cent. W it h no free list, a 10 per cent, duty would yield the whole of the revenue required. Allowing for a moderate free list, however, 15 per cent, would be the highest point to which it would be necessary to go in order to bring in the revenue required by tlie Treasurer. Of course it was clear to every-, body that when on some of the items of a revenue character a very much higher rate of duty was imposed, and when many of the fixed duties yielded much more than was estimated by the Treasurer, the revenue would be very much increased. In the face of this very large surplus over the admitted requirements of the Treasurer, are we prepared to pass duties which in the aggregate will yield halta-million more than the Treasurer requires ? Whilst we are bound under the compact made with the States to provide for their financial necessities, we are not bound to do more. We know very well that with the complications existing before the Commonwealth was founded -we could not give all the States a surplus unless we created a Tariff which the Commonwealth could not possibly endure. I know that under this Tariff, as it is To my proposed, yielding a revenue which shows a surplus of half-a-million, there are still deficiences in the amounts which will be received by Queensland and Tasmania. I think, however, we ought to pause before we recognise the principle that the whole of Australia is to be burdened in order to create such symmetrical conditions that a surplus will be given to every State. I know that no State would like to be a borrower or a mendicant with regard to the Commonwealth, but we have to deal with a broad national policy in this case, and with all respect to the States, I say that it would be far better for them to give up a certain amount to the Commonwealth as a whole than to dislocate the whole of our finances. Therefore, we have a very serious position to face. As I said in my opening remarks, the less abnormal for the next two or three years, and that being so, we are inclined to propose that there should be moderate duties upon these items-no t the duties which the Government desires, but such as would at any rate recognise the principle that these goods are taxable. As the years go on, if it is found absolutely necessaiy to increase these duties, that can be done. We are not inclined, therefore, to ask that either kerosene, tea, or rice, or any of these articles, should be placed on the free list. matter we do not bind any individual member. We are squaring off the national finances, and must deal with this matter in a broad spirit. I do not know that there is essentially any party question involved in tlie duty on tea, because we might take up one or the other of two positions. AVe might say that the duty should be left alone as a sort of stand-by for the Treasurer, to be imposed if, in spite of the duties we have already passed, the Tariff does not yield sufficient to meet the requirements of the States. On the other hand, we might impose a moderate duty which would recognise the principle that tea is a fair subject of taxation for revenue purposes, and this duty could be either increased or decreased as the years go by. I wish this point to be distinctly understood from our side of the Chamber. Free-traders under a simple Tariff of a few items would certainly impose a duty on tea.",16,Honourable Members Hear Hear

14,Mr Wilks,Some of uswill.,17,Honourable Members Hear Hear
15,Sir William Mcmillan,"In thistraders. traders as a rule, carrying out the principles of Peel and Gladstone, would make the Tariff comprise only a few simple itemssomewhat similar to the Tariff introduced by the right honourable and learned member for Bast Sydneyi n New South Wales. This, I think, was probably the simplest and best Tariff in the world. The principle, that free-traders hold, as a rule, is that commodities of universal use -which are not made or grown in the country, and which cannot, therefore, be made the subject of a duty with a protective incidence, are, above all things, reasonable subjects for taxation. I honestly confess, however, although I intend to vote for a moderate duty on tea and kerosene, that the Tariff will operate unfairly to the great masses of the people of the interior, and that the position is a very difficult one. These people, who contribute £90,000,000 worth of the total of £112,000,000 of wealth which we produce yearly-that great class of toiling people in the interior of this country, away from the luxuries of the cities, who are the real pioneers and makers of Australia-ar e subjected to so much injustice under this Tariff that if any honourable member, although a free-trader, takes up the position that he must have compensation for these people, it cannot be wondered at. If the Government had been satisfied with a reasonable duty on almost every item in the Tariff, we should have conceded the duties on tea or kerosene, or anything else; but that has not been done. A t the same time. I feel that we must adopt a broader stand-point now that we have to deal with the last few items. We have fought strenuously, and, considering the position we occupied, we have succeeded beyond our expectations. We have, I am glad to say, had some of the moderate members on the Government side rallying round us when the Ministerial proposals were so extreme that even protectionists could not swallow them. We have done a great national work, and we have so altered the incidence of taxation under this Tariff that it is at least 50 per cent, better than when it was introduced. Speaking of the Tariff broadly as it is likely to emerge from this Chamber, I say that, in view of the abnormal character of the existing circumstances, and of the greatly differing conditions in the States, we have an unknown quantity to deal with. Although Freewe have not been fairly treated, although great injustice has been done to the working population, still, as a matter of finance, it will, upon the whole,, be wiser for us to allow a moderate duty to be imposed upon these items, and to watch the result hereafter. That is the position which I take up. To some extent I feel that the Tariff is one the results of which it is very difficult for the Treasurer to foresee. It is so complicated by exemptions, and by differential duties,. that I fear very great openings 'will exist in the future for fraud. It is not a Tariff framed in the interests of the honest trader, and it will be for the Minister for Trade and Customs to deal with the complications which will result from its operation. I am perfectly satisfied, from my little knowledge of business, that many of these divisions are so complicated by exemptions and by differential rates of duty that no Custom-house officer* in the world will be able to properly administer this Tariff. While the Treasurer has now shown that the total receipts from its operation will piwbably exceed his estimate by £500,000, the future still is before us, and it is a very unknown future. I strongly insist that the Commonwealth should not be overburdened with taxation in order to make the Tariff symmetrical for the sake of one or two States, but, nevertheless, that is a consideration which we cannot overlook. We know, for instance, that Tasmania already shows a deficiency of about £100,000. £110,000. the proportion of the revenue derived from the proposed duties which will be returned to Tasmania and Queensland will not make up their deficiency, still a few thousand pounds to a State containing only a small population is a very considerable matter. I do not wish to open up unnecessary debate, because we are all anxious that these, items shall be disposed of during the current week. As far as I am personally concerned -and I believe I speak for a good many honourable members upon this side of the ChamberI will endeavour to deal with . these items fairly and honestly from a revenue stand-point. A t the same time, I shall not consider it inconsistent for any honourable member upon this side of the",17,Honourable Members Hear Hear

19,Sir William Mcmillan,"AlthoughHouse, who, from the character of the Tariff as it has been framed, and from the injustice which has been done, considers it necessary, to vote in an opposite direction. that the Treasurer has given the Chamber every available data upon which to base opinions concerning the amount which will probably be derived from the operation of these revenue duties. Unfortunately, though he, has given us all the information at his command, it is not as complete as it ought to be under the circumstances. For instance, with regard to the revenue received during February, there are no figures available other than those for each division. script here if the honourable member would like to see it . not have an opportunity of perusing it an hour ago. Then, again, the accounts relating to the receipts from the duties operating upon oils have been so mixed up that it is impossible to ascertain the extent to which kerosene has been imported. To that degree, therefore, we are at a loss in criticising the Treasurer's estimate of the surer estimated that he would receive revenue which will probably be derived in the future. Just after the introduction of the Tariff, I expressed the opinion that the right honourable gentleman had considerably under-estimated the receipts from it . It seems to me that events have justified the prediction which I , in common with many others, then made. states that he has to increase his estimate for the current financial year-whic h covers a little under nine months of the operation of tlie Tariff-by £57S,000.. I contend, however, that that sum does not nearly represent the almost certain increase in the revenue which will accrue from the Tariff. The Treasurer's estimate of the receipts from Sth October last t ill 30th June next has been increased by £578,000. 33ut even this estimate of the probable revenue derivable from the duties comprised in the main part of the Tariff is not a cines, but so far he has collected only fair one to put before the country. For example, every person knows that when the section of this House with which I am associated put forward a number of items upon which they declared their intention of seeking either to reduce or abolish the duties imposed, a number of importers rived from a large number of those articles immediately entertained the fear that they was received during the first quarter of the would be left with stocks upon their hands year. which had paid a high duty if they cleared them at that particular period. The result is that from that date t ill now, there has been an absolutely restricted output of the articles comprised in the list put forward by the labour party, and the revenue has suffered accordingly. mouth trade with them. a hand to mouth trade in respect of kerosene. The bonds in New South Wales and Queensland are stocked with kerosene. The importers have been using up their old stocks and living from hand to mouth in the interim. Till a week or two ago the I have the manusame remark was applicable to timber, and it also applies to rice, tea, and a number of other articles. I will mention to the comI am sorry that I did mittee a few of the articles upon which the revenue received during the past five months bears no -proper relation to the amount likely to be received during a normal period. Upon spirits-takin g a pro rata estimate by dividing the total receipts by the number of months during which the Tariff has operated the Trea£500,000, whereas he actually received £390,000.

His estimate of the receipts from imported tobacco was £272,000, the actual reThe Treasurer now ceipts being £144,000. Similarly he calculated that the excise upon tobacco would yield £100,000, whereas the actual amount collected was £56,000. From, the excise upon sugar he anticipated collecting £123,000, whilst the receipts were £77,600. Upon blankets there was a falling-off from £125,000 estimated to £30,000 collected. His estimate of the revenue which would be obtained from oils was £67,000, whereas the actual receipts were £35,000, He also calculated that he would receive £27,000 from medi£14,000. The estimated receipts from rice were set down at £39,000, whereas the amount received was £26,000 ; whilst the estimated revenue from tea was £147,000, and the actual receipts £64,000.",18,Honourable Members Hear Hear

25,Sir Geohge Turner,"The revenue depoint presently. The total difference between the Treasurer's estimated revenue from the items I have mentioned and the actual receipts represents no less a sum than £649,000. Yet notwithstanding this huge deficiency other items of the Tariff have yielded such a large revenue that the receipts during five months are between £700,000 and £800,000 in excess of the Treasurer's total estimate. Sir GnoitGE TURNER -But that estimate was for a normal year, and not for this year. The estimate for a normal year was £1,000,000 more than for this year. During the first portion of the present financial year New South Wales had no duties operating. A normal year must naturally yield over £375,000 more than the present year in respect of that one State alone. Yet the contention of the Treasurer all along has been that the .receipts from the protective duties imposed will be a little less a few years hence than they are at the present time. WhatI am pointing out is that there is a total difference between the estimate of the Treasurer and the actual amount collected of nearly £1,400,000 in respect of the duties which are likely to be protective in their incidence. Of course, in regard to revenue items pure and simple, upon which it was known that a great fight would occur in this Chamber, and in respect of which every importer held back to the last possible moment, we naturally find a considerable shrinkage in the duty-paid. But surely the Treasurer will not say that there is any likelihood of a large falling-off in the sugar receipts as compared with the position at the present time ! I contend that, if anything, the receipts from this source are likely to increase, because our consumption of sugar grows very rapidly, and the Queensland stocks have been upon the market for some time. The stocks from last season have already been distributed, and clearly there was no opportunity of cise duty upon that particular sugar. Having been distributed, this is in the hands of the retailers or consumers, v While the collection of excise on next year's crop will have the effect of materially increasing Queensland's receipts from this source, it will not have the effect of materially diminishing imports, I will come to that unless there is a very large increase of production. The equivalent amount of sugar is on the Queensland market, from the State's own production, although it has not paid excise up to the present. Then, in regard to timber, I fear that appearances are all against the correctness of the Treasurer's estimate I believe the Treasurer has underestimated immensely the amount tliat is likely to be received at the Customs from this source. Timber was one of the items only recently dealt with, and, therefore, it was bonded during most of the period to which the returns refer. I am informed from the actual records of shipments inOf course it was. wards at the Customs-that is, shipments which have not passed the Customs, but are in bond-that if ,the duty had been collected on the whole of the timber imported into Victoria 'since the Tariff commenced, the contribution of'that State from this source would have been £53,000, while the total amount which the Treasurer estimates to receive from the whole Commonwealth is only £119,000. It must be apparent to any one that, if the figures are correct, there has been a w.oeful under-estimate of the revenue from this particular item. Now we come to the position occupied by the States. So far as the revenue required for Commonwealth purposes is concerned, the Estimates put before us for this year by tlie Treasurershow that the expenditure, after allowing for certain increases caused by the appointments of officers in connection with bodies not yet created, such as the Inter-State Commission, is about £1,700,000. Four times thatamounfc is, of course, £6,800,000, and I admit that we must allow for a larger expenditure than that which has to be met at the present time. Allowing for all that, however, I contend that under £8,000,000 of revenue is more than sufficient for Commonwealth purposes. That estimate allows for all reasonable developments, and, if not for an extravagant, for a liberal idea of the extension of tlie functions of the Commonwealth in taking over departments which have not yet been touched. Taking the charging either import or ex-Treasurer's own estimate, and putting aside my contention and the contention of many others that there has been a woeful under-estimate of the result of several large revenue items, I say that if tea and kerosene were made free, which would mean a loss of a little over £500,000, we should still .have a Tariff yielding £8,400,000.",19,Honourable Members Hear Hear
26,Mr Watson,,20,Honourable Members Hear Hear
27,Mr Watson,"£500,000, we should have a Tariff of £9,000,000. without the two items I have mentioned there would be a Tariff of much over £9,000,000. I make bold to estimate that by the end of the financial year following this, it will be seen that the Tariff, even without tea and kerosene, -will result in not less than £9,250,000. So many items have been under-estimated-so many imports have been kept back pending the decisions in this Chamber-that it is-absolutely impossible to gauge the volumes of imports by the quantities which have passed the Customs daring the last few months. I say, therefore, that for all purposes a revenue of £S,000,000 is more than sufficient. Then we are brought to the position of the smaller States. The position of Queensland will not be nearly so bad as has been attempted to be made out. In the Melbourne Argus of the 18th of this month there were published returns, circulated by the Treasurer, and these show that the actual amount paid to Queensland by way of refund have been £25,618 more than the Treasurer estimated in October last. In the returns referred to there are shown the actual amounts paid over to the various States during the whole year. guide to what the States will get during the twelve months. The returns show what they got for some months, but in other months there are certain heavy payments which are not shown, and which naake -all the difference. I did not publish that statement. The information was asked by a certain newspaper, and I gave it , but I am not responsible for the argument deducted from it . I am responsible for the correctness of the figures, but the use made of the figures is another matter -may happen at the end of that period; tlie not responsible for the -use made of the figures. We make strange use offigures-in this Chamber sometimes, and I should not for a moment hold the Treasurer-responsible for one-tenth of what is done in that connection. So far as Queensland is concerned, we have to consider the fact that for three months Of tlie present year she had her own large revenue tariff, which, in some-respects, was heavier than that of the Commonwealth -of exports from Victoria-to Tasmania duty But Queensland had nd revenue from excise in respect of sugar, -whereas now she will Including the extra have £ 3 per ton on, I suppose, three-fourths, or, at any rate one-half, of the sugar locally consumed. sugar is credited to the country of consumption and not to the country of production. sumption in Queensland; I do not say that that State will be credited in respect of the sugar consumed in other places. Queensland will have £ 3 per ton on the consumption of all sugar grown by black labour, and £ 1 per ton on all sugar grown by white labour. In any case, that is an extraordinary source of revenue. the other States. will help to weaken the other States. I am speaking particularly of Queensland, because it is pointed out that that is a State whosefinances render necessary the imposition of high revenue duties.

But the Customs department, I am also informed, have not credited the States of Tasmania and Queensland with the sum to which the Auditor General's decision would entitle them -States? For-some time to come such an allowance -would make a considerable difference in the finances of both Tasmania and Queensland. It would vitiate, to the extent it operated, any calculations as to the Customs returns of these two particular States. It is evident that if Queensland and Tasmania are at present being supplied from either reserved stocks or recent importations-fro m New South Walesi n the case of Queensland, and from Victoriai n the case of Tasmania-the y are not paying duty, or getting credit for any consumption represented by importations within the near future. In any case, if they are to be credited with the amount represented by the imports, it will mean a considerable difference-on e may safely say tens of thousands of pounds in the results so' far as this Tariff is concerned respecting those States. I should like the Treasurer to give us an estimate later on, if he has the figures, of what is involved in this dispute, respecting the imported goods into Tasmania and Queensland. sible to give such an estimate, even if the contention be correct, which is not admitted. Attorney-General says that the contention is correct, though I am not speaking from private information, but merely from what has been made public. may be sure that the information is not far from correct, and those States will have to be credited with the sums involved. If we have no data, is it not useless to inform the Chamber that Queensland and Tasmania will be bankrupt unless these revenue duties are passed, when-all the time their accounts can beso adjusted as to materially alter the position of each of the two 'States? As a matter of convenience and economy, Queensland is largely supplied with goods re-exported from New South Wales, and Tasmania with goods re-exported from Victoria. That fact affects the position of those States very materially. But, after all, the question which we have to consider is: To what extent are we justified in mulcting tlie taxpayers of the other States, for the benefit, not of the taxpayers of Queensland and Tasmania as a whole, but for the benefit of a few individuals in those date methods of taxation ! revenue solely upon Customs taxation, the men who are best able to pay taxes escape at .the expense of the poor. We can understand why the dominant parties in Tasmania and in Queensland cry out against -any alteration of the Tariff which may ultimately have the effect of shifting the burden of taxation in those States on to the shoulders of those who are best able' to bear it . Tasmania has a land tax and an income tax, but I think that-she could safely increase her land tax. land tax is the heaviest in the Commonwealth. is only Jd. in the £ 1 . The Premier of Queensland appeals to us to save his State from bankruptcy by imposing duties upon tea and -.kerosene; but what he really wants us to do is to save the rich men of Queensland, who now? have to pay only . It is utterly imposa small fraction of the taxes, from paying their' fair share. He is prepared to sacrifice the interests 'of the peopleof Queensland as a whole' for the benefit of a few who do I understand that the not pay taxes in. proportion to their means. Therefore, we-are asked by the Government, and by the acting leader of the Opposition, to compel the people of tlie Commonwealth to pay duties £o provide revenue which is not absolutely necessary. I am prepared to make some allowance,so far as Tasmania is concerned. If that State has exhausted her possibilities of local taxation, and is likely to have a deficit which economy cannot rectify, I am ""prepared, during the bookkeeping period, to make her an advance from the funds of the Commonwealth, rather than increase the taxation upon the whole people of the Commonwealth.

That amount will be subject to reduction, year by year, according to the rebates allowed.

I am convinced that we can very well afford to give up these duties, which considerably affect the most humble classes, particularly in the interior, where so much tea is consumed, and where people, require something to cheer them up in the midst of adverse conditions. Kerosene might reasonably be placed upon the same basis. In the country districts it is the almost, universal illuminant, and even candles do not enter into such large consumption. When the opportunity occurs I shall also move that kerosene be placed upon the free list. As one of those who have consistently supported the Government Tariff proposals as a fair compromise between conflicting principles, I want to show that I am as anxious as are others, who have spoken so much about it, to relieve the people of unnecessary taxation. I intend to support the proposal of the honourable member for Bland to place tea upon the free list. I am sorry that some of those who have declaimed so loudly against taxation on the necessaries of life should now refuse to afford relief. The acting leader of the Opposition has announced that he intends to support the propositi to impose a duty upon tea, and I desire to know where the extreme anxiety of the honourable member to prevent over taxation of the people comes in. I have noticed tliat any taxes which might incidentally or directly have a protective effect have been loudly declaimed against, but I cannot see any anxiety displayed with respect to duties which must necessarily invol ve increased prices to the people. 1 agree with the honourable member for Bland, that the revenue will be greater not merely than was formerly estimated, but greater than is at presentexpected by the Treasurer. In the first place, we have reduced a great many protective duties, and the effect will be to encourage larger importations. As importations increase they will necessarily to some extent involve tbe destruction of home industries, and the greater the importations the larger the revenue will be. This will be noticed more and more as the months go on, because manufacturers will have to get rid of existing stocks, and as they begin to feel the pressure of the increased importations will probably find it necessary to restrict their output. Then there is also the fact that in regard to tea, and kerosene and other articles, the importers have been 31 T living from hand to mouth. Owing to the uncertainty that has existed during our lengthy discussion of the Tariff they have been simply taking goods out of bond to meet absolute necessities. We already have too many revenue duties. I have been very sony to see placed upon the dutiable list many articles which were not previously taxed in Victoria. These comprise articles which enter very largely into manufactures, and which are otherwise usef u l to those who are carrying on business. As the list of taxable articles has been increased, I have felt the greater necessity for keeping the duties on staple lines, such as tea and kerosene, as low as possible. It may be urged that we have to consider the position of those States -particularl y Tasmania and Queenslandwhich have to bear such heavy interest charges. I recognise that we are bound to see that there is no violent dislocation of the finances of any State, and that, however strong our views may be upon any one point, we must accommodate them to the necessity of making the transition from the separate State existence into membership of the Commonwealth as gentle as possible. I find that Queensland is the most heavily indebted of all civilized countries. I am speaking of her actual indebtedness, apart from the means which she may have of paying her debts. No doubt the resources of Queensland are very great, because she has land as rich as can be found in any part of the world but I have no hesitation in saying that she is overburdened with debt, and that she will very soon feel the effects of such huge expenditure as she has been carrying on. I also find that the expenditure per head in Queensland is heavier than in any other State, and that beyond a trifling dividend tax Queensland imposes no direct taxation upon her people. imposed by the Divisional Board. Every State has municipal taxation, but I am speaking of State taxation. Queensland, as I say, has borrowed heavily and is spending very freely, and yet she has imposed no direct taxation. I do not think, it is our duty to increase the burdens of the people of the rest of the States in order to relieve Queensland from direct taxation. I do not say that I would drive that proposition to an extreme, but we certainly ought not to increase the taxation of the other",23,Honourable Members Hear Hear

Tasmania has spent, more upon unproductive works than has any other State, and it derives less revenue from its public works in proportion to the money borrowed. This of course has been partly due to the special difficulties with which the people in that State have had to con^ tend. Tasmania has a tax upon land-on e of those unwise taxes which discourage enterprise-namely , a tax upon land as improved. I understand that this tax yields about £30,000ayear. IadmitthatTasmania has imposed direct taxation to some, extent, but I do not think that we should be justified in placing a huge burden on other States in order to obviate the necessity for an increase of. direct taxation, in Tasmania.

I do not see why we should have a customs revenue up to the Tasmanian level, to the disadvantage of all the other States. has sanctioned duties above the Tasmanian level. member was the Premier of a Ministry which passed a Tariff for Tasmania that imposed burdens upon far more articles than, did any Victorian Tariff. Moreover, many of those duties were distinctly protective in their incidence. Some reference has been made to the tax upon tea. went carefully into thisquestion, some years ago, and after very close inquiry I came to the conclusion tliat with a -duty of 3d. per lb. operating, upon this article-haying , regard to the fact tliat the importer, the merchant, and the retailer all charge a profit which is cal-culated upon the original price plus the duty-a n ordinary family of five would pay nearly an additional 30s. per year for their tea. is disputed whether a protective tax increases the price of the home-made article, but I have always taken the view that a revenue duty increases, the cost of any article. A family of five ought to consume 1 lb. of tea per week, and if honourable members work the matter out they will find that, having a due regard to the two or three profits that have to be made, a tax of 3d. per lb. upon that article will mean about an. additional 30s. per year to them. I can. scarcely recognise the right of certain honourable members opposite, including, the acting leader of the Opposition, to call themselves free-traders-. I suppose that the honourable member for Wentworth will recognise Mr Henry George as an undoubted, free-trader ? In. the LibraryI find a book written by him in . which he says that the only legitimate excuse for any customs taxationis protection. He puts the position thus :All the objections which apply to indirect taxes in general, apply to import duties-. Those protectionists are right who declare tliat protection is the only justification for a Tariff, and Hie advocates of , ' ' a Tariff .for revenue only "" have no case. If we do not need a Tariff for protection we need no Tariff .at all, and for the purpose of raising revenue should resort to some system which will not tux the mechanic as-heavily as the I have not been able to millionaire, and will not call on the man who rears a family to pay on that account more than the man who shirks his natural obligation, and leaves some woman, whom in the scheme of nature it was intended that ,he should support, to take care of herself as best she can. I find also t h a t MrH . C. Carey writes : A Tariff for revenue should have no existence. Interference with trade is to be tolerated, only as a measure, of protection. An extraordinary feature is that the archpriest, of protection and the arch-priest of free-trade concur in this opinion. Extremes meet. I want honourable members upon this side of the Chamber, who have been consistently abused for placing, burdensupon the backs of the people, to embrace this opportunity of proving that we are their I true friends. A t all events, unless it can be shown that the course proposedby the honourable member for Bland will result in a violent dislocation, of the financesof the States, it is my intention to support it.. have listened very attentively to the honourable, and. learned member for Northern Melbourne, and I congratulate him upon his intention, to vote, for the first , time against the Government, and in favour of reducing Of course, the question the burdens of . the people.

I have voted consistently for relieving the taxation of those least able to bear it, and I shall do all I can to prevent any additional burden in the shape of duties on kerosene and tea. quite admit that this question possibly places honourable members on both sides of the committee in a difficult position. There are those on this side who warned the Ministry at an earlier stage that an unnecesor about 40 lbs. a year for a family of five. sarily high revenue was being demanded, and efforts were made from time to time to reduce the revenue by lowering the taxation on many of the necessaries of life. But with what effect ? In many cases 1 those who hold protectionist views, and the honourable member who has intimated his intention of proposing the abolition of certain duties in the list, said that they would not free those necessaries of life, but revenue which has been put before us. would place duties on tbem, in spite of the fact that they thought the revenue demanded was excessive. There were other protectionist members who were perfectly willing to impose taxation in this waythat is, willing to impose protectionist the Treasury, but would place taxation .on the backs of the users of the articles. No reasonable man can deny that many of these protective duties which have been imposed on the necessaries of life, while not bringing anything into the Treasury chest, will take money from the people who use the articles, whether those people be poor or whether they be rich. Are those who, like myself, are in favour of a revenue duty on tea, to abandon that duty even if a lesser revenue can be done with than the reduced revenue which has been reached through the efforts of those on this side 1 tlie reduction will not make so much difference, so far as revenue is concerned. absolutely free, there must be a reduction prevent honourable members, if they choose, recommitting any of the other items, and reducing the duties. Where a considerable amount of revenue must be obtained Then the by means of customs duties, I am, and always have been, in favour of a duty upon tea, because of its general applicationwhile, if the rate of duty is sufficiently small, the tax upon any individual is not a severe one. The honourable member for Northern Melbourne endeavoured to show that the proposed duty upon tea is equal to a tax of about 30s. per annum upon an average family of five people, but I think that his estimate is absolutely wrong. According to the figures which have been given by the honourable member for Bland, the consumption of tea per head of population is about 8 lbs. per annum, A duty of 3d. perlb. upon that quantity would produce 10s. Allowing 10 per cent, for the profit made by tlie importer-and that. allowance is a very large one-that would increase the charge to l is . , and, allowing still further for the profits of the retailers, an average family would not have to pav more than 13s. or 14s. per annum.

95,Mr Thomson,"There is nothing toannum. Efforts were made to strike off the duties upon arrowroot, sago, and tapioca,, and, if they had been successful, £14,000 would have been saved to the consumer. If the duties upon butter and cheese had been removed, that would have saved another £7,000, and would have prevented the consumers within the Commonwealth from being charged unduly high prices by the producers. If the duty upon dried f r u it had been reduced by one-half, £76,000 would have been saved; while £6,000 would have been saved by striking off the duties on grain and pulse, and £34,000 by striking off the duties on matches and vestas. If the duty upon fish had been reduced by one-half, £50,000 would have been saved; if the duty upon rice were reduced by one-half, £71,000 would have been saved; and if the duty upon tea were reduced by one-third, £128,000 would be saved. Then if the duty upon cotton and linen piece goods were removed, there would be a saving of about £200,000 ; and about £50,000 could have been saved by removing the duties upon certain machinery. By reducing the duty upon kerosene even by one-third, we can save £50,000. In that way a total saving to the taxpayer of £686,000 might have been effected. I agree with the honourable member for Bland that the Government is asking for too much revenue : but I am very much averse to casting away a duty such as this. As the base of a free trade system of taxation, if revenue had to be obtained through the Customs, duties should be imposed which would have to be paid by every member of the community, but which would press lightly upon all. In addition, there ought to be duties upon articles of luxury, and direct State taxation which would make the wealthy contribute to the revenue in proportion to their means. I ani afraid that if we abandon the duty upon tea on this occasion we shall never . again be able to impose it. The duty is also to be regarded as a counterbalance to the duties upon beer and tobacco. It produces some equality of taxation by making the teetotaller and non-smoker pay something towards the revenue as an equivalent for what is paid by the beer drinker. For those l-easons I have always felt strongly in favour of a duty upon tea, where any considerable customs revenue is necessary, and I have in the State Parliament voted for such a duty. Therefore, while I shall vote for a reduction of the proposed duty, I shall not vote with the honourable member for Bland to wholly remove the duty upon tea. I have come to this determination the more readily because I hope that the Tariff, when it leaves this Chamber, will not be regarded as finished with, and that it will be moulded elsewhere more into the form which a free-trader would desire to see it . But if there is no margin of revenue to go upon, that expectation may not be fulfilled. On the other hand, if it is shown, as the returns month after month should show, that, notwithstanding the reductions which have been made, more revenue is being obtained from the Tariff than ought to be necessary for the requirements of the States, many of the duties to which we have objected, and which, while protective, incidentally yield revenue, may be reduced or struck off altogether. The reduction or removal of those duties will materially benefit the class for whose advantage the honourable member for Bland advocates the removal of the duty upon tea, and it will have the further advantage of getting rid of many complications. For instance, if we remove the duties upon cottons and linens we shall relieve the consumers of duties returning £200,000 of revenue, and which as originally proposed would have returned over£300,000. The relief to the consumers, however, will be still .larger than that amount, because the profits made in connection with those classes of goods are much greater than the profits made in dealing with tea, running up as they often do to 100 per cent. The removal of those duties would also get rid of an enormous amount of Customs work, and would save complications that now occupy the time of Customs officials for hours every day. Nothing can be, more easily collected than a fixed duty upon tea. Tea, although so largely consumed, is, like beer, not an absolute necessaiy, and its consumption per family is not so great as to make the proposed tax a heavy one. Furthermore, the inspection duefcothe duty tends to improve the quality of the tea imported. It may be said that we have already agreed to the duties upon cotton and linens, but we can easily recommit the item if the majority of honourable members are in favour of still further reducing them, or of striking them out altogether; and I am prepared to vote for such a recommittal. I believe, however, that in the long run it will be against the interests of free-trade to wholly remove the duty upon tea, and therefore I shall vote for a reduction, and against the proposal of the honourable member for Bland. member for North Sydney is always listened to with attention by honourable members on both sides of the Chamber. He always speaks temperately, and in the light of an extended mercantile experience, and I confess that we as free-traders have received much information and assistance from him in our fight for the construction of a Tariff upon free-trade lines. I am sorry, however, that I cannot agree with him on this occasion. The Treasurer has indicated by interjection that the supporters of the Government are divided upon this matter, and the acting leader of the Opposition has made a similar admission in regard to the members on this side of the Chamber. therefore, that the democratic free-traders on the one side, and the democratic protectionists on the other, have come together on this, occasion.. The acting leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for North Sydney belong to the old school of free-traders, between whom and the free-trade democrats there are some important points of difference. The free traders in New South Wales would not have been so successful but for their democratic ideas. The battle for free-trade was fought in that State by the democrats, and among the members of the labour party here to-day there are four or five representatives who right through the Tariff discussion have thrown in their votes with the Opposition simply because they believe in democratic free-trade. It surprised the democratic protectionists from Victoria at first to see demowere governed by British precedent he crats voting as free-traders, but they will now would refuse to impose any further burdens doubtless understand the position. It has been urged that, because the members of the labour party have allowed certain revenue duties to pass, they should support the proposed duties on tea and kerosene, but I do not see .any force in that argument, and it cannot possibly apply to my position, because I have voted for the reduction of all duties upon the necessaries of life to the lowest possible figure. I cannot accept the dictum that the only difference between the free-trader and the protectionist is a matter of 5 per cent., nor can I agree with the proposition that every item in the Tariff must be taxed. If these are to be the lines of demarcation between the two great parties, I do not hope for much from the operations of the free-trade party in the direction of reform. In -the electorate I represent, scores of industries are now being .carried on for which I have not sought any protection, and it is reasonable, therefore, that I should object to the imposition of duties upon necessaries of life which enter into the .daily use of those employed in those industries. Under a free-trade Tariff, the bulk of the revenue should be derived from the duties upon narcotics and stimulants, and the balance of the sum required should be obtained from duties upon luxuries, the necessaries of life being relieved as far as possible. The honourable member .for North Sydney stated that one of his reasons for supporting a reduced duty upon tea was that if the duty were once abandoned it It seems, would be abandoned for ever, and the free traders would not be able to f a l l back upon it in future as a source of revenue. As a free-trader, however, I object to the tax on tea, and I cannot see that there is any force in the honourable member's contention that teetotallers should contribute to the revenue as well as do those who use stimulants. As a matter of fact, the great majority of teetotallers belong to the richer classes, of the community, whereas the taxes on stimulants and narcotics are paid largely by the great masses of the people. We have already taxed the clothing and boots, and food of the masses, and now we are asked at the last moment to add to our already large surplus of revenue by imposing taxes on tea and kerosene. I am stoutly opposed to all duties on food supplies. The leader of the Opposition said that if he upon the people. He has told us that when Gladstone and other leaders of the great free-trade party in England found their revenue requirements supplied they ceased to further tax the people, and I would ask the acting leader of the Opposition to follow their grand example. Although we have a large surplus of revenue, we are told by the acting leader of the Opposition that we should consider the necessities of the States. I would point out, however, that section 96 of the Constitution gives us ample power to make up to the States any deficiency that may exist in their revenue.

104,Mr Poynton,"I have as strong becontrary, there are times when one must consider matters from a State stand-point. I confess that I do not believe in taxing the necessaries of life. In this connection I have some difficulty in deciding what course to adopt in regard to the whole of these items. But I must face the fact that under the Tariff as it stands South Australia will receive a small surplus revenue, whereas if we abolish these duties that surplus will disappear. I have also to bear in mind the accumulating expense involved in the establishment of a ""white Australia."" According to the latest figures, South Australia will have a surplus revenue under the present Tariff of approximately £63,000. If we abolish the duties upon tea, kerosene, and rice, that surplus will vanish. We have already sanctioned legislation under which the sugar-planters are to be granted a rebate upon sugar grown with white labour. ""Upon a very moderate estimate, there will be 50,000 tons of sugar produced next season from cane grown with white labour, upon which we shall collect only £ 1 per ton excise. That represents a shrinkage in the revenue of £100,000, of whicb South Australia's proportion would be £10,000. During the second year, probably 75,000 tons of sugar will be produced by means of white labour, which will mean a shrinkage in the revenue of £150,000. Probably in the third year 100,000 tons of sugar will be produced with white labour, which represents a shortage in the revenue of £200,000. Of this amount, South Australia's share would be £20,000. Further, the Tariff provides that after five j'ears no excise duty shall be charged. years the bookkeeping period ceases to operate, which will be to the advantage of the smaller States. difficult to persuade some of the States at the end of five years to divide the revenue upon a population basis. suggest the pooling of the revenue, and its allocation upon the basis of population, but when that period arrives I think very great objection will be raised to the adoption of such a course. Within five years the Treasurer will lose the whole of his excise revenue, which in round figures represents nearly £600,000. Sir WILLIAM McMILLAN land will supply the whole of Australia. of this legislation. South Australia's share of that £600,000 is £60,000. That is in addition to the increased expenditure, which at present is something like £30,000 ; and these are facts that we have to consider. I wish I could see my way clear to put these articles on the free list, because I do not believe in raising revenue on the necessaries of lifea policy which, in my opinion, penalizes those who can least 'afford to pay. A t first I thought it would, perhaps, be better to reduce the duties, seeing that we could not afford to give up the whole ; but I was faced with the difficult question whether the consumers would get the benefit of such reductions. benefit when the duties were abolished in New South Wales. that. crease the price % by at least the amount of the duty, plus whatever extra the business people may charge. off, the price must be reduced. duty does not always lower the price.

If we give up the duty on tea. South Australia will lose £34,000, and if we give up the duties on rice and kerosene, that State will lose something like £26,000. It has been said that some of the States have not exhausted their sources of taxation. I do not say that South Australia has exhausted all her resources in this connection, but the people of that State are taxed very heavily.

A t any rate, the Commonwealth will have to pay :for the premature robbery of the Kanaka .from Queensland, and also to arrange for Queensland, Tasmania, or any other State being 'maintained in a solvent condition. there in Queensland ? There is a great deal more internal taxation in Queensland than in New South Wales -4d. per lb. In the latter State the Government never had the pluck to place on the backs of the people throughout tlie western and central districts the cost .of''the administration of their own local affairs. In Queensland, on the other hand, all the cost of forming roads and bridges has been borne by the farmers and squatters. Victoria was the first State to provide local government, and Queensland adopted that State as her .model with great benefit. . In these local burdens, apart from the rabbit extermination tax, Queensland .has practically a land tax. In many parts of the country we have had a seven-years drought as disastrous as that in the north-western parts of New South Wales; but our professed friends here have no regard for that. We have lost millions of sheep and thousands of cattle, and have heavy burdens upon our backs. I wish that Queensland had the big surplus which New South Wales enjoys under the Braddon provision. As a matter of fact, we could do with twice .as much. I advise the New South Wales politicians to use their surplus in reducing the State public debt; Is there never to be a diminution of taxation in these StatesW it h regard to the proposed duty upon kerosene, it will fall very lightly upon those in the country districts, because we have so much daylight in most of the country parts of Australia that very little artificial light is needed, and very often, when light is required at night, the people are content to use fat lamps. The workers of Queensland, however, are independent and loyal enough to their State to be ready to contribute their share to the revenue derived from There are tens of thousands of duties upon tea and kerosene,"" because they know that the money will be expended to secure the protection. of life and property, .and to provide what is practically free education for'their children. It would be bad for both Tasmania and Queensland if these duties were remitted. Under the Queensland Tariff there was a duty of 6d. per lb. upon tea in bulk, of 4d. upon each Jplb. packet, and of 8d. per lb. upon every packet containing more than £ lb. Surely the reduction which is now proposed is sufficient. In New South Wales there was a State duty of I d . per lb., while the duty in Victoria, South Australia, and Tasmania was 3d. per lb, and in New Zealand 4d. per lb. In my opinion, the bulk of the electors do not wish to avoid this taxation. No one can say what the requirements of the Treasury will be during the next six months, and it is our duty to maintain the good-will of the States towards tlie Commonwealth by doing nothing to impair their revenue, and thus bring inconvenience or even disaster upon their financial administration. member for Brisbane has referred to Queensland as a necessitous State.

Queensland tied up in the sugar industry 1 The honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, put the matter very forcibly when he said that it would pay the Commonwealth Government to buy out the sugar industry altogether, and I believe it would. I admit that the legislation on the Kanaka question has .had a disturbing influence upon the sugar industry, but the results have not been so bad as many member challenges us, we shall reckon up his people foretold. not begun to feel the effects of it yet. The sugar planters have been .making enough noise and leading every one to believe that Queensland would become insolvent if the Kanakas were dispensed with. If the Kanaka is necessary for the salvation of Queensland, then the sooner the sugar industry goes the better. The honourable member for Brisbanehas stated that the people of Queensland are bearing too much 'taxation at the present time, and I claim his vote against the duty on teabecause it bears very heavily upon them. It may be assumed that the prime cost of tea landed in the Commonwealth is 7d. per lb. The duty amounts to 3d. per lb., and the wholesalers' profits, reckoned at 15 per cent, to l£d. per lb., whilst bhe retailers' profits may be put down at 30 per cent., or 3£d. per lb. This makes a total of Is. 3d. charged to the consumer. If there were no duty, the cost of the tea would be 7d. per lb., the wholesalers' profit-at 15 per cent, would represent l-05d., and the retailers' profit at 30 per cent -:2*45d . This would give a total of 10id. per lb., or a difference between the price of tea subject to duty and tea free of duty amounting to 4|d. per lb.

The people whom I represent do not require any protection; all they desire is a fair and square deal, and they will get it if I am able to secure it for them. I strongly advocate a free breakfast table, and it seems to me that some honourable members who call themselves free traders, and who are supporting the duty on tea are false to their principles. AlthoughI submitted myself to the electors as a revenue-tariffist, I am here as a free-trader, and I have become a stronger free trader than ever since the Tariff has been under discussion. The masses of the people of Queensland are free-traders, and I am not at all anxious as to the attitude of my constituents on the subject of direct taxation. I hope that the free-traders who have been consistent in their opposition to the Government proposals throughout will stand to their guns and not desert us in connection with the duty on tea. -The honourable member for Maranoa has spoken in favour of a free breakfast table, but I hope he will recognise the fact that tea is not on the free list in Great Britaina true free-trade country, which has the lightest Tariff in the world. Why should the honourable member talk about free traders abandoning their principles when they vote for the retention of a revenue duty, pure and simple, the whole of which goes into the Treasury?

The honourable member for Bland has told us that Tasmania is to be compensated for her loss of revenue in some mysterious way which he did not attempt to explain. That honourable member, af terhavingdeclared I do not care what the that out of some nebulous Treasury chest, Tasmania would draw some compensation, proceeded to add that all the surplus revenue derived by the Commonwealth had been absorbed. It has gone. The fund has disappeared, out of which the honourable member for Bland would be so generous to the smaller States, which require revenue more urgently than do the larger ones. The honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne also indulged in some criticisms, although I do not know that with those criticisms he offered any compensation. Regarding the question of compensation, I should like to say that Tasmania adopts today the attitude she has adopted throughout. That State, recognising the tremendous relative sacrifice which she made for federation, has always desired to stand independently of the Commonwealth in regard to her finances, and has declined to come cap in hand for a pittance to help her through her difficulties. .She has preferred to stand upon her own resources, and to rely upon the justice of the Commonwealth in its taxation measures. The honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne criticised the administration of Tasmania. He does not speak from any long experience as a Minister of the Crown charged with the duty of regulating the affairs of a State. In speaking out of his inexperience he has gone considerably beyond anything that is justified by facts. Tasmania may have been guilty of weakness in matters of administration, but time and again she has resolutely set her face against financial pressure and stress, and has been raised by the Ministry of the day out of the slough of despond into a state of solvency. She will maintain her position if she only receives justice at the hands of this Parliament. Let me point for a moment to the loss upon a few items which Tasmania has already suffered through the operation of this Tariff. By the reduction of the duty upon kerosene from 6d. to 3d. per gallon she sustained a loss of £4,000, whilst upon Gotton goods she suffered a loss of £10,000. Buti t is in connection with the excise duties that .her loss is so great. For example, upoia still wines Tasmania has suffered a loss of £6,000, upon tobacco a possible loss of £20,000, upon spirits a loss of £10,000, and upon beer a loss of £6,000. The last-named deficiency was occasioned by the reduction of the excise from 4d. to 3d.",34,Honourable Members Hear Hear

These amounts represent more than one-eighth of the total revenue of that State. The loss occasioned by these excise duties has in no case been incurred because of any Tasmanian industry. It has been made in the interests of industries in other States. Tasmania makes no wine, does not grow or manufacture tobacco or sugar, and does not distil spirits. Having in view the sacrifices which this State must make, her independent attitude in the matter of finance, and the splendid way in which she came to the front when the question of federation was to be determined, I hope that the committee will decline to throw away revenue duties. Especially do I trust that we shall not sacrifice the duty upon tea, which is a duty that has been borne continuously in England, where it has been reduced only within the last ten years to 3d. per lb.

FOWLER (Perth) I do not propose to deal with the financial aspect of this question. It is sufficient to say that I for Bland that the Treasurer will get more revenue from this Tariff than he really needs. Even assuming that the necessities of some of the States demand that we should raise eveiy possible penny of revenue, I believe that that revenue can be obtained in a much better and more equitable way than through the Customs. I wish, however, to say a word or two regarding the free-trade speeches which we have heard this afternoon from honourable members upon this side of the House. We have been told in effect that free-trade is identical with revenue tariflism, a statement which the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne has combated with a good deal of effect. He quoted Henry George to show that free-trade and revenue taritfism had no relation to each other. He might have gone even to the fathers of the free-trade movement in England, and found stronger evidence of the fact that free-trade and direct taxation are closely related to one another. If he referred to the speeches of Bright, Villiers, or Cobden, he would find overwhelming evidence that these authorities upon free trade always regarded revenue tariflism as something to which an end had to be put at the earliest possible moment. It was clearly indicated by the leaders of the free-trade movement in England at the time to which I refer, that their object was to relieve the masses from indirect taxation and to restore the incidence of taxation to its proper and equitable basis. We have heard a good deal this afternoon of the sacrifices in which we are going to involve some of the States if we do not impose duties upon the particular articles under consideration. I It has cannot understand that line of reasoning. There are no authorities upon political economy with whom I am acquainted who defend revenue tariflism as an equitable method of taxation, and if there be any shortage in the revenue of the States, I am unable to understand how honourable members can speak of a sacrifice being entailed upon them when they have absolute freedom to revert to equitable methods of taxation. methods ? of raising revenue is by direct taxation and not by the indirect method of getting at the agree with the honourable member consumer which has been so common even in England up to the present time.

I feel that the time isMr Poynton, was under a misapprehension when he said that the Treasurer's estimate of the South Australian revenue would be exceeded by £60,000. I find, upon looking into the figures carefully, that it will be exceeded by only £18,900. That being so. we must consider closely what would be the result to South Australia if the large revenueearning duties upon tea, kerosene, rice, and other items, were removed. Some honourable members on this side, whose consistency in tlie free-trade cause I admire, seem to think that free-traders should go what is vulgarly termed "" the whole hog,"" and place all the articles I have named upon the free list. It must be borne in mind, however, that the Treasurer's estimate of the revenue for the year is to a great extent guesswork, and, still further, that it is based upon the assumption that the duties of which I speak will not be removed. estimated what amount of revenue will be lost if these duties are removed ? MrV . L . SOLOMON -The duty upon rice is estimated to return £124,000, the duty upon kerosene £157,000, and the duty upon tea £384,000. the duty upon tea will be slightly reduced, because we intend to propose a reduction in the rate. MrV . L . SOLOMON -Yes; but there can be little doubt that, if these duties are removed, the anticipated surplus will disappear. While I should view such a contingency with some uneasiness, from the Commonwealth stand-point, I am bound by pledges to my constituents to do what I can to prevent the State of South Australia from being placed in a difficult nancial position. We must approach this subject in a common-sense way, and make allowance for the necessities of the States, both before federation and at the present time. We cannot therefore take the risk of riding the free-trade hobby to death. As the honourable member for South Australia, Mr pledged myself to do my best, as I did in Batchelor, has pointed out, the majority of the members of the Legislative Assembly of that State were pledged to secure a free breakfast table so soon as the revenue of the State became sufficiently buoyant to permit of the duties upon the necessaries of life being removed ; but the honourable member was a member of a Government for sometime, and other honourable members who were pledged in the same way were also members of Governments, without proposing a revision of the Tariff to allow their pledges to be carried out. On the one occasion, during a series of years, when there was more than a paper surplus in South Australia, the money was devoted, not to making good any deficiency, which the removal of the duties upon necessaries of life would have created, but in providing for the free education of the people. Notwithstanding the kindly references which have been made to the numerically smaller States, which may be in a difficult financial position, and the need for treating them charitably and reasonably, I shall be no party to compelling South Australia to come as a pleader or mendicant to the Commonwealth. I would rather uphold the independence of that State than place her in such a position that her representatives might be told year after year that they occupied a position inferior to those from other States which were solvent, and not indebted to the Commonwealth. Honourable members who represent States whose finances are not very flourishing may depend upon it that if these duties are abolished, the time will come very shortly when they will have to come, cap in hand, to the Commonwealth. can speak for his own State and not for Queensland. member judge as to the position of Queensland?

181,Mr Mcdonald,"Put the taxes on thehis tools of trade, his clothing, boots and shoes, and nearly everything he uses. When, however, we are considering tea, sugar, and . kerosene, we must admit that these have been recognised throughout Australia as legitimate subjects for revenue duties, to which even free-traders might agree. The duties-upon kerosene, tea, and rice cannot be dispensed with at present. The position of the Commonwealth finances is not such as to admit of it, and bhe abolition of these duties would place South Australia in a position which would be regretted by the greater number of the electors in that State, and also by many of those who are now disposed to remit the duties in the interests of the working man. Taking the returns for 1900 as a guide, the abolition of the tea duty would represent a loss to South Australia of £40,951, and the duty on kerosene, £13,061, or a total of £54,000. During the past few years, South Australia has had all she could do to make both ends meet. If that State were in the position of some of the others which have not yet exploited all their means of direct taxation, tlie case would be different, but South Australia has been about the foremost of all in adopting every possible form of direct taxation, including probate and succession duties, a progressive land tax, an absentee tax, and a progressive income tax. Thetaxa, tion imposed upon the land-owners and farmers, and particularly upon the latter class, is just about as heavy as they can bear. In addition to having to face this loss, South Australia will have to provide for increased expenditure. The expenses of the Defence department have gone up by leaps and bounds, and up to the end of the present financial year they will amount to pretty nearly twice as much as was estimated at the time that federation was recommended to the people of South Australia. Then again, South Australia will have to face a heavy loss in connection with the sugar duties. In 1899-1900, South Australia imported 15,000 tons of sugar from Queensland, and derived from it in Customs revenue with a duty of £ 3 per ton, £45,000. It is now apparent that the revenue from sugar when imported from Queensland will probably be reduced to £ 1 per ton, owing to the fact that there is to be a rebate of £ 2 per ton allowed on all sugar grown by European labour. Supposing that only one-third of the total quantity of sugar is grown by European 31 u labour, then the loss would still be very considerable -Then, I have just alluded to the increased expenditure in connection with e the Defence department, which will constitute a heavy burden upon the people of South Australia. I would further point out that the additional outlay involved in the payment of the minimum salary of £ 1 1 0 per year to adult officers in bhe clerical division of our public service represents about £35,000 for the present year, with the probability that next year it will amount to £45,000. South Australia's proportion of this expenditure will be about £5,000 per annum. This brings the total amount up to £65,000. The present position of that State is not such as to warrant me in voting for the abolition of these duties. The Barrier traffic has decreased very considerably during the past few months, and the probability is that the loss which South Australia will sustain in this connection durinsr the year will approximate £100,000. I do not think there is a representative of that State present who-if the determination of this question rested with the local Parliament-woul d to-day vote for the removal of the duties upon kerosene and tea. the removal of the duty on kerosene. In fact, I moved in that direction in the State Parliament. MrV . L . SOLOMON"" I know that the honourable and learned member did salve his conscience with a little oil, even bliough ib was kerosene oil, and voted for what was then a very popular measure, namely, a free breakfast table. There were members who voted for that proposal, and others who promised to do so; but always with the proviso that the revenue of the country was sufficiently elastic to permit of the alteration. That is my proviso in regard to the abolition of the duties upon tea, kerosene, and other items which I consider are fair revenue-producing items. learned member adopt a similar attitude in regard to the Commonwealth finances 1 MrV .

184,Mr Wilks,"Well, the Treasurer has ataxing the people t MrV . L. SOLOMON I do not think that they are over-taxed; at any rate, I have had no hand in over-taxing them. AlthoughI was returned to this House as one who would always have the solvency of the States before him, I have voted consistently with the free-trade party in favour of reducing the burdens upon the people wherever it was possible and reasonable to do so. But the abolition of the duties upon these items would involve several of the States, including South Australia, in a serious loss. Therefore I feel bound to part company with some of my friends upon this side of the House. I shall vote for the retention of these duties solely because I believe that with all our increasing expenditure-expenditur e the extent of which we are unable to calculate at the present moment-the time is not ripe for a free breakfast table. If , in a year or two, the result of the union of the States is an increase of our trade, of our productive wealth, and of our industries, I shall be one of the first to assist in remitting all duties upon the necessaries of life. I should like to point out some reasons why the Government should abandon their proposal to tax tea. I am opposed to placing a duty upon that article; because it would constitute purely a revenue duty. A t the outset of this prolonged debate upon the TariffI declared that I was opposed to all revenue duties, and that if I went to the logical extreme of the free-traders, I should insist that no customs duties were required except for protective purposes. The honourable member for South Australia, Mr Solomon, has made a very extraordinary confession. He says that he has been fighting for cheap clothes, cheap boots, and cheap machinery for the working man throughout this continent, and yet he declares tliat he cannot give him cheap tea. It mattered nothing to that honourable member how many Victorian industries were destroyed. He never raised the question of whether an article could be produced here or not. But tea is an article which cannot be produced within the Commonwealth, so that the protectionist element does not enter into the consideration of this question. The proposed duty is a purely revenue duty, and I affirm that a scientific system of customs taxation will eventually is the use of overshow that Henry George is right, and that we want customs duties for protective purposes or not at all. We can raise money in a country like this in many other ways than through the customs, and we shall have to adopt other means some day. I would further point out that the Treasurer is not in financial straits. Those who know him are aware that he always errs on the safe side. He is not prone to exaggerate. Consequently it will be found that his estimate is up to the mark, but not very much above it . If , however, he found himself in straits, I would point out that there are numberless luxuries which are being admitted free. The superior wines pay nothing like the amount of customs revenue that they should pay. Suoh articles as Madeira, port, and choice champagnes, and Burgundies ought to bear the burden of taxation. The ground-work of all democracy is that luxuries should be taxed, whilst the necessaries of life and raw material should, as far as possible, be free. Tea is essentially one of the necessaries of life in Australia. Perhapsi t would not be an unmixed blessing if people drank less tea; but whether that be so or not, the people themselves have come to the conclusion that it is an absolutely indispensable beverage. Consequently this would be one of the most unpopular of taxes; and if we are short of revenue there are endless sources of taxation. In this discussion we have an exhibition of what would have happened if revenue tariffists had been in a majority. We should have had the same fight over the duty to be imposed on every necessary of life. I feel perfectly sure that if these articles are not admitted free there will be a material reduction in the duty, and a boon thus conferred on the people. It is not the time to enter into the question of the duty on kerosene, although that Gomes within the same category as tea. In a number of protectionist countries, notably Canada, tea is free; and Canada has been the model for us in many instances. 'The more we see of the advantages of a protectionist Tariff the more shall we follow that model; and revenue duties are no part of a protectionist policy, but the very opposite. We can experiment in producing those articles of which we have the initial elements, but tea is not one of these. I ask the Government, if they are short of revenue, to",40,Honourable Members Hear Hear
185,"Mr Wilks,",What,41,Honourable Members Hear Hear
186,Mr Ronald (Southern Melbourne),"consider the numerous luxuries which are open to taxation, and in the meantime not to insist on what, I feel sure, is an oppressive tax. I am sorry the duty on tea has been large in many of the States, and no doubt the Government, in their desire to be fair, have struck an average in their proposal of 3d. per lb. It would, however, be a greater advantage if the Government w i u l d gracefully and ungrudgingly remove this duty as an instalment of a ""free breakfast table."" If they do that I have hope that sooner or later we shall reach the ideal of having all necessaries free of duty and all luxuries taxed. An HONOBABLE luxury ? thing that is necessary is not a luxury, and everything that is not necessary is a luxury. I shall vote for placing tea on the free list, because I am against all revenue duties, and in the hope that sooner or later we shall-find a scientific method of taxation on the lines I have indicated. ""Unlike the honourable member for Southern Melbourne I am in favour of revenue duties, though I am not in favour of revenue duties plus protectionist duties. It is about time the distinction was made clear between honourable members on this side of the Chamber and honourable members on the other, who to-night are found together advocating the abolition of these duties. One reason which impels me to vote for the abolition of the duties is precisely the reason urged by the honourable member for South Australia, Mr Solomon, for his support of them. The honourable member referred to the increased and increasing expenditure of the Commonwealth, and I regard that as a reason for trying to prevent the surplus which the Treasurer has stated will be the result of the year's operations. Ought we to be piling up duties when the cry for retrenchment and reform is heard throughout the States? The expenditure in the various States is too high ab the present time, and it would be almost criminal to frame a Tariff so as to guarantee at the year's end a surplus of £700,000 or £800,000. us with some particulars concerning the operation of bhe duties so far, and -we are now dealing wibh items which were postponed in order to see how the Tariff worked. The only effect of the postponement has 31 u 2 been to show the absolute non-necessity for these items, from a revenue point of view at any rate. The Treasurer estimates a surplus of £580,000, and for the next four months he anticipates a revenue averaging £237,000 per month. Why does he estimate so low a revenue ? months are coming on. in the short month of February was £250,000 odd. Does the Treasurer mean to tell us that tlie revenue for the next four months will not come up to that figure ? month, but April, May, and June are known A non-necessity. Everyto be bad for revenue purposes. bhe Treasurer, as he always does, has underestimated his revenue, and that the result of the year's operations will show a surplus of nearly £700,000, which corresponds with the amount derivable from tea, kerosene, and rice. To pile high duties on those articles of common necessity, with a view to obtaining such a surplus, is reckless financing. I admit there has been some trouble in the small States, and I do not quarrel with honourable members who are concerned as to bhe effecb of bhe votes of this committee on the revenue of bhe States. We are told by the representatives of Queensland that the revenue of that State is much behind, and the representatives of South Australia also tell us that if we take off these duties the finances of that State will be prejudicial!y affected. But whose fault is that ? Isi t the fault of honourable members who have steadily tried to reduce duties so as to increase bheir revenue-producing capacity ? We have no righb to take the responsibility for the muddle which the Government have brought about in the small States by reason of their vicious system of taxation. The honourable and learned member for Brisbane told us that we ought to look at this matter from a Commonwealth point of view, and when I interjected that he should have done so himself, he promptly told me that he had taken that view before I was born. Why did the honourable and learned member not take that The Treasurer has furnished view the other night when, in his most per-* fervid way, he told the committee that he hoped there would not be another buggy or sulky imported into Queensland ?

There is the broad fact that as the Tariff stands at present there will be a surplus at the end of .the year of £ 7 0 0 , 0 0 0; and if we remit the more equitable in its incidence, and much -duties on tea, kerosene, and rice, there will sstill remain to the Treasurer as much revenue as he, at the beginning of the financial year, calculated on getting. If the Treasurer's present estimate is maintained, and if those dire results happen to the various small States, is that our doing, or is it the doing of honourable members on the Government side, who have steadily striven to reduce the revenue-producing .capabilities of the various items ? MrL . E. GROOM -Ho w could any revenue Tariff get rid of the inequalities in -the revenues of each State? .made that point clear in connection with one item, which is representative of the others.

It is my bounden duty as a tective. In any case, in my opinion, the representative of New South Wales to take Government have sufficient revenue already, care that there is no large surplus of revenue. In view of a surplus, an opportunity is given to me to remit taxation on the common necessities of life, and if good effects rather than i ll will occur by reason of my vote, I am under the obligation to try to relieve people from burdens whicli otherwise may be imposed on them. It has been said that in discussing these proposals we should have regard for the necessities of the various States. That is a perfectly true remark which applies to the whole Tariff; but I should like to know when they were trying to impose high duties whenever they thought they could protect local industries. The interests of the States, and the interests of the Commonwealth as a whole, have hardly been considered at all in dealing with the Tariff. If they had been, we should have had aTariff far more productive of revenue. Some honourable members on this side of the Chamber propose to vote for the duties on tea, kerosene, and other articles of large domestic consumption, upon the ground that they are purely revenue duties, and should form the basis of any revenue Tariff. That may be admitted; but is this a'revenue Tariff? Has not everything been done to make it a highly-protective Tariff? We are under no obligation to vote for duties which might have found a place in a Tariff entirely different from that which the committee has framed. If the Government had proposed a revenue Tariff, I should have consented to the imposition of a small duty upon tea ; but I feel under no obligation to vote for the inclusion of revenue duties in a highly protective Tariff. able member is discussing properly belong Tariff may as well be called a free-trade able and learned member supports may be",42,Honourable Members Hear Hear

Sir LANGD ON BONYTH ON (South Australia) -Personally , I should have great pleasure in voting to place tea and kerosene upon the free list; but I am afraid that the condition of the finances of South Australia just now is such as to render such a course quite out of the question. It is fearedand I am making the statement upon the best possible authority-that the disastrous effects of rust on the last harvest, and the shrinkage in .the value of silver, copper, and lead, will cause a deficiency of at least £150,000 in the railway revenue of the State this year. stances, it seems to me that it is my duty to support the proposals of the Government. Mr G. B. EDWARDS (South Sydney). It is to be regretted tliat the Government proposals have created a split in what is probably the finest political fighting force ever brought together in Australia. I am not disposed, however, to sink what I consider a principle in order to vote with my party. I have always considered that what we have to do in framing the Tariff is to raise sufficient revenue to meet the requirements of the Commonwealth, and to raise it by inflicting the least possible amount of hardship upon the taxpayers. has been that that result can best be obtained by a system of low duties, designed to return the maximum amount of revenue. We have already imposed a great many duties which will yield little or no revenue, but which will nevertheless tax the people very heavily. Now, however, we have to deal with a number of items which can be made the subject of purely revenue duties. Tho £400,000 odd, which it is estimated will be returned by these duties, is practically the whole amount that they will cause to be taken from the, pockets of the people. As a revenue-tariffist, I think that they are ideal duties, and, therefore, from the very first I made up my mind to vote for a moderate tax upon tea. My idea of an ideal TarifF at this juncture is a Tariff of compromise the Tariff which was promised in the Maitland manifesto. If that Tariff had been offered to us, the Tariff fight, would have been finished this session, and we should have heard no more of it for ten or twelve years to come. But, under the present circumstances, I believe that it will be continued throughout Australia during the whole of that period. I wish for the imposition of a duty upon tea because I firmly believe that we, on this side, will presently have an opportunity to determine how the taxation of the Commonwealth shall be arranged, and, when the opportunity comes, and many of the duties against which we have been fighting so earnestly are removed, we shall want the revenue which the duty upon tea will produce. I am sorry that I ' have to address my remarks upon this subject to my political friends rather than to the supporters of the Government. The honourable member for (North Sydney gave Under these circumus a logical, clear, and conclusive reason why we onthisside should vote foradutyupontea. He pointed out that the framing of the Tariff cannot be regarded as finished immediately the Tariff Bil l leaves this Chamber, and that"" we cannot expect that that consideration will be paid in another place to the revenuetariffist's point of view which we desire should be paid if this duty is eliminated. Honourable members opposite, and notably the honourable member for Southern Melbourne, took up the position that a duty upon tea is a burden upon the poor man. But did he or the members of the labour party raise their voice in the interests of the poor and struggling when the Government My idea were heaping other taxes upon them ? If we adopt, as I hope we shall, a duty of 2d. per lb. upon tea, the tax which the poor man will have to. pay will be about a I d . per week. But honourable members opposite have placed much heavier taxes upon nine out of ten of all the articles he uses or consumes. He will have to pay four or five times as much upon his boots, his hats, his groceries, and many other things, but the full amount of the tax will not go into the pockets of the State; whereas practically the whole of the revenue derived from the duty upon tea will reach the Treasury. I am aiming at the establishment of a Tariff of compromise, and the revenue which a duty upon tea will produce will be required, if ever we get such a Tariff. We shall not rest content with the result of our labours this session, but the consideration of the Tariff will be re-opened before very long, and we shall then endeavour to remove some of the heavy duties now imposed. When we secure their remission, we shall require the tea duty in order to retain our finances upon a sound footing. The fact that the Treasurer expects a surplus of over £600,000 has been used as an argument in favour of abolishing the duty 'on tea. AVe must, however, proceed quietly in regard to this surplus. The wisest of us cannot foretell what tihe effect of the Tariff will be, but if we have such a surplus when the full effects of the Tariff are felt, the best use the Treasurer could make of any such money would be to apply it to the purposes to which the proposed loan is to be devoted. We could not better employ any surplus than by using it so as to avoid the necessity for adopting the borrowing policy which has been the curse and bane of all the States in the past. If we have any surplus we shall know what to do with it. Economy in the States will have to be enforced by the citizens of those States, and we ought not to speak about ' duties in order to reduce the expenditure of the State Governments. we should be wanting in the federal spirit if we did not pay some attention to the financial necessities of such States as Queensland, Tasmania, and South Australia. The deficiency in tlie finances of Queensland is so large that I venture to say many Queenslanders must be looking forward with apprehension to the Tasmania also has a deficiency which, although it may seem small to many of us, is certainly a very grave one, and that State will have difficulty in meeting it. In South Australia, we are told that the Government have been able only to barely make ends meet with their present revenue, and that if we decrease it by such a large sum as that expected to. be realized from the duty on tea, we shall upset their financial arrangements. committee, without sinking its principles, to, as far as possible, provide for the financial needs of the States, 'and I think we should be proceeding in the wrong direction if we were to remit the duty on tea, because, although the Tariff may supply New South Wales with a surplus, it will not yield more than sufficient to meet the requirements of tlie other States. For these reasons I shall support a duty of 2d. per lb. upon tea. The proposed duty upon kerosene brings us. face to face with a different set of circumstances. tea is consumed by every one throughout the Commonwealth, kerosene is used only Mr G. B. Edwards. in the extreme suburbs surrounding the large metropolitan centres or in the country districts. It is upon the residents in the country and the outlying parts of the cities that in many instances the Tariff will impose the heaviest burdens, and it would be scandalous if we, after having remitted the duty to some extent upon the light used by the people in the large cities, were to impose a special tax upon the only illuminant that can be used in the country districts. For this reason I shall vote against the duty on kerosene. elected to this ChamberI stated it was my intention to vote for the admission of tea free of duty. If , for the purpose of calculating the percentage of this duty upon the value of the article, we adopt the price of tea, f.o.b., at the port of shipment, we shall find that it amounts to from 75 to 100 remitting per cent. The average price of tea, f.o.b., at the port of shipment may be stated at Then, again, from 4d. to 5d., and the tea used by the poorer classes of the community would scarcely be worth as much as 4d. per lb. Yet honourable members who objected to 25 per cent, duties in many cases, are now ready to support this heavy impost. voted for a duty of 180 per cent, in one consequences. case. of 180 per cent, upon goods which could be manufactured here, and if we could grow tea and regulate the conditions under which it was prepared, I should vote for an even higher duty than that now proposed. It is only because this duty has no protective incidence that I am opposing it . I am given to understand that there will be a large majority against the introduction of It is the duty of this free tea, and that many honourable members who have opposed taxes of a far less oppressive nature intend to support the duty upon an article which is consumed in every house in the Commonwealth. It has been urged that unless we impose a duty of 3d. or 4d. per lb., we shall have large quantities of adulterated tea imported into tlie Commonwealth. I do not think, however, that we need have any fear on that score, because we have provided in the Customs Act against the importation of adulterated and exhausted tea. I hope that kerosene Whilst will be admitted free, for reasons very similar to those which I have advanced in favour of the exemption of tea. The value",43,Honourable Members Hear Hear

202,Mr Tudor,"I should vote for a duty of kerosene, f.o.b., at the port of shipment, would be from 6d. to 7d. per gallon, and the duty proposed would represent a very high percentage on its value-equa l to 50 per cent. Many honourable members have expressed themselves as opposed to tlie imposition of any duties representing a higher percentage than 15 percent., and l a m curious to see how many of them will be found supporting the Government in regard to the duties now proposed which range from 50 per cent, to 100 per cent. The division list will show who are the real friends of the workers in this community. It has been urged that we should take care that tlie revenue realized by the Tariff is sufficiently large to maintain tlie solvency of all the States, but I contend that tlie Commonwealth has no duty in that respect. All we have to do, according to my reading of the Constitution, is to return to the States three-fourths of the duties we collect. The State Governments, would be in a particularly happy position if we have to find all the money that they spend. In Victoria the daily newspapers are urging the necessity of economy in the State expenditure in the public offices, and possibly the same thing might with equal advantage be impressed upon the Governments of other States, especially with the higher paid officials. If the doctrine preached by some honourable members this evening be a sound one, then the Commonwealth is under an obligation to provide all the revenue which the States may desire to spend. That would be a very happy position for the States to occupy. They would get credit for all the new roads and bridges which were constructed, and for all the railways which were built, without having to provide the money for those undertakings, because we provide all the money and incur all the odium and displeasure of the ratepayers, as we impose the taxes. I claim that we are not compelled to preserve the solvency of any State. All that we are required to do under the Constitution is to return to the States three-fourths of the revenue which we collect. If that revenue be not sufficient for State purposes, the State Governments have an unlimited field for taxation. Let those States that are short go in for a land tax. Honourable members are well aware that since the labour party announced their intention of fighting for the remission of the duties upon tea and kerosene very little revenue has been collected upon those articles. During the past four months the duty upon tea has returned only £64,000, although it would need to yield twice that amount to realize this Treasurer's estimate. But despite the fact that very little revenue has been collected upon tea and kerosene, the Treasurer anticipates that the receipts for this financial year under this Tariff will exceed his estimate by £578,000. Therefore, honourable members can vote for the remission of the duties upon the articles named without entertaining the slightest fear that by so doing they will bring about a deficiency in the accounts. I hope that honourable members will show that they are in favour of giving the workers an instalment of that free breakfast table of which we have heard so much. one looks at the Treasurer's estimate of the reveaue which will be raised under this Tariff the more it becomes apparent that the amount will approximate £9,750,000. This is a very serious matter, when we recollect that every £1,000,000 extracted from the people deprives 10,000 men of constant employment at £ 2 per week. Every penny raised in taxation limits the amount of capital available for productive work. It is, therefore, to the interest of the Commonwealth to keep the amount collected from the people down to the lowest possible point. When federation was inaugurated, it was estimated that the customs revenue required to be raised would amount to £7,800,000. Assuming that another £200,000 were derived from this source, the total would represent only £8,000,000. Now we are told by the Treasurer that he expects to receive £9,400,000. I believe that the revenue collected under this Tariff will not fall far short of £10,000,000. Of course honourable members are told that we must consider the necessities of the States, but I have yet to learn that the people of the States are not the people of the Commonwealth, and that any injury inflicted upon the latter is not felt by the former. Yet the extraordinary argument has been presented that, because Tasmania or Queensland require a certain amount of revenue, we should impose the taxation proposed. When we are asked to consider .one State, why not another? Why not consider that four States are receiving far more revenue than they actually require?

Tea can be and has been grown in the Inverell and Clarence districts, and if a duty of Is. or Is. 6d. per lb. were imposed, it would soon be successfully and profitably produced.

The Treasurer talks aboub raising a loan of £500,000, but I suggest that if he insists on retaining the duty on tea, it would be better to devote the revenue thus raised to the purposes of the loan, rather than embark on a career of extravagant borrowing. Wales say ? people would at once say that what they want to see throughout Australia is economy. object to any duties which can be done without, and I only regret that half-a-dozen members on this side have departed from the sound principle that all taxation is an evil. Led away by what they think are the necessities of the States, and forgetting that we represent the Commonwealth, they have intimated their intention to, in certain cases, support the Government in these duties. Like other members of the free-trade party, I can only fight against such a policy. If the Government had been able to say that the revenue was so small that they could not carry on, they would have established a sound case for these duties ; but that is not the position. The great bulk of the working people are perfectly prepared to take their fair share of taxation, and the man who is not willing to take his share ought not to have a vote; but no man should pay a single penny more than, is absolutely necessaiy. state of affairs prevails here from that which prevails in England, where the proportion of direct and indirect taxation is, roughly speaking, 50 per cent. each. When Lord Salisbury uttered a warning to the people in this connection it was taken as a protectionist statement, but it had a very different will still be asking for extra revenue, and if meaning. Lord Salisbury said that the two different methods of taxation had arrived at such a point that if any further revenue had to be raised ifc must be by broadening the area of taxation. That meant that if another million had to be raised ifc would have to be raised directly and indirectly in equal proportions. But here it is proposed by some of the wealthiest men in the community to take £10,000,000 out of the pockets of the poorer classes of, the community in one form only. I do not think the English proportion can be preserved in a newly-settled community. Here direct and indirect taxation ought to be represented by 40 per cent, and 60 per cent. respectively. That disproportion, however, should disappear as the country becomes more thickly populated. What we have to consider is that if we raise £10,000,000, of that sum £6,000.000 ought to be raised directly and £4,000,000 indirectly. The principle we are fighting for is that each man shall contribute taxation according to his means ; but every sound rule known to political economists seems to have been departed from by the Government. Isi t a wonder that honorThe free-trade party naturally able members on this side are almost tired of explaining to the Government what is the proper course to take. I am afraid that some of the honourable members on the Government side will never learn, because we see that they allow the interests of the privileged few to out-weigh the interests of the great bulk of the. people. It is quite sufficient for a man to say that lie is a manufacturer, even if he employs only two or three hands, to at once receive from this Government an amount of consideration that thousands of workmen never would receive. When we consider all that has taken place in this committee, it is essential to prevent any further taxation. If the Government desire to carry these duties they ought to reconsider other items in the Tariff and make reductions. Let the Government, at any rate, give some promise to reduce the revenue, which is at present so large that A very different it can only lead to extravagance on the part of the various States. Every penny tliat we have been returning to the States has been spent by them, and those States which are receiving a surplus have plunged into acareer of violent extravagance.

We must pass Acts and must provide funds for their administration, and if all the money is handed over to the States we shall Create demands for further taxation from six States, instead of as now from only two. The difficulty is one which must be met sooner or later. What the Government should have done was to take care that the revenue raised did not exceed £8,000,000.

He forgets, however, that kerosene can be produced in New South Wales, and that the kerosene industry there formerly employed nearly 300 men. If the argument which he has been urging in support of other items of the Tariff, but which no one outside of a lunatic asylum would believe, be correct, he ought to ask us to vote for a protective duty on kerosene to encourage its local manufacture, and to make it cheaper.

I say that where taxation is not necessary it should not be imposed. We should look upon unnecessary taxation as an evil to be strenuously guarded against, and to be voted down on every opportunity. MrL . E. GROOM (Darling Downs) I intend to support a duty upon tea, because I believe that, unless the smaller States receive back a fairly large amount in cus toms and excise duties-=almos t as much as they were obtaining from that source of taxation before joining the Federation-the y will consider that this Parliament has been guilty of a breach of faith towards them. During the elections, the leader of the Opposition said that it woidd be necessary for the Commonwealth Tariff to produce at least £8,000,000, and the Prime Minister was of opinion that even a larger sum would have to be raised. Before that time, and previous to the taking of the referendum, it was pointed out that there were provisions in making his financial statement, relied in the Constitution which would secure the solvency of the smaller States, and prevent their financial embarrassment, and that a sufficient amount would be returned to them from customs and excise duties to make their financial position in that respect similar to what it was before they joined the union. We must now look upon the Tariff as a whole in considering the returns of the revenue. I do not think that honourable members opposite, if they were in power, could deal differently with the smaller States. Tariffs, each State was dependent for its revenue upon that source of taxation to a different degree, and it therefore follows that, in trying to meet the requirements of Queensland, which depended more than any other State upon its customs and excise duties, we must increase the revenues of the larger States. Thus, we must obtain more from New South Wales than that State, which was least dependent upon its customs and excise duties, requires. The statement of the honourable member for Parramatta, that the Government are responsible for what he terms "" this muddle,"" is incorrect. Whatever Government we might have in power would have the same problem to face-ho w to provide sufficient revenue for the smaller States. Queensgreater disadvantage than the other States. While many of us may consider direct taxation a fairer means than customs taxation of obtaining revenue, and look upon the imposition of customs duties rather as a means of encouraging and fostering native industries, we must have regard, not so much to our own fiscal opinions, as to the expectations of the people of Australia when they voted for federation. able member been voting against revenue duties MrL .

210,Mr Isaacs,"There is no provision i nduties, but the Commonwealth Treasurer estimated in the first instance that she would receive only £ 2 l is . 6^d. per head from the Commonwealth Tariff, a reduction of nearly ten shillings per head. Tariff now produces less than the Treasurer's estimate. That being so, I think that it would be a mistake to materially reduce the proposed revenue duties. The Queensland Treasurer last year, before the introduction of this Tariff, expected a receipt of £1,524,934 from customs and -excise duties. That, in my opinion, was an unreasonably large revenue to expect. The Commonwealth Treasurer, however, now estimates the probable receipts in Queensland at £1,281,421, which will give on the figures of the Queensland Treasurer a shortage of £243,513. The Treasurer of the Commonwealth estimates Queensland's shortage at £280,000. But the Queensland Treasurer is reported to have said the other day that his shortage, in revenue will actually amount to about £400,000. He cannot blame the Commonwealth Government for the whole of that deficiency. Some of ifc must be due to a decline in the other local sources of revenue. Last year in Queensland they had a deficiency of about £528,000, but notwithstanding that fact, they are incurring almost the same expenditure. I believe that when rain falls and the grass grows, and the stock increases, the revenue will improve very rapidly.

Surelyi t is reasonable that the Treasurer should make some allowance for a surplus from which he would be able to meet any such claims. I do not believe that Queensland will ever need to ask for such assistance. We have a State with unbounded natural resources. During the period from 1895 to 1901, Queensland suffered from one of the worse droughts ever known, but notwithstanding this her revenues have kept up wonderfully. In the financial year 1895-6 tlie revenue amounted, in round numbers; to £3,641,000; in 1896-7 to £3,613,000; in. 1897-8 to The £3,768,000; in 1898-9 to £4,174,000; and in 1899-1900 to £4,58S,000; and in 1900-1901 to £4,096,000. The trouble in Queensland has been that there has been an increase in the expenditure in excess of this continually expanding revenue. The State Government will not be justified in ascribing the whole of their deficiency to this Parliament for reducing the revenue from customs and excise. StillI think we should endeavour to keep the revenue of Queensland as nearly as possible at the figure at which it stood when the Federation was inaugurated. It is ot, as stated by tlie honourable member for Werriwa, the duty of the Commonwealth Government to practically dictate to the States how they shall carry on their business. If we attempt to assume any such function we shall create a great deal of unnecessary friction. We have to consider the necessities of the Commonwealth as a whole, and try to keep faith with the smaller States. The way in which the States spend their money is a matter entirely for the consideration of their own people. The present duty upon tea represents a reduction of 50 per cent, upon that previously levied in Queensland. In 1900 the duty on tea in Queensland realized about £87,800, whereas will realize in that State £52,000 ; so that considerable relief has been granted to the consumers of tea in Queensland. The duty on"" kerosene represents to Queensland only £16,000 per annum, and as the tax would fall upon tlie residents of the outlying country districts, I shall support its abolition. may at once conciliate the honourable and learned member for Werriwa by declaring that if he will move that sugar, glucose, matches and vestas, rice, starch and starch flours, and kerosene be placed upon the free list, I shall support him. I cannot, however go with the honourable and learned member as regards tea. As a free-trader, I have always held that, when we are readjusting the Tariff, free-traders are bound to diminish, and, if possible, abolish duties which have a protective incidence, and I contend that this can only be done by the retention of the purely revenue duties. If we",49,Honourable Members Hear Hear
211,Sir William Mcmillan,I think he,50,Honourable Members Hear Hear
212,Mr Glynn (South Australia),"Isurrender the purely revenue duties, of which tea is one, we shall simply play into the hands of the protectionists, and send to another place a Tariff which is indirect in its incidence, and protective in its character. For these reasons I must differ from the honourable and learned member as to what ought to be the free-trade policy with regard to these duties. Ib is not in accordance with the best spirit of free-trade traditions to destroy purely revenue duties, and by diminishing bhe revenue to give a pretext for the levying of protective duties. For that reason I consider thab tea should bear a duty, and I would point out that the comparative pressure of such an impost upon the poorer classes has been much exaggerated. estimated by Coghlan that the consumption of tea amounts to about 7 lbs. per head of the population, and, assuming that a family consists of four persons, the total amount paid in duty upon the tea consumed by them would not amount to more than 7s. per annum. amounts to 10s. per family, we may inquire, what is the general incidence of the Customs Tariff? It is stated as being equal to over £2 per head, so far as the results bo the revenue are concerned. to MidliaU, however, a conbribution of £2 per head to the revenue means a burden of six times bhab amount upon bhe taxpayer. If £2 per head is contributed to the revenue, a family of four would contribute £8 per annum. calculation the total burden, being that paid to the revenue and the higher profits to protected to six times £8, but if we double the amount, instead of multiplying six, we find that the total of the Tariff upon a family of four would amount to £16 per annum. that is asked for by those who supporb bhe remission of bhe duby on tea is the reduction of this amount by at most 10s., and I submit that those honourable members who are opposing tlie duby are directing bheir attention to the wrong item. If we have to levy customs duties, I look upon the impost upon tea as easily levied, and one of the least burdensome; said in its favour that it has been sustained as a revenue duty in England for the last 200 years. follow on all points the reasoning of my honourable colleague, Mr V. L. Solomon. I am nob afraid for bhe financial condition of Mr Glynn. South Australia. The Treasurer told us that he estimated that the revenue of South Australia from customs and excise would amount to £683,000, or £19,000 more than was first estimated, and £44,000 more than was received in 1899. In 1896-7 the customs duties produced £S6,000 less than the estimate for this year; in 1897-8 . the receipts were £110,000 less than for this year; and in 189S-9 £S6,000 less. I contend, therefore, that there is no ground for any such fears as my honourable colleague entertains, and that from the poinb of view of solvency, the figures I have mentioned will compare favourably with any figures which may be quoted for any other State in It is the Union. The South Australian revenue is now larger than it ever was. It is not from any fear that South Australia would be financially cramped that I support the retention of this duty, bub simply because it is a revenue duty, and the least burdensome of all duties in its inEven admittingthat it cidence. W it h regard to kerosene I may mention that in the South Australian Parliament not only did I express myself in favour of the abolition of the duty upon it , but I supported a resolution with that According object. I honestly believe that we ought to retain the duty upon tea, because it is easily collected, and because the incidence of the taxation is extremely light. For example, compare the incidence of that duty with the outlay by the ordinary head Taking Mulhall's of a family upon beer. The tax upon beer is far more burdensome. industries, would amount only one member of a family. it by difference to the financial outlay involved 1 incidence The incidence of the beer duty, taking the average weekly outlay on it, is far heavier All than the incidence of the duty upon tea, and if I were to charge any members of the party with which I am associated with inconsistency, I should say that they are inconsistent in hot asking that the poor man shall have his beer duty free. I shall support the proposed duty upon tea, not because I believe in indirect taxation, but because I think that, while we are re-adjusting the and it may also be Tariff, we ought first to deal wibh the most burdensome or protective duties. able and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, certainly supplied some original matter to this discussion when he said in effect bhab £16,000,000 are",50,Honourable Members Hear Hear

215,I Do Not Mr Fisher (Wide Bay),"The honorextorted from the people in order that the Commonwealth may secure a revenue of £8,000,000. believe that statement, I think the earliest opportunity should be afforded them of smashing the whole Tariff, and of collecting from the people, by some easy system, only the amount necessary to carry on the government of the country. I should not have risen but for the statements which have been graciously made, that the necessities of Queensland are so great that unless the proposed duties are sanctioned, that State will be compelled to knock at the door of the Commonwealth for assistance. Queensland, I affirm, is not in the position of a mendicant. Her financial position, notwitstanding the serious droughts which she has suffered during the past few years, is the best of all the States. Certainly she has the greatest resources, and under proper administration would soon, become the greatest Australian State. A mere temporary deficit is not going to destroy Queensland, which contains more good land in one district than is to be found in the whole of Victoria. I do not think that the proposal to levy a duty upon kerosene can be justified. Such a tax will fall almost entirely upon the pioneers and people who are resident outside of towns. In most instances the residents of towns consume either gas or electricity. Very high rates are charged for the carriage of kerosene upon our railways. Surely, having regard to all these circumstances, the Commonwealth will not insist upon placing a duty upon this article. In connection with the financial condition of Queensland, I would ask if it is likely tliat a State which receives an announcement by its Treasurer of a deficit for the last financial year of £528,000 without a shudder, will fall upon its knees and beg assistance from the Commonwealth if we withhold from it £52,000, which represents its proportion of the revenue derivable from tea, and £25,000, which covers its share of the revenue collected upon kerosene? I wish also to point out that attempts have been made by . public men in Queensland to give people the impression that if the Commonwealth remits these duties, the other States will derive all the benefit therefrom at Queensland's expense. That is the kind of teaching which has been going on in Queensland. The citizens of that State are led to believe that the revenue is being reduced for the advantage of the other States. in Queensland who know better, though not making the statement in direct' words, cunningly contrive to leave the impression that the reduction of customs duties is to the disadvantage of that State and to the advantage of the other States. If we reduce the duty upon any article, the deficiency thus created will certainly not be collected from the people of Queensland. Why should'we impose a revenue duty upon tea when the consensus of opinion in Australia is that that article should be admitted free ? The honourable and learned member for Darling Downs has said that we must respect the compact which was made with the States. I admit that we should endeavour to carry out that compact as far as possible. In the case of Queensland, however, it is impossible to do so, because of the high taxation which existed there prior to the establishment of the federation. In my judgment we should not abstain from remedying the anomalies which appear in the Tariff simply because Queensland, as the result of recent droughts, is temporarily in financial difficulties. This Tariff will probably stand for years, and we should legislate accordingly. I shall cheerfully vote in favour of exempting tea and kerosene from duty. If only one of these articlescan be made duty free I hope that it will be kerosene. Every one will pay his proportion of the duty on tea; but in the case of kerosene the persons least able to pay the increased price are those who are doing the best work in Australia, and those whose lot in life is the very hardest. The Premier of Queensland has stated that if we take off the duty on rice we shall do a great injustice to Queensland's revenue. The duty, he says, will lead to the production of rice in that State.. That is delightful reasoning. I am only giving the statement as Mi'. Philp is reported to have made it. As far as my opinion is worth anything, Queensland requires no commiseration in this matter. She is not in need, nor will she ever come to the Commonwealtli for help. I believe, indeed, that if there is to be any appeal for help it will be made by some of the people of the other States to Queensland.

If the Government will accept the compromise I have suggested, they will retain a fair margin over the revenue necessary, and will commend their proposals to the committee. my intention to vote for a duty on tea, which I hope will be 3d. per lb., and also for the other proposals of the Treasurer. I do not do this as a representative of Tasmania, but as a member of the Commonwealth, and because I believe tea is a fair, and legitimate subject for taxation. As a resident in the country I have used* kerosene all my life, and can speak feelingly on the subject; nevertheless I think it is a fair subject for taxation. I rose particularly to refer to some remarks which have been made in regard to one or two of the smaller States. Representatives of the richer and more populous States have said that the smaller States should not be considered -at all-that the fact that a smaller State requires a few thousand pounds of revenue is no reason for imposing taxation amounting to £500,000 on the rest of the Commonwealth. But no Statein the Commonwealth ha,s received such small consideration as Tasmania. ""When the cry was raised for a "" white Australia "" in connection with the sugar industry in Queensland, the Treasurer, in order, I believe, to placate the labour party, proposed an excise duty on sugar.

Tasmania has never been, considered on any occasion by tlie members of this committee. I have no desire to continue the debate, because no new point can now be touched on. I sincerely trust the Treasurer will stand to his guns and will not retreat as he has done on other occasions. MrO ' MALLEY (Tasmania) -Most of the honourable members who have spoken seem to have devoted their attention to Queensland and Tasmania, and have, in fact, endeavoured to show that these States are the two financial vagrants of the Commonwealth. The bookkeeping provisions of the Constitution are a huge mistake. What benefit would it be to me to become the partner of a Rockefeller or a Rothschild, if I had to ""go broke"" in the partnership. That is exactly the position of Tasmania and Queensland, which came into the Union to better their condition and to assist in bettering the condition of the whole Commonwealth. Tasmania will lose £20,000 if we make kerosene and tea free, but look at the immense revenue that New South Wales obtains from those commodities. The difficulty in the Commonwealth of Australia is that Ministers seem to be afraid to tackle this question like straight out business men. When we evolved this Constitution it was the result of compromise with stipulations. The idea was that the Ministers' selected should be capable of grasping the situation, and formulating a scheme in accordance with the environment and conditions of the people. I have lived in a country where there would be no difficulty in adjusting the whole matterbut here Ministers seem to be bound by red-tape to the eternal conditions of their forefathers. The trouble with every British country I have been in is that the Government seems bound by relics of the dark ages. It is proposed that we should tax the people of this great Commonwealth to the extent of thousands of pounds in order to prevent of £20,000, and Queensland from losing ing the people's money, and nothing has",53,Honourable Members Hear Hear

Now, the working man is being called upon to make this loss good. But I propose to the Government an expedient which I would have no hesitation in adopting if I were running the show. Instead of raising extra taxation from the whole Commonwealth, I would hand over .£20,000 to Tasmania, and £77,000 to Queensland, out of the immense surplus that New South Wales is to receive; charge them with it during the bookkeeping period ; and, in balancing the accounts, forgive them the debt. That is the way in which the American people are treating the State of Nevada. The whole system of Christianity is founded upon two practical maxims""Love God, and love humanity,"" and a second which springs from the first-""Let the strong bear the burdens of tlie weak."" I quite agree with the sub-leader of the Opposition that it would be a good thing to reduce the duty upon tea to 2d. per lb.; but it is better to have no duty at all. The Treasurer is one of those who would follow a sovereign all over the earth. When he hands you a coin, it has a string attached to it , so that he gets it back before you can take hold of it . He was very much below the revenue-producing powers of the Commonwealth in the calculations which he made, and I should be quite willing to take the extra amount, and clear out of this House for ever. Look how they are taxed in England. We have no taxes upon titles here, though I think that our friends who accept titles should be willing to pay a couple of thousand pounds to the revenue. Theni n England they have a heavy tax upon coats-of-arms, and upon carriage crests, but we have no such tax here. member is now discussing something quite apart from the Tariff. Mr O'MALLEY -Yes, but I am trying to illustrate the fact that we have not nearly exhausted our resources of taxation, and every man must speak according to the intelligence which God has given him. In conclusion, let me say that the time has come for the Commonwealth Parliament to do something for the strugglers of Australia -for the sovereign democrats on the West Coast of Tasmania, and the people everywhere throughout this great country. Let the poor women out in the back-blocks-o n the mountain tops, in the valleys, and by the side of our little streams-ge t their tea free, and let them have free light, so that their children may see to drink that tea That is all I ask. propose to detain the committee to any great length, because there is no doubt that this matter has been thoroughly thrashed out from all points of view. No one would have a claim to this particular duty on pro : tectionist grounds. We need not therefore be surprised to see a split on both sides of the Chamber. Our friends on the Opposition benches are not unanimous, any more than are honourable members sitting on this side, and the proposal ought not be regarded as a party question in any shape or form. This matter, I admit, is purely one of revenue, and I look at it solely from that point of view. As a revenue tax I think that a duty on tea is perfectly j ustifiable. We find it in existence all over the world. I believe that they have no duty' on tea in Western.Australia or in the United States, but it is generally resorted to as a fair and legitimate tax, which falls upon all classes of the community. It is all very well to talk about our having a surplus of £ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 ; but, unfortunately, honourable members -will look at the total amount, and not at the individual States. That is where the trouble arises. We may have this large surplus, but whilst £8,000,000 might be enough for the individual States, we have to give £1,000,000 out of what we may raise to New South Walesi n consequence of her having previously adopted a free trade policy. That is what creates all the difficulty. If New South Wales had been previously raising large sums through the Customs that difficulty would not have arisen. . If the Convention had endorsed the views I entertained with regard to the distribution of the moneys raised through customs and excise, and if the representatives of New South Wales had then held the same views as the 'honourable members from that State now appear to entertain, there would have been no difficulty. We should not have had the bookkeeping clauses, and there would have been no necessity to raise this large amount of revenue. It would, however, have been hardly fair at the start to ask one or two States to contribute the whole amount required. Althoughi t might have been",54,Honourable Members Hear Hear

Victoria and New South Wales were agreed upon that point. of the representatives of New South Wales said they would not mind helping the practically insolvent States to the extent of £300,000 or £400,000, but that they would not go any further. The Constitution ties us down to a certain amount of expemditure and, therefore, we have to consider what revenue has to be raised in order to maintain the Statesi n as nearly as possible the same position that they occupied in the year before federation was entered upon. I venture to say that if we had told the States which have been loyal to the federal movement from first to last that their finances were to be disarranged to a considerable extent, we should have found that they would not have entered into the Federation at all. If little Tasmania, the most loyal of all the States, after perhaps South Australia, had been told that there would be a heavy loss upon her customs revenue to the extent of something between £100,000 and £120,000 per annum, it would have been very difficult to convince her that she should enter the Federation. The States, however, did enter on the distinct understanding that this Farliament -would do all it could to maintain them in as nearly as possible the same position, as far as their finances are concerned, that they occupied before they entered into the federal bargain. gain. undoubtedly. honourable gentleman think of that when he brought down his first Estimates of Revenue? provide for it .

There is no doubt that during this year the States will have to go short. It is not only two States, but four, that are interested in of this matter. Queensland and Tasmania are undoubtedly deeply interested, but South Australia, as has been fully pointed out by the honourable member for South Australia, Mr Solomon, is also concerned, because the surplus which we expected that State would receive will probably be converted into a deficiency if we strike out these duties. In Victoria also, the abolition of these duties will make a difference of £161,000 per annum. gentleman will be paying them more than they formerly received. to take the year 1899 as the proper guidein this matter.

Theoretically, it is magnificent, but when the matter is put to the test ifc will be found that the people will say, "" It is all very fine if you put the tax on the other fellow, but do not put it on me.""

244,Mr Watson,"Yes, and also in Queensasserts that we could remove this duty if it were found later on that we could do without it. My experience is that it is 'ten times more difficult to remove a duty thari it is to impose it , for the simple reason that the only idea of a Ministry is to spend every cent upon which they can lay their hands. The mere fact that revenue is in existence is very often put forward as an excuse by those who ask for advances. surer appealing to the Federal Treasurer to reduce the amount returned to his State! that bird will fly. If we find later on that this duty is absolutely necessary, I do not think that there will be a voice raised against its imposition, provided that those who are conducting the affairs of the States interested first make a legitimate effort to see how far direct taxation will go towards making good the deficiency in revenue. When that has been tried and proved unsuccessful, I shall be prepared to vote for some compromise in the matter of the duty on tea and kerosene. Premier of Queensland has said that rather than impose a land tax he wouldsell every acre of Crown lands. It is a fine idea of economy to part with the capital of the State rather than impose a little direct taxation. As soon as the people of Queensland come to vote on the matter no doubt they will insure that no such prodigality in regard to the disposal of Crown lands shall take place. MrV . L , SOLOMON -Ne w South Wales has been doing that for a long time. South Wales have awakened to the iniquity of the practice, and recently we have materially diminished it . Another point raised by the Treasurer was that the consumers would not benefit by the reduction of tlie duty. We can certify that in New South Wales as soon as the duty on tea was removed the. consumers benefited. the same class of tea? class for the same money where an arbitrary price was fixed, and, in addition to that, the same class of tea was placed on the market at a reduction equal to the amount of the duty. We had a line of tea sold in New South Wales at 9d. per lb. which is now being retailed in Melbourne at Is. per lb., and which is.practically 31xi the lowest grade, plus the import duty. The package tea affords the easiest and most certain method of testing the difference. There can be no doubt whatever that the remission of a revenue duty of this kind is an immediate benefit to the consumer, because it gives rise to competition amongst the local salesmen leading to a reduction in the price. That is why the big tea merchants desire to see a duty imposed. They believe that it would 'shut put the competition of the small intruders who disarrange their business. They make a profit on the duty. The^honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, made a statement that the tea-duty was a very unimportant matter so far as the taxpayer was concerned. The amount received from stimulants and narcotics under the Treasurer's estimate is equal to about £ 1 4s. 6d. per head. The amount received from other items in the Tariff is £ 1 2s. fid. per head, and those other items include tea, kerosene, and articles of that sort. On the basis of' the computation, which the honourable member fOr North Sydney has made, and which I The think is an exceedingly low one, the tea duty alone, without counting the extra charge for interest that the merchant and retailer impose, amounts to 10s., or one-eleventh.of the total amount of taxation per family. Surelyi t is oil important matter by one vote to free the heads of families from one-eleventh of the whole taxation per family outside of that on admitted luxuries, such as narcotics and stimulants are. I have been twitted by the honourable member for Dalley and the honourable member for South Sydney, with not going the "" whole hog"" in respect to other items in the Tariff. PerhapsI have been seduced from the straight path of political rectitude by the example of some honourable members on the opposition side. They have departed from their own principles so far as to declare for the free importation of many lines on which they admit that they would be constrained to impose moderate duties if their own party were in power. In some coses I have hod to oppose the absolute freeing of lines where a large number of men were employed, but even on the question Of hats we found a compromise arrived at, and accepted by the Opposition generally through their acting leader, to impose a 30 per cent, duty, and I followed humbly in the rear. On many of these things I followed the lead of the honourable member for Wentworth.. .1 do not wish to shelter",57,Honourable Members Hear Hear
