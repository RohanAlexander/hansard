4,Mr Menzies,"A very ingeniousruasons that they stated-no t to defend free institutions, not to honour their pledge to Poland-bu t because they thought that Germany, after dealing with Poland, would come their way. That is the allegation. The furthe r allegation is that, had we received a guarantee from Germany that, having cleaned up Poland, it would proceed east, then we would, with cynicism, have torn up our pledge to Poland and would have said, "" Sorry, it does not matter about you; so long as the German fights the Russian, it is a good thing."". That, as a statement to go out to the world from a responsible Minister of the Government of this country, subject to censorship, as an indication of what that responsible Minister thinks, is as diabolical a thing as could conceivably be thought of. It says to Russia, with which the British Empire, the United States of America, and all the expatriated powers of Europe have a partnership of blood: "" If Germany had had a go at you and had taken Poland on the way, then GreatB r it a in and France would have heen prepared to say, ' Havei t your own w a y ' "". In other words, they would have been prepared toquit in face of the greatest responsibility ever .placed upon them. Then, having said that, he comes along with bated breath and whispering humbleness, and says, "" I regret, I am surprised, that any one has misconstrued the meaning intended to he conveyed by me "". The honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr White) must have interjected something at that stage, because the Minister went on to sayI point out to tlie honourable member for Balaclava tliat one of our great disadvantages in the present conflict has been the fact that the native peoples over whom we had control -and I now refer to Great BritainMark those wordsI now refer to Great Britain.

He did not administration. doubt also exists as to the loyalty of great numbers of Indians to the British cause. Iu Malaya, troops had to be withdrawn from the firing line in order to discharge cargo from ships because native labourers at Singapore deserted. In spite of the "" hifalutin"" talk of honourable members opposite, the natives saw no reason to be enthusiastic iu defending a form of government which had kept them in a state of illiteracy and semistarvation. I ask honourable members on any side of the House whether there can be any room for misconstruction. I s there any room to doubt that that is an attack of the most scandalous kind upon British colonial administration? The whole sentence is a bitter sneer at British administration, and it is delivered at a time when the problem of India is delicate enough, God knows-whe n the whole problem of Eastern peoples now under the control of the Japanese is difficult enough. This is the time when the Minister chooses to say with a sneer things of this kind about British administration in Eastern countries. Later on, the Minister said thisThere has been a widely shared opinion, not only in Australia, but also in other countries, that certain of the United Nations tended to try to withhold their strength, and retain it and build it up while allowing the Soviet to be bled white, so that when the conflict terminates they will be the strongest military powers in Europe, and therefore wield the greatest influence at the Peace Conference. What construction should be placed on that? Why should a Minister of the Crown, from his place in the House, make such a remark? Wasi t in order to reproduce idle gossip? That is inconceivable. D i d he say it so that, having said it, he could deny it? The fact is that he did not deny it . D i d he say it so that, having said it , he could dissociate himself and his colleagues from it? He did not do so. What he did was to adopt this alibi form of words most carefully, and to use them in a manner which indicated deliberation. I notice that a commentator in one daily journal remarked with great spirit and propriety that a crime was none the more creditable because it was committed with a borrowed weapon. If the Minister intended no more than to recount this contemptible story, why did he not follow it up by saying, "" But nobody do that. He repeated the story, and left it there in all its repellent nudity. Then, when he was challenged, he declared, "" I",11,Motion Of Want Of Confidence Sbcond Frontinwebte Rn Europe Statementbtmb E J Ward M P Means What He Says I Cannot Of Course

8,Mr Menzies,"to the Prime Minister that I am baffled by his position in this matter. I just do not begin to understand it. Surely, he must realize how ambiguous is his position in relation to this matter. It it almost as if, looking at our Allies, he were adapting some words of a famous seventeenth century song and saying, "" I could not love the so much, loved I not Eddie more What is the secret of the powers of a Minister who can-and I hope and believe that this is a true statement-so frequently depart from the policy of the Government of which he is a sworn member and yet remain a Minister? What will fhe people of Australia say ? of the world say insofar as they are interested in us? What conclusion can they reach about this matter? It is a really astonishing incident. It is an incident which should have been followed by the instant dismissal of the Minister from his seat in the Government. It has not been so followed, and, because it has not been so followed, I believe-and I say it with regret and sadness-that this matter has brought grave discredit on this country wherever live people who have read about it and puzzled about it. So, I move in the terms of which I gave notice yesterday. The Prime Minister has said that this is a motion of censure. It is a motion of censure, indeed. "" Censure"" would be a mild word to describe the feeling of Australians who have read what was said last Thursday and what has been done, or has not been done, in the interim, and realize that the man who uttered those foul libels is still in a posimorale of the people than hy the fact tion to utter them with the apparent backing and undoubted authority of being a Minister of the Crown. support the motion of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies). I only wish that the Prime Minister( Mr keep allies together there must he enCurtin) had been in the House last Thursday night to hear and sense the sentiments expressed by the Minister for Transport ( Mr Ward). If the Prime Minister had been here, I do not think that he could with any sort of conscience whatsoever have accepted this mealy-mouthed apology of the Minister. I sat through that speech and listened wlith amazement to the thoroughly anti-British sentiments expressed by that Minister in this House. Throughout the speech, if one reads it, one can see a tirade against British administration before and during this war. The culmination of the speech was How can it he explained? the words already -read by the Leader of the Opposition. I must read them again I do not think they can be read too often-to let them sink into the mind of every member of this nation who has a drop of British blood in his veinsI do not know whether a second front in Western Europe is advisable. That problem I leave to militar y experts to determine. But there has been a widely shared opinion not only in Australia but also in other countries that certain of the United Nations tend to t r y to withhold their stength, and retain it and build it up while allowing the Soviet to bleed itself white, so that when the conflict terminates they will be the strongest military influence at the Peace Conference. The implications in that remark are sinister. The Minister does not state that this is his own opinion. He said that it is "" widely shared"", but he does not s a 7 hy whom it is shared. I will tell him. Such sentiments do not come out of even his fertile brain. They came from the German propaganda machine eighteen months or two years ago. They are similar to the propaganda that came over during the last war. They are nation-splitting sentiments, and the expression of them hy a responsible Minister shows that he is, wittingly or unwittingly, making himself a tool of the German propaganda machine. Wars are won .more by the spirit and tliat one people can produce more munitions and raise larger armies than another people. Armies are useless unless their morale is high and unless they have confidence in one another. Napoleon said, ""Give me allies to fight"". To gendered between them a spirit of implicit trust and confidence that each is fighting for the same cause and that there will he no separate ends to he gained to the disadvantage of one of them.

11,Mr Coies (Henty) [2.56],"I rise to the minds of soldiers fighting on the allied side. They are specially coined by a skilful propaganda machine to attempt to split the Allies. Last Wednesday, I heard the remarks of the Prime Minister which, to say the least of them, are not unseasonable. Britain, though not in words such as those used by the Minister. He drew attention to the unequal distribution of the necessaries of lif e and he directed the attention of Australians to the fact that GreatB r it a in is on the "" t h in edge of the wedge "" at the present time and the position looks bad for that country. He pointed out that Australia has a task to perforin. That task is to endure a greater strain in the coming year than Australians have had to bear in the past. We must give up luxuries and perhaps even certain necessaries in order that we may send more of the necessaries of life to the people of GreatB r it a in so as to enable them to carry on the struggle, despite their fatigue. The Prime Minister saidThe people of the United Kingdom, too, have been fighting for a long time. While t:he enemy has been using up his resources wo also have been using up our resources, and it would be unrealistic on my part not tn acknowledge it. What a difference between those words and the sentiments expressed by the Minister! reeded.Most certainly the people of the United Kingdom,' in particular, have had to bear stresses and strains inseparable from the maintenance of their island home, not only for themselves, but also as a base which the United Nations could and must use. The United Kingdom had to be held in order that it could be used as a base for the launching of a vast force against Germany. That this has been achieved by Great Britain is a matter not only for admiration, but also for thanksgiving, for had that base not been held Germany would have won the war. That is a fact. The people of the United Kingdom have been engaged in active warfare longer than have the people of Australia. The Prime Minister fighting a good fight. He is leading the thoughts of the people along the right lines. He knows how difficult it is for our people, vasion recedes, to keep to the task when they are becoming tired. to educate the people of Australia to do Mr dole*. their part, the right honourable gentleman needs l i e whole-hearted hacking, not only of his own Ministers but also of the whole community. In repeating the sentiments put out by a German propaganda machine, the Minister for He referred to Great Transport is traitorous to his Prime Minister, to his country and to our Allies. That is my opinion of his remarks. He is not worthy to hold the position of a Minister of the Crown. He said in this statement that is supposed to clear h i m It is not my intention to reflect adversely in any way whatever upon the Governments either of Great Britain or any other Allied country. Ou whom then is he reflecting? Is he reflecting on the people of GreatB r it a in ? I have been in GreatB r it a in during this war. I felt the spiritual impact of contact with those people under bombing. I am grateful and Australia is grateful for the enormous quantities of arms and materials of all kinds that they sent abroad in their extremity, when they had practically nothing with which to defend themselves. What is more, they have continued to send out those materials in ever-increasing quantities. The Leader of the Opposition drew attention to the epic courage of the Murmansk convoys. Nothing like that has ever beThe Prime Minister profore been written in history. The people of GreatB r it a in did that. I want the Minister to understand that I speak of things which I know. I saw these people in their distress. I visited the homes of people who had been bombed out and I saw what they were enduring. I know the confidence that they have in their Government. It is the pure trust and confidence of a grateful .people to a government that has tackled superhuman tasks and has won, not only for themselves, but also for us. Where would we be if GreatB r it a in had not held the for t in those dark days when the rest of Europe fell? No such sentiment as was of Australia is expressed in this House on Thursday night should be allowed to go abroad from, any person in Australia, let alone a responsible M in as the threat of inister. But how can censorship prevent those words from being read abroad ? In his effort They are published in every newspaper in Australia. They will be read by Australian soldiers and airmen throughout the world, and the impression will be gained that the Commonwealth Government, which has led this country through dark days when invasion was near, and which has done a magnificent job for Australia, has condoned this utterance by tacit consent. It is unthinkable that tlie Prime Minister should condone such remarks. do it. A man who expresses such sentiments, and means them, and I say he meant them, because I sensed the atmosphere in the House when he was speaking that evening, should be interned. Make no error about it. It was a vicious, virulent speech that was meant to be slanderous to Great Britain and to British administration. We shall never be worthy of what other nations have done for us unless we, in our hearts, are willing to bear the whole burden that we are expected to bear, and throw out those people who voice such sentiments as those which the Minister expressed. I urge the Prime Minister not to treat this matter lightly. The right honourable gentleman will shortly visit Great Britain, where his name and his reputation stand high. He must keep them high. Ho stands for Australia. He must not have to answer a charge that he is condoning sentiments that are thoroughly anti-British. ister) [3.8] -The House is called upon to carry a motion submitted by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) because the Minister for Transport ( Mr Ward) is at present a member of the Government. of the case put forward by the right honourable gentleman relates to remarks that were made in this chamber last Thursday evening by the Minister. If the matter stood there, I could quite appreciate the purport of the speeches that have heen made. But yesterday I was asked a question, and I replied that I regarded the letter which the Minister had addressed to me as making it quite -clear that he never at any time had any intention of reflecting adversely upon the Government of the United Kingdom or the Government of any of its Allies.' Minister know the meaning of plain English? and I take it now, as a withdrawal of any reflection upon our Allies, and chiefly upon Great Britain. He wrote in his letter to me that he had no intention of reflecting upon Great Britain and our Allies. I The Prime Minister cannot have been a member of Parliament for a long while and I have heard many speeches in this chamber. All of us, on occasions, express ourselves in what we ourselves might subsequently regard as a somewhat unfortunate way. In this matter the purpose of the Minister is the chief thing. If everything that the Leader of the Opposition has said about that speech representedthe intention of the Minister, he would not be a member of the Government to-day. As a matter of fact, he would not want to serve in the Government. But as it happens that his remarks either bear that construction or have been so construed, the Minister, in his letter to me, has assured me that he never had any intention of reflecting upon Great Britain. Minister must have thought differently when he caused the speech, to be censored. member for Parramatta wish me to give instances of the occasions on which, for the good of this country, action has been taken in respect of remarks made in this Parliament? Prime Minister must have had misgivings. The whole tunate and, indeed, a most unhappy occurrence; there need not be any misunderstanding about that. Everything that the Leader of the Opposition has said about the words that were uttered could have been said by every honourable member on this side of the House. From the time that this Government assumed office until now, there has been in fact a maximum contribution by this country in order to wage total war. There has been on the part of this Government only the warmest and most eager co-operation with the Government of the United Kingdom in the work",14,Motion Of Want Of Confidence Sbcond Frontinwebte Rn Europe Statementbtmb E J Ward M P Means What He Says I Cannot Of Course

33,Mr Curtin,"I suppose that any of the United Kingdom. That is what I regard the Minister's letter as meaning and that is the construction I place upon it. I was therefore quite ready to allow the incident to close. That is where the matter stands at the moment. I do not propose to say much more about it. Honourable gentlemen opposite have been eager for a long while to discover in speeches, or in some other way, some indication that this Government is not fully co-operating with its Allies in the war. I do not think any evidence of that kind can be produced against the Government, for the actions which it has taken, and which it will take, are far more important than any words that may be uttered by any one. Our record of service and actual accomplishmentsthe things that have been done-is the most conclusive proof obtainable of how far the Government has striven for maximum co-operation with its Allies. The stresses and strains that, as a matter private and independent member of Parliaof policy, we have imposed upon the nation indicate that we have given the fullest co-operation that Australia could give to its Allies. For my colleagues as a whole and for myself I say that we are proud of what Australia, has done; but we are even more proud of what Great Britain has done in the war. Leader of the Australian Country party) [3.18] I must say that I am surprised and disgusted by the complacent manner in which the Prime Minister( Mr honourable gentleman now says that, havCurtin) has treated this serious matter. Hearing his sentiments, following the admirable speech of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) and the passionate British speech of the honourable member for Henty( Mr heard a portion of it. The Prime Coles), I was both surprised and appalled. The Prime Minister said that he accepted the statement of the Minister for Transport ( Mr ""Ward) that his speech had been misconstrued and misunderstood and that he had not intended to convey the sentiments that had been attributed to him by his critics. What the Prime Minister has said leaves the matter in a very unsatisfactory state. The right honourable gentleman said yesterday that he regarded the letter of the Minister for Transportas having removed any grounds there might have been for any assumption that the Minister for Transport and External Territories either reflected or intended to reflect upon the Government of either Great Britain or any Dther Allied country. Before dealing with the evidence that is available in the records of this House as to the continued intention and purpose of the Minister, I shall refer briefly to the very foundation of democratic government. The maintenance of constitutional, democratic government in this country depends largely upon the observance of the functions wfliich tradition has handed down to us. The Cabinet is obviously the core of the system, and the doctrine of collective Cabinet responsibility must ensure the continuance of stability and unity in government. In 1864, Lord Palraerston statedA member of the Government, when he takes office, necessarily divests himself of that perfect freedom of action that belongs to a ment. The reason is that whatever a member of the Government does and says upon public matters must to a certain degree commit his colleagues. The very basis of democratic and constitutional government in this country is the collective acceptance of ministerial responsibility and discharge of duty. The speech of the Minister for Transport was made in the course of a most important debate in this Housea debate that ensued upon a statement dealing with international affairs which had been made by the Prime Minister. The right ing read the speech of the Ministerwhich, unfortunately, he did not hear honourable gentleman himself hear it. Minister now seeks to evade his Cabinet responsibility by stating that the letter which he received from the Minister for Transport, dated the 15th February, 1944, removed any grounds there might have been for the assumption that the Minister had reflected or had intended to reflect upon the Government of Great Britain or the Government of any Allied country. I intend to show that the letter cannot in any way he read",17,Motion Of Want Of Confidence Sbcond Frontinwebte Rn Europe Statementbtmb E J Ward M P Means What He Says I Cannot Of Course

36,Mr Fadden,"Unfortunately, Ias a repudiation or denial of the very mischievous statements that are contained in the Minister's speech of Thursday last. On the contrary, I regard it as the culmination of a series of speeches seriously maligning the British Government which the Minister has made in this House on many occasions over a period of years. One portion of the speech which has given rise to the present proceedings is as follows:But there has been a widely shared opinion, not only in Australia but also in other countries, that certain of the United Nations tend to try to withhold their strength and retain it, and build it up while allowing the Soviet to bleed itself white, so that when the conflict terminates they will be the strongest military powers in Europe, and therefore wield the greatest influence at the Peace Conference. The Minister has said in his letter, and the Prime Minister believes him, that it was not his intention to reflect adversely in any way Avhatever upon either Great Britain or any Allied country. I submit, however, that the Minister's statement has to be taken, not as an isolated instance, but as a continuation of intention and purpose which have been definitely demonstrated by h i m over a period of years. I go as f a r back as the 21st August, 1941, a few months before we came into conflict w it h Japan and before the honourable member for East Sydney became a Minister of the Crown. In a debate on international affairs, initiated by a statement by the then Prime Minister, the honourable gentleman in reply to an interjection by the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Rankin), made the following statement:Tlie interjection proves what I am endeavouring to make plain to the country, namely, that many people who now advocate the granting of aid to Russia wish, in their hearts, that the Soviet will fall before the German hordes. Their fervent hope is that Russia and Germany will become so exhausted that the British, by conserving their strength, will be able to impose their will upon those nations. That is almost exactly the sentiment which the honourable gentleman expressed last Thursday night. to believe that it was not his intention or his purpose to reflect adversely upon the Government Allied country. Any one who believes that is, to say the least, and simple. Mr Fadden. May, 1939, before war had begun, the honourable gentleman, in the course of a debate on international affairs, made the following declaration:I am not prepared to agree that the British Government has been generous in its attitudeto the solution of European problems of recent times. During the same speech the honourable gentleman saidI t is true that that country meaning GreatB r it a in is now taking a more definite stand against the totalitarian States, but the reaction is that those States, not satisfied with their conquests to date, are making demands in other quarters in which British imperialists have interests. Only when their interests are endangered will the imperialists of the nation resort to war. They are notactuated by any desire to preserve existing democratic institutions; if they were, they would find ample scope for their activities inside their own country. He went on to sayThere are people occupying high positions in this country and abroad who, ever since the outbreak of war, have endeavoured to switch the war in order to make it a war not against Nazi Germany aud Italy but against the Soviet. Evidently there are many men in this Parliament as well as in Britain who want to defeat Hitler, not because of his policy but because Germany is a. strong rival of Britain in the commercial world. Statements of 'that character, made on several occasions over the years, coincide with the statement that was made by tihe honourable gentleman last Thursday; yet we are asked to display such simplicity as to believe that it was not his intention or his purpose to reflect upon the integrity of GreatB r it a in and our Allies. The appalling feature is that his leader, the Prime Minister, believes h i m, and seeks to make this Parliament, and through this Parliament the nation, and through the nation our Allies, believe that such scurrilous statements were not intended to reflect adversely upon GreatB rita in or any Allied country. The Minister cannot plead ignorance as an excuse for having made these statements, because the attitude of the Prime Minister and, I Yet we are asked take it , of those who are behind the Prime Minister, was demonstrated in no uncertain manner when the right honorof Great Britain or any able gentleman said last Wednesday in this Housecomplacent At the Conference at Teheran, complete In this House on the' 9th understanding was reached between President Koosevelt, Marshal Stalin, and Mr Churchill, on measures for the prosecution of the war -against Germany, and for co-operation in the peace tliat will follow. The scope and timing of operations which are to be undertaken in Europe from the east, west and south were agreed upon, and plans were co-ordinated and preparations made for the final defeat of Germany. demonstrated the complete unity of purpose and close understanding of the United Nations, and the re-affirmation of their inflexible determination to wage the war until the final defeat of the Axis powers has destroyed whatever hopes the enemy had of securing a compromise peace. Then, in the same debate, a responsible Minister of the Crown says that there is an opinion, not only in Australia, but also throughout the world, that some of the United Nations-Britain and the United States of America in particularare letting Russia down; that they are reserving their strength as a part of a plan to bleed Russia white. It is evident that the Minister for Transport must have been aware of the statement made by his leader, and therefore, in saying what he did, he has shown himself to be out of harmony with the Prime Minister and with the Government. On the 3rd November last, the Minister for External Affairs (Dr. Evatt) issued the following statement for publication:By its published results alone, the Moscow Conference is revealed as one of the outstanding political events of the war. Apart from what has been made known, which is in itself a sufficient indication of the single-minded purpose of the three Powers concerned,, the public can take it that the discussions of the three Foreign Ministers were extended with great frankness and intimacy to other matters, both military and political, vital for or tending to accelerate the successful conclusion of the war against Germany and its satellites. Thef u l l results of the conference w ill appear gradually, but already it is clear that a completely decisive blow has been given to attempts by Axis propagandists and others to provoke political disunity between the Soviet Union, Britain and the United States. I leave it to the Government to decide in what category the Minister for Transport should he placed-amon g the Axis propagandists or among the "" others"". The quoted are not mine, but those of the Minister for External Affairs, a man who holds a senior and important position in the Government. They must have been known to the Minister for Transport and should have removed any belief he might have had there was a widely-held opinion in Australia that the United States of America and Great Britain were withholding their strength in order that Russia might be bled white. Yet the MinThese epoch-making conferences ister says that he did not. intend to reflect adversely upon the British Government or upon any allied government. If that is true, I should like to know the meaning of the words "" reflect adversely"". It was his duty to back up the statements of the Prime Minister and the Minister for External Affairs in order to remove any doubt that might exist in this country regarding the motives of our Allies, a doubt that might lead to disunity The speech made by the Minister for Transport last week was merely the culmination of a series of similar statements that have been for too long tolerated by the Government and by this Parliament. The Minister for Transport, in his letter to the Prime Minister, stated as an excuse-certainl y not as a denial or a withdrawalSo far from wishing to reflect adversely on the United Kingdom and our other Allies in this war, I have only the warmest admiration for the tremendous sacrifices being made by these peoples and the heroism of their fighting services in the common struggle to defeat the Axis powers. I ask honourable members how such sentiments can be reconciled with this statement from the speech of the same MinisterIsi t not a fact that cocktail parties were continued even when the enemy was getting dangerously close to Singapore? I have heard it said that the military caste in that theatre of war spent the bulk of their time at such parties, and were in a semi-drunken state, when they should have been attending to their military duties. To-day, unfortunately, as the result of that outlook some of the best of our man-power are now languishing in prisoner of war camps. A r e those the persons whose h e r o is m he now professes to admire? He r e is a f u r ther e x t r a c t from h is speechI point out to the honourable member for Balaclava that one of our great disadvantages words which I have just in the present conflict has been the fact that the native peoples over whom we had control -and I now refer to Great Britain-were not so enthusiastically pro-British as one would imagine after experiencing many years of the alleged benefits of British colonial administration.",18,Motion Of Want Of Confidence Sbcond Frontinwebte Rn Europe Statementbtmb E J Ward M P Means What He Says I Cannot Of Course
37,Mr White,"Wher e did that happen?doubt also exists as to the loyalty of great numbers of Indians to the British cause. In Malaya troops had to be withdrawn from the firing line i u order to discharge cargo from ships because native labourers at Singapore deserted. In spite of the "" hifalutin "" talk of houorable members opposite, the natives saw no reason to be enthusiastic in defending a form of government which had kept them in a state of illiteracy and semi-starvation. ' The Minister's reference to the employment of soldiers on the wharfs in Singapore comes well from a member of a government which employed on the wharfs in this country Australian soldiers who had only just returned from the Middle East. In spite of his statements the ' Minister now. asks us to believe-and he has apparently convinced his leaderthat he did not intend to reflect on the integrity of British administration. Surely the words he used can have only one meaning, and it cannot be said in his defence that this was merely an isolated statement made, perhaps, on the spur of the moment. It was merely one of many similar statements made with the deliberate purpose of maligning British administration, and calculated to produce disunity among the Allied Nations at a time when unity is so vitally necessary. There is no need for me to say anything more in order to convince reasonable, loyal Britishers of what ought to be done. Unfortunately, the Opposition has not the numbers in this House to enforce its wish, but as an Opposition we have a duty to perform, and that duty will be discharged with courage and determination. If we are unable to convince honourable members opposite, we are consoled in the belief that there is a tremendous body of opinion among the proBritish and true-thinking people of Australia which will not for long tolerate the inclusion in the Government of a man who holds the opinions expressed by the Minister for Transport in his speech last week. The duty of the Prime Minister is clear. associate can be carried too far. Loyalty in a household is a great thing, but loyalty to the nation is greater. This country is overwhelmingly British and is an integral part of the British Empire. We must do all in our power to maintain our British character, for we have every reason to be proud of the Mr Fadden. Union Jack and grateful for the protection we have enjoyed under it.

Attorney-General, who was reading a paper upon the agreement, misunderstood or, as I think more likely, affected to misunderstand the point I raised. He gave to the House an erudite statement on the right of the Executive to make agreements under Royal Prerogative. A t no time have I challenged that right, but in a deliberative and democratic assembly such as this is we must watch very carefully the making of pacts, agreements, and treaties with other -As objection is being taken to my countries under the reserve powers of tbe Royal Prerogative. The AustralianNew Zealand Agreement 1944 was made on the 21st January. Parliament had already been summoned on the 19th January to meet on the 9th February. Honourable members had been given preliminary notice at the end of December that Parliament would meet on that day. Accordingly, at the time when this agreement between New Zealand and this country was being discussed-befor e indeed it had been signed-the Parliament had already been convened. There was no suggestion whatever of any urgency or any need for secrecy about this agreement, yet, despite the fact that Parliament had been summoned, the agreement was made by the exercise of the Royal Prerogative a few days before the Parliament assembled. I submit that the subject was not appropriately dealt with by the reading of a statement by the Attorney-General after the agreement , was made. Such a practice is not in conformity with the dignity of a democratic Parliament. ""We should have been given the opportunity to discuss the agreement. While the Attorney-General was making his statement, the honourable member for Richmond( Mr Anthony) interjected"" That means that you are placing before the House a document that it is quite impotent to alter "".

Section 50, which also is important in this discussion, readsEach House of the Parliament may make rules and orders with respect to(i) The mode in which its powers, privileges, and immunities may be exercised and upheld; (ii) The order and conduct of its business and proceedings either separately or cede that pacts may be made with other jointly with the other House. Those sections provide that each House of the Parliament may make rules and orders. tion of each House. done, but I am entitled to move in respect of the matter. The Attorney-General likes to be regarded as the defender, in theory at all events, of liberty and free speech, but, unfortunately, in this matter the right honourable gentleman has not defended the rights of this Parliament, and it may happen that pacts, agreements and treaties may be made by the right honourable gentleman and his colleagues which will affect the lives of the people of this country, and bind even future generations without members of the Parliament having any say whatever in the matter. The subject, therefore, is one that calls for the serious consideration of every honourable member. The British Labour party has always adopted the attitude that pacts, agreements and treaties shall come before the Parliament. I assert that the Royal Prerogative should not be exercised unless there is the need for either urgency or secrecy. Apart from these considerations all such agreements should, in the view of the British Labour party,' come before Parliament before they become operative. The following significant passage occurs in a publication entitled Cabinet Government, by W. Ivor Jennings, M.A., LL.D.:In 1.924 the Labour Government announced that it would submit all treaties to Parliament and lay them on the table for twenty-one days before proceeding to ratification. The succeeding Government refused to follow this practice. It was restored by the Labour Government in 1929, but has presumably not been followed by its successors.' . . . In this country, in which the rights and powers of this Parliament depend upon the Constitution, section 49 of which enables new privileges to be created, it is proper that we should maintain the closest scrutiny of any exercise of the prerogative, any act of the Executive which may bind this country firmly to another country. I concountries by means of the exercise of the prerogative. I also concede that agreements have been made with other countries that have not been placed before the Parliament for ratification. But I do not know of any occasion upon which an arrangement has been made between one part and another of the British Empire, which has not first been placed before the Parliament for ratification. Those who have been in this House for many years will share my remembrance of the very important Imperial Conference of 1923. Before Mr Bruce left Australia to attend that conference, a discussion of various principles took place in this House, in order that he might be assisted in his deliberations overseas; and he did not bind this country upon the vital matters that were there considered, until they had first been submitted to this Parliament for ratification. The Statute of Westminster, which recognizes the freedom of each part of the British Commonwealth of Nations under the Crown, also came before this Parliament for .adoption. The Ottawa Agreement, too, was translated into legislation. On the present occasion the Attorney-General, who obviously was the moving spirit, promoted an agreement between New Zealand and Australia, the terms of which, for the moment, I do not canvass; an agreement, however, whatever views one may take of its provision, is none the less a far-reaching and important document. affect the matter of privilege? the honourable member to understand that it is the right of a representative in this chamber to protect the people, to express his opinion of public acts, and at all times to exercise the important function of maintaining the closest scrutiny of the Executive Government;",23,Objection To Ruling Right To Raise Question Of Privilege

56,Mr Spender,"I should not expectthat is one of the privileges of membership of this House. With great respect to the Chair, I affirm that any member of this House is entitled to submit a motion dealing with privilege, although it may not be on a matter ""suddenly arising"". May's Parliamentary Practice, twelfth edition, at page 241, states the matter clearly in the following terms:The .proceedings of the house may be interrupted at any moment, save during the progress of a division, by a motion based on a matter of privilege, when a matter has recently arisen which directly concerns the privileges of the'house; and in that case the house will entertain the motion forthwith. If complaint of a breach of privilege be made whilst the house is in committee, the committee reports progress. A privilege matter may also be brought forward without notice, before the commencement of public business, and is considered immediately, on the assumption that the matter is brought forward without delay, and that its immediate consideration disregard of the opinions of this Paris essential to the dignity of the House. I direct attention to the fact that as far back as the early days of parliamentary history, in the reign of Edward III . , the Parliament discussed without inhibition the limitation of the exercise of the prerogative. Farnborough, in the ninth edition of Parliamentary Practice, at page 289, deals w it h the question of privilege upon matters suddenly arising, and then adds the following:But in other cases, equally affecting the privileges of the House, but of less immediate urgency, the matter is ordinarily brought forthat this Parliament should express its ward without notice, at the commencement of public business. I submit with great respect that the Chair was in error in preventing me from raising this matter when I first sought to raise it. I have shown that the agreement between Australia and New Zealand was made while Parliament was in course of being reassembled. The Attorney General has met my contention that Parliament should have been first consulted with the proposition that the executive government has ample power to do what it did, and having now placed the document before us, has done all that the circumstances required. we are expected to he satisfied that all the principles of democracy have been observed. The procedure adopted is not that in which I believe. I consider that no pact of this description should be made Mr Spender. until it has first been placed before this Parliament for ratification. I am not, in this debate, opposing any portion of the agreement; that is entirely beside the point. In principle any matters, but. particularly those that may affect the relations of this dominion and any other portion of the British Empire, should be placed before this House before becoming binding upon this country. The Attorney-General has said that this is an exercise of the prerogative. The strange fact is that the agreement does not pretend to be an exercise of power by the Governor General in Council. This is an act of the Government, and so far as 1 know the prerogative cannot be exercised by the Government, but only by the Governor General in Council. Therefore, this agreement has been made under such conditions that it was not a proper exercise of the prerogative. Certain members of the Government, with complete' liament, proceeded to make the agreement. The High Commissioner for Australia in New Zealand, Mr Thomas D'Alton, is one of the signatories to the agreement. Apparently, his power is considered to be much greater than that of any member of this House. Tasmanian Parliament. view in respect of any pacts that are made in the future, whether between this country and another member of the British Commonwealth of Nations, or between this country and a foreign power, unless there is the need of urgency, or considerations of secrecy, before they are made to bind this country.

Accordingly, I move dissent from that ruling. eral and Minister for External Affairs) [4.19] -The question before the House Apparently, is a narrow one; not as to whether or not the Australian-New Zealand Agreement ought, as a matter of good practice, to have been brought before this House before it was finally ratified and given force and effect, but as to whether",24,Objection To Ruling Right To Raise Question Of Privilege

59,Dr. Evatt (Barton,"Attorney-GenMr Speaker was right or wrong in a ruling that he gave last week. The honourable member for Warringah ( Mr powers, privileges and immunities of the Spender) then raised .the point that, because this House had not been consulted by the executive government before the agreement was made binding. had not been consulted before the agreement came into full operation, therefore a question of privilege arose. Mr Speaker ruled against it on two separate grounds, the first being that it was not a matter of mentary Practice even a suggestion that privilege suddenly arising, and the second a matter of this kind has become the that it was not a matter of privilege at all. He said, "" In my opinion, it is not a matter of privilege"". I submit that it clearly is not a matter of privilege. The privileges of this House are well known to honourable members-betterr known to many of them of long experience than they are to a comparatively new member like myself. I venture to suggest that never before has a motion of this kind been moved in any Parliament of the British Dominions. To what does the honourable member for Warringah point in support of his contention? He says that some government in the United Kingdom once made it a practice to bring all agreements and treaties before the House of Commons before ratification. Under that practice they had to lie on the table of the House for 21 days. That was the MacDonald Government. But the honourable member went on quite frankly to say that the next previously existed. government did not follow that practice, presumably because it did not think it was necessary. The honourable member did not suggest that any one at any time rose in the House of Commons and claimed that the succeeding government, in reversing the practice, was violating a privilege of the House. I assert that the honourable member's argument is preposterous. He is seeking to say, on a point of 'privilege, what he could very well say when the agreement itself comes before the House for discussion,.namely, that the agreement should not have come into effect until Parliament was consulted. I will say nothing further on that point, because I have already made my position clear in regard to it. The hon[10] orable member referred to the Constitution, section 49 of which states that the House of Representatives, except where specifically declared, shall be those of the Commons House of Parliament of the United Kingdom. I point out that no privilege in respect of this matter has ever been declared. motion, the purposes of which would have been to declare the privilege. will not find anywhere in May's Parliasubject to privilege, and, according to May, new Commons privileges cannot be created. The honourable member for Warringah was a member of a government which performed many important executive acts without consulting Parliament. For instance, it declared a state of war without consulting Parliament. Its action could have been objected to on the ground that Parliament ought first to have been consulted, but no one would have contended that a question of privilege was involved. I submit that no question of privilege is involved in the present instance, and the honourable member has been unable to point to a single authority to support his argument. orable member sought to move that tbe House declare a privilege, shows that he recognized that no such privilege that the ruling of Mr Speaker was absolutely correct, and that there is no ground now to canvass it. I am unable to claim that his ruling is covered by May, because never before in the history of the Mother of Parliaments has it-been suggested that privilege was involved in a matter of this kind. the Opposition) [4.25] I support the motion, and, with respect, I suggest that the Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt) has not answered to the point of the motion.

Standing Orders have two references, so far as I can discover, to matters leges and immunities of Parliament are of privilege. I do not need to tell you, ""such as Parliament declares them to be. sir, because you are more familiar with Parliament may, by appropriate means, the Standing Orders than most of us, declare its privileges.

72,Mr Menzies,"The powers, privithat I have, or any other honourable member has, as an individual. It is of no moment that any one as an individual should secure special rights because he is a member of Parliament. On the contrary, as members of Parliament, we become the recipients of great obligations. But they privileges of Parliament are the privileges of the Constitution and are vital to self-government. That is why Parliament has always claimed privilege. That is why Parliament has always claimed the immunity of a member of Parliament from arrest while in the Parliament. That is historic. It would not be safe to rely on that immunity after leaving the House, but it is a long-standing privilege, and is designed to enable the work of Parliament to go forward without unseemly interruption. It was recognized that in proper deliberation lay wisdom. The Prime Minister will realize that ""proper deliberation "" is the expression that I used. member for Warringah raised the matter I said it with a slight retrospective tone as soon as the House met. That was in my voice. The privileges which belong to Parliament are, therefore, of great importance to the people. I do not profess to say at this moment-I do not think I am concerned to say-whethe r it is proper that this Parliament should regard as a breach of privilege the failure of the Executive to bring a truly executive treaty before Parliament. That is not the question at the moment, although it is one upon which one may say a great deal. But to say that the honourable member had no right to raise that matter as a matter of privilege and to secure the adjudication of Parliament upon it seems to me to cut across the whole foundation of parliamentary privilege. So, I submit, with the greatest goodwill to you, Mr Speaker, that the ruling given by you in this matter was wrong, and, because of the circumstances now existing, I must very strongly make the submission to honourable members that your ruling should be disagreed with. BecauseI am exceedingly jealous of the privileges of this Parliament, I find myself in some difficulty in regard to the motion submitted by the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender), for, when it is voted upon, it will not really touch the main issue at stake. It will be a decision practically that oranges are not apples, and that is not really what we are anxious to settle. The privileges of Parliament are twofold. First, there are the privileges of the Houses of Parliament collectively, and, secondly, there are the privileges of individual members. It seems to me, Mr Speaker, that in this debate both privileges are at stake and cannot be dealt with simply by moving dissent from your ruling. I hope that before the vote is taken you will expound the law and practice in regard to this matter so that we shall see exactly where we stand. There are two issues. The first is the question of privilege itself. If it is necessary that questions of privilege be raised immediately something affecting privilege has happened, what shall we do when Parliament is in recess, as it was on this occasion? The honourable his first opportunity to do so. If a thing happens on Friday afternoon, it will be raised on the following Wednesday. That is the earliest opportunity to raise it. If we are to be bound by the time factor in matters of privilege, it seems to me that we may very easily lose our privileges which have been jealously guarded for many years. It is the prerogative and custom of Parliament to deal with matters of privilege at any time, whether a minute, an hour, or three months after the supposed breach. Consequently, it seems to me that that is the matter that should be settled. I should like an indication from you as to how we can raise such matters if the ruling given iby you is to stand. in all cases. How do we raise questions of this nature, and at what time ? We must have a substantive motion. We should have a clear direction in regard to the whole matter. The second issue is the question of privilege itself; that is, what are the rights of this Parliament in the ratification of treaties with other countries? It seems to me that we should be failing in our duty if, at this particular time, just when we are on the point of almost being forced into a spate of treaties with other countries on the termination",27,Objection To Ruling Right To Raise Question Of Privilege

I submit to the Government, for this is a matter for it rather than for you, Mr Speaker, that it is indeed a bad practice that an agreement should be made by the Commonwealth Government with another government, especially one inside the Empire, without Parliament being called together to discuss that agreement before ratification takes place.

It seems to me, therefore, that a matter of privilege could be taken into account from the time the House became conscious of it, even if that should be months after a certain event occurred. In my view there is no merit whatever in the case submitted by the honourable member for Warringah, and, as I have said, I am surprised that he and his leader should have argued the matter as they have done. in replyI am not raising a technical matter of privilege, but one which I believe is of vital importance to the private members of this Parliament. I agree with the right honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page) that it would be a pity to divide the House on a matter touching the rights and privileges of members of this Parliament, not only now but in the future. It has been contended by honourable members opposite that no motion may be made in respect of a matter of privilege. I interjected while the honourable member for ""Watson( Mr Falstein) was speaking in order to point out that it had been done for centuries, and has been done even in this Parliament. I direct attention to an occasion in 1920, which will be remembered by some honourable gentlemen, when the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes), without referring to privilege, movedThat, in the opinion of this House, the honand to provide for distribution of coal, in the orable member for Kalgoorlie . . . having, by seditious and disloyal utterances at a public meeting on Sunday last, been guilty of conduct unfitting him to remain a member of this House, and inconsistent with the oath of allegiance which he has taken as a member of this House, be expelled this House. That was clearly a matter of privilege and it was dealt with as such. I consider that my only method of procedure, when I wished to raise this matter, was to conclude with a motion. This may relate to a matter in which a new privilege is sought to be asserted, as well as when an established privilege needs emphasis. I was not given the opportunity to put my case. I do not wish to press this matter to adivision. We have had the opportunity to express our views and I am sure that the Prime Minister will agree that it is a subject that should be given more consideration. It is proper, in this or any other matter, that a member who seeks to declare a new privilege should be heard until he concludes with his motion. It is then for the House to determine whether or not the new privilege shall be declared. That is a right which private members must steadfastly uphold. The issue is a simple one. I have raised a matter of privilege. It is none the less a matter of privilege because I have sought to move this House to the declaration of a new privilege. My second point is that it is wrong to reject a motion of privilege on the narrow ground that the matter has not suddenly arisen. Thirdly, whether or not the matter is one of privilege can be determined only when the honourable member raising it has stated his argument and has concluded with a substantive motion. My contention is that this House should be the custodian of matters relating to foreign affairs, and that no agreement should come into force until this House has had the opportunity of either ratifying or rejecting it, unless it contains the element of secrecy or urgency.

106,Motion (By Dr. Evatt) Agreed To,"Debate resumed from the 10th February (vide page 125), on motion by Mr been done by both Great Britain and the That the following paper be printed:"" Review of the War-Ministeria l Statement, 9th February, 1944"". The speech which the Prime Minister( Mr Curtin) made in a review of the war last week is, I take it, one of those which will indicate exactly the arguments the "" right honourable gentleman will advance when he goes abroad. I wish him a successful visit to Great Britain and the United States of America later in the year, and hope that he will be able to assist substantially Empire co-operation and world collaboration. The conference he will attend will be of very great importance. It will have to deal, first, with the further .prosecution of the war, and then with preparations for peace. In connection with war operations, it will approximate in importance the conference that was held in 1917, the effects of which continued for many years after the termination of the last war. Despite the unfortunate proceedings ""in connection with the Australian-New Zealand Agreement, I trust that the right honourable gentleman will bring back to this Parliament, for discussion and ratification, whatever conclusions may be' arrived at. I hope that his eloquence will convince the people of Great Britain that Australia is 100 per cent, behind them in the gallant fight which they have waged for many years, and that, with the support of colleagues from the other portions of the Empire, he will succeed in making it clear to the whole world that the British Empire intends to be a solid core in the post-war deliberations for the settlement of all negotiations. I assume that when he leaves Australia he will no longer be merely the leader of a party or a government, but will be the ambassador of this country. On that account, it is imperative that, before his departure, there should be a clean-up of as many as possible of the controversial issues that exist, iri'order that he may be able to leave Great Britain delivered 111. Within with the unstinted support of the whole of the people of Australia, and thus be fortified in his mission on behalf of the Empire and the world. Therefore, I think it would he a very good thing if we were to place on record exactly what has United States of America to help Russia, so that no doubt shall remain in the minds of people anywhere in the world regarding our appreciation of what has been done. I propose to catalogue the help which has been given, in the expectation that this will dispose of any suggestion by the Minister for Transport that Britain and America have been half-hearted in their support of Russia. In 1941-42, the first year in which Russia was engaged in the war,'Great Britain sent 8,000,000 tons of war material to Russia by the northern sea route. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) referred this afternoon to the great heroism of the men who manned the ships in the Arctic Sea. Theirs was an epic contribution to the war effort. In addition to What was sent by the' northern route, great quantities of war material were sent to Russia through the Persian Gulf, and the British people established special factories for the production of goods to aid Russia. Even from Australia locomotives were sent through Persia into Russia. A t the most critical period of the Pacific campaign, when the fate of Singapore was in the balance, Great Britain never stinted the Russian front. As I have said, in the first year, Great Britain sent 8,000,000 tons of war material, and it was shown afterwards that the Russian railways were unable to handle it all. Great Britain sent to Russia in 1941-42 no fewer than 4,700 aeroplanes, including spare engines and all spare parts. Supplies also included 6,000 tanks, besides a great number of motor vehicles. Altogether, Britain sent enough equipment to arm and equip 32 divisions. By the end of November, 1943, goods to the value of £129,000,000 had been sent to Russia, including £3,000,000 worth of clothing fGr the population of territories freed from Nazi control. In May, 1941, for every 100 aircraft promised to Russia, one week of the invasion of Russia by the Germans, 500,000 pairs of boots were despatched by Britain, and by April of next year 3,000,000 pairs of boots had",32,Widows Pensions Bill 1944
107,Sir Earle Page (Cowper) [5.7],"been sent to Russia. In a period of four days Great Britain despatched enough great-coat clotih to stretch from the ""White Sea in the north to the Black Sea in. the south. Russia also received from Great Britain 3,000 tons of medical supplies and 50,000 tons of rubber, and the rubber was sent after the fall of Singapore, at a time when Britain itself was in urgent need of every pound of rubber it could get. In addition, 831,000 tons of metal and machine tools was sent, and 41,000 tons of aviation spirit, every gallon of which had to be brought to Britain from overseas. Other items were 1,000.000 tons of sugar, and 2,500,000 tons of wheat and flour. Both before and after the entry of the United States of America into the war, that country was affording active assistance to Russia, the goods being carried in British ships. Up to October, 1943, the United States of America sent under lend-lease to Russia goods to the value of $3,550,000,000. These goods included9,000 planes. 3,500 tanks. 195,000 motor vehicles (or three times as many as Australia imported normally in peace-time each year). 1,800,000 tons food, made up of' 343,000 tons wheat and flour. 277,000 tons sugar. 324,000 tons canned fruit. 441,000 tons edible fatB and oils. 130,000 tons dried fruit and vegetables. 38,000 tons dried eggs. 33,000 tons butter (which the United States of America had not exported for years). 5,500.000 pairs of army boots. 1(1,000,000 yards woollen cloth. 251,000 tons of chemicals. 144,000 tons of explosives. 1,200,000 tons of steel. 342,000 tons non-ferrous metals. 011,000 tons petroleum products. That is the way in which Britain and the United States of America were bleeding Russia white! It is imperative that these facts be placed on record, as also the appreciation of this Parliament and the nation of what Great Britain spared for Russia from its own defence at a most critical period of the war so that the Russian line might be held. I trust that the Prime Minister will clear up this matter with members of his own party before 'he leaves Australia, and that he will also clear up other matters at issue. He will need the undivided support of the country which he is to represent in Great Britaina fact which I learned from my own experience. In his speech the other day the Prime Minister spoke in optimistic terms regarding the end of the war. I hope that he is right, but I believe that there is still a long road ahead of us, and that endurance is the quality necessary to enable us to win. The enemy, both in Europe and in Asia, will make desperate efforts to achieve a victory or, if not victory, at least stalemate, before he succumbs. It must be remembered that Germany holds more than half of Europe, and that the German leaders have no hesitation in calling upon the populations of conquered countries for slave labour to support the German war effort. In the East, Japan holds 1,500,000 square miles of fertile and productive territory, and with such resources it is clear that the task of defeating Japan is a tremendous one. The Prime Minister said that the status of Australia at the peace conference would depend upon the number of men we have under arms. I go farther, and say that our status will depend upon the magnitude of our total war effort, not only in relation to men in the armed forces, but also in relation to our production of munitions and food. To-day, warfare is a struggle, not between armies and fleets only, but between nations themselves, a struggle in Which every material resource and every moral quality must 'he actively employed. In such a struggle no speck of rottenness, nor any fault in the national organization, will be without its effect upon the final outcome. We should examine our whole national, economic, political and military structure in order to ensure that we are, in fact, doing our best. We must examine carefully our military situation. That is important in the long-run ensuring victory, and important in the short-run so that we may save many thousands of lives, and preserve the health of our people. Because of that I intend to make an analysis of our war organization and its effect on strategy, on the distribution of manpower, and on our total war effort. On the 3rd or 4th JanuaryI sent a telegram to the Prime Minister stating that I was greatly concerned about tbe whole matter, and suggesting that it would be advisable to call Parliament together at an early date in order to enable a discussion in secret. The Prime Minister has said that in his opinion that is not advisbeyond our assistance during the war, we able,. I bow to his view, but if I say anything in public that I should have preferred to say in secret the responsibility is his, not mine. The first thing we have to realize is that the number of armed men that Australia can put into the fight is definitely limited. The forces we are able to put into the field, if all our adult male population without reserve were in uniform, would be relatively insignificant in numbers alongside the millions of British, American, Russian and Chinese soldiers. The men whom we have put into the field have done magnificently. They have earned in this war the great reputation that their fathers earned in the last war. On the munitions side also our effort has been magnificent. ing from behind scratch, our munitions industry gained such momentum that we are now able to slacken our effort in certain directions. in this respect is one of the most wonderful in the world. that the Minister for ""War in the United States of America said that Australia ranked sixth as a producer of armaments, but, compared with the totaloutput of the world, our contribution of munitions is relatively insignificant. The products of the land, those things which go to feed and clothe people, are even more important than many munitions in war-time. Our production bulks very large indeed in the total production of the United Nations. It is necessary that we should be carrying on the production of food at 100 per cent, strength, but, unfortunately, we are slipping, and, when the war is over, the thing which will matter will not be the number of armed men or the stores of munitions, but what food we shall have to feed ourselves and the starving people of Europe, and clothes to clothe ourselves and the people in those European countries which suffer dreadful winters. If we find that because we have diminished our food effort during the war, the first result of peace is that wft must ration victorious nations Sir Earle Page. more than they had to be rationed in war-time, we shall have great difficulty in persuading those nations that they have won the war, because, having to feed the starving nations which have been shall get less and less for ourselves. It is, therefore, important that we should keep our food-producing industries 100 per cent, efficient. They must progress, not decline, whatever comes or goes. There are non-essential industries from which labour must be obtained if men cannot be spared from the Army or munitions. Failure to feed the starving millions of the world after the last war sowed the seeds of this war. That is what built up the idea of autarchy, that self-sufficiency that made Europeans produce what they needed at enormous cost, and thereby destroyed international trade. We most certainly shall sow the seeds of the next war if we fail in our duty to feed the Startstarving after this war. All the efforts that we are making to prevent another war and to live in peace will go by the board. We saw when we suffered the Our achievement terrible experience of being within an ace of invasion that the real security of I think Australia rested, not in world collaboration and treaties, but in our having millions of people in this country. When we have them we must be able to feed them, but what we produce at present would not feed them, and we cannot expand our production unless we keep the framework substantial. We must see the whole man-power picture in proper focus. We are asking our rural workers to produce more than before, yet their numbers show a decline of 160,000 from the pre-war total. The number engaged in transport is down by over 40,000. The numbers engaged in trade and commerce are down 100,000; those in mining are down 14,000; and those in other services, including the professions, are down 33,000. Building and construction are employing roughly the same number of men, if the Allied Works Council is included in the present-day figures. The armed forces are up 700,000; the administrative departments are up 20,000, and all factories are up 100,000. Before the war there were 456,000 males employed in all factories, and of those 11,000 were in munitions factories. To-day, the total number is 550,000, of whom approximately 400,000 are in munitions factories. To maintain and increase our food production, we must replace the loss of ' 160,000 men mechanical power. Many of the men engaged in munitions are needed to swing into the production of mechanical aids for agriculture. Existing machinery has worn out, and much new machinery is needed. there must be many thousands of skilled land men returned to the land. Obviously, the Army and munitions are the two services-the great pool of supplyfrom which they must be obtained. At the beginning of the war, the most useful countrymen and those most needed went into the Australian Imperial Force in great numbers. There was the call of patriotism, the call of adventure, the opportunity of going overseas, a liking for camp life, and the memory of their fathers' previous war service. The important thing to remember about them is that they enlisted as individuals, and went away as individuals, and must come back as individuals. They cannot come back as a drove. They will come back, if released, as 20,000 individuals who are badly needed on the land, and who can be employed and housed on farms. In my own electorate I have investigated this matter. I have discussed the whole problem with the chief dairy inspector on the north coast, whose territory runs from the Tweed Eiver to the Hunter River. He said that there are 500 named individuals who must return to the dairying industry in that area. Otherwise the industry will collapse. I know who they are, and where they are. The facts are on his files. Unless they come back the old folk of 60, 65 and 70 years of age, who have been striving to carry on, will collapse and die. Some have actually died at work because we have not allowed their sons to return to carry on work which was beyond their capacity in their old age. We must carry out the recommendations of the organizations that the Government has created to deal with this matter, namely, the District War Agricultural Committees and the DairyI n dustry Man-power Committees. In every farming district those organizations consist of most responsible men. All have boys overseas. Many have lost their sons over Germany, in the Middle East or in New Guinea, and all have a definite personal stake in the matter. Those men by either human, electric or have looked into this matter in such a way as to ensure that they would do a fair thing by the country. At Grafton, the District War Agricultural Committee examined 40 applications for releases of men from the Army. The committee Also, ruled out twenty applications, because the subjects of the applications were in categories, members of which will not be released by the Army. Of the remaining twenty, the committee decided that ten should be released and ten should not be released. So, out of 40 applications for release the committee decided to recommend the release of only ten. But does the Government let them out? No. "" He is a batman at Port Moresby, an active area and cannot be released"", was one answer; yet, generals fighting in New Guinea can be released to take up other than active service jobs. Therefore war needs cannot possibly be the reason why the recommendations of the District War Agricultural .Committees in these instances cannot be carried out. Parliament should insist that the organizations which the Government has established should he vested with full responsibility and executive power. The Australian armed forces consist of more than 700,000 men, and it cannot be claimed that more than 200,000 of them are indispensable. Of the 500,000 that are not indispensable, some should be . released, as individuals, to work in primary industries. The difficulty arises from the failure of the Army itself to carry out the Government's policy, and that, in turn, is due to the organization of the Army, which leads to chaos. I shall cite instances to prove my contentions. In March, 1943, the Prime Minister announced that Australian casualties in this war totalled 67,191 killed, wounded, missing and prisoners, of whom 10,253 were killed. Eleven months later he declared that the total number of casualties was 66,930, of whom 16,480 had been killed. That is to say, after another eleven months fighting there were fewer casualties in to to but more soldiers had been killed. That mistake could arise only from the system of Army administration. We experience it whenever we endeavour to secure the release of a man. The file of Private Ensbey, which begins on the 30th June, 1943, and terminates on the 20th January, 1944, is a typical example of Army During the period when we sought his release, his mother died from overwork on the farm, his sister entered hospital a nervous wreck, and his father became an inmate of a hospital because of high blood pressure. The farm used to produce 1 ton of butter a month. I first endeavoured to obtain his release, the Army claimed that he was a member of a particular training unit and that his discharge could not be contemplated. In the meantime, his neighbour from the next farm, who was a member of the same unit, had been released. When the mother died, I was able to secure for him a month's leave and I tried to obtain his discharge. I received letter after letter from the Minister for the Army stating that the man was too important to be released, but the man-power authorities notified me on the 20th January that his release from the Army had been gazetted three weeks previously. Another man was released on the 6th October, but on the 31st DecemberI received from the Army a letter saying that he could not be discharged. A fortnight later the Army notified me that he could be released. His wife and I were greatly surprised when we saw him in his civilian clothes on the day the Army had informed us that he could not be discharged. Like the spots of measles or scarlet fever, these are relatively minor visible symptoms of a deep-seated malady which is due to the faulty organization of the Army, the great pool of manpower. That faulty organization must be corrected because it is preventing the most advantageous use of our man-power. It disorganizes strategy and duplicates administrative there are two secretariats, one with a staff of 2,000 and the other with a staff of 1,000 persons. those secretariats would be sufficient to do the job. Faulty organization also interferes with the Army's relations Sir Earle Page. with other government departments. Honourable members have experienced the terrible confusion that occurs when they approach the Army with a request. They are referred from one department to another. Faulty organization also delays the demobilization of the garrison troops in Australia. Thousands of bungling. soldiers are stationed throughout the country, although the Prime Minister stated that the danger of invasion has passed, and we are unable to secure the release of some of these men to engage in urgent rural work. Finally, faulty organization impedes or paralyses efforts When essential to ultimate victory. Instead of being the servant, the Army has become the master of the nation. For the information of honourable members, I shall compare our Army organization with that of Great Britain. After Great Britain has been at war for four and a half years, fighting on many fronts, controlling armies in many theatres of war, supporting the greatest navy in the world, and despatching tremendous quantities of arms and equipment to allied nations, the control of man-power there is infinitely more effective than it is in Australia. The reason is that Great Britain has started from a different basis. The control of manpower is the direct responsibility of the War Cabinet, and is exercised through the Minister for Labour and National Service, Mr Ernest Bevin, who is the strongest representative of the Labour party in the British Government. He determines the number of men who shall serve in the Army, in the factories, and in primary industries. The antithesis to that system has been adopted in Australia, where the Army has first call on man-power, and men can only be released after months of strenuous "" digging "" on the part of honourable members. When I was in Great Britain a dispute arose in War Cabinet regarding what use should be made of the services of 11,000 rural workers. The Minister for the Army contended that they should be staffs. For example, drafted into the fighting forces, but the Minister for Labour and National Service replied, "" without food we shall lose One of the war"", and the men remained in primary production. In Australia, the Army has first call on man-power. Even Cabinet tries unsuccessfully to secure tbe release of certain men. I bave no doubt that the Minister for the Army himself has just as much difficulty in securing the release of men to work in the electorate of Capricornia as I have in obtainpromotion of every officer above the rank ing their discharge to work in the electorate of Cowper. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Fraser) has also encountered considerable difficulty in this the South-West Pacific, the Minister for matter. By its policy the Government k locking the stable door after the horse has been stolen. The British military organization carried England through that year when the country stood alone against the whole might of Germany and Italy. It has enabled the nation to carry on the world war for nearly five years on many fronts as the spearhead and directing force of the whole undertaking. This organization consists of the British ""War Cabinet, the Secretary for ""War, and the Army Council under the control and chairmanship of the Chief of the General Staff. The Army Council consists of the AdjutantGeneral, the Quartermaster-General, the Master-General of Ordnance, and they control the services. The Army Council controls the Commander in Chief of the Home Forces and the various Commanders-in-Chief of the overseas forces. Before the outbreak of war with Japan, our Australian system was similarly handled. The authorities were: The Commonwealth Government, the Minister for the Army, the 'Chief of the General Staff, who had his military board under him, the Adjutant-General, the Quartermaster-General, the MasterGeneral of Ordnance, the General Officer Commanding the Home Forces, the General Officer Commanding Australian Imperial Force overseas, and the various command|s-northern , eastern, southern and western. After Japan came into the war, the Commonwealth Government entirely altered that basis. The Government and the Minister for the Army handed all power to the General Officer Commanding, the Commander-in-Chief. This officer was given a task beyond the capacity of any one man adequately to discharge. He controlled the New Guinea forces, the first army and the second army, the Military Board, became principal staff officer to the General Officer Commanding, Comniander-in-Ohief, and all the various corps and forces came directly under his control. The General Officer Commanding became personally responsible for the of captain. At present, the Commanderin-Chief has to maintain relations with the Commander-in-Chief Allied Forces in Defence in Australia, and the Minister for the Army, and also control all matters from boot-laces for the Volunteer Defence Corps to bridgeheads in New Guinea. He maintains his own secretariat. In this maze much that is good -may be lost or never emerge from the administrative bottle-neck. We shall have to get back to a simpler form of organization such as is in operation in Great Britain, and such as we had in operation until three years ago. The present duplication of control is costly and a waste of manpower. It has caused tremendous delays in minor decisions. I call to mind the case of a man released from the Army; two days later the person who applied for the release received advice from the General Officer Commanding, Department of the Army, that the man could not be released. A great deal of the circumlocution and many of the conflicting decisions given by various sectional authorities could be eliminated with proper co-ordination, but when the General Officer Commanding is thousands of miles away on the active front, and decisions have to be made, it may be impossible to allow a senior officer to appeal and flagrant injustice may be done. In fact injustice seems to have been done in many cases. The effect of the present lack of coordination can be seen in the strategy of the New Guinea campaign. Changes in strategy have had a very big influence on the demand for extra reinforcements owing to the numbers of personnel killed or wounded or disabled by tropical diseases. Many of the difficulties would ibe overcome if the Australian control, under Wa.r Cabinet direction, followed the British precedent along the following lines:1. The Ministry of Defence, controlling policy and broad strategy as at present, thus ensuring proper co-operation of the three services in conjunction with the full use of the civil powers and resources of the nation. 2. The Department of the Army, consisting of the Minister, secretariat and Military Board, which should decide matters of policy, personnel, equipment, supplies, medical necessities-prophylacti c and therapeutic policy-and issue directions to(a) the Commander-in-Chief of the Army in the field of operations, or to the Commanders-in-Chief of Armies in various theatres of war; and to (b) the Commander-in-'Chief of the Aimy or Armies on the mainland of Australia, who should he responsible for the land defences of the Commonwealth, the organization and training of the troops, including the provision of trained and equipped reinforcements for the Army in the field of active operation, the is the highest single cause of death in the training and placement of reserve formations for purposes of local or fixed defences, the requirements from the Ministries of Supply and Shipping and Munitions, and, also, the clothing and other factories, and technical services operating directly under the Department of the Army. [Extension of time granted.] The place of the Commander-in-Chief pines, Netherlands East Indies, New is with the Army in the field. The Guinea, Burma, India, and East Africa Middle East campaign was conducted at are all malarious. The territories that roughly the same distance from Whitehave been occupied by the Japanese are hall .as the New Guinea campaign was highly malarious areas ringed on the from Melbourne. It was carried out south and east by allied territories which by the Commander-in-Chief with his are mostly non-malarious. If the Japanhead-quarters on the spot, to which was ese could be driven out of the islands of attached a Minister of State, who was Guam, Truk and Wake, they would be also a member of the War Cabinet. Our deprived of their few remaining non-political and strategic control should be malarial bases, the occupation of which in equally close contact with our fighting by the Allied troops would not expose troops. The farther the battle is from them to an additional malarial hazard. Australia, the more necessary this beAllied medical opinion has always been comes. This suggested organization for to make use of malaria and dysentery the control of the armies on the mainbecause it regarded these geographical land of Australia would ensure, or make and disease factors as our natural allies easy, the attainment of the ideal of one and most potent weapons which can be Sir Baric Page. army and would abolish duplication of staffs, ensure the raising of the standards of organization and training, and facilitate the inspection of services so as to reduce waste of material and improper diversion of personnel. The Minister for the Army has recently stated that 86 per cent, of our total forces are in the Australian Imperial Porce. He also said that the bulk of the Citizen Military Forces consisted of boys of eighteen and nineteen years of age. Soldiers of this age, whether in the Australian Imperial Force or the Citizen Military Forces, are not being sent on overseas service. If these lad.? are the only soldiers left in the Citizen Military Forces the amalgamation of the two army administrations on the mainland should be very easy to accomplish. To understand the strategy of the Pacific war, as it has always been seen by medical eyes, it is necessary to remember the geographical distribution of endemic malaria, which whole world and has caused the greatest number of disabilities to the Australian armies in this war. The line that separates non-malarious from malarious islands runs from Formosa east of the Philippines, just east of the Solomons and swings then to the west through -northern Australia across the Indian Ocean, Asia and right over to Africa. The islands farther west, including Guam, Truk, Wake, New 'Caledonia and F i j i , are all non-malarious. The Solomons, Philipused for the destruction of the enemy without unnecessarily exposing our own troops. Bombing, and especially night bombing, can be exploited to inflict malarial a 9 well as battle casualties on the enemy. Forces sent immediately to New Guinea Might bombing drives the enemy out of mosquito nets into slit trenches and exposes him to the added risk of malaria infection by the night-biting anopheles mosquitoes. This is particularly effective during the times of maximum seasonal incidence of malaria, which, as a rule, occurs at the end of the wet season. Similarly, the destruction, hy day or night mountains? Why was the defence force bombing of anti-malarial stores, drugs and mosquito-proofed huts would inevitably entail malarial casualties in hyperendemic areas such as those at present occupied by vast numbers of Japanese troops. That is what happened in East Africa during the last war. The interruption of the sea and air supply lines of the Japanese troops in these malarial islands, who are already debilitated and anaemic from chronic malaria, would cause a very heavy death-rate from blackwater fever, and this dreaded complication.of malignant tertian malaria would have all the factors that are favorable to its developofficer, Major-General Rowell, one of the ment. This policy is now, apparently, being adopted in the south Pacific campaign. With this background, let us consider Command. I ask the Prime Minister the Owen Stanley campaign, and the to give the Parliament a f u l l account of losses from disease and battle casualties the circumstances of Major-General consequent on the abandonment of this Rowell's recall. I ask him to state specistrategy. I was given to understand that fically what recommendations were made when the Japanese were driven back over regarding the Owen Stanley Range, the military whether he acceded to them; and, if not, tactics were to follow the medical sugwhy not? I ask him to give to us the gestion and cause the Japanese to rot to very weighty reasons which induced him pieces from malaria, dysentery and to send a man, who a few weeks prestarvation, by interference with their viously had been an acting lieutenantnaval and air supply lines. I understood general in command of our chief fightthat no military commander associated ing front and prior to that Vice-Ohief with the South-West Pacific command o.f Staff of the Citizen Military Force, believed that a major Japanese force to Cairo, to act as liaison officer, a posicould cross the range and attack suction which could have been filled by a cessfully Port Moresby, where all the much junior man. I ask him . to say advantages were with us. There were no what circumstances induced him to cause roads, the altitudes were high, the enemy us to lose this brilliant officer, who has could give his route little air cover, we now been taken over by the Allied High had defeated him navally at the Coral Command and placed by General Sea and Milne Bay, and months of work would be needed before he could make a road for heavy transport vehicles, even if it were at all possible. But, if that attack was believed feasible, why was not the Commander-in-Chief of the Land and kept there in charge of the momentous affairs that were in progress in July, 1942, and onwards? Why, if there was real danger of a major offensive across the range, was not more precaution taken? If the Government apprehended real danger, why had it not taken steps to block the passage across the OviTempleton area on the nether side of the in that region merely one inexperienced, isolated battalion of Militia? What was the fate of that gallant, isolated, ill equipped, insufficient force, when the Japanese began their passage of the mountains? We all remember what happened when the enemy did trickle over the ranges almost to the Moresby perimeter. Although it was no more than a trickle, the communiques were phrased as though the Imperial Guards had arrived at Parramatta. Then the Prime Minister sent Sir Thomas Blarney hotfoot to Moresby. The immediate result was that a distinguished Australian two whose staff work had chiefly helped the escape of the hulk of the Australian Imperial Force Who got away from Greece, was sent home from the Moresby Major-iGeneral RowellEisenhower in the highly important position of Director of Tactical Studies at the Head-quarters of the Western European Invasion Forces, in London, with the rank of major-general. I further ask him, and I ask the Minister for the Army, why, if it is possible to abstract Major-General Rowell, with the whole of the plans of the campaign in his brain and at his fingertips, from active service in the fighting line, it is desperate urgency, against a force which not possible to release a batman of one of the officers who happens to be in New Guinea, for essential farm service? To return to the Owen Stanley Range campaign: The enemy was only tenuously established at Buna-Gona as a major outpost. He had not shown any signs of building a large invasion base there. His force seemed to consist of approximately one Japanese divisionwhich is smaller than a normal European division-wit h ancillary troops. He had no heavy artillery, but he had a few 3.1 anti-aircraft guns turned into anti-tank weapons. He had not even troubled to build a wharf. He had not built any roads worth the name to the approach to the mountains. He had not shown any signs of laying down staged dumps along the route. What air-ifields had the enemy built at Buna-Gona in preparation for the supposed attack on Moresby? I understand that he had one or two crude strips. Were intermediary air-fields or other preparations found between Buna and Iroibawa, which pointed to a large-scale invasion? attempt on land to protect his flank towards Milne Bay, with the result that allied troops landed there without resisttralian battle casualties were more than ance by land forces. An ill equipped force was sent from Moresby across the mountains; it stumbled into a heavy ambush on the other side, in the Ovi region, and lost many gallant lives. Yet, these men were able to advance, lightly equipped as they were, to the edges of the Buna-Gona perimeter. The enemy was obviously beaten in the air, since he could Alamein and Buna. not prevent forces from being sent by land and sea to lay down air-fields right under his nose-air-fields that were large enough to land big transports incessantly without any major loss, and to establish dumps without much opposition. Sir Earle Page. enemy was blocked at sea, and blocked in from the air; we were told so repeatedly. Yet, it seems that in formations weary from the dreadful march over the mountains, ill-equipped, ill-prepared against malaria, which caused more than three times the number of casualties caused in battle, our men were driven on straight into battle. They were sent in as though the matter was one of could not get away and was bound to starve, or die of dysentery or malaria, in i few weeks; whose position, in fact, was so hopeless that it did not even attempt to escape, except in small parties. We had given our allies-malaria , dysentery and hunger-int o the enemy's hands, as his most potent weapon against us. The Japanese force, I repeat, was not a big one-abou t a division. Attacked with strong artillery, after long air bombardment, it must have been vanquished without heavy loss. Buti t seems that our men were thrown in before they were armed for the effort. They fought at first with very limited artillery support. I ask whether, having regard to the nature of the objective, such a method was necessary. The Parliament should see the military reports advising the course that was taken. Less than 10,000 Japanese dead were found, I am told. They were nearly all the Japanese'who had remained to fight. Yet in wiping out that single division, ill-armed by the standards of modern war, cut off from its supplies, dominated from the air, with no fighter The enemy had made no cover worth the name, and with only one or two air-strips which showed how minor had been its preparations, Austwice those sustained during the whole of the fighting on the El Alamein front from the time when the 9th Division was brought out of Palestine to help stem the retreat, until it was withdrawn from the battle line after General Montgomery's victory and brought home. I ask the House to compare the actions at El On the 25th November, 1941, the Minister for the Army announced that ""the Australian Imperial Force in the recent successful action against the Axis The forces in Egypt, suffered 2,419 casualties, of which 619 were either killed in action, or died of wounds, or are missing"". These casualties were later estimated at a total of about 2,700. [Further extension of time granted.] Let us remember that these losses were incurred in one of the most intense battles in the world war, in which the 9 th Division opened the operation over open, heavily mined country, against a well-equipped enemy with an abundance of tanks, artillery and mortars-a n enemy whose supply lines were open, and who was able to switch forces as the brunt of battle shifted; an enemy, in fact, at a vast advantage compared with the isolated Japanese division in New Guinea. But what of the New Guinea casualties? On the 11th April, 1943, the Minister for the Army saidI regret to say that the number of men killed in action and died of wounds and sickaerial and naval action. Even under ness to date as a result of the land campaign the strategy pursued, disease casualties in New Guinea is 2,110. A total of 3,833 have been wounded in action, and 209 are listed as missing. Tlie grand total of these casualty figures is 6,212. And these were not all, for the American losses were greater than the Australian. The joint losses of nearly 10,000, apart from all sickness which did not prove fatal, must have been about the heaviest in any successful operation anywhere in this war. Compare these with the casualties of the battle of Salerno, where the whole of an allied Fifth Army was engaged against several of the best of the German divisions well fitted out with armour and guns and entrenched in several rows of well-fortified mountain positions. According to The Times of London, of the 12th November last, the United States Secretary of State for ""War reported as follows:The United States Army casualties in Italy since the landings at Salerno on 9th Septemwar, disease is as great an enemy as are ber totalled 8,556 with 1,295 killed, 4,764 wounded and 2,497 missing. British losses in the same period were somewhat heavier. So, in point of fact, the losses of the Australian Imperial Force and the Americans at BunanGona, against a foe fighting with only light equipment and without efficient air-cover or communication lines, were heavier in known dead than were those of the whole of the Fifth Army in Italy, British and Americans combined, in two months of incessant action against an entrenched and thoroughly armed and battle-tested enemy, with all the advantages of terrain and weather an his side. This takes no account of the terrible toll of sickness, which reduced the 6th and 7th Divisions to infinitesimal proportions at Buna. I have recited the history of wounds. What of the story of the casualties from disease? From August, 1942, to February, 1943, inclusive, disease caused 25,000 cases of disability, compared with 6,212 battle casualties. Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m. casualties from malaria, dysentery and scrub typhus numbering over 15,000 could have been averted if the original strategy had been pursued, and Japanese supplies cut off by could have been greatly reduced, and I was glad to hear the Prime Minister announce the other night that the number of casualties under this heading had, in fact, been reduced in the recent campaigns. The fact is that methods of preventive treatment are well known and were, in the main, practised in the Middle East. Unfortunately, great difficulty was experienced in New Guineai n making soldiers, and even senior officers, understand the importance of antimalarial discipline. It may be recalled that in the South African War the number of casualties from enteric fever and similar diseases was very high amongst the troops. In the Great War, this difficulty was largely overcome because more heed was paid to the advice of the medical profession, and the troops were inoculated against disease. In this the Japanese. I suggest that the military leaders should pay greater attention to the advice of medical men, particularly regarding the kind of food supplied to men in the front line. Every soldier knows that as he approaches the front line rations tend to be cut to the bare essentials, because of the difficulty of transport, so that at the actual fighting front little is left but bully beef, biscuits and tea, and even all three of these commodities may not be available on the same day. There is a danger that the eyes will be picked out of the rations",33,Oubtin
108,Sir Eaele Page,"Many of thebit by bit on tbe 'way up to tbe front, until tbe fighting troops, who need the best rations, receive the worse. Malnutrition predisposes men to malarial infection, and to re-infection once they have contracted the disease. We must abo consider the effect which malaria may have upon the post-war development of Australia. It is mo3t important that as few soldiers as possible should be infected during active service, and we should also take care to prevent the spread of the disease to areas in Australia where soldiers, training for active service, are likely to be infected. Malaria infection is carried by certain species of mosquitoes. The actual varieties carrying the disease differ in different countries, but they all belong to the anopheles order. Some of them carry' the disease much more readily than others. In Australia, we are fortunate that the best mosquito carrier of malaria is found only in the far north, but there is another variety of anopheline mosquito found all down the east coast and in the irrigation areas inland. Up to the present, this mosquito has not shown itself, outside the laboratory, to be a very active carrier, but it might, in the midst of a malaria-saturated population, change its habits, as the rabbit and the prickly pear did in Australia, and become a very dangerous carrier. The whole of the better-watered parts of Australia, which are now the healthiest, might then become the most unhealthy, and become unsuitable for carrying a considerable population until after tremendously costly anti-mosquito and anti-malarial measures had been carried out. Therefore, I suggest that hospitals for the treatment of malarial patients should be situated on the elevated tablelands of Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria, which are not frequented by anopheline mosquitoes. Hospitals and training camps should not be situated in medically unsuitable areas merely to suit military convenience. In a matter of this kind medical considerations only should be allowed weight. The whole point of my argument is that the running of a modern army is not a one-man job. All the relevant factors should be given full consideration, and this applies particularly to medical requirements. Sir Marie Page. Many of the undertakings now being carried out by the Civil Constructional Corps are not comparable in importance with the work waiting to be done in rural areas, particularly in the production of protective foods such as meat, butter and eggs at present so badly needed by Britain. I have tried to get men released from the Army, but the authorities have informed me that the only condition upon which they will release men is that they get a body Amery. addressing the' Agricultural Council, emphasized the need to increase food production. I believe that the organization already in existence, if given full executive power, could effect a tremendous increase of production. There is room for improvement in the way of farm mechanization, and the development of electrical power so as to make full use of the resources at present at our disposal. Prime Minister( Mr Curtin) in his statement made a comprehensive review of the war activities of the nation, and that the people are appreciative of his efforts as their war-time leader was fully demonstrated at the last general election. I am grateful to the Prime Minister for the way in which he has discharged his responsibility, and for his successful direction of Australia's war effort"". Of necessity, his review was confined to generalizations, and his language was guarded. It was necessary to prevent the enemy from getting a preview of our plans, and of the plans of the United Nations. It was necessary, also because of the controversial nature of the proposed plans for the future prosecution of the war. I can appreciate, too that the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) has to be extremely careful in his approval of war policy. His party recently suffered a demoralizing defeat at the polls, and if he hopes to achieve any success in the future he should know that he must be careful in his criticism of the Government's war policy. I regard the Leader of the Opposition as a very capable man, one who should have the information at his disposal to enable him to offer constructive criticism of the Government's policy. Therefore, I cannot understand how a man with, a logical",42,Oubtin
109,"For A Body. Only Last Week, Mr Bankes",,43,Oubtin
110,Mr Bree1t (Calare) [8.12],"Th emind like his can envisage a new world order which includes a prosperous Germany and a prosperous Japan, particularly when we hear in mind his attitude towards the debated ""second front"", by which we understand an attack on the west coast of Europe. The Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, in dealing with this matter, warned of the tremendous risks and almost inevitable awful casualty lists that would be have already made sacrifices for the right entailed in the second front, and, reading between the lines, one would be forgiven if one inferred that both were sceptical of achieving worthwhile results, commensurate with the risks, in even a successful landing on the French coast. The Leader of the Opposition is a man who must be listened to because of his eloquence, logic and understanding of the position and because of the information that he has. Still, I cannot think that he is serious in advocating the second front if he believes that it will be fraught with terrible consequences if it fails. If he believes that the future of the world requires a prosperous Japan and a prosperous Germany, it does not seem sensible or logical that millions of lives must be sacrificed for the mere purpose of defeating the governments in Germany and Japan and then rebuilding these nations to the stage of prosperity which he visualizes as being necestions that have controlled the world in sary in a prosperous new world. If I believed that a military victory would destroy the ideology that we 'term "" fascism"" I would add my voice to those which clamour for a second front. It is not the politician's or the statesman's job to do the military planning of the second front or the planning necessary for the conduct of the war in Europe. It is the parliamentarian's job to look to the politics of the matter and it is the people's responsibility to pay the cost of military operations and for the plans formulated by their representatives. Having appreciation of the price that the people have paid and are paying in the sacrifice of human lives on the battle-field and on the home front and in the hardships associated with their war effort, I believe that, as a popular representative in the Parliament, I should use the freedom of speech that they have won and paid for so dearly to speak as my conscience directs, whether what I have to say is popular or unpopular. I am not convinced that a military victory will finally destroy fascism in Germany or Japan or Italy or anywhere else in the world. In saying that I am speaking as my conscience dictates. I consider that the people who are fighting this war and of free speech expect me to say things that I believe are right, particularly when I believe that the policy of organizing the physical force of the world for the purpose of destruction, for the purpose, of achieving a military victory, for the sole reason of destroying enemy government, is fraught with such danger of evil results. I have read reports that have come from all over the world by cable and wireless to the newspapers in order to find out just what the nations of the world are doing and just how serious are those who control the people's destinies in their protestations of a new order to follow this awful war. I must say that I am very sceptical that those people who promise a new order hope to bring it about. I saw in the Canberra Times of Monday a report of a statement by the Assistant Attorney General of the United States of America. It said that if the capitalist organizathe past and that influence very much the economy of the world at the present time were not restrained a third world war would eventuate. Such an eventuality is too horrible to contemplate. I want to deal with this question of the continued organization of the physical force of the world for the purpose of a military victory from the point of view of the effect such a military victory will have on Australia, because, after all, my first concern is the well-being of this nation. I realize that it will be very difficult to have a prosperous Australia in a world of confusion, but I submit also that, unless the people who are charged with the responsibility of government in the nations of the world ensure that those nations shall individually play their part in the scheme of things, the overall scheme will have no possibility of success. For that reason, I consider it my duty to let the people on whom the responsibility of the government of the country rests know that I consider that a military victory, whether it comes early, with consequential tremendous losses of men and 'blood, or late, as the result of a long drawn-out struggle, can have but one final effect on this nation, and that effect will be disastrous. We have in Australia a population of about 7,000,000. Our task at present seems to be in politics, and if we are able to expand our populainternational politics, at any rate, to justify our continued occupancy of this huge continent by such a small white population. Having in mind the figures that the right honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page) cited to-day, it is only reasonable to suppose that, when the military victory is finally won, we shall have greater difficulty in justifya high capacity for production, and a ing our holding of this country and restricting migration, especially if we desire to pick and choose the newcomers. I do not think anybody is more conscious than I that no matter what the future holds in regard to the war our destiny is fraught with danger, uncertainty and difficulty. Undoubtedly, it is a case of military victory by the United Nations or our discontinuance under the protection of Great Britain, and, as I heard the Leader of the Opposition say, lately, if we have to move out of the ambit of Great Britain, we shall definitely have to move into the ambit of America if we want to protect ourselves against any future aggression. But it is very problematical whether the people of the United States of America, when they have counted the cost of this war, will be inclined again to take part in what they term ""the mess-up"". It is problematical whether they will take us under 'their wing in tbe event of our being attacked and not being able to secure the protection of the British Navy. Again, the question arises of the continuance of the WhiteAustralia Policy. Unless we have either the protection of the British Navy or guarantees of support by the United States of America, we shall not be able to withstand a challenge by the Japan or India of the future to our right to continue that policy. Yet, if we lose much more of our man-power, either in big military operations or as the result Mr Breen. of casualties and disease in a protracted struggle, we shall, with fewer than 7,000,000 people, still forfeit the right to ask other nations to guarantee us in the maintenance of that policy. I cannot offer the solution of the problem, but I believe that, if this war can be ended without international recriminations such as followed the last war, if there is no World War III . within the next 20 years, tion to 20,000,000 persons, we shall be able to justify and defend our policy against any challenge. After all, no physical bastion, no Gibraltar at Noumea or Port Moresby, will hold this country if we have a reservoir of only 7,000,000 people. The defence of Australia in future will lie in a population of 20,000,000 persons, patriotism as fervent as that of our forebears. Those things alone will give to us the right and the ability to hold this country. The Prime Minister is about to go abroad. I am grateful for the personal effort which he has devoted to the task of organizing and directing this country in its hour of crisis. I know his ability. He will not be easily swayed by some of the things that led to the downfall, from the Australian point of view, of former Labour Prime Ministers who went abroad. I am confident that that will not be the fate of the present Prime Minister. On previous occasions, I have praised the right honourable gentleman for his work in Australia's war effort. No other man could have rallied the nation as he has done and guided the ship of state to the approaches of the harbour European of peace. With my benediction to him on his projected departure, I say that in 1917, when he was sent to gaol for his war activities, he did more for humanity and for Australia than he did in 1944 when he was cheered. very comprehensive statement to the House last week, the Prime Minister( Mr Curtin) mentioned the trials and difficulties which will beset the people of 'Great Britain in the next few months. He explained that our obligation will be to see that they shall receive from us the greatest possible physical assistance, particularly in terms of food. As some",43,Oubtin
111,Mr Holt (Fawkner) [8.36],"In hisdays have elapsed since the Prime Minister made that statement, I shall repeat briefly what he said on that occasion, because he clothed the address in the most attractive languageMoat certainly the people of the United Kingdom, in particular, have had to bear stresses and strains inseparable from the maintenance of their island home, not only for themselves, but also as a base which the United Nations could and must use. The United Kingdom had to be held in order that it could be used as a base for the launching of a vast force against Germany. That this has been achieved by GTeat Britain is a matter not only for admiration, but also for thanksgiving, for had that base not been held Germany would have won the war. That is a fact. The people of the United Kingdom have been engaged in active warfare longer than have the people of Australia. Later, he saidBut to-day I am concerned about what I consider to be the inadequate distribution of the necessaries of life among our kith and kin in Great Britain, our comrades in this great struggle. We in Australia owe it to them, and we should regard it as our privilege very real want, leading to physical disto make our maximum contribution to their physical needs so that their stamina may be maintained and so that, having regard to what they have already undergone, they will be aible to stand up to the physical ordeal that they must endure before victory can be gained. Any comparisons which can be made between what has been done in this country in the past and what is being done now are beside the point. The important thing for me to ask myself is, ""How much of meat, butter, eggs and other foodstuffs can I contribute towards my colleagues, my brothers as it were, in the United Kingdom ?"" If this nation desires to bring the Japanese war to the earliest possible termination it must, this year, make its utmost physical contribution towards ensuring that supplies requisite for the great attack from Great Britain on Germany shall be provided on the largest possible scale. Those l of t y sentiments, nobly expressed, will commend themselves to every honourable member who has given any thought at all to the sacrifice and endurance which the people of GreatB r it a in have displayed throughout this war. But the real test of any l of t y statement is the ultimate performance. Unhappily, as with so many of the grandiloquent speeches which the Prime Minister delivers in this House, the facts do not, bear out the sentiments. The House w ill be shocked, as I was shocked after examining the figures, to learn the extent to which our deliveries of food to GreatB r it a in have shrunk during the last few years. Australia is one of the few countries which can supply to the British Isles substantial quantities of food. I imagine that Australia was the most important contributor of food to GreatB r it a in at the present time. We know somethingof the severity of the rationing in that country, but if there has been any fault at all regarding our knowledge of the position, it is perhaps that we have been inclined to take a light view of the condition of the people of GreatB r it a in because of the very cheerfulness with which they have borne those deprivations in their normal supplies, and because of the tales which reach us of their good health. It came to me as a surprise recently in Melbourne to learn from a very distinguished Englishman that unless supplies of food to GreatB r it a in could be increased in the next few months, the people would experience not only deprivation but also ability. In the face of that knowledge, which must be in the possession of the Commonwealth Government, we should be entitled to assume that during recent months Australia has established substantial supplies of food for export to GreatB r it a in . E a r l y in the war, shipping difficulties prevented the despatch to GreatB r it a in of quantities of food that were available, but those obstacles have now been very largely removed. Mr Bankes Amery, the head of the British Food Missioni n Australia, declared this week that shipping was no longer a l i m it in g factor. He said that ships were available to take all the food that Australia was able to send. been a limitin g factor regarding essential food. for Richmond( Mr Anthony) has made a closer study of that subject than have most honourable members, and I accept his statement on that point.

The first year was 1939-40, which includeda few months under war conditions. The second year, 1940-41, found Great Britain almost alone facing the combined strength of Germany and Italy. The year 1942-43 is the latest period for which I have the detailed figures. In 1939-40 we supplied to Great Britain approximately 109,000 tons of butter; in 1940-41, 77,000 tons; and in 1942-43, 49,000 tons.

A drop from 216,000 tons to 109,000 tons is considerable. In 1939-40 we exported 65,000,000 lb. of dried fruits. The figures for 1940-41 were 93,000,000 lb. and for 1942-43 82,000,000 lb. That seems to indicate that there is still a fair export, but the figures in relation to canned fruits are enlightening. In 1939-40 we exported 67,000,000 lb. of canned fruit.

In 1942-43 our exports of butter to the United Kingdom dropped to a little more than 49,000 tons which is considerably below the figure for the previous two years. The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture has informed me, in another document that he has supplied, that present indications are that we shall ship a minimum of 40,000 tons to the United Kingdom in the current twelve months, although he hopes that that figure will be exceeded. It is probable, however, that our output of butter will be adversely affected by the recent bushfij-es. I have drawn a clear picture of how our exports of foodstuffs to the United Kingdom are shrinking. We must bear in mind that Great Britain is not able to supplement its supplies by imports from other countries. Yet it is faced with the necessity for continuing to supply Russia, and also troops in various parts of the world. In America the home consumption of these vital foodstuffs has had to be reduced.

The butter ration in Britain is only 2 oz. a week whereas ours is 8 oz. a week. In Great Britain a person may purchase meat to the value of only Is. 2d. a week, which, I presume, would give very much less than our ration of 2£ lb. a week. It must be obvious to all of us that as Great Britain will have to face what the Prime Minister has described as the physical strain of invasion preparations .and also sustain invasion forces, it will be necessary to do something to supplement its food supplies. We wish to know what the Government proposes to do to meet the position. Mr Bankes Amery stated a few days ago that if Great Britain were to get larger supplies we would have to reduce consumption in Australia or else increase production. How is it proposed to do either of these? Our colleagues of the Australian Country party have' already debated the subject at some length in this sessional period. I believe that if effective measures-are to be taken the Government will have to discard, almost overnight, a great deal of the machinery with which the country is cluttered up at present. A simplification .of production and distribution methods is urgently needed, and action must be taken at once. Even an increase of production will not meet the needs of Great Britain in the critical months that are just ahead of us. We ought to he doing our utmost to increase supplies to Great Britain immediately so that the needs for invasion activities and the like can be met. The Government should impose immediately a considerable reduction of consumption in respect of both meat and butter in Australia. How else can we show our sincerity ? gentleman taken into account the availability of shipping? to the statement made by Mr Bankes Amery recently that shipping is no longer a limiting factor. The honourable member for Richmond( Mr duction, and the production of whole Anthony) can supplement my statement out of his own experience. Instead of making a sympathetic approach to these problems the Minister in charge of rationing, Senator Keane, stated in the press this week that a reduction of the butter, ration in Australia had not even been considered. I have seen no qualification of that statement. If the Government has not even considered a reduction of the butter ration in order that the people of Great Britain may obtain increased supplies it has hardly any right to consider itself as a cooperating unit in the British Empire. Certainly the Prime Minister had no right to use the language that he employed in this House last week when he said, in effect, that his heart was bleeding for the people of iGreat Britain, and that he had the fullest admiration for their wonderful war effort. Unless the Government faces up to the facts of this situation and does something to meet this emergency in order that 'Great Britain may be tided over the anticipated invasion period, it will be letting both Australia and the United Kingdom down very badly indeed. War Organization of Industry) [8.55]. I should not have intruded in this debate had it not been for certain remarks made by the honourable member for Pawkner( Mr Holt) and the right honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page). Both honourable gentlemen have shown some agitation of mind concerning food production in Australia and the allocation of available foodstuffs. I inform them definitely that ever since it assumed office this Government has given a great deal of attention to the production of basic foodstuffs of every kind that have been in short supply. The output of every basic food which has been in short supply has been substantially increased since this Government came into office. say that about butter? gentleman had been listening carefully to me he would have appreciated that I used the expression "" every basic food "". Whole milk is the basis of butter promilk in Australia has increased very greatly since 1941-42. This Government came into office in October, 1941, so it had no opportunity to do anything to increase production in 1940-41. The production of whole milk in that year was, if I remember correctly, 1,106,000,000 gallons. export whole milk. to honourable members that whole milk is the basic material for butter production. Our production of whole milk has improved very greatly. Honourable gentlemen must appreciate that we have had to provide for not only the civilian population of this country but also for a greatly increased service personnel. We have also sent to Great Britain large quantities of butter, cheese, condensed milk and powdered milk. Whole milk has also been used to meet civilian needs in this country and to produce ice cream. It is true that butter production has declined somewhat, but we have had to divert large quantities of whole milk to the production of condensed milk and powdered milk for the use of the fighting services, and we have used milk for the production of cheese in accordance with the wishes of the Government of the United Kingdom. I repeat that there is not a basic food commodity that has been in short supply in this country which has not been produced in substantially larger quantities since this Government assumed office.

The Government has this year assessed our capacity to produce meat-and that is what is called the production goal-a t approximately 1,100,000 tons. Actually, the production will exceed the estimate that was originally made, because of the excellent work which the Department of Commerce and Agriculture and the Minister who controls it, have done in stepping-up the production of pig meats. All of this criticism, goes back to something that is far more important than the question of whether or not the food front has been efficiently organized; it goes back to the much bigger question of whether or not the Government is using in a balanced manner the very limited supply of labour power at its disposal. which I raised; it is, whether the people think that I am replying only to him. members opposite have spoken to this",49,Exports Op Foodstuffs To United Kingdom During The Years 1938 30 To 1942 43

In fact, they are not in a position to know the extent to which we require the mobilization of our man-power in the fighting services. It is all very well to ask for the release to do that, the Opposition would be the of an additional 100,000 men from the fighting services. I make it perfectly plain that a decision by the Government to release such a number would be made against the advice of its expert military advisers. The Opposition has always contended that in military matters the Government should adopt the advice of its expert advisers and not interfere in matters of strategy. What would be the result if the Government, acceding to the wish of some honourable members, denuded the fighting services of the manpower which they require? We should not then have the necessary strength in the front line, and could not play our part in the operations that are to-day taking place in the Rismarck Archipelago. The Government is not prepared to accede to this request, which is made so strongly that one could describe it as a demand, because it knows that it could not afford to do so. cultural Council has made a recommendation in respect of the release of men from the Army. sists of State Ministers of Agriculture, who sit in session with the Commonwealth Minister for Commerce and Agriculture. It has passed a resolution to the ought to accept that allocation of the effect that 50,000 men should be released from the fighting services. I ask honourable members: What do State Ministers of Agriculture know about the strategic situation in the north? . Are they in a position to know the facts in relation to the strength of the enemy?

Of course, it depends upon the situation of the camp. Those serving in camps in North Queensland would get a full military ration, but those in camps situated near a city in one of the southern States receive, I understand, only the same ration as is available to civilians. is quite wrong. able member has information to support his contradiction, but I have been assured by the Minister for the Army( Mr discussions.

177,Mr Dedman,"It has been underwhat is heing produced now, they will be forced to admit that, on the food front, the Department of Commerce and Agriculture has done a very good job. The production of every basic item of food which is to-day in short supply has been substantially increased since 1941-42, and this has been achieved with less manpower than was then available. This has been possible because of the plans laid by the Department of Commerce and Agriculture, and because the Government set aside a certain amount of the country's productive capacity in order to establish » pool of farm machinery. To-day, there is more mechanization on the farms than ever before. The position is being improved all the time, and we hope that the production of food will in future he increased still further. creased exports? the meantime additional military forces come to this theatre of war. It might then be necessary to re-allocate available supplies, and that would be done after discussion with the Government of the Dnited States of America and, probably, the Government of Great Britain also. In regard to the allocation of available has not been able to help Great supplies of labour in Australia, I believe that we have achieved as satisfactory a balance as has been achieved in any other country in the world. The residue of labour available after the satisfaction of war requirements has to be spread over a wide range of occupations and industries. Every production department is looking for more labour. ""We need more men to cut firewood for the approaching winter, more for the production of food, and more to work in industries for the supply of goods to the forces of the United States of America in this theatre. All those demands must be met out of a limited and very much depleted labour pool. The fact is that we have not enough man-power to meet all the demands that are being made upon us. -The outstanding feature of the statement made last week by the Prime Minister( Mr Curtin) was the great tribute which he paid to the war effort of 'Great Britain and the other United Nations, and the stress which was laid upon the obligation which faces Australia to aid the United Nations in every way possible in the forthcoming attack on fortress Europe. The food produced in Australia must be supplied to our own troops in the South-West Pacific, to Allied troops in this area, and to the troops which wiil be engaged in the attack on Europe. In addition, there will be a tremendous demand for food from the peoples of the countries that will be liberated from the enemy. In the last few months a heavy demand for food has set in from the liberated people of southern Italy, numbering about ten million. To-day, the right honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page) mentioned the assistance which the United States of America had rendered to Russia, and pointed oult that in the first (twelve months after Russia entered the war, America had sent to that country 32,000 tons of butter. However, the fact remains that the United States has not been able to provj.de as much food as was hoped, and any surplus produced in that country is, for the most part, sent to Russia. I suggest that the United States Britain to any great extent, nor even to supply the forces in the Middle East. The other great food producing countries in the Americas are Brazil and Uruguay, but until quite recently, food production in them was hampered by drought conditions. In Argentina, not only was there a drought, but the Government is a very doubtful quantity, being practically Nazi in character, so that Argentina cannot be depended upon to supply food to the United Nations as freely as might be hoped. South Africa is a comparatively poor food-producing country. So Australia and New Zealand are left as the two lands upon which. Great Britain and its Allies must largely depend for essential food supplies. As the Prime Minister has so often reminded us, this is a global war, one in which the only objective of the United Nations must be the destruction of the military power of Germany and Japan.

180,Mr Abbott (New England) [9.25].,"a defensive war. To attempt to fight a defensive war is to lose the war. The only way to win a war is to go out and destroy your enemies, and to do that we must supply our fighting forces with food and war material to the full productive capacity of the United ""Nations. I put it to .tie Government that the aimed forces of the United Nations need food to fight with just as much as they need munitions of war. I was astonished to hear the Minister for ""War Organization of Industry( Mr Dedman), after saying that the question was whether the Government had used the man-power of this country in a properly balanced way, proceed to chide members of the Opposition for attempting to have men discharged from the armed forces in order to take their place in the great food production drive. I assume that, in the same breath, he also chides supporters of the Government, many of whom have been equally active in trying to have men discharged from the armed forces for .that purpose. My reply to the Minister is that the distribution of man-power needs a complete overhaul with an eye to what is needed now, not to some vague idea that certain war factories shall be kept operating in the post-war period. Our task now is not to think airily about what will happen to munitions factories when the war ends, but to use our man-power to provide means of bringing this world struggle, which is burning up humanity as in a furnace, to an end as soon as possible. We are not doing that. We are not using fully those things that we have in the greatest abundcorrect, and I say that the figures ance. We are not producing sufficient food, because man-power is being wasted. This Government is not doingits very best to win the war. Minister for War Organization of In dustry made a great song about attempts to have men discharged from the fighting forces to engage in primary production. He said that the Government's military advisers advocated that we should maintain the size of the Army. Those military advisers are General Douglas MacArthur and General Blarney. But does the Combined Chiefs of Staff Committee in Washington, which is directing the conduct of this war, think that Australia should maintain its forces at their present size, or does it recommend that those forces should be lessened in order that the food production drive in this country may be carried on to the furthest extent? Those are questions to Which the country wants answers. member does not expect me to discuss in public the nature of commivnications between the Combined Chiefs of Staff Committee and me? right honourable gentleman to discuss anythink like that in public, but I think that the blessed word "" security "" is used, not only by him, but also by other Ministers, as a cloak for many sins of omission. There would be no breach of security if we were told whether the highest command in the world believes that we are making too great an effort in one direction and not one great enough effort in the other. The Minister for War Organization of Industry said that, for reasons of security, nothing could be said about why the numbers in the Army should be maintained. So, as we are left in ignorance-w e are not even told anything in secret meetings-w e must compare our enlistments in the services with those of other countries. I understand that the figures that I am about to give the House are correct. They have been published in the press, and have never been challenged. The Prime Minister himself gave in this House .the number of men enlisted in the armed forces of Australia. So those figures should be of the other countries have been checked. Enlistments in Australia are one in eight of the population, in Great The Britain one in nine, in Germany one in eleven, in the United States of America one in thirteen, in Canada, one in twenty and in Japan one in twenty-five. We have no means of judging the necessity for Australian enlistments to be heavier than those of any other country, but the Prime Minister did make the following statement last, week in his review of the war situation:The scale of Australia's military effort w ill have an important bearing on our status at the peace table.

There is, therefore, a to the Almighty for having poured down minimum below which our military effort cannot be permitted to fall. Are we to paralyse the food production of this country because we think that we shall derive benefit from being able to say at the Peace Table that we have large forces in the background? Compared with the forces of other countries, our armed forces would be insignificant. I do not think that we shall derive any benefit from that if we go to tJhe Peace Conference with a record of having failed to produce the food and raw materials which are so urgently required by the United Nations. It will be of no advantage to us to have a large army if we have failed in other essentials, thereby, possibly, prolonging the struggle for months longer than necessary. The Minister for War Organization of Industry said that man-power had been adequately and properly distributed in Australia to the best adyantage of this nation. He citedfiguresin regard to the munitions industry. I understand that, according to an announcement by the Prime Minister in December last, the number of employees, male and female, in the munitions industry of Australia is 556,000. Only7 per cent, of our women are being used in war work or in the Services compared with 40 per cent, in Great Britain. I submit that there is a great reservoir of woman-power which could be used to replace men doing light repetition work in munitions factories. Those men could take their place in the armed forces or be employed in the food producing industries. From the outbreak of war to October, 1943, the number of people employed in rural industries fell by 28 per cent, from 500,000 to 360,000. During tJhe same period 20,000 women took up rural employment. The Minister for War Organization of Industry read a mass of figures relating to the dairying industry. I give him credit for reasonable accuracy; he was only a few hundred thousand gallons out, but that, apparently, is a matter of little moment. What is more important is the fact that he tried to make out that since the coming into being of this Labour Administration milk production in Australia has risen like a rocket into the sky. Mr Abbott. He was not modest, for he gave no credit rain on to the earth to make the grass grow. I do agree with the Minister that the measure of production must be in terms of whole milk, because there has been a diversion to butter, cheese and dried milk. In 1939-40 the whole-milk production amounted to 1,256,000,000 gallons, but in 1942-43 it dropped to 1,128,000,000 gallons, a very big fall. man-power in the dairying industry. The decline of production from 1938-39 to 1942-43 was 61,000,000 gallons. 'The target for 1943-44 is 1,134,520,000 gallons, which is 121,580,000 gallons less than the production in 1939-40. The Prime Minister has said that the requirements are 1,287,890,000 gallons, leaving a deficiency of 153,000,000 gallons on the target figure, but, if we reached the 1939-40 figure we should be only 31,790,000 gallons short. The_ decline of production in the dairying industry is practically due to. the shortage of labour. It has been said that the dairymen are selective in the labour they want in the industry. They ask for the return from the Army or from the munitions industry of their sons, other relatives, or people who have formerly worked for them. There is a very good reason for that. Those people know the industry; they know how to work in it ; they know how to get production much better than any stranger. In my electorate, a man was engaged with his wife and daughter and a hand sent to him by the man-power authority in grading and packing citrus fruits for the food supply authority in Sydney. He was packing 1,250 cases a week. His son was allowed out of the Army for three months to assist him in the urgent work. As the result his deliveries jumped in one week to 2,500 cases and stayed at the same level. That was because he had the services of his own son, not a person with no interest in the work. The Minister for War Organization of Industry talks a lot about meat production in Australia. One would think that the story was the best that could be",54,Exports Op Foodstuffs To United Kingdom During The Years 1938 30 To 1942 43

There are 10,000,000 month. The Government should not beef cattle, nearly 125,000,000 sheep, and commence the manufacture of huge air1,560,000 pigs. Never before have those craft, because the process is most difficult numbers been equalled in this country, in Australia.

The parts have to be carted from cent. This year, on the available stock pillar to post over a congested' transport figures, we should be producing system, which is desperately short of 1,344,000 tons of meat. Although wo adequate supplies of coal and rollinghave the stock, we lack the necessary stock. The breaks of gauge add to the man-power to handle it. The man-power other difficulties. The manufacture of is tied up in munitions establishments aircraft in Australia is being undertaken and the Army. Labour should be sent to largely for the purpose of establishing for the country districts to produce the food the post-war period an industry that may necessary to bring the war to a speedy be of value to this country. But that conclusion. Although the Government is aware of ment should divert those employees to the the extraordinary shortage of man-power production of commodities essential to iu rural industries, Australia chooses this the victory of the United Nations. moment to embark upon a vast programme for the construction of bomber to construct in Australia a heavy type of aircraft, and a complicated aircraft bomber aircraft. I "" understand that 30 engine. Those undertakings will demand transport planes of the type which the the services of an enormous number factory would be capable of making for of men and women. If the Governcivilian use would serve the requirements ment is anxious to construct . airof the whole of our internal air routes craft in Australia-and I believe that in the post-war period. I am told by a it is essential to keepthe aircraft inleading authority on aircraft in this dustry in operation here-it should build country and also an overseas authority machines that are not capable of being that, after estimating replacements at a flown to this country. By constructing much higher figure than normal wastage, that type of aircraft, the Government these planes would last for at least four would conserve shipping space. The and a half years, so that only seven new Minister (Senator Cameron) stated that more than attempt to create an industry of that 2,500 aircraft have been manufactured in nature in Australia is a waste of men and Australia. He addedThe tens of thousands now employed have to do so when the effort may deprive the been recruited from all trades and callings and United Nations of essential food. The have made a success of their war job. . . . It is a pertinent fact that, at a time when Government's decision has been made at there is talk as to what will be done with a time when primary producers are munitions factories when the war is over, the endeavouring to work broken down government owned and operated workshops machines or are unable to operate them that delivered their 500th Beaufort aircraft during the last quarter of 1943 have a better because of the difficulty of obtaining jecord of deliveries-havin g regard to the size spare parts.

It .becomes wicked and cruel farmer, 30 miles away from the agent, may require a sparking plug for his tractor, or a new hall race. No longer able to obtain the spare parts simply by communicating with the agent by letter or telephone, the farmer has to make an application upon the prescribed form and despatch it to the Allied Works Council. No doubt, the application is referred back to the local district war agricultural committee. Unnecessary delays occur. Even if supporters of the Government do not realize it, the seasons do not wait until spare parts reach the farm. Ram does not dally until sparking plugs for tractors reach the farmer. Honourable members opposite laugh. I do not regard the situation as humorous. They think that it is funny when the farmer is deprived of these spare parts. They make witty remarks about it. Perhapswhen they meet their constituents again, they will explain this particular type of humour to them. The farmers will not understand it. The Government must decide what are the essential requirements for Australia to produce for the purpose of assisting the United Nations speedily to finish the war. At the Peace Conference, the great Allied Nations will be influenced not by a huge Australian army, which will"" probably be considered a corporal's guard by the ruler of Russia or in comparison with the forces which the United States of America and Great Britain will have under arms, but by its efforts to bring the war to a victorious conclusion; and the best effort that Australia can make is to re-aline the whole man-power of the country to ensure that supplies of food in unlimited quantities are made available to the United Nations. I associate myself with the sentiments that the Prime Minister. ( Mr Curtin) expressed in his speech last week, and particularly with his references to the work that has been done by Great Britain, and the manner in which that country alone faced the world during one period of the war, and to that extent was our substitute in sacrifice. As I represent a rural constituency, I may be pardoned for repeating some of the remarks that have been made by previous speakers. The electorate which I represent includes all the major primary industries of Australia, namely, wool, beef, wheat, butter, cheese, fruit, vegetables, potatoes, mjaize and peanuts. I was particularly interested in the statement of the Minister for War Organization of Industry( Mr Dedman) and some of his utterances about production I challenge. Dairy production has not equalled the output of 1938 and 1939. In fact, production in 1941 was only 50 per cent, of the production in those years; and never since have the receivals of butter for export approached the output of those two years. Butter production for the first seven months of this financial year, compared with the corresponding period of last year, has declined by 8,000 tons, whilst the production of cheese is about equal to that of the previous year. In Queensland the production of butter this year is 2,000 tons less than it was last year. The production of cheese has been reduced by 1,228 tons. Some honourable members appear to believe that any matter raised in this chamber is ventilated for political purposes, but my only concern is to stimulate production. I accept the assurance of the Government that Australia requires increased production. Because of that need, the Government announced a policy of releasing man-power from the Army. Most honourable members have doubtless asked for the release of certain men, and in view of the Government's announcement that 20,000 will be released in a certain period we cannot be blamed for doing so. My regret is that the releases are tardy and unsatisfactory. My own district is a rich dairying centre, and the chairman of the local district war agricultural committee informed me that the district was allotted, under the Army releases scheme, 330 men for the purpose of .assisting production. After the lapse of seven months, not a score of men have been sent to Kingaroy. I say without hesitation that the dairies which have gone out of production there number more than the men released from the Army. The tragedy is that the allocation of one man to each dairy would have preserved the farms. In my electorate more aged farmers have fallen by the wayside and died at their tasks than the number of men released in my district. That statement cannot be",55,Exports Op Foodstuffs To United Kingdom During The Years 1938 30 To 1942 43
185,Mr Adermann (Maranoa) [9.54].,"challenged. Of the twenty men released to work in the district, one half were disgested that there should be an increased charged from the Army against the recommendation of the local war agricultural committees. Scores of recommendations for release were made, and we recognize that all of them could not be granted by the Army. But the Minister for the Army( Mr Forde) explained that men are being released in accordance with the undertaking that he gave to Parliament. I ask, where are the men being sent? They are certainly no!t being allotted to Queensland in anything like the numbers that the State requires. That is causing me grave concern. In many instances, one additional man could prevent a dairy from ceasing production. Last season 100 dairies were sold and this season approximately 50 more have been sold in my district. Notwithstanding that we have experienced the best dairying season in Queensland since 1917, the production of butter has declined by 2,000 tons as compared with last year, which was a semi-dry year. We are missing the opportunity of the bountiful season which God has given us. The Minister for War Organization of Industry has said that production has increased. Insofar as dairying in Queensland is concerned, whether we consider whole milk, butter or cheese, the reverse is true, as the figures which I have cited show clearly. What are the reasons, other than lack of man-power, that have caused this decline of production? Two months ago I wrote to the Minister for Supply and Shipping and asked whether it was a fact that 200 tractors suitable for main road and other constructional work were being held in Brisbane because there was increased. no plant available for them to pull. The reply I received practically admitted that that was so. Yet throughout the previous twelve months we had been trying to to get higher prices just as the worker obtain tractors for farm work and had likes to get higher wages. found it impossible to do so. It seems to me that the recommendations which were ment for an increase of the price of made by the Agricultural Council which butter. I trust that the investigation met in Canberra this week were futile. committee will go thoroughly into that If they represent the best advice subject and that the Government will that the council can give us, I receive its recommendations sympathetisuggest that the man-power authorities cally. should draw upon the personnel of the council for the purpose of increasing the in primary industries have to face is the [11] man-power on farms. The council sugproduction of winter feed. But where is the man-power to grow additional feed? It suggested also a lengthening of the lactation period and supplementary feeding. The same question arises: Where is the man-power to produce the feed? It seems to me that the council consists chiefly of theorists. The Minister for War Organization of Industry( Mr Dedman) suggested that some of the recommendations were made in ignorance. I doubt that. The Director-General of Agriculture, Mr Bulcock, who has been appointed to his position for a seven-year period, was available for advice, yet only theoretical suggestions were made. Some of the members of the council could, I think, do good work on dairy farms. Herd-testing and an extension of farm machinery pools were recommended. I agree that it would be a good thing if farm machinery pools could be extended, but I do not know where there is one such pool in Queensland. We need more farm machinery. As to herd-testing, the plain fact is that many stud-breeders have had to forgo their herd-testing because of the lack of man-power. Mr J. Sparkes, a prominent Hereford breeder in the Daiby district, adjacent to my own district, has stated that he cannot supply anything like the number of Hereford bulls required by dairymen. What does that signify? To me it indicates that the dairymen intend to breed for beef in preference to breeding for milking stock, because it makes for an easier life and will not mean slaving day and night in the dairy.

188,Mr Adermann,"That is an argushortage of rubber. I dealt with this subject some time ago in speaking on the motion for the adjournment. Any one who can picture the district that I represent, which is three times the size of Victoria, can realize the transport problems that have to be overcome. It raises the ire of. the producers in that district to be told by the Deputy Controller of Rubber in Queensland that they should co-operate with their neighbours. How can they do so' when their nearest neighbours are from 20 to 30 miles distant? It is obviously an impossibility. Many of my constituents have written asking me to do what I can to expedite decisions on their applications for tyres and tubes, in order to keep on the roads the only transport they have available. I do not know the rubber position from the inside, and perhaps I have no right to know it, but 1 urge the Government to deal sympathetically with primary producers in this regard, and to give them a higher priority than they have at present. Primary producers in our outback areas never use their motor vehicles for pleasure. Transport for business purposes is the only thing that they are interested in and it is necessary that they shall be given a reasonable priority. I shall revert to the man-power position for a moment because I overlooked one point earlier. Producers have been invited to nominate persons for release from the Army and also the Allied ""Works Council, in order to work in primary industries, but I regret to say that applisouthern areas to Queensland. If more cations made to the Allied Works Council receive very little consideration. I direct attention to the case of a semiinvalid of more than 60 years of age, who has only his wife, who is suffering from milking eczema, and has been forbidden to go into the dairy, and another lady to help him, in a dairy in which 130 cows are being milked. He applied to the Allied Works Council for the release of a man and his application was rejected. I renewed the application for him and it was rejected again. I made it clear that I would keep on applying on his behalf. The only reason given for the refusal to release the man was that this semiinvalid of 60 years of age could find time to do some repair work to his house. I know that this man rises before daylight Mr Adermann. and has to work well into the hours of darkness. If he did any repair work on his house it was done during an hour or two in the middle of the day when he should have been resting. As it is, he is working day and night and he ought to be given some relief.' I must say a few words about wheat. The Government should be more liberal in relation to the area that may be put under wheat. Growers should be allowed to produce from an unlimited area at the guaranteed price of 4s. l i d . a bushel. Any one with a blind eye can see, as the Irishman would say, that there will be a shortage of wheat throughout the world after the war. We shall have to provide for 100,000,000 people in India, the people in the Netherlands East Indies, as well as the teeming millions of China. All these will need our wheat badly. How far will Australia's surplus of 100,000,000 bushels go among them ? cution of the war? fair in this matter. I suggest to the Government that it should allow wheat growers in Queensland who have machinery lying idle to use their plant to produce wheat to the maximum capacity. A good deal of wheat-producing machinery is partially idle in Queensland because of the restrictions that are in force. Yet, every day about 400 tons of wheat has to be transported from wheat could be grown in Queensland, a great deal of man-power and transport could be diverted to more useful service, and we should not hear remarks by Commonwealth Ministers to the effect that insufficient transport is available. I do not ask that extensive additional man-power shall be made available for wheat growing in Queensland; I ask that our people there shall be allowed to grow 1 wheat to their maximum capacity. Vegetable production is very important in these days. Just before I left my electorate to come to Canberra, I made an investigation of the position. We all know that Commonwealth Ministers have urged that vegetable production should be increased. The tragedy is that gluts so often occur in this industry with the",58,Exports Op Foodstuffs To United Kingdom During The Years 1938 30 To 1942 43

190,Mr Adermann,"I desire to beresult that growers are compelled to accept unprofitable prices. Guaranteed prices are not available. When gluts occur growers are dependent upon the charity of a Commonwealth department, which may buy their surplus produce and send it to hospitals or elsewhere, in order to maintain prices. able member does not complain because the surplus production is purchased? trouble is, that all the growers do not reap the benefit; those who do not consign vegetables to the market on that particular day do not participate in it, nor does the price paid cover the cost of production. Why should the industry have to depend on the charity of a Commonwealth department? department purchases the vegetables and gives them to hospitals. member be surprised to know that stockmen have asked that similar action be taken in regard to sheep? authority instances in Queensland of the Government having fallen down on the contracts it has made, on the ground that quality was deteriorating. A contract was made with a resident of the Mundubbera district, covering £1,000 worth of swede turnips. Every man in the district who can speak with authority certified that the quality was absolutely first-class, Two or three months ago, at the instigaand that nothing better had ever been seen. Because the Army refused to eat turnips, the grower was told that the quality was deteriorating, and the contract was set aside. On the legal issue of quality, the Government might succeed in' certain instances if the matter were taken to court; but it has a moral responsibility. The chief factor in the loss of production is the lessening of the confidence which the growers have in the Government. To say that the quality is deteriorating when everybody knows that it is not, is despicable. I have been informed, on the authority of the chairman of the Gayndah and Mundubbera shires, that not a vegetable-grower in those two districts will grow vegetables in future, because of the actions of the Government. be paid contract prices for third and fourth grade vegetables. asked the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture a question regarding the delivery of cases with a view to saving the Stanthorpe fruit crop. I am sorry to say that the Minister followed his usual practice of generalizing and, in effect, giving no information. I asked him what action he had taken in response to the representations that had been made to him by all sections of the fruit industry. His reply wasThis matter has received the constant attention of Timber Control in Queensland and every effort is being made to relieve the position which is acute in varying degrees in the fruit industry generally. That is a general answer, which meant nothing to the fruit-growers of Sitanthorpe. Had the honourable gentleman, three or four weeks ago, taken action to release nine or ten men to assist the sawmillers to get the cases out, the position would have been met. To-day, I received the following urgent telegram:ilan-.power requirements Stanthorpe sawmills still not met. Growers have already lost many thousands of pounds worth fruit, Result serious. Case shortage calamitous. Loss now inevitable. Growers desperate. Delay inexcusable. That is signed by the chairman of the Deciduous Sectional Group Committee.

Transport was available. Had the honourable gentleman complied with my request, one or two men would have supplied all the cases that were required for the whole of the fruit industry in that district. He may have had good reasons for refusal; I grant him that right as a Minister. But he has ignored the many requests that have been made from a whole district of growers.

There seems to be a tendency to adopt towards primary production the attitude that is adopted in connection with other civil matters, which we know can at times await attention for two, three, four, or even six weeks, without being adversely affected. Primary production cannot wait. Many crops have to be harvested immediately they are ready. Latitude of a week or, at the most, a fortnight, is all that can be allowed without prejudice to the crop. If we can instil that into the minds of the officials who are handling these matters, we shall have done much good. My object is to help the Government. I have no desire to criticize it continually. I should like it to be as serious in considering my submissions as I am in making them. I wish to help the primary producer to overcome the many difficulties with which he is now confronted, and to make the department acquainted with them. If I have been of any assistance, I shall have achieved my purpose, which is to enable the Government to increase food production. We should be told of the source from which labour is to be provided, and should not be charged with party political motives when we apply for it. The Government should remember that in the dairying districts of Kingaroy, Gayndah, Dalby and Jandowie, the production has been lowered to approximately 50 per cent, of the record output.

The question of payment of subsidy to these milk producers is already under consideration by the Commonwealth Prices Commissioner and the Price Stabilization Committee.

If so, what salary is paid to this gentleman? 3. To what vote is it charged? 4. Is Signor Vaccari known to have been a member of the Fascist party? 5. Is Signor Vaccari alleged by other Italians still to be a Fascist? 6. Has he expressed such views recently in Melbourne, and were they published in Stella Marisf 7. Has the Government received objections to Signor Vaccari's appointment from reputable members of the Italian community? 8. Isi t the intention of the Government to appoint such representatives from enemy nationals and others to look after the interests of Germans, Jugoslavs, Greeks, Bulgarians, Turks and others? D r . EVATT The answer to the honorand able member's questions is as f o l l o w s : After the armistice between the King of Italy, acting through Marshal Badoglio, and the United Nations, representations were made to the Prime Minister in Australia to the effect that internees of Italian origin who had been working in labour camps and were found medically unfit for work lacked adequate medical attention and care, and that it would assist the departments of the Commonwealth Government if some individual were permitted to act as an unofficial liaison between such on Commonwealth members of the Italian community in Australia and the various Australian government authorities which, in one aspect or another, are charged with their control or responsibility. The name of Mr Vaccari, who is a naturalized British subject of over twenty years' standing, was suggested to the Government in this connection. Mr Vaccari was authorized to make representations to government departments in respect of such matters as detention, restriction, release and employment of Italians, and the relief of special cases of hardship and distress. There was no appointment, no salary whatever was paid, and no vote of money is involved. The paper Stella Maris to which reference is made in the question has been examined by associated with the Roman Catholic Church. Security Service have .reported to me that so far as they can ascertain no Fascist views have been published by or attributed to Mr Vaccari in such journal. When Mr Vaccari was authorized to act the Government had no knowledge of any alleged association by h im with the Fascist party, past or present. However, several letters of protest have been received on behalf of certain groups of Italians. I am informed that up to' the present Mr. Vaccari has carried out his duties to the satisfaction of Security Service, Man Power authorities and Allied Works Council. Yesterday, however, my attention was drawn to certain matters not related to those mentioned by .hfl 4 honourable member. In view of a l l this, I have asked the appropriate authority to report f u l l y on the matter so as to enable the Government to consider whether Mr Vaccari's authority to make representations should be further coning the Minister for the Interior, upon noticeW ill he lay on the table of the Library a ll papers and correspondence in connection w it h the removal from Deloraine to Launeeston of the office of returning officer for the electoral division of Wilmot?",61,Papers

I have not made a broadwithout notice:Is the Minister for Commerce and Agrithe elections, except to formally introduce culture aware that the subsidy paid to wheatState Ministers for Agriculture who were growers in respect to wheat sold to poultryjoined in a national broadcast in the farmers and for stock feed is not sufficient to make up the gap between the price of such drive for increased production of foodwheat and the ordinary price of wheat sold stuffs generally for other purposes ? Will the Minister increase the subsidy so that tlie cost of providing cheap wheat for stock-owners shall not be a tax upon the wheat-grower? I am now in a position to inform the honourable member that the subsidy for wheat sold for stock feed brings the return to the Wheat Board up to the local price. In view of price stabilization measures and the benefits which they confer on wheat-growers as well as other sections of the community it is not proposed to increase the payment from Commonwealth funds. the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr the Victorian bush fires was made known, Holt) asked the following question without notice:Isi t a fact that, in the course of a recent broadcast address, the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture said that Australians need not fear that there would be any reduction of the butter ration, and that even if it meant that Great Britain would be supplied with a smaller quantity, the present ration would be maintained in Australia? Will the Minister state what iB the present weekly ration in Great Britain as compared with the ration in Australia, and will he state by how much Australia was short in its butter shipments to Great Britain during the last few months? In reply to the honourable member, I point out that the Tation in the United Kingdom is 2 oz. per week per person and in Australia 8 oz. Great Britain has requested Australia to supply 55,000 tons of butter during the year ending the 30th June, 1944. The present indications are that Australia will ship a minimum of 40,000 tons during that period, with the distinct possibility that some further thousands of tons may be available for shipment. In reply to the honourable member's further question, I wish to reiterate that I did not broadcast or make any statement to the press regarding butter rationing in Australia, except to remark in reply to cast speech since immediately prior to BUSH FIBE RELIEF. the honourable member for Hume( Mr Fuller) asked the following question, without notice:Will the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture indicate the nature of the relief that is planned fur those primary producers who suffered lo.js as the result of the recent disastrous bush fires? Will he also indicate tbe progress that has been made in giving effect to the Government's decisions, and the degree of Commonwealth and State co-operation that has been achieved in the matter? I have to advise .the honourable member that, immediately the grievous nature of I conferred with the Prime Minister( Mr Curtin) and the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) regarding Commonwealth assistance. It was decided to make an immediate grant to Victoria, and to guarantee the sum of £100,000 should it be needed. As there was a risk of bush fires in all States, the sum of £200,000 was set aside to assist the States, to afford relief where serious outbreaks occurred. In addition to the Commonwealth grant, the Victorian Government agreed to contribute £50,000. This sum has been included in the list of subscriptions to the fund opened by .the Lord Mayor of Melbourne. This fund now totals £138,000. The New South Wales Government has agreed to contribute £1 for £1 for money contributed by the Commonwealth for relief in New South Wales. The Victorian Government was notified immediately of the action taken by the Commonwealth, and officers of the Agricultural Division of Food Control were instructed to cooperate with officers of the Victorian",62,Electobal Wilmot Divisional Retubnino Office

Victorian bush fires in latest outbreaks-bu t also there was a particular, represent a disaster which very great loss of stock and property. the nation and the people can ill afford. Preliminary estimates indicate that Tbe Commonwealth is giving all possible approximately 500 homes, 1,000,000 aid and will continue to work with the sheep, 50,000 cattle, 1,000 horses, 1,000 State in giving the necessary relief. pigs, 200,000 poultry and thousands of miles of fencing were destroyed. It is too early to estimate the losses of stock and property in the most recent outbreak, but it is feared that there have been heavy losses of dairy cattle, dairy equipment and buildings and additional quantities of fencing, as well as many homes. As the result of Commonwealth and State cooperation, those who have requisitioned for fencing are being assisted. Many settlers have not yet sought materials, possibly because they have not been able to estimate their total requirements. Living allowances are being provided w*bere a settler's resources are limited and his income has ceased, and where his labour is required on his own property. The Minister for War Organization of Industry( Mr Dedman) is represented on the Victorian committee by a senior officer, and his department is taking action to ensure 1/he prompt supply of building materials to those who desire to rebuild. At the direction of the Minister for the Interior (Senator Collings), the Allied Works Council has arranged for tbe transfer of 200 Civil Constructional Corps workers for work in Victorian forest areas. These men are being made available for the production of fencing materials, and will work in co-operation witlh officers of the Victorian Forestry Commission.
