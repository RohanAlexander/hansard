I have this morning received through the Prime Minister official information thatThe Admiralty are released from the obligation against inter-communication with Stations fitted with other than Marconi apparatus. The restriction on His Majesty's ships on this Station from communicating with, or carrying out trials with, any other Station that may be worked by the Commonwealth Government and fitted with apparatus other than Marconi will therefore no longer apply. In these circumstances, tenders will be advertised in the Commonwealth Gazette of Saturday next, open to all systems of wireless telegraphy which comply with the Departmental regulations and tests.

In Committee (Consideration resumed from 19th October, vide page 4699): Clause 9Section sixty of the Principal Act is ref iealed, and the following section substituted in ieu thereof :"" 60 -(1. ) In time of war it shall be lawful for the Governor General, by proclamation, to call upon all persons liable to serve in the Citizen Forces to enlist and serve as prescribed. "" (2.) A proclamation under the last preceding section may call upon all the persons liable to service in any military district or sub-district, who are specified in any one or more of the classes hereunder set out, so to enlist, but so that the persons specified in any class in that district or sub-district shall not be called upon to enlist until all the persons in that district or sub-district who are specified in the preceding classes are or have been called upon. "" (3.) The classes referred to in this section are as follow :ClassI years and upwards but under thirty-five years, who are unmarried, or widowers without children; Class II years and upwards but under forty-five years, who are unmarried, or widowers without children; Class III eighteen years and upwards but under thirty-five; years, who are married, or widowers with children; Class IV years and upwards but under forty-five years, who are married, or widowers with children; and ClassV years and upwards but under sixty years. "" (4.) If the Parliament is not sitting at the date of the issue of the proclamation, it shall be summoned to meet within ten davs after that date."" move That the words "" In time of war it shall be l a w f u l "" be left out. If this amendment be made, the Governor General-which , of course, means the Executive Council-wil l have power by proclamation, at any time he may think fit, to call upon all persons liable to serve. My reason for proposing the amendment is that it is not difficult to conceive of a state of affairs arising in the Pacific that would more or less necessitate the Commonwealth Government devoting its lime and energy to the work of getting its Reserves ready before a declaration of war. Under the clause as it stands the power to call upon the whole of the Reserves in Australia could be brought into operation by the Government only after war had actually been declared, and when it might be too late to do the work effectively. I do not think that the Minister will object to this enlargement of the Ministerial power. It is a power that cannot be recklessly exercised because, as honourable members will see, there is a proviso to the proposed new section that if Parliament is not sitting at the date of the issue of the proclamation, it shall be summoned to meet within ten days after that date. It is impossible to conceive of a frivolous exercise of great powers like this, but, certainly, we require the power to prepare our untrained reserve forces before war is declared. The word "" war,"" according to the definition, means also "" danger of war''; but I do not like that phrase, because we may be hoping for peace, and if we can act only under a clause which implies the danger of war, we may, by what we do, hasten the very danger that we wish to avert. All men of the age of eighteen the words "" In time of war "" ? equally well, and be easier. I beg leave to move in that direction. All men of the age of Amendment amended accordingly. Minister of Defence) [2.52] -This proA l l men of the age of thirty-five vision is in the original Act, and no amendment is suggested in regard to it. No harm can be done by leaving the clause as it is, All men of the age of forty-five because ""time of war"" is a very wi(3e term, ancl includes any apprehension or danger of war. The effect of the honourable member's amendment will simply be to widen the power that the Government now (Wentworth) [2.47] I possess of calling out the Reserve Forces by proclamation. I see no reason for striking the words out. They are a limitation, perhaps a wise one, to which even a Government should be subject.",17,Statutor Y Rule No 83 Interpretation Position Of Postal Employes

I ask the honourable member not to press the amendment. inclined to think that the words "" In time of war"" are better out. If the Governor General can issue the proclamation only ih apprehension of war, its issue will be practically a declaration that he contemplates war. If we leave the power without limitation, the interests of Parliament will be safeof Parliament in some such words as, guarded by the fact that it must meet within ten days of the proclamation. It is very invidious for the Minister to have to make a public declaration that he apprehends war when negotiations for peace or settlement may be going on. out all the military. that his purpose was simply to arrange manoeuvres. tions could be given, if this limitation were removed from the clause, but if it be left in the only reason that, could be given would be that the Minister apprehended war. Mr J. H . CATTS (Cook) [2.57] I hope that in this case the Minister will stand by the words in the Bill. If we are to have compulsory service, it should be made as general as possible, and there should be as efficient training as possible; but every reasonable check should be imposed upon the Defence Department with regard to calling out the citizens for Avarlike purposes. This check was deliberately inserted in the original Act, and the Government, after consultation with the authorities, have re-embodied it in this Bill. It is not for the Government to show reasons why the words should be retained, but some powerful reasons ought to be shown, by those who advocate their excision, for the widening of the clause. heard anything which would incline me to vote for extending the Governor-Generals : power in this direction. It is not sufficient to say that it would be better to leave the Governor General a wider discretion. A limitation is placed on his discretion, and I hope the Minister will adhere to it. principal Act is widened by this Bill. Mr J. H . CATTS I shou/d rather limit than widen it. There are two objections to the clause as it stands. One is that it cannot be taken to say what it means, as it means something wider than is expressed by the words contained in it. The other is that, in cases of this kind, it is inadvisable to put a clause giving a power of proclamation in this form, because questions of law arise as to whether in .point of fact the time referred to in the Act has arrived. These proclamations have generally been referred to in Acts"" When in the opinion of the Governor General,"" so-and-so occurs. Then there is no question of law involved. As the clause stands, however, if a proclamation were issued, at a time when it was doubtful whether a state of war had arisen the exercise of the power to call out the men might be open -to question. I -believe that in actual life, Australians would be found to take no points of law in emergencies. "" In time of war,"" in this clause must mean in time of actual war, or when danger of war is seriously apprehended. If , under this system, we are to train and prepare men for years for the .shock of battle, it would surely be necessary to draw upon the civilian ranks before the actual fightingbegan. It would be a cruel thing to allow war to break out before the civilians were brought into line. I do not attach very much importance to the point, because I am satisfied that in time of real danger, a call by the Government would be readily responded to by the people of this country ; but nevertheless 1 feel that the language of the Bill is too narrow. It must really be taken, as some honourable members have suggested, to include a time when war is apprehended. Let us suppose that war is not actually declared, but is believed to be imminent. Could the Governor General wait and wait, leaving the citizens without any summons to enlist, and to make preparation for actual fighting? Could he wait until a I have not yet declaration of war was actually issued? It would not be possible. tion in the principal Act which affects the phrase "" In time of war."" includes ""danger of war."" -",18,Defence Bill

This leads me to say that it is most necessary, when we have before us a Bill amending a principal Act, that we should also have before us the Statute proposed to be amended.^ This is an instance in point. I am satisfied with the provision which the honourable member for Corio has brought under my notice. think that the amendment of the honourable member for Wentworth is worthy of consideration, and I intend to support it if he presses it to a division. As has been well pointed out, it would be foolish, and might, perhaps^ prove fatal to our national existence, to wait until war was actually declared before the Governor General called out all the forces. It will be very much better to alter the wording of the clause so as to permit of the forces being mobilized at any time. touch the ordinary forces, but only 'Jie reserves. clause applies to any person in the Commonwealth who has served in the forces, or is liable to serve. If words were inserted in this Bill, giving the Minister power to mobilize the forces, the fact that they were mobilized would not give other nations the idea that we had any apprehension of war. European nations frequently put in force mobilization schemes for the training of their troops. It is all very well to consider this matter in the light of things as they are to-day; but we may hereafter find ourselves in an entirely different situation. Therefore, I think that the Governor General should have power to mobilize the forces at any time. take a different view from that which has just been expressed. When we discussed the principal Act some years ago, there was a very strong feeling against universal service. I was one of those who, at thattime, entertained an opinion against compulsory service, and expressed it very strongly. But I must confess that reading, thought, and the interchange of ideas have changed my view in that regard. a change of the honourable member's environment. is altogether wrong, because my view on this subject was altered before the Fusion was thought of. changed.' even public opinion is with us entirely on this question. But, in the interests of peace, and of the destruction of that military spirit which many of us desire to see eradicated, I have come to the position which I now maintain. But, nevertheless, I do not share the view of the honourable member for Wentworth as to the clause under discussion, and hope that the Government will stand by it. I think that we should be at the last resort before putting into force the compulsory provisions of our defence legislation. A departure has been made in the direction of extending the power given to the Governor General in the Bill before us. Section 60 of the principal Act provides that in time of war it shall be lawful for the Governor General to do certain things,, the occasion being first communicated to Parliament. That is to say, before the forces can be called out, even in time of emergency, Parliament must be consulted. Perhaps the Minister will explain why the Bill before us proposes to change that provision. Surely no one desires that persons up to the age of sixty years should be called out, except in time of grave emergency. If we are to widen the clause in the direction suggested by the honourable member for Wentworth, I do not know what may happen if we have a "" scare "" Government in power. want the Reserves called out every week for exercise. on the kind of Government we had whether the Reserves were called out or not. Mr J. H . CATTS -Some people went nearly mad about the Dreadnought scare. not know what would have happened if the present Ministry had been in office at that time. If a timid Government held office when an European war was feared, all those liable to serve up to sixty years of age might be called out, even though there was very little risk of Australia being involved.

But before that was decided upon, Parliament ought to be consulted. be consulted. ing to giving the Minister the power implied in the words to which reference has been made, but I think we should have an explanation as to why the words in thteJ principal Act, to which I have alluded, have been omitted. am very glad that the honourable member for Wentworth has brought up this matter, because it is of considerable importance. I support the proposal to omit the words "" In time of war."" The Governor General in Council should have a larger power. It might be necessary to call oiit all persons liable to serve in the Citizen Forces a month or two months before the declaration of war, for the purpose of mobilization. Sub-clause 2 of the proposed new section provides for the manner of calling out, while sub-clause 3 declares the order in which the various classes are to be called out. out at once. out in the. Order provided for in sub-clause 3. abouts would not be called out until the ' other classes had preceded them, and probably would not be needed at all. If Parliament is not sitting at the time of the issue of the proclamation, it must be summoned to meet within ten days of that date. be a Parliament in existence nt the time, and it would be dangerous to require the Governor General in Council to wait until one could be called together. I hope that the Committee will support the honourable member for Wentworth, and that the Minister, after hearing the arguments which have been advanced in support of his proposition, will agree to the omission of the words "" In time of war."" A war might arise externally or internally, and the Governor General should have power in' time of national danger to use his discretion for the protection of the country. my opinion, the amendment is a necessary one. If the words "" In time of war "" are If there not omitted, the Government will be prevented from calling out men for service when they may be needed. The honourable member for Corio is wrong in saying that "" Time of war "" means a time when there is invasion or apprehension of invasion. This is the definition of the principal ActAny time during which a state of war actually exists, and includes the time between the issue of a proclamation of the existence of war, or of danger thereof, and the issue of a proclamation declaring that the wai or danger thereof, declared in the prior proclamation, no longer exists. I agree with the right honourable member for East Sydney and others, that it may be necessary to call out the forces a considerable time before war is declared. To w ait r until the actual declaration of war would be suicidal. country like Australia. be thought, that a Government would call out men for active service unless it had good ground for apprehending danger of war. Should a Ministry misuse its power in this respect, it would not continue to live.for forty-eight hours.

We must endeavour to secure tion of this kind elsewhere; certainly not in Great Britain, where, perhaps, the common law applies. words "" In time of war"" will give the Government more power. ing listened to the arguments, if they can be so termed, in favour of the amendment, I see no justification for striking out the words referred to. If an attack on Australia were anticipated, the Military Forces could be got ready as quickly as possible to repel it. What more is wanted? Onone occasion a Victorian Government was so scared that it called out the military to prevent the holding of a public meeting. I am afraid that, occasionally, similar scares may be created, perhaps, by cable news, and an excited populace may demand tbe calling out of the Reserves, thus, perhaps, precipitating what we would prevent. War is a thing of which it is to be hoped we shall have no experience. But sometimes communities, like individuals, get excited, and rush into hostilities without really understanding how their differences of opinion arose, behaving in the end like a bull when a red rag is waved in front of it. The limitation which it is proposed to omit is a necessary one,, because we desire that our forces shall be called out only when there is danger or apprehension of war. Ordinarily mobilization may be done at any time. For it, a proclamation is unnecessary. Australia, thanks to its isolation, cannot be attacked suddenly, like European countries, and, I trust, will be careful to avoid provoking attacks. If war threatened, the Reserves could be called out at once. What more is needed? It has been said that time'must be allowed for drilling the menwho are called out; but it is to be hoped that they will already have learnt their drill. Up to the present only a very small proportion of our population has had a military training of any kind. We must be content to do in this matter as other nations, have done. They have sometimes had to fight with very inefficiently trained men. When I was in the Volunteer Forces our drill instructor used to tell us of the way in which recruiting for the Crimean war was carried on. Men, after being drilled for three days, were sent into the trenches before Sebastopol, and gave a good account of themselves. It is not right, however, save in time of great emergency, that men should be sent out without being properly efficiency in the form provided by the Bill. It is only in the last resort that the Reserves The omission of the would be called out, and honourable members, must not forget that this proposed new section applies only to the calling out of reserves. I take it that the military authorities would not dream of asking the Governor General to call out the Reserves except in a case of great emergency. The cost of keeping a large body of men in the field is veryj great. Wars are often determined by questions offinance,and it would be unwise for a country to drain its resources by needlessly bringing into the field a great army of men, many of whom were the least efficient of its forces. I am opposed to the amendment. Some honourable members have apparentlv failed to understand the grounds on which I have taken this action. In the definition section of the principal Act it is provided that""Time of war""-Means any time during which a state of war actually exists, andincludes the time between the issue of a proclamation of the existence of war or of danger thereof, and the issue of a proclamation declaring that the war or danger thereof, declared in the prior proclamation, no longer exists. clamations. posed new section a proclamation is to issue for the calling out of troops, so that in calling out the untrained reserves we have to consider that there actually exists a danger of war. What would be the position of the Minister in such a contingency as I now propose to state. troops I should issue a proclamation. gards the matter as very simple; but let us assume that there is some grave Imperial emergency. it were necessary, I should not issue a proclamation. Imperial authorities represented to the Australian Government that it would be highly disadvantageous to Imperial interests for the Governor General to issue a proclamation that "" a danger of war"" existed, my honourable friend, if he were Minister of Defence, would not start training the reserve manhood of Australia.",21,Defence Bill

We are dealing now, not with the Citizen Forces of Australia, who are presumed to be trained when the time of war arises, but with the Reserves. This Bill does not aim at the training of the whole of the adult manhood of Australia. It aims at the training of a sufficient number from year to year to provide for the maintenance of a full fighting force for anti-raid purposes, but vast numbers will be left untouched. lates to the excess-to those over the ages fixed for compulsory training. the Minister of Defence, when an Imperial crisis arises, shall be able to say-""We want to train our reserves. We do not say that their training has reference to any crisis; but we do not want to be subject to the dictation of the Home Government, who may say to us ' Considerations of Imperial diplomacy demand that you should not issue a proclamation that there is * danger of war.' Train the men, but do not say why you are doing so.' "" member propose by this means to have all adult males trained? have all our adult manhood trained. My honourable friend, like others, thinks that we are as capable of settling a future contingency as would be the Parliament and Government of that time. If is important, however, for us to foresee all possible conne tingencies. We should not endeavour to leg-rope future Parliaments; but that is what the proposed new section, as it stands, would do. I can foresee great difficulties arising if we take power to raise these levies only by the issue of a proclamation of war or danger of war. In time of emergency the Imperial Government might endeavour, by the exercise of diplomacy, to delay the actual declaration of war. The arts of diplomacy might be used to endeavour to secure the sympathy of neutral powers, and those neutral powers would regard with irritation, if not hostility, the calling out of the whole of the forces of Australia under a proclamation which expressly stated that there was danger of war. On the other hand, they would no more object to our beginning to train our reserves without the issue of such a proclamation, than they would object to their neighbours or themselves periodically doing so in times of peace. I fail to see why the Minister should not agree to the excision of these words. My desire is simply to safeguard the future. Australia is not what she has been. She has been in the position of a spoilt child-to o puny, too insignificant, for the rest of the world to care what she did. But in the future, if we are to have a truly efficient and comprehensive defence schemer, she will be a power, within the British power,"" well worth considering. If that is so we shall have to display all the discretion of a growing nation. No power of which I know would declare, by proclamation, on the eve of hostilities, which she did not wish to hasten, that there was danger of war. If it did so, it would immediately alienate the sympathies of the rest of the civilized world. It would be looked upon as a quarrelsome, aggressive power, just as Europe is inclined to regard the Balkan principalities when they suddenly issue proclamations, and push on with their armaments. There may come a time when we shall be up against the teeming millions of the East, and may require to train the whole of our reserves. But because the Minister and the Parliament of to-day, by the honourable the use of the words which I propose to omit, had limited future Governments, we should not be able discreetly to make due preparations to meet that contingency. I appeal to the Minister and the Committee not to handicap the future actions of this Democracy. y ) [3-35]-A good case has been made out for the omission of these wordsIn the principal Act reference is made not only to "" Time of war,"" but also "" War,"" and we have there the following definition""War""-Means any invasion or apprehended invasion of, or attack or apprehended attack on, the Commonwealth or any Territory under the control of the Commonwealth by an enemy or armed force.

Circumstances such as have been foreshadowed, to some extent, might arise far from our own shores, which would necessitate the manhood of the Empire being made ready as quickly as possible to meet a threatened danger. "" The Minister should have power, subject to the control of Parliament, as provided in the proposed amendment, to meet that gravest of all dangersa danger affecting not only Australia, but the Empire-by calling out the reserves of the manhood of the Commonwealth. Section 60 of the principal Act provides thatIn time of war it shall be lawful for the Governor General (the occasion being first communicated to the Parliament, if the Farliament be then sitting, or notified by proclamation if the Parliament be not then sitting), by proclamation, to call upon persons liable to serve in the militia forces to enlist in the militia forces. . There we have a safeguard. If Parliament were sitting it would have to approve first of all of the issue of the proclamation, and I would prefer that provision rather than the proposed new section as it stands. It is here provided that if Parliament is not sitting at the date of the issue of the proclamation, it shall be summoned to meet within ten days of that date, but this Bill does not say, as the original Act does, that Parliament, if sitting, shall .be afforded an opportunity to approve of the proclamation before it is issued. That is the difference. I should like to see the words "" In time of war"" struck out, but with the additional safeguard that Parliament, if sitting, shall approve of the proclamation. The Minister might promise to consider the matter, and recommit thc clause later if the honourable member for Wentworth, who moved the amendment, desires. He might consider whether it is not desirable to give a power which might be very necessary in the greatest of all emergencies, and at the same time to afford to Parliament that proper security which it should have in all cases. emergencies "" surely could not arise in ten days. arise in a moment. It might suddenly become evident to all parts of the Empire that every man would have to be got together and prepared to meet an emergencv that affected the very existence of the Empire. means either an actual invasion of Australia, or an apprehended invasion, but there is something of Imperial concern outside that. The honourable member for North Sydney and the honourable member for Wentworth argue very fairly that it is' possible to conceive of a difficulty arising in certain circumstances, but I do not think it is at all likely to arise. On the other hand, if the words, ' In time of war '' are left out, we 1 shall simply give the Government power at any time, and for any purpose they choose, to call out the Reserves, subject, of course, to the fact that Parliament would have to be called together within ten days. J member think that any Government would exercise that power improperly? conceive circumstances in which it would be done. Our Defence Forces are to be created for the defence of this country in time of war, and we ought not to place it in the power of any Government to call out the whole of the Reserves in time of peace. The troops in training will be at their command at any time. give the Reserve Forces a little training? difficulty about that in practice. There is no necessity to remove the safeguard provided in the original Act simply for the purpose of giving the Reserves training. cannot be called out for active service except by proclamation. that proclamation can be issued at any time. It is not necessary in the case of -the ordinary troops to wait until a time of war exists. The amendment would give the Government a similar power in regard to the Reserves. afraid of internecine war? ticularly afraid of anything, nor do I think there is much danger of the inhabitants of Australia being called out for military service to put down internecine strife. At the same time we are asked to extend the original Act. I hope the Minister will stick to his Bill. This provision was inserted deliberately in order to show the people that, although we intend, to provide for Australian defence, we do not want to War, according to our definition, take aggressive action.

General gives a concrete instance of the clanger of striking out the words "" In time of war."" necessary to go into history to find the reason for '' subterfuge '' provisions of this sort, because that is all they originally were. A similar section will be found in the Canadian Act, and in Canada one is generally told that there is universal service, because there every man in the population is liable to be called out. This is really a survival of the old power which used to exist in Britain in feudal times, when every acre of -land could be levied upon to pay its share of military service. As a consequence the Militia Act of England, although carried on by a system of balloting, still preserves the power to call out every male in the population. Act was passed the proviso-""In time of war""-wa s put in rather with the object of getting away from the universal service idea, to which a good many objected at the time. I do not think that in Germany or France or other places where conscrip tion obtains, power is given to call out the population en masse up to the age of sixty years, to the full extent that this proposed new section proposes. It was recognised in Australia that it is the duty of every man in a democratic community to defend his country, but it was not intended that every man should be liable to be called out except in time of real danger. There is, under an existing organization, first the field force, which provides the expeditionary force that does the work and meets the first attack; then there are garrison troops, and after them you have the whole male population to depend upon. In any case this discussion is useless, because Part IV. of the original Act has the heading "" Liability to serve in the Citizen Forces in time of war."" govern the whole of the sections to which they relate. Eveni f the words "" In time of war "" are left out of this proposed new section, they will still prevail through being in the cross-heading of this part of the original Act. amended consequentially. to amend a good many other sections of that Act. a general definition than alter a particular section. ber for Wentworth really proposes that the whole population shall be liable to be called out at any time, I do not think that would do much good.

I should also say that the military authorities would be the last to"" want to call out the untrained"" men, except in the last resort.

The present Ministry themselves have recognised that they have not faith in Governments, because they have provided for Parliament to be called together in the event of a proclamation being issued. Why is Parliament to be called together? Simply because the Ministry cannot trust any future Government to run the affairs of the Commonwealth in time of danger. member think that Parliament would approve of calling out the Reserves if there was no danger? ber prepared to go to his constituents and tell them that he has voted for a Bill imposing conscription on this country? He denounces the present Government, and yet he proposes to give them this enormous I will go for manhood serpower. The more I look into the subject the more I am convinced that the safeguard laid down in the principal Act is a wise one. The Reserves should only be called out when there is a serious apprehension of war. If we are to leave it to the discretion of a Government to do or not to do a thing, why do we want an Act of Parliament at all? I am astonished at the honourable member for Wentworth makI f the Parliament of the ing this insidious attempt to bring in conscription. I was not aware that he favoured that policy. Who is going to carry on the industries of the country if all males between fourteen and sixty years of age"" are to be called out to serve in the Army? It looks as if some of us older chaps would have to run the industries of Australia. But I am sure that the honourable member for Wentworth does not mean that, and hence I fear that he has not given sufficient consideration to his own proposal. the clause under consideration is to be of value or it is not. If it is to be'of value, the power conltained in it ought to be capable of being exercised in time to give practical effect to it. As has been pointed out, if the Reserves are only to be called out after a state of war has actually been created, or after a proclamation of war or Without any of danger of war has been issued, their services may be availed of rather late in the day. A proclamation of war can only be issued by the Imperial Government. And no Australian Government would think of issuing a proclamation of danger without consulting the Imperial Government. Consequently, if the proclamation calling out the Reserves is only to be issued after an outbreak of war, the forces so mobilized may be brought into the field too late to be of effective value. The sugestion that the striking out of the words to which the honourable member for Wentworth objects would give the Government of the day power to enforce conscription at any time, is too wild to be considered. No Government would do such a thing.

There may be good reason for requiring that the proclamation shall state that there is, in the opinion of the Government, danger of war, and I fail to see that the use of such an expression might have such an irritating effect on a foreign nation as to precipitate hostilities. Our aim is tb create an effective force for the defence of our country, in the hope that our preparation will prevent attacks upon us.

It is simply playing at the game, to train junior cadets in the use of miniature rifles. In Victoria at the present time, thousands nf boys between the ages of twelve and fourteen years are using small rifles other than those known as "" miniitures,"" and are becoming expert marksmen. The use of such rifles ought to be preserved to them. They are doing good work under the direction of school teachers, and no heavy expense is incurred in connection with'lheir instruction. allowed to practice with small rifles at Youngsters of less than fourteen years of age are capable of becoming good shots. All over the country, boys of ten years of age, and even younger, are to be found handling rifles. tunately, do occur occasionally; but for the most part, they take place in connection with the use of pea rifles. The training obtained by firing with ""miniature rifles at miniature targets, is much like that obtained by practice at shooting galleries; and I hope that the Minister will see his way clear to make the amendment which I suggest. Minister of Defence) [4.32]--The honourable member's proposal would mean, to begin with, an expenditure of £80,000 per annum, in providing junior cadets with rifles of the class of which he speaks. I do not think it is necessary to so equip them. The age of fourteen years is early enough for them to commence to carry rifles of use; and we propose that cadets, on reaching that age, shall be armed, say, with Westley-Richards rifles, which will carry up to 500 and 600 yards on an open range. That being so, these boys will be subjected to only a temporary deprivation. I recognise the sentiment attaching to this question. I remember, when one of my own boys, who was then twelve years of age, returned home with a rifle and a uniformwhich I had had to purchase for himand thought that he was three times twelve; but, after all, I think fourteen years of age is early enough at which to clothe the ""cadets with the actual habiliments of war. If they, get a thorough physical setting up between the age of twelve and fourteen 'years, they will be the better able to carry' arms. amendment. The question of expense determines the matter. Cadets were equipped withordinary rifles, they would have to wear uniforms, which would cost about £ 1 per annum per boy; and the total bill would amount to about ,£120,000 or £130,000 a year. I doubt the utilityof incurring that expense; although I appreciate the sentiment underlying the proposal. If I could encourage it I should be glad to do so. Buti f these lads obtain a physical setting up, and are miniature ranges, they will be able to pre-' pare themselves for the time when they will have to seriously take up the work. to know whether, under the clause as it stands, the use of Morris tubes by junior cadets attending school will be done away with ? is that their use should be continued. My disposition is to let the schools take charge of this, as far as they are able to do so. provide the schools with a certain number of rifles to enable the Junior Cadets to be trained in shooting and sighting as at present with the Morris tube? with-the school organizations as far as we can. taken root in the western portion of Queensland within the last two years, and boys there are very anxious to become efficient. In many towns, the school Committees have purchased Morris tubes and targets, and the Department has provided the boys with miniature rifles. Some of the lads on leaving school have joined the rifle clubs, and as the result of their earlv training have become efficient shots.. I do not desire that this enthusiasm on the part of the school boys shall be scotched. The people of the western portions of Queensland and New South Wales are more averse to a military system than are the people of any other part of the Commonwealth."" The sight of a uniform used to have very much the same effect on many people in Western Queensland that a red rag has on a bull. That was the position prior to Federation.

I do not need to be advised as to the seriousness of the problem regarding the horsing of the Field Artillery. At present we spend about £5,000 per annum on horses, mostly unsuitable. I am -told that there is a great .deal of fun at many of the encampments, arising out of the unsuitability of the horses. The moment I have time to go into the matter seriously I shall do so. 1 have read the report to which my friend the honourable member fbr Hindmarsh has referred. He has done good service in ventilating the subject. I am not prepared to say that the scheme formulated in the report is the best possible one. I hope that my honourable friend will not shut his mind to any other scheme that may be formulated. I shall go into the matter thoroughly, recognising as I do that we can have no efficient Field Artillery unless we own our own horses. I may also inform the Committee that the reason of striking out the word "" Garrison"" in. section 31 bf the principal Act is that we intend to create a small permanent section of the Field Artillery. It will be one of the duties of the section to look after the Field Artillery horses. Of course they will have many other things to do, but this will be one of their main duties.

A few clays ago a question was raised as to the need for a rifle range at Junee, when the Minister stated that the price asked for the land desired was prohibitive. A large number of new rifle ranges will be required under this Bill. Can land be entered upon and used for such purposes under this provision ? In South Australia we had for many years a rifle range which was used by a club with whicli I was connected. It was required only for a few hours per week, and its use as a rifle range did not interfere with the ordinary purposes for which it was employed, except on Saturday afternoons. As many rifle ranges will be necessary and as it is often difficult to purchase land except af enormous prices, it will be a good thing to know whether the clause covers such purposes. hear the Minister say so. Clause agreed to. Clause 14 agreed to. served that clause 15 includes the whole of the proposed new sections from 125 to 146, occupying three pages of the Bill. I do not intend, therefore, to put the clause as a whole, but to put each of the proposed new sections separately.

The tendency is nowadays to have school children medically inspected, and it would be better that that instruction should take place at the age of ten than at twelve. If then a child were found to be unable to take part in physical exercises he could be exempted. But the sooner we find out whether children are physically fit to be trained the better; and the sooner we commence to train those who are found to be fit the more useful as members of the Defence Forces they are likely to be. These children are not to be called upon to -do any hard work. It is, I understand, the desire of the Minister that the system of physical training adopted in schools shall be on a uniform scientific basis. I should like to see the method adopted in Queensland followed throughout the Commonwealth. children are trained in a manner that does not lead to physical exhaustion, and those children who have physical defects are not likely to be injured by the training which they receive. Without elaborating the point further, I ask the Minister to accept my amendment, which is in conformity with the proposal favoured by the Fisher Government, who considered that we ought to have in schools a different system of training than has obtained in the past. We looked into the Swedish system, and found that its results had been simply admirable. The Jwork in Queensland is being done under the Swedish system today. teachers, and I . take it that the Minister, of Defence will see that the teachers who are to give physical training under this Bill will also be properly trained. [5.8] I should like to know whether under this Bill the Defence Department will be able to keep ah eye on the children referred to in paragraph a of proposed new section 125-that is, children between twelve and fourteen years of age, who are to be trained in the Junior Cadets? I point out that in one State of the 'Commonwealth at least a considerable number of children between twerve and fourteen years of age do not go to school. Iri South Australia a child sometimes gets an exemption certificate at the age of ten, and it is by no means uncommon for certificates to be given at the age of eleven. The law provides that a child may, on receiving a certificate, or attaining the age of thirteen, leave school. is fourteen; and even if a child passes the necessary examination he is not allowed to receive the certificate until he is over -twelve years of age. in South Australia is thirteen, but a child having received a certificate, there is no power to compel his parents to send him to school any longer. I am aware that the practice of the Education Department is to withhold certificates in order to keep the children at school over the age of ten, but there is no legal power to compel their attendance. A good many school teachers and inspectors have spoken to me on fhis subject. They say that they lose sight of a considerable proportion of the children, and apparently no provision is made which will enable the military authorities to keep In lhat State an eye on them, and compel them to submit, to training after they have left school. I hope that the Minister will look into the matter. desire to draw the attention of the Minister to the matter referred to by the honourable member for Wakefield. Many boys pass thc sixth standard and leave school before reaching the age of twelve years, and in their case there must be an interval during which neither the educational nor the defence authorities will have oversight of them. There they have properly trained son why boys should join the Cadet Force at the age of ten years. hardly capable of doing more than the exercises which form part of the ordinary school drill. boys from ten to thirteen years of age ought to do. should do more until they are, at least, twelve years old, when the provisions of this measure will apply to them. Having taken considerable interest in the cadet movement for many years, I am strongly of the opinion that boys should not join the cadets at an earlier age than twelve years. Perhaps the Minister will let us know what is in his mind regarding this question. How is he going to provide for the training of the boy who leaves school before he is twelve years old?

Some thousands of copies of its report, which is a most useful one, were printed and distributed throughout the States, and I am surprised to find that I have not laid one on the table. In effect, the recommendation was that there should be a standardization of physical culture for school children and cadets. It was suggested that a director of physical training should be appointed to prepare a manual which would establish a standard for the whole Commonwealth, and that the actual training of the children and young cadets should be left to the school authorities. I suggest to the mover of the amendment that, up to the age of twelve years, he might very well leave the physical training of boys to the school authorities, who, in most cases, are to-day doing it very well. After a boy has reached the age of twelve, he will come under the control of the military authorities, and will learn, perhaps, a little more drill than he is taught while under the instruction of his school teachers between the ares of ten and twelve. defects may be discovered and rectified which, at twelve years, would have become chronic.

Surely, if medical examination is necessary in regard to adults, it is still more necessary in regard to children, and the earlier we begin to inspect them, the cheaper it will be in the end. It would be an education to many honourable members to read Sir John Gorst's work on The CHldren of the Nation. In the reports of the medical examinations held in New South Wales, it is shown that the percentage of children suffering from defects of the eye, ear, nose or throat in Australia does not differ very materially from the percentage in the Old Country. The sooner we commence this work the better. I have not moved the amendment with the mere object of endeavouring to provide something different from that which the Minister of Defence desires; I believe that the honourable gentleman has in view the same object as I have-that he desires that we shall obtain as many strong, healthy cadets as possible-and I am sorrv that he is not prepared to accept my proposal. I fail to see why it should be easier to ascertain that a child is fit for physical training at the age of ten years than it is at the age of twelve. I should say that a boy of ten would be just as liable to diseases of the eye, ear, nose or throat as a boy of twelve would be. young, I was not immune from the nose and throat troubles, which are very prevalent amongst children, even under the age of ten years, but in my case they were removed. A very considerable proportion of children under the age of two years are subject to such troubles.

I should like to see This applies even in money on rifles that cannot be utilized for war purposes. If we obtain a large number of rifles to be carried by boys, which cannot be used in war time, the defence vote will be debited with a large sum with which it ought not to be debited. with which to train the boys. have been on safer ground if he had proposed to divide into two classes the Senior Cadets dealt with in paragraph b. The average Australian boy of sixteen is quite capable of carrying a regulation rifle, and every such boy should be allowed the use of one for training purposes. If that were done, we should effect a considerable saving. distinctly opposed to this amendment, and am convinced that this portion of the Bill will work out very inequitably in regard to the lads who leave school, unless we insert a special provision to meet their case. Paragraph a of proposed new section 125, provides that boys of from twelve years to fourteen years of age shall be liable to be trained in the Junior Cadets, and at a later stage I propose to move an amendment providing that the names of all lads between those ages who leave school shall be reported to and registered by the Defence Department. That would enable the DeWhenI was partment to obtain some control of lads who had left school, and would make them feel that they owed some responsibilty to the Defence Department, even if they owed none to the schools. speaking to the motion for the second reading of this Bill, I drew attention to what I termed one of its structural defects: the absence of adequate provision in respect of boys who leave school before reaching the age of fourteen years. The question has been again dealt with this afternoon by the COOK -His proposal honourable member for Wakefield and the honourable member for Kooyong. Apparently, however, the defect is to be left unremedied until another conference of educational experts shall have considered the point.

219,Mr Roberts (Adelaide) [5.33],"I namendments in the direction of either reducing the age at which we shall commence to train boys as cadets, or of increasing the age at which we shall cease to train them in that way. It was my intention to move an amendment to make the training applicable to lads of less than twelve years of age, and to provide for a more effective separation than this new provision will insure, for the reason that we cannot possibly retain control over a very large proportion of lads between the ages of thirteen and fourteen years without providing additional machinery and instructors of two separate classes, and also because I think it would be a mistake to brigade boys of fourteen with youths of eighteen years of age. Possibly the conference of educational experts which is to meet may express an opinion on that phase of the question, but as one who has had some experience in handling both boys and men ashore and afloat I am confident that it will be a great mistake to brigade lads of fourteen with youths of eighteen. this Bill that will compel us to do that. It may be that what the honourable member says is correct. If it is the administration will find it out. not necessarily compelled under the Bill to brigade boys of fourteen with youths of eighteen. The Minister may arrange that lads of fourteen shall be grouped in separate regiments, and shall be pitted in friendly rivalry against regiments consisting of lads of fifteen years of age and so forth. But under the Bill as it stands, in the absence of a great deal of administrative detail, we shall have all senior cadets between fourteen and eighteen years of age brigaded together; and unless special machinery is provided, we shall lose sight of all the boys who leave school before reaching the age of fourteen years. Apparently the Minister's desire is to leave the younger lads to the schools as far as possible, but there is no provision for drilling in any way a very large proportion of our boys. I have spoken to several educational authorities since I addressed myself to the motion for the second reading of the Bill, and have been informed by them that in all the States a very large proportion of boys leave school at the age of thirteen years. An immense amount of administrative work will be necessary to follow up all thore lads. [171]2 40 per cent, of our boys leave school on reaching the age of thirteen years. me that the proportion is much larger. twelve years. the standard certificates, which exempt children from the compulsory attendance piovisions of the Education Act are being obtained by boys of from ten to twelve years of age. As soon as they receive such certificates many of them leave school. Then again there are others who on reaching the age of thirteen years leave school at once, and unfortunately for them and for the Commonwealth no educational establishment sees any more of them. We must, however, take such boys into consideration in connection with the machinery of this Bill. As it stands, the Bill makes no provision for them. We should be* doing much better work if we took the boys in hand at the age of ten years, leaving the entirely elementary work to the schools and devoting to it much less time than at present. Even if we did that, however, we should lose a small proportion of the boys. Boys of from thirteen to sixteen years should be trained as cadets and might very well be brigaded together with less expenditure and trouble than would be involved under ' this proposal. They sliould be supplied with miniature rifles, but certain!v not with uniforms. Then again it would be much hetter to brigade senior cadets of from sixteen to nineteen years of age together. Youths over nineteen years of age should be drafted into the Militia for a. period of years. It will not be long before some Ministry-eve n if the present one does not -wil l bring down an amending Bill to provide that there shall be more than the two trainings for youths between the ages of eighteen and twenty years, and to do awav with the militia and volunteer svstems as at present existing. From the senior cadet corps we should gradually draft the youths into the Militia for a period of vears and then draft them into reserves, of which we should have some knowledge and over which we should have some control, for a further period. So far as the first fighting line is concerned we shall not need the voung men until they are twenty-three or twentv-four years of ase. The effect of the Bill is that we shall lose sight of bovs at the very age that we should have them",35,Kelly S Amendment Put

The Minister seems to be unprepared to accept any amendment. frame of mind. taken, but even if the Minister does take that stand I shall not cavil at it. I suggest that, if no amendment is accepted, the point I have raised should be put prominently before the conference of educational experts, who may be able to devise a plan which will find favour with the Minister. suggest an improvement of the measure in that direction, I shall be happy to meet him, because I have no other object than to provide for an effective defence force, and to insure that all males physically fit shall be trained to be decent defenders of their own country. scarcely agree with the view that medical inspection of all children should be undertaken before they are trained. The training of schoolboys will be valuable, not only to make them soldiers, but because of the effect of discipline upon character. Irre-spective of physical defects, therefore, we should, if possible, include the whole of the boys in the training while at school. The Minister should consider if it is practicable to reduce the minimum age from twelve to eleven, and allow perhaps three years junior cadet training instead of two. A large percentage of the boys leave school at thirteen, and it will be difficult to handle them at from thirteen to fourteen. I hope the Minister will see that the Junior Cadets are liberally supplied with miniature rifles and rifle ranges. A large amount of good can be done in that way at a very small cost. successfully in Europe, and has the hearty endorsement of many naval and military authorities in Great Britain, including^ Lord Roberts. [5.44] -The Minister of Defence might suggest to the conference of educational experts when it meets the advisableness of compelling boys who have left school before fourteen years of age to attend school at certain periods for junior cadet training. That would be a great deal more economical than to call upon the military officers of the Commonwealth to supply the instruction required to meet that gap in the Bill. I suggest this more particularly because the time is not far distant when the Education Acts will be amended in the direction of compelling the attendance of children at school, at all events up to thirteen, if not up to fourteen. Educational experts regard as a great evil the possibility of boys of tender years drifting away from school, even though they may have received the compulsory certificate. I should like to learn from the Minister whether boys attending private schools, secondary schools, and colleges are to be exempt from the provisions of the Bill in regard to camp life. There are reasons If later on the Minister can why they should be exempt, so long as the authorities of the schools are willing to submit them to any examination approved by the Defence Department, and they turn out to be thoroughly efficient-especiall y when that efficiency is gained without a penny of cost to the Government. It is one of the duties of the principals of such schools to look after the home life of boys committed to their charge, but they cannot properly fulfil their duties in that regard if the boysgo into camp away from the schools. until the age of eighteen. provision in the Bill that, in connection with drills, the pupils shall be required to be withdrawn from the colleges, and, therefore, from the control of the colleges. Is that imperative, and is there any reason why it should lie? I have heard no convincing arguments to lead me to take exception to the provisions of the Bill on this point. Those who advocate the extension of the term of service may be right, but I presume that the Minister, in fixing the ages, took care Similar work is being carried on to fortify himself with the best expert opinion upon the .subject. I have never professed to have more than a limited theoretical knowledge of military matters', although probably that is as valuable to me as the dangerous "" little learning "" of some people who have-taken merely a dilettante part in volunteer movements. I have, however, an important matter to bring before the Minister of Defence. Disappointment has been expressed at meetings in my constituency that junior cadets under four-",36,Kelly S Amendment Put

232,Mr Bruce Smith (Parkes) [5.48].,"teen are to lose some of the privileges they have hitherto enjoyed. I believe that boys known as junior cadets have been allowed . hitherto to wear uniforms when between the ages of ten and fourteen, but that fourteen is now to be the minimum age at which boys can become cadets and be supplied with rifles and uniforms by the Government. At a rather important meeting in my constituency, doubt was expressed as to the wisdom of disallowing the use of the uniform under the age of fourteen. I spoke to the Minister about the matter, and he explained that, although boys under fourteen had hitherto been allowed to wear uniform, it had been supplied' at their own expense. They had also been allowed to use a substitute for a gun, and underwent extensive drill. further understood from the Minister that in future it was not intended to allow boys under wear uniform, even if supplied by themselves, nor to have a gun or substitute for a gun. I sent the Minister's explanation to one of my constituents, who takes' great interest in the question, and he replied that my letter only confirmed the fears of those interested, because they were' not so much concerned about the boys who were twelve to-day, and who would be fourteen when the new Act came into operation, as about the (boys who wouLd be twelve after the initiation of the system. I had explained to him, and to the citizens whose views he expressed, that the BiU would not come into operation until July, 1911, and lhat boys who were twelve to-day would be fourteen then. Headded, in his letter, that he understood that all public schoolboys, from infants upwards, received a course of physical drill, which it was almost impossible to improve, and that to have worn the uniform before they left school was an incentive to boys to' continue to do so by joining the Senior Cadets. Otherwise, he said, a great number would not take the trouble, having missedthe enjoyment of wearing the uniform and of taking part in the drill. The substance of the letter seems to be that many boys will be discouraged from joining the Senior Cadets through not being allowed to wear a uniform or carry a substitute for a gun before they are fourteen vears of age. axiom in military matters that the uniform is a great attraction, and that the more elaborate it is the greater the attraction it exerts. If cadets under fourteen are not to be allowed to wear uniforms, even if they buy them for themselves, is a scout to be allowed to wear a uniform? Mi. REID -The boys get round that regulation by joining the scouts. who is a scout. his uniform, and he is going to wear it, too. wear a khaki jacket, with a badge to show their regiment, and carry a knapsack and a sort of imitation gun consisting of a broom stick. I not forget the knife ! are aids to the imagination. I have had to fourteen to pay for the equipment of a scout, and know that the cost is trifling. But the things worn, and the fascination they afford, i l lustrate some characteristics in our Australian human nature. The little khaki jacket, the knife, the broom stick, and the knapsack, seem to hold some charm for the boys. The point is that if the smaller boys, as scouts, are to be allowed to wear uniforms paid for by their parents, why should not the small boys who are not fourteen years of age be allowed to wear their own uniforms as junior cadets? Why should they not also be allowed to carrya small substitute for a rifle ? I am not advocating the use of a real gun by boys under fourteen, because, having shot myself as a boy, on one occasion, I know that small boys ought not to be intrusted with firearms. The age of fourteen is -possibly a fair minimum for the introduction of genuine rifles. But I believe that a substitute for a gun helps the imagination, and enables the boys to do exercises which they will hereafter have to do with real weapons. I should like the Minister to consider whether there is any real objection ""to the privilege that is now extended to the scouts-and which the right honourable member for East Sydney seems determined to insist upon in the case of his own boy, whether the wearing of the uniform is against the law dr not-bein g extended to junior cadets under fourI accept it as an teen years of age, so long as the uniform is paid for by the parents of the boy ?

I believe that the whole fit-out of a scout does not cost more than 7s. 6d., including the jacket, the knife, the knapsack, the hat, and the broomstick. The substitute for a gun would not cost more than sixpence. The movement which Major-General Baden-Powell started in England, and which has extended throughout the Empire, is now so extensive that an enormous industry has sprung up in the manufacture of the little khaki suits and other accessories of a boy scout. There is a very widespread feeling that it is unwise to deprive junior cadets of the right to wear a uniform; and it seems to me that if boy scouts are allowed to wear a special dress, junior cadets need not be deprived. I think that the Minister would satisfy a widespread feeling if he would extend this privilege to the Junior Cadets. I may also point out that the. uniform of the scout is a nearer approach to the uniform which was generally adopted in South Africa than is that sought to be worn by the Junior Cadets. Bill the scouts must be merged into the cadets. The Department cannot permit a percentage of the boys to be volunteer scouts, and the remainder to be regular cadets. not come under the Bill at all. who is a. scout reaches twelve years of age, he does come under the Bill. will yield to the request that has been made to him, I think that he will find that he has done both a wise and popular thing. Minister of Defence) [6.8] I think that it would be very undesirable indeed to allow a portion of the cadets to appear in uniform alongside others whose parents could not afford to buy them uniforms. The honourable member for Parkes will probably know that at present only some boys can berbng to the cadets for that very reason. There are very many boys in this country who would be glad to be cadets, and who regard it as a deprivation that they cannot, by reason of the fact that their parents are unable to buy uniforms for them. It would be creating a class distinction, to put it plainly, to grant the permission asked for. There are twothings which we ought to avoid in connection with this scheme of compulsory training for our youths and boys. One is that we should take care that no class distinction is created. either. distinction. not being kept out at present. kept out of this Bill, I hope. The next objection is a material one. To give to the Junior Cadets ""uniforms would mean an added expenditure of £120,000 for a commencement, and thenceforth£60,000 per annum. That is a very large sum. The Bill is already loaded as much as we think we can bear at present from the financial aspect. I do not agree that the boys will be as much discouraged as the honourable member for Parkes imagines by not wearing uniforms. On the contrary, boys between the ages of twelve and fourteen will look forward to the day when they will be able to wear uniforms and carry genuine weapons. To sum up, there are two reasons why I must rule out the suggestion which has been made, the first being that we want to avoid creating class distinctions, and the second that we do not desire to increase the expenditure. vided for the cadets? rifles are all that we propose to give to them. The rifles with which the boys will be supplied will cost next to nothing. already have uniforms? becomes operative, they will be old enough to join the Senior Cadets. It is to be regretted that so many boys should leave school before reaching the age of fourteen years. If the school authorities cannot keep track of such lads, and make them perform the drill prescribed, the Commonwealth must do so. It has been suggested that boys who have been drilled between the ages of twelve and fourteen years should be given certificates to that effect. Then, when at the age of fourteen, the lads presented themselves to be enrolled in the Senior Cadets, it would be seen whether they had or had not undergone the pre-",38,Kelly S Amendment Put

I disagree with that entirely. would be of no use. field training. member said that it was of no use so far as field training was concerned. I do not think he is right even when he says that it is not field training. A great deal that the cadets will learn will be the same as they will have in field training. The cadets will have to do many things which they will afterwards do in the field in larger forces and larger numbers. Almost the only difference is that they will be training in .masses and in the higher formations. I take it that the cadets will learn outpost, scouting, attack, defence, advance, and rearguard drill, but it will not be done on such a large scale as it will be afterwards in the field. While I fully admit the superiority of field training, over company and battalion training, it is not correct to say that the cadets will not do some of it. I venture to say that they will know pretty well all that is to be known so far as the skill to do it is concerned before they finish their cadet training. It is a misrepresentation to say that they will not be fit for field training. When the cadet goes into his field training iri his nineteenth and twentieth years, the practice may not be perfect, but the knowledge will very largely be there. anything about a lot of it. to the contrary. One reason why I canledge of soldiering, making such a statenot accept this amendment is that, on ment.

This scheme is already going to cost £1,750,000, and we ought recruits are drilled in Switzerland. to hesitate before increasing the amount by another half million per annum. If anything. further is required in the way that their training will be almost equal to of expenditure, we must see whether we are that in Switzerland, a lot of which is most not in duty bound to spend more on naval elementary, and such as our cadets will not defence than we now propose to do. able member not to open up that question. pose to argue it. The adequate defence of system of education, and spends a great Australia will, I think, require that the next deal more on it, than we do. development of expenditure should be on the naval rather than on the land side. I do not object to additional expenditure if it is found to be necessary for the perfecting of the scheme as sketched in the Bill, but to increase the estimated cost of land I said it was not defence from £1,750,000 to £2,250,000, and leave the cost of naval defence at only £750,000, would be to have an altogether lopsided and inharmonious scheme of defence. We have to fly with both wings of our defence scheme. The naval side after all represents the first line of defence of Australia, and it is only when that has been broken through that we shall require to fall back upon our land defence. The scheme financially is as much as the Commonwealtb is capable of bearing at present. Even now we propose a great increase of expenditure over what honourable members opposite contemplated in their scheme. Whereas our land defence is to cost, when completed, £1,750,000, theirs, when completed in 1915, would have cost only £1,300,000. Training and. equipment are largely a matter of expense. As the expense is, so, very largely, will the efficiency of the forces be, always supposing that there is an adequate organization in respect of the expenditure voted.

But my point is that we are not neglecting these men between twenty and twenty-six years of age, as my honourable friends opposite suggest. We propose to keep a grip .over them as far as we can in the Militia, and those who do not go into the Militia will go into the Reserves. 1 propose to tempt them to enter the rifle clubs after they have passed through the Militia, so that when they have arrived at the age of twenty-six years they will have had six years' service. Although we are not doing this compulsorily, we hope to do it effectively. I therefore ask honourable members to let us put our scheme to the test. Minister continues to be obsessed by the idea that the training given to the cadets will turn them out capable soldiers. To that he returns again and again. In my opinion, that training will no more make men soldiers than will the learning of reading, writing, and arithmetic give a knowledge of applied mathematics A cadet will receive a preliminary physical training, but for his practical education as a soldier hardly anything will be done. Yet the Minister seems to think the Cadet Force of such value that subsequent training may be curtailed. He has informed us that this opinion is supported by the advice of. his experts. I do not ask him to tell us the names of those experts. ofiicers of experience have so advised him. But we are justified in contrasting with that advice, the opinions of the leading soldiers of the Empire, and the example of Switzerland. member should say "" some of the leading soldiers of the Empire."" experts who have advised the Minister are some of the leading soldiers of the Empire. of my own officers. any leading soldier of the Empire has disagreed with the opinions expressed by Lord Roberts and other officers of similar experiproposes to retain the Militia as the basis ence. Every officer of high standing in the United Kingdom who has spoken on the subject, has emphasized the need for exceptional training during the recruit period, and has attached no importance to the cadet course, other than as affording preliminary instruction. They all urge that we should not take either semi-trained or partially-trained troops into the fighting line. There has been no change of opinion on this point so far as I am concerned. I have not seen the Bill of the Fisher Government, nor have I heard it discussed, but Senator Pearce gave a public explanation of what was intended, which differed entirely from that of the Minister. What has appeared in the Call may or ma.v not have been supplied by a member of the Fisher Government, but what Senator Pearce proposed was that the trainee should for three years-betwee n the ages of eighteen and twenty-one-receiv e sixteen days' continuous training a year. There is a vast difference between sixteen days' continuous training in camp for each of three consecutive years and thirty-two days spread over a period of two years. sixteen days of continuous training the men were to -have twelve half-day, and twenty four night, drills a year. Bill, the thirty-two days' training which is to be given in two years may be made up of half-day drills and night drills. There may be an eight days' camp, and the rest of the time be made up in ""equivalent"" drills, which, in my opinion, will be almost useless. I should not like to make any reflection on the Militia. I know its value. The men deserve praise for the enthusiasm Presumably which they show, but the training which they receive is of little value in the production of soldiers fitted to take their places in the firing line. In addition to serving with two contingents, I had charge practically of two camps formed by other contingents, COOK -The honourable and know that it was easier to teach the green recruit who had come from a country town, or even from a city, than the militiaman, who had a smattering of military knowledge, what was essential for the work on hand in South Africa. get proper training. hear the Minister say that, seeing that he of the new system. proved.",45,Kelly S Amendment Put

In the first place, he repudiated all that we urged, and brought forward statements .which he thought completely demolished our argument. He now says he agrees that the proposed training should be different from that now carried on, but he makes no provision for a change. there should be a little extra training, the Minister objects. the honourable member has quoted serve to show that our proposal will be satisfactory. again, but they.are in the direction of showing that the Bill does not provide for sufficient training. quoted by the honourable member merely says in effect that if the training is bad, it is bad. that the methods proposed under this Bill are generally valueless, if not positively harmful, and had better be given up. Colonel Bridges goes on to point out thatThe Swiss soldier receives his training first, in a school of recruits, which turns him out a trained soldier,fit to take his place in the ranks, and secondly, in repetition courses or annual trainings, during which units from companies to army corps are mobilized and trained. Before a man is put into the fighting force in Switzerland he has to devote sixty-five -whole days to continuous training. From the age of twenty-one to thirty-two, every man there has to serve one hundred and forty-seven whole days' actual training in camp. The Minister informs us, however, that for all practical purposes, the cadet course, followed by thirty-two days' training in the first two years, after our youths leave the cadets corps, is all that is necessary to turn out an efficient force. Quoting again from Colonel BridgesAs the result of the experiment with the "" Spectator"" Company last year, Lieut -Colonel Pollock, who conducted the training, proposed ""six months' training on enlistment; twenty-two drills and exercises, and a course of musketry annually, and one week in camp not less frequently than in alternate years,"" but he also stated, *' I do not pretend that a fighting unit, fit for immediate service, had been created by the six months' training."" Could we have a more emphatic statement? Yet the Minister continues to urge that his proposal that thirty-two days or their equivalent shall be devoted to training, is r sufficient for all purposes. It is evident, however that the honourable gentleman will not accept an amendment of any description, no matter what may be our desire to improve the Bill. member can say no more against the Bill, I certainly cannot accept the amendment. say would cause the honourable gentleman to change his mind. task?

During the next few years we shall have a militia, the larger proportion of which will consist of recruits, while a certain proportion will be rather too advanced in years to be fit for immediate service, with no great alteration or departure from the existing system. Before we adjourned for dinner, the Minister suggested that on this amendment we should test the question of whether or not the drills and training proposed should be agreed to, and that we should not continue the debate any longer in regard to that matter. I fully agree that we should have one test vote to determine whether or not the Bill shall be improved in the direction of increasing the drills and the period of training, and the turning out of a more effective fighting unit than is proposed, and I hope that that course will be followed. now reached the most critical part of ther Bill, the policy of which the House has practically endorsed by agreeing to the second reading on the voices.

Those honourable members are speaking from their own practical experience. I admit that the Australian youth is very apt, imitative, and quick to learn in military as well as' other matters : but while he picks up ordinary drills and exercises quickly, he also drops his knowledge of them quickly Por that reason, it is dangerous for the Minister to relv on the Senior Cadets being sufficiently acquainted with organization and field work to supply the deficiency in the training which the Citizen Forces will get.

But the feeling of honourable members evidently is that, while we are about it, we should make our system of training as perfect as possible. My limited experience in this matter convinces me that eight days training is not nearly enough. The honourable member for Adelaide has put the matter very fairly, and has aptly quoted a reliable authority in Colonel Bridges, who is undoubtedly the best military authority we have in the service of the Commonwealth. Colonel Bridges has had to fight his way without any political influence at his back, and no one who knows the kind of service that he has rendered can help speaking in high admiration of him. Personally I have never had the pleasure to speak to him, so that I am not saying this from motives of friendship. I judge him by his work. He has forced himself to the front by his own knowledge of and capacity in military affairs. Unfortunately, in one sense, he is now removed from Australia, but he is the best representative that the Commonwealth could have in military affairs in Engfor the late Government were not perfected land ; and the Minister would be well advised if he relied to a very large extent upon but what was proposed in that outline of Colonel Bridges' opinion in this matter. member know what Colonel Bridges says in regard to the matter? He has never committed himself to compulsory training in any shape or form. weakness of camp life as at present conducted. The Minister is, however, in this happy position-that within eight weeks from now the best organizing authority in the British Army is to arrive in Australia. I refer to Lord Kitchener. Let the Minister of Defence ask that distinguished officer whether he thinks that eight days continuous drill in camp is sufficient to fit a man to be a soldier, and whether training on that basis will be likely to give Australia an efficient active force. I venture to say that the Minister will be surprised at the answer that he receives. Adelaide has quoted the experience"" of the Spectator newspaper, by whose means a number, of men were kept in training for six months continuously under picked officers and expert drill masters. Yet at the end of that time they were not thoroughly equipped soldiers. I am sure that any one who has had experience of military camp life will not hesitate to express the opinion that what is proposed by the Government is utterly insufficient. I am pleased to know that the Minister proposes to go into camp himself. 1 trust that when he does he will move about and take stock of things He possesses strong powers of observation. We must compliment him on the ability that he has shown in assimilating military knowledge. He has shown himself to be very earnest and keen. But he must not imagine that senior cadet training is sufficient to make men competent soldiers. -The Minister has asserted that my amendment represents an entire change of front from the proposals of the Fisher Government. That is not so. The Ministei has not justly represented what was contained in the Gympie speech. I venture to say that if the honourable gentleman consults his experts as to whether they would prefer to take this Bill, or, in the alternative, the proposals of the Fisher Government, there is not one of them but will tell him that the Gympie proposals are preferable. It has to be remembered that the whole of the Bills being prepared when the Gympie speech was delivered; policy was very different from what has been represented by the Minister. He only proposes sixteen drills a year for two years -that is to say, thirty-two days' training in two years. The Fisher Government proposed seventy-five days' training. But, says the Minister, "" Look at the cadet training which we propose."" Allow me to tell the honourable gentleman that the Fisher Government, as shown' in the Gympie speech, proposed to give more cadet training than is provided for in this Bill. We proposed to give seventy-five days' training, as compared with thirty days, and including the cadet training, 123 days. We did not think, nevertheless, that we were going to turn out efficient soldiers by that means. What we did think was that we were making a substantial beginning. Mv reason for proposing this amendment The honourable member for is that I think that the Minister has brought down a Bill which is designed in a proper direction, though I fear that it will not accomplish anything of a substantial character. I thoroughly agree that seven days' camp training is not nearlv enough. But I have proposed what I thought was the maximum which the Min-",50,Kelly S Amendment Put

Will the Government accept the proposals of the Fisher Government ? member has been trying to demonstrate that the Bill is of no use whatever. absolutely wrong. If I thought that the Bill was' absolutely useless I would not have proposed an amendment, but would have denounced the Bill altogether. WhaiI say is that the Bill is useless in its present'form, because it will lead to an enormous waste of public money, and produce no good results. It will not only lead to waste in respect of the training of men, but we shall also spend huge sums without receiving a valuable return for the expenditure. Gympie speech was this: The cadets were to' begin at the _age of ten, and were to be trained up to fourteen years of age. They were to be senior cadets from fourteen to eighteen. They were to have twelve halfday and twenty-four night drills throughout the year. The Military Forces were not only to have sixteen days' continuous training in camp, which would give something like a training on a war footing, fitting them to take the field, but we proposed, in addition to the sixteen days, that for three years they should have twelve half-day and twenty-four night drills. That was a very different proposal from that made by the present Government. WhatI am now proposing is that we should have seventy-four days' training divided over eight years, as against seventy-five days' training proposed by the Fisher Government. How, therefore, can the Minister say that what I am proposing represents an entire change of front? It is practically the same thing. I am moving the amendment with the object of assisting the Minister to accomplish something substantial. If the honourable gentleman consults his experts he will not find one of them who will not say that the amendment would mean an enormous advance on the proposals now submitted to us by the Government. I am certain that the experts approved of the scheme of the Fisher Government, except that they did not think their proposals went far enough. But they did go far enough to insure to us something substantial for our money, and by means of therm we should have been able to present in the field a force creditable to Australia. Government to do all that for £1,300,000? membered that we did not propose to pay COOK -The honourable the men as much as the Minister is proposing ' to pay them. If the Government can find the money well and good, but the Minister has not told us how it is to be provided. The Minister goes further than we did in the matter of expenditure, but he will not get the training which the Fisher Government's scheme would have secured for the troops. What is a paltry £500,000 in comparison with the defence of Australia ? Government propose to"" spend only £1,300,000? What was proposed in the that we could get a really effective force for our proposed expenditure. Mr J. H . CATTS -The money was to be spent differently. of the Minister will cost a great deal more, and will provide less training. He admits that the Militia has been a failure, and in that he is borne out by the statement of Colonel Legge, his expert adviser, that only 10,000 of a force of 23,000 are fit to take the field. We have no indication as to bow the Militia is to be improved. The Fisher Government proposed to use volunteers, but not to have volunteers working alongside militia. That has always caused failure. A volunteer force could be made as efficient as a militia force, if there were not a militia force working alongside it. I was very sorry when the old Volunteer Force was abolished. I believe it could have been made more effective than the Militia, at half the expense. But volunteers and militia will not work well side by side. However, the Minister seems determined not to allow his Bill to be improved, although the criticism which he has received from honourable members on this side of the Chamber has been delivered in the most friendly fashion. He should be glad that those of us who have advocated compulsory training for so many years are willing to help him. Our opinions are supported by those of every expert in and out of Australia, while the Minister has not been able to give us the name of any officer who has declared that the training which he proposes to give is sufficient.

Why should we not profit by the lessons of the past ? I ask Ministerialists not to make this a party matter, backing up the Minister through thick and thin, Whether his proposals are good or bad. They should listen to the voice of the experts. The period of training has been increased in every civilized country. The Minister said that I did him an injustice by not mentioning that extra training will be given to the scientific branches of the forces; but I did not mention that a similar proposition was made by the Fisher Government. I was concerned only with contrasting the thirty-two days of training which he proposes to give to infantry with the seventy-five days of training which would have been given under the scheme of the Fisher Government. Government proposed the scheme, the vital question must be, Is it effective? lery or engineers be taught in fifty days' training, extended over two years? The men would not learn even the rudiments of their work in that time. I did not mention the training which the cadets would receive under the Fisher scheme, although it would have been as much as would be received under the Minister's scheme. Under neither scheme would cadets be given field training. There are a thousand things to be done in the field which the boys would not learn while in the Cadet Forces, and which could not be learned in a few days spent in camp. It is a great pity that the Minister will not accept a reasonable proposal. A certain section of the community is in favour of compulsory training, and of a much longer period of training than has yet been proposed, and why should it not be listened to? duction of compulsory military service into politics has declared that the longest period of training yet proposed will be totally inadequate. by those who, like the honourable member for Maranoa, have had practical experience. The honourable member will agree that the longest period of training yet proposed would be inadequate. will not accept the amendment, I hope that. at least a number of his followers will support it. gret that the honourable member for Hindmarsh tried to arouse honourable members on this side of the Chamber to a sense of their duty by drawing attention to the glorious halo surrounding his head and that of his fellow Oppositionists.

Unlike some of my honourable friends, I cannot pretend to be an authority, but the officers with whom I have discussed the question, and the bocks which I consulted, have indicated that the best way to train citizen soldiers is to have a long recruit course, followed by a few other shorter courses, to keep the trained men efficient. cient. proposed, I should be compelled to support it. I believe in compulsory service, because it provides the best means for making a force efficient. Without it, the men cannot be kept together for a sufficiently long period. Unless the training periods provided for in the Bill are recast, it will be difficult to get anything approaching efficiency, and if my honourable friends who have criticised the measure could suggest a better arrangement, 1 Would support it with enthusiasm. I The body associated with the introwould give young men who had arrived at the age of eighteen years a long continuous training, such as they have in Switzerland-fro m forty to fifty days for That declaration is borne out infantry, and longer periods for other aims of the service-and pay those who had done best in that training for sixteen days' annual training in successive years. In this way we could establish an efficient fighting force-a n anti-raid force, which is what the Militia is to be. The first line would be fed with the pick of those trained under the recruit drill. In this way, we would get efficient soldiers. But while we have been talking so much about training, we must remember that",52,Kelly S Amendment Put

I would like the honourable member fo propose something that is likely to secure more efficiency. with astonishment the statement of the Minister of Defence that he intends to make our Militia a fighting force fit to take its place in the fighting line against any of the ivell-trained armies of the world. My experience of the Militia Forces in the' Old Country-and it must be remembered that they have to engage in many days of conI do not wish to discuss tinuous training-doe s not lead me to believe that the honourable gentleman's hopes will be realized. If a Militia Force is asgood as a permanent and thoroughly trained force, then the Old Country ought to do away at once with its permanent troops. Australia, at the did. I think that he was carried away by his own eloquence; he has such faith in his scheme that he thinks it cannot be improved upon. I desire to ask him whether he. thinks that one day's parade per annum will keep efficient those who leave the Citizen Forces on reaching the age of twenty-six years ? intended to keep them efficient; it is designed only to keep track of them. Wentworth very properly asked the Minister how he proposed to 'keep track of the men when they passed out of the Citizen Forces, and he received a reply that that would be provided for under the Bill or byregulation. The Bill provides for a system ol registration which would enable the Department to keep in touch with the men without compelling them to parade once a year to show themselves. It is absurd to think that one day's training a year will keep them efficient. The Minister ""says that he hopes to make the Militia so attractive that on reaching the age of twenty years men will be anxious to join it. My experience is that on reaching the age of twenty or twenty-one years a man who has been compelled to undergo military training is anxious to ""turn it up."" I do not know whether the position to-day is what it was when I was a young man; but when I was twenty-one I was thinking about getting married. The average young man whose thoughts go in that direction devotes more attention, to the question of how many nights a week he will be able to see his girl than to that of compulsory military training. Does the Minister propose to make the Militia attractive to our young men by attaching to it a regiment of amazons ?

Let me quote the authority of Field-Marshall Lord RobertsNothing has given rise to such differences of opinion as the duration of the first year's traindo 41 days' training instead of the ordinary ing. Some advocate a longer, some a shorter period. After very careful consideration, four months appears to be the most suitable period, having in view the industrial conditions of the country, and the fact that this training should, as far as possible, be carried out in camp. I would specially direct the attention of the Minister fo the fact that Lord Roberts says that the training must take place in camp. night .drills are useless. They will not make a man efficient. The honourable member for Wentworth pointed out that no provision is made for securing additional officers and non-commissioned officers. The mainstay of a force lies in' its non-commissioned officers, but in this Bill no provision is made for securing them. Officers are not going to be turned out by means of twenty-eight days of continuous training, and to send a force to the front without being properly officered is to send it to a shambles. In the Old Country, the one set of officers attends to the two units. The first unit consists of recruits. Those who have been recruited during the spring have fo attend forty-nine days of continuous training under the direction of militia officers, including the adjutant of the Militia Forces. They are then drafted into a battalion, and engage in a further period of thirty days-and , in some instances, sixty days-continuou s training under the same omcers. There is a constant flow of officers to make good losses by death, disaster, or discharge. In a work by Lieutenant-Colonel S. T. Banning, dealing with the administration, organization, and equipment of the Militia and Regular Forces in the Old Country as existing in September, 1907, it is stated thatA militiaman enlists for 6 years, and may -re-engage for 4 years, up to 45 years of age. An infantry recruit during his first year either out "" Milk-ho"" before his horse would -drills on enlistment for 49 days at the Depot of the Territorial Regiment with the recruits for the line, and does 14 days' musketry before the annual training, or comes up for preliminary drill for 63 days with all the other recruits of the battalion, just before the annual training. Recruits of other arms are trained in like manner, but the respective periods differ. The annual training is for not less than 21 or more than 28 days, unless the King extends the period by Order in Council, as he has power to do, up to $6 days; or reduces or dispenses with the training of any unit. The period is usually extended in this manner for those Corps which are to be trained at some distance from their place of assembly. Mr Page. Of the Militia Infantry the recruits of 20 selected battalions, during the winter of 1906-7, performed 6 months' drill under their own officers; in 1907 these selected battalions are to In time of national danger the King can, by proclamation, embody the Militia, in which case they must serve until disembodied. The Militia are not liable for service outside the United Kingdom, except with their own consent. If it is necessary in England to build up the Militia by a system of continuous training in camp, it is equally necessary Saturday afternoon drills and that we should do something in the same direction. We are proposing to expend £ J 7 5 ° ) ° per annum to secure a partly I 0 0 efficient force; and to make that force thoroughly efficient, we shall have to spend, according to the Minister of Defence, an additional sum of £500,000 per annum. We might as well throw that £ >75°. I 0 0 0 into the Yarra as devote it to the securing of a -partly efficient force. We should either expend the additional £500,000 per annum to make the troops thoroughly efficient, or reduce the number of troops to be raised, and take care that they are made efficient. Since the inception of the Commonwealth, we have expended over £11,000,000 on defence, and the Minister tells us that all our efforts in that direction have hitherto been unsuccessful. That being so, over ,£11,000,000 of the taxpayers' money has been wasted. Yet the Minister says it will take another £500,000 to make the forces thoroughly efficient. Are we to let the scheme go by the board for the sake of that sum ? It would be spoiling the ship for a ha'port'h of tar. Every party and individual in this House, now that we have realized what a system of defence means to Australia, wants nothing but the best. The honourable member for Dalley referred in a Gilbertian fashion to incidents that occurred at the encampments that he attended-particularl y where an officer had to rattle his scabbard and call move. That sort of thing shows what kind of fighting forces we have had. I suppose that if the horse had belonged to an undertaker it would have refused to move at all unless the officer had walked in front of it. The Minister asks for authorities to support the view put forward by the honourable member for Hindmarsh. Let me quote further what was said by Lord RobertsI , myself, would never have agreed to so short a period of recruits' training as four months for the Infantry and six months for the other arms, with a fortnight's training in camp and a course of musketry annually during each of the next three years, if I had not calculated on the Citizen Army including in its numbers the most intelligent and the best educated men in the land. . . Lords, I now agree to this small amount of training only on the understanding that the training would be carried out by omcers and, non-commissioned officers of the Regular Army, and that for a time at any rate the Citizen Army would be strengthened by a liberal number of regular officers and non-commissioned officers being attached to it. That ought to satisfy the Minister. He also wanted to know what Colonel Bridges had to say about training. That officer in his report on the Swiss military system in 1907, saidI f the periods in Appendix III . are compared with the requirements for efficiency (12 days' attendance annually) prescribed in the Australian Military Regulations, it will be seen that the Swiss soldier undergoes considerably longer training than the Australian soldier. This is more marked in the case of officers. Other things being equal, the longer the training the more efficient the Army. We all recognise the truth of that statement. AlthoughI went through a course of gunnery, and when I left the service was a thoroughly efficient artilleryman, I am to-day worse than a numbskull in the science of artillery, because it has made such rapid strides since then. The same is true of the rifles, the range finders, and even the ordinary drill. If the drill is foreign to one who has been through the mill on active service conditions, is it not likely to be foreign to men who are called up for only one day a year? The whole system is ever changing. only for inspection. muster parade for inspection purposes. should be at least twentv-eight days' continuous camp training. The Minister says that at twentv the men leave the forces. Does he think that he is going to have an efficient field force with only boys? that the vouths trained in the Cadets ness. We must have a force that we can will join the Militia. If they do not, the rely upon and put our hand upon at once Minster will have no forces.

No commanding officer would undertake heavy battalion drill, marching, or field work, with boys of twenty, for they are nothing but boys. Yet that is all the Bill provides for. If we are to have compulsory training or a field force 'W.orthy of the name, we must have continuous training, just as the Militia Forces in the Old Country have. I thoroughly agree with the honourable member for Wentworth. I think that to propose seven days' training is only dilly-dallying with the question, but even seven days is better than one day. The strength of a chain is only its weakest link, and the weakness of this scheme lies in the doubt whether the men as they pass out of their training will join the Militia or not. There is a way to overcome that difficulty if the Minister will adopt it. If the men do not join the Militia Forces, let some provision be made for a continuous camp. would have to be revised if the Militia movement broke down. 'the Militia Forces for our defence, God help Australia. If that is the Minister's idea of continuous or compulsory training, the whole thing must break down.

The mainlstay of a battery of artillery is the sergeantof tar, or remain in the position that we major, and the same rule applies throughout the service. Unless you have a good set of non-commissioned officers, you will not have an efficient force. The sergeant-major and the adjutant are the two men who make the whole force-the adjutant for tbe drill, and the sergeant-major to keep the men together, arid see that the adjutant's instructions are carried out. I ask the Minister again to see that he gets a good staff of non-commissioned officers, and to insure thar the commissioned officers have proper training. At Rockhampton, many years ago, I saw an officer who was supposed to be drilling troops in the field. At his elbow was the sergeant-major prompting him with the word of command. The sergeant-major was doing the drill, and the officer was shouting the instructions. If the sergeant major had .stayed away, there would have been no drill there that day. I am pleased that the honourable member for Wentworth has foreshadowed amendments whereby I hope we shall obtain an efficient force of officers. The honourable member is on the right track in that, and is doing a good thing for the Commonwealth. I have never met Colonel Bridges; out I should be only too proud and pleased to meethim at any time, because I honestly believe that he is the only thorough soldier be-' longing to the Commonwealth Forces. He is now in the Old Country, where, if the British Army authorities are wise, they will keep him; but I hope that he will come back brimful of information. sure that he would be only too eager to impart it to the officers, non-commissioned officers, and forces of the Commonwealth. Unfortunately, there is a jealous feeling among many officers; and if a man shows any ability to rise head and . shoulders above the others, there is a plot at once to down him'and keep him down-> The honourable member for Dalley put the matter in a nutshell when he said that Colonel Bridges had fought his way up from the ruck step by step, without anypolitical or social influence whatever. Those are the men that we want; and I hopd that by means of the proposition of the honourable member for Wentworth, we shall obtain an efficient force of officers to officer our brigades. 1 shall support the amendment now before the Chair, although it does not go as far as I should likeEveni f it costs a little more money, let us have an efficient force, and let the people know what it will cost. Whatever we do, we must not spoil the ship for a hap'orth occupy to-day. Mr J. H . CATTS (Cook) [10.10] -Anything that I have to say on this or any other provision of the Bill is conditioned by the few general remarksthat I shall make on. the third reading. At present, I am prepared to support the amendment of the honourable member for Hindmarsh. It must be remembered that the proposed training for cadets is not sufficient to turn out trained soldiers; and, secondly, that the training will not have been enough when the men reach the age of twenty. Consequently, if they have not been trained as soldiers, it is not likely that one registration or one muster parade in each year will do anything material towards their training. It is patent that there must be some further training. It appears that in the framing of this Bill there has been a conflict of ideas. There has been a desire to reconcile the hesitating attitude of the right honourable member for Swan, with the more progressive attitude of the Prime Minister in regard to compulsory training; and the result is that we get a proposal 1 that is neither fish, flesh, nor good red herring. It is a hybrid scheme. But this is one of those matters as to which we cannot afford to experiment. The Minister seems to say, every time he rises, ""Let us take one step at a time; if it doesn't turn out well, we can do something else afterwards."" But""""that is a very unsatisfactory manner in which to propose to spend a I am very large amount of money. It is very unsatisfactory to make haphazard proposals for the defence of the country. Surely we ought to know definitely that what is proposed is likely to turn out effective. We should have authorities quoted in support of this policy. The Minister tells us that he is advised that what is proposed is sufficient. We have not been told what officers have given that advice. I doubt whether any officer occupying a decent position in the service could be persuaded to",56,Kelly S Amendment Put

441,Mr Page.,"On that point, let me giveput his name to such a proposal as this. I have not met a great number of omcers, but I have talked with some, and I know that this idea is being ridiculed amongst thern. Mr J. H . CATTS -The Minister must not think that I am so green as to mention names to him. It would appear that the Government, first of all, arrived at a policy twenty and twenty-six years of age is the in this way. They said: "" We have to pay so much money to the States, and shall have a little bit over for defence."" Then, apparently, they said to their officers, "" We want you to frame us a Bill in accordance with the general lines of a compromise policy we have laid down. We; have a certain sum of money to spend, and cannot spend more."" Evidently the officers had said : "" For the amount of money that you have to spend, and in accordance with the sort of hopscotch policy under which you desire details, this is the best scheme we can suggest."" But to proceed in that manner is to bring a serious national requirement to the point of absolute farce. Even honourable members on the Government side of the chamber are dissatisfied with the proposal. We have had the honourable member for Wentworth and the honourable member for Dalley telling us that they are not content. the Government supporters. Mr J. H . CATTS -They have given more consideration to the question than has the honourable member for Indi. From the helpless position taken up by the honourable member for Wentworth, it would appear that .he has consulted the Government, and they have told him that they can agree to nothing better than they have proposed. Accordingly, he has given up the ghost. Would it not be wise for the Minister, having regard to the criticism that has been directed to the Bill, to consult his officers and to see whether it would not be possible to remodel the portions of the measure with regard to training? I have not heard any honourable member support the provisions as they stand. The whole of the criticism that I have heard has been destructive. Bill. about carrying the motion for the second reading. Mr J. . H . CATTS -They had no trouble whatever; in fact, many of us were prepared to forego our right to speak on the second reading in order that the Bill might get into Committee. We wished to evolve a measure that would be useful to the country. The honourable member for Wentworth has said that he does not see much use in altering the one day's period of training to seven, unless the other periods of training are also altered. But we have to begin somewhere, and the provision as to seven whole days' training for those between first item which we have reached in regard to training. Subsequently, we can bring other provisions into harmony with that now under discussion. A number of honourable members have given many years to the consideration of this important question. Consequently, I do not propose to traverse the ground which they have covered. But I may say that I view with great diffidence a proposal for compulsory training at all, unless accompanied with payment for lost time and direct taxation to provide ways and means. If , however, we are to have such a system, we should have it in an effective form. To incur considerable expenditure without attaining the best results seems to me to be farcical. Either we should do the thing properly, or leave it alone. That is why I am prepared to vote for seven whole days' training for those between twenty and twenty-six years of age. If the Minister does not feel satisfied, I hope that he will take time to consult his officers again, because we have now reached the vital stage of the Bill. Tf something cannot be done to give us an effective system of training, the expenditure will be wasted, and might as well be thrown into the ocean. The Minister would be wise if he did not assume a dogmatic attitude by determining to stick to the Bill as it stands. He should realize that all sections of the Committee are desir ous of producing an effective scheme of miliT tary defence, and should take time to think before definitely and irrevocably committing himself to a position opposed to the opinion of those who are well qualified to speak! with authority. hopeful that anything that can be said from this side will make the slightest difference in the vote to be cast. Although it is said that this is a non-party measure, it is in reality only non-party by reason of the fact that there are not many The Government had no trouble parties in attendance to listen to the arguments. I am afraid that when the division is taken, we shall see upon this, as upon so many other questions, that honourable members will simply sit behind the party leaders wilh whom they are associated. Therefore, we must be content merely to",57,Kelly S Amendment Put

445,Mr Hall (Werriwa) [10.20],"I am notstate our reasons for the belief that the proposals o^ the Government are wholly insufficient, and ought to be improved in the direction indicated by the honourable member for Hindmarsh. I do not enter into this military experiment with all the enthusiasm which other honourable members seem to be able to manifest. To my mind the idea of instituting compulsory training is regretable. The necessity for it has been forced upon me as a melancholy one, in view of the circumstances surrounding our country. with the pleasure that others have displayed, Richmond was thatbut with the utmost regret. At the same time, if we are going to mate a change if we are to remodel our mil;t.?:y systemwe may as well do the thing decently and effectively. Otherwise we should leave it alone. It would be a great deal better for us to' present a couple of million pounds per annum: to the Imperial Government, and rely upon Great Britain to defend us as part of the Empire, than to waste such an amount of money in half doing the thing for ourselves. We should certainly be safer in relying on our associations with the Empire than upon a few half-trained or comparatively untrained boys to defend Australia. There is no alternative : either we must be prepared to rely on others, or on ourselves; and if we are io rely on ourselves, there is not a man in this Chambei, except the Minister, who would be prepared to say that the training proposed in this measure is sufficient. I expect very little in the way of defence from cadet training. world that places much reliance upon that method of making efficient soldiers. On the contrary, we see a nation like France, situference in principle between the two proated right in the midst of the trained camps of Europe, practically giving up her cadet system altogether, instead of relying upon it, as we propose to do. given up senior cadet training. those which have had most experience in military matters. Surely we should be wise to benefit from the experience of others, inthatstead of wasting money to gain our own. We are starting out to adopt a system which other nations with larger experience have seen fit to give up. cadet experience is a good thing for a boy, but I do deny that it makes a soldier of him. What training is proposed to be given apart from the cadet training, which will not make men soldiers, although it may improve their physique and carriage? In addition to the cadet training, it is proposed that, between the ages of eighteen and twenty years, those who are to constitute the fighting force of Australia shall have sixteen whole day drills a year, or their equivalent in afternoon parades and night drills. Let me compare that proposal with that of the honourable member for Richmond when a member of the late Deakin Ministry. Those who a few months ago were prepared to support that Bill, are now prepared to support the present Bill, which provides for quite a different scheme. TheI support these proposals, not proposal of the honourable member for The prescribed training shall in time of peace not exceed in each year(a) in the Cadets and Senior Cadets, fiftytwo attendances of one hour each and four attendances of one whole day each, or their equivalent, as prescribed ; and (i) in the Defence Force, for the first three years, eighteen working days, or their equivalent, as prescribed. The honourable member for Richmond proposed eighteen working days a year for three years, while the honourable member for Parramatta proposes sixteen days for two years. No doubt the honourable member for Richmond will cheerfully support the present proposal, although,he would have stoutly resisted it had it, last year, come from the present Minister of Defence. To continue the quotationIn the Defence Force, for the last five years, seven working days, or their equivalent, as prescribed. The great Liberal party supported that I know of no country in the proposal. member will not say that there is any difposals. The difference is only one of degree. cannot see any difference in principle between asking a man to train for seven days and to register for one day, I cannot help him in the matter. Everything is in a sense a question of degree. The honourable member for Richmond also proposed In the case of those allotted to the Naval Forces, and in the Military Forces, the Artillery and Engineers, the training shall not exceed annually, in the first five years, twentyI do not deny that eight working days or their equivalent, as prescribed, and in the last three years seven working days or their equivalent, as prescribed.

The Minister of Defence has moved a long way to get as far as he has got. proposal of the honourable member for Richmond was to make a man a soldier by means of eighty-nine days' training, and the honourable members for Maribyrnong, Batman, and others, who would have voted for that proposal, are now ready to vote against it. is involved. member support a proposal to train for live days a year. as it stands. ialists will do the same. They shut their eyes, open their mouths, and take whatever the Government likes to send them. I cannot understand their capacity for accepting one thing to-day and quite another thing to-morrow. I very much prefer the Bill of the honourable member for Richmond to the present measure, so far as the period of training is concerned. No doubt honourable members opposite will be able to justify the readiness with which, they were prepared to accept the first Bill, and the alacrity with which they will vote against its provisions now that their acceptance is being proposed by honourable members on this side of the chamber. But before they do so, I ask them to consider the experience of other countries. The Swiss are a comparatively poor nation who naturally do not wish to expend much money on defence. Yet they have found it necessary again and again to increase the training designed to make their citizen soldiery' more efficient. In a lecture delivered by 'Colonel G. R. Campbell, details of the Swiss system up to April, 1907, are given, and it is pointed out that the amount of training now proposed for the Swiss Army in the first year is sixty-five days for inthese circumstances I shall vote for the fantry and engineers, ninety days for cavalry, seventy-five days for artillery, and member for Maranoa, that it would be idle sixty days for medical, &c. The repetition courses are, for infantry, eleven days per annum for seven years; and for cavalry, fourteen days per annum for eight years. Either the people of Switzerland are fools and are adopting a system of training that is wholly unnecessary, or the Government of the Commonwealth are proposing a training that is wholly inIf adequate. Since Switzerland provides, in its repetition course, for eleven days' training per annum for seven years in the case of infantry, is it too much for us to ask The that the repetition course in Australia shall comprise eight days per annum? Then again, since the Swiss think it necessary that a recruit in the first year of his sendee shall undergo sixty-five days' training, are we asking too much when we urge that the training proposed under this Bill for the first two years in the Citizen Force shall be extended to sixteen days in camp per annum? I am convinced that if this measure be passed as it stands our young men will have forgotten all about the training they received when they reach tbe seasoned years at which they will be most effective with a reasonable amount of training thereafter. If we are going to rely for the defence of Australia on youths who have trained for sixteen days or their equivalent per annum for two years, and who, on reaching the age of twenty-one-and thereafter until they are twentysix years of age-ar e simply to attend an annual parade or to be registered, we shall return to the old volunteer system. We shall have a system as ineffective as any, 1 that has been in existence in Australia. The system proposed by the Government differs from others that have preceded it, in that it will call for sacrifices, which, being inadequate, will be useless. It will mean a waste of time, and an interference with the industries of the country to no purpose. I am prepared to advocate whatever interference is necessary to secure the end in view; but why we should interfere with industry merely to create an inefficient fighting force is beyond my comprehension. Under the Bill as it stands we shall simply have a waste of money. It will provide us with something that will not be sufficient for the purpose we have in view. To have a half-trained force is to waste tlie time of the men, to waste the public money, and to give the country a false sense of security.
