Under what authority was this action taken? indeed that the honourable member bas raised this matter here in this chamber, because the statement made in the press was brought to my attention, I think on Monday morning. The statement appears to be an acknowledgment from the gaming police in Victoria that they had received every co-operation in this matter from the Postal Department. We have always offered such co-operation. However, the press statement was couched in a way which could convey to readers the idea that there had been agreement by the Postal Department's officers to some form of telephone tapping. That, I am glad to have the opportunity to deny emphatically. These are the facts of the case: The recommendations from it.

26,Mr Davidson,"The Leader of thebrought up in the press quite recently. First of all, he asks about a report by the Australian Broadcasting Control Board some time ago regarding licences in Brisbane and Adelaide. Tbere is not much need for him to ask about that matter. He should remember, and I am sure he does remember, that the board's report on this matter was openly tabled in this House. It originally recommended one licence. The Government, in its wisdom and in the exercise of its prerogative, having gone into the matter, decided that in continuing its policy of providing as wide a television service as possible, two Ucences would be preferable, and it asked the board, "" In the event of two licences being granted, which two applicants would you recommend?"" Two licences were proceeded with, and the wisdom of the Government's decision is now apparent, on the operations of the two commercial stations in each of the cities of Brisbane and Adelaide. The financial results of the companies concerned are available to me and to the Government from time to time. However, I do not propose to announce them in this House. That would be improper. I repeat that it is obvious that the Government's decision was justified. The honourable gentleman also asked, I think, whether the board was consulted before the announcement about the granting of third licences in capital cities. This question has been under Cabinet consideration for a considerable time. Several times the Cabinet has been consulted, and the board has made certain comments on the proposal to the Government from time to time. Before we decided finally on the fourth phase of television the question of third licences in capital cities was considered, and at that stage it was decided, as I announced, that when the fourth phase of television, involving further extensions into country areas, was well under way we would fur'th-i consider the question of extra licences in the capital cities. That is exactly what we have done. the Minister for Labour and National Sering decisions on administrative matters of vice. Is it a fact that the shortage of this kind.

Is there any sound reason why an adult should be debarred from becoming a tradesman? say that in some industries, particularly in the building and electrical trades, there is a shortage of skilled tradesmen. I think, too-and in this I am supported by the opinions of persons competent to judgethat there will be an increasing shortage of building tradesmen during the next few months. For that reason my department is very interested in the matter of apprenticeship and in deciding what new and improved methods can be adopted, including the apprenticing of persons over 21 years of age, to ensure a steady supply of those technical personnel who will be so much needed by this country. Recently, my department consulted representatives of industry and of the trade union movement, and a booklet has been published setting out the views of those who engaged in the consultations. I think I should make available to the honourable member a copy of that pamphlet, in which he will find most of the information he wants, particularly with regard to new avenues to be explored for the purpose of overcoming the difficulty. unrest among the staff of the Commonwealth Bank in Queensland because of the introduction of the 8.45 a.m. starting time?

It is related to a recent statement by the Minister to the effect that in an attempt to overcome an Australia-wide shortage in the important medical branch of bacteriology, the Repatriation Department will offer three cadetships in bacteriology. Two of these cadetships will be offered in Victoria and the other in New South Wales. I ask the Minister why only those two States have been singled out for these cadetships, and why Western Australia, in particular, has not been included. Will he consider giving similar cadetships in Western Australia, and perhaps also in the other States? was quite correct when he said that these cadetships in bacteriology had been offered for the States of Victoria and New South Wales. I am sorry that I cannot give him an assurance that during this financial year any further cadetships will be offered in this tage to our primary producers and prevent subject. Arrangements are made for cadetships of this nature in accordance with the requirements in each State. At the present time we have one bacteriologist operating in all the mainland States and that is sufficient for our present requirements. The cadetships have been offered with a view to overcoming any deficiency in the immediate future. I hope that during the next financial year further cadetships will be available and perhaps, when the requirements are known at that time, Western Australia, Queensland and the other States may be included. for Labour and National Service whether by continually interjecting. I remind them it is a fact that the Stevedoring Industry that to interject is contrary to the Standing Authority acts as informer, prosecutor and Orders, and that it prevents a Minister from judge against waterside workers, whilst making a prompt and short reply so overseas shipping monopolies are allowed that more questions may be asked in the to attack industrial conditions without time allotted. penalty. Also, is it a fact that waterside workers are required to be available for work on 354 days a year for twenty years Council of Trade Unions has been informed to obtain long service leave whereas that we are now ready to continue disworkers in other industries are required to cussions. It knows our general line of work only some 260 days a year for twenty years to get the same leave benefits? I ask, further, whether some 22,000 waterside workers are to-day holding stop-work meetings throughout Australia in protest against the unjust penalties imposed by legislation introduced by this Government. Finally, I ask the Minister whether, as the Minister responsible for permitting such provocative and unjust legislation to exist, he will resign his portfolio to-day. this should be said: Already the waterside workers have been permitted a four-hour stop-work meeting to consider changes that are to be made in the stevedoring industry legislation, and that stop-work meeting was approved by the Stevedoring Industry Authority and by the steamship owners. Now, if ever there was proof of the necessity for legislation it is this totally unwarranted strike called by the executive of the Waterside Workers Federation against the law of this country, a strike which holds up shipping and which can only increase costs and be of disadvanthem from competing effectively in international markets. There is another reason why I believe this strike is totally irresponsible and should not have been called.

Since the publication of that statement, a copy of which 1 sent to my colleagues in Victoria, I have received no official information, but I learned from statements appearing in the press that a departmental inquiry was being held, and I think it was about half way through last week that I learned that the report from Inspector Hill's inquiry had been forwarded to the Commissioner of Police and the Chief Secretary. I was informed only yesterday that this report had been received and that it was intended to forward the report to me here for consideration. I understand that it is stated in this morning's press that the Chief Secretary had said that the report contained certain matters which he felt might warrant further investigation, and that if such further investigation were carried out we would have the co-operation of the State Government but, because of the nature of the report, it was not intended to publish it. I welcome the forwarding of the report to us because this is a matter which I desire to be thoroughly clarified. Up to the time of coming into the House this afternoon, I had not received the report in my office.

I have received a letter from the honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Allan Fraser) proposing that a definite matter of urgent public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namelyRestrictions being suffered by those on social services, notably new restrictions on pensioners in letting rooms in their homes, the increasingly severe restriction on pensioner medical entitlement and the exclusion of unemployed persons from such entitlement, the exclusion of all mental hospital patients from any pension payment, the undue restrictions which have become apparent in the operation of the supplementary allowance and other similar restrictions, I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. (More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in their places)[3.23] -It is said that the Government intends to curtail discussion on this matter. If that is so, I think it is very regrettable because, although the matters contained in this submission are not major matters of policy and do not involve any very large expenditure, they are matters of very great importance to the people who have to depend on social services. An unfettered discussion of these restrictions might lead to very useful results for the pensioners concerned. At this date, it is not possible to say whether the parties sitting on the Government side or the party now in opposition will present the next Commonwealth Budget: but as we now advance towards the recess, it seems most likely that the Government will survive until Budget time. If so, this is an appropriate time to bring these matters to the attention of the Government. Many of them can be remedied by administrative action. Only a few of them need legislative change. I put them, therefore, to the Government and to the Minister for Social Services( Mr Roberton). Honourable members will know, of course, that I do this in no party spirit whatever but in the hope that these matters can receive the careful consideration of the Government .ij"",: between now and Budget time. As many of the changes we propose have great merit, I hope that the Government may see fit to make them. In particular, I would say to the Minister for Social Services that I hope he will not allow that rather dreadful old tory, Peter Snodgrass, to have his ear too frequently when he is considering social service matters. Even as Scrooge was able to have a change of heart, so it is possible that this Minister can yet develop into one of the most humanitarian, forward-looking and progressive Ministers for Social Services we have yet had. under Providence. The first change 1 bring to the attention of the Minister is that dealing with restrictions on pensioners letting rooms in their homes. Every honourable member who has dealt with pension cases will know of the general nature of the new restrictions. However, I have found in discussion with colleagues that in their application the restrictions vary somewhat from State to State. Formerly the position was quite clear. The act provides that a pensioner's home shall not be counted as property for means test purposes. Until recent years, providing there was a connecting door in the home between the premises let and the premises occupied by the pensioner, no objection was raised to his letting them and the value of the let portion was not held against bim under the property means test. If, however, he converted portion of his house into a separate and self-contained flat, then and then only that portion of the premises was regarded as being separate from his home and was taken into account under the property means test. All that has been completely changed and, as honourable members who deal with these cases will know, the interpretations given in recent times have become increasingly narrow and severe. For this, I do not blame the departmental officers at all. They must follow the directions given to them by the Government and its",20,Taxation

Honourable members on both sides of the House had to accept that situation at that time but, providentially, Mr Speaker, that was the last year-and I speak in the prophetic sense of the termof the Labour administration. No one at that time dreamt that with the change of government expenditure on health services and social services would move up year by year and budget by budget until, in the short space of the succeeding twelve years, it has reached the staggering total of more than £365,000,000, or more than £1,000,000 a day. No one at that time dreamt that the traditional exclusions, restrictions, limitations and qualifications surrounding the payment of social services could be eased to provide benefits of one kind or another to some 4,500,000 people-men , women and children. But that is the proud record of this Government. It would give me great satisfaction to refer to the major changes in social services at some length and in some detail, but the fifteen minutes available to me demand that I should deal categorically with the four allegations set out in the matter raised, in all innocence I hope, by the Opposition. The first point refers to what are described as ""new restrictions on pensioners in letting rooms"". Mr amendment to the Social Services Act, Speaker, no new restrictions have ever been imposed by the present Government on pensioners letting rooms in their homes. On the contrary Mr Clyde Cameron Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. Do the Standing Orders permit the Minister to tell a deliberate untruth? stance in the point of order. full responsibility for what I have to say. No new restrictions have ever been imposed by the present Government on pensioners letting rooms. On the contrary, the old restrictions have been eased to the material advantage of pensioners who do let rooms. Mr J. R. FraserI take a point of order, Mr Speaker. The Minister is reading his speech. This, I take it, is not permissible under the Standing Orders. position is quite clear. Some relaxation of the Standing Orders is allowed so that a Minister may read a speech. This is done so that the information will be accurate. allegations made by the Opposition. for an honourable member to keep on repeating the same speech in this House? not upheld. have ever been imposed by the present Government on pensioners letting rooms. On the contrary, the old restrictions have been eased to the material advantage of pensioners who do let rooms. May I remind honourable members that prior to 1954, any income derived from letting rooms had to be taken into account as income in the application of the means test? But since 1954 and subsequent to an income from this source being income from property has been disregarded. Where the building in which a pensioner resides is shared by other persons who pay for their accommodation, it is necessary to examine the position in order to decide whether the accommodation charge should be regarded as income from property and therefore exempt for means test purposes. For this purpose, it is the practice to decide whether such persons are lodgers, boarders or tenants. Generally speaking, a person who is provided with sleeping accommodation only is a lodger and the pension rate is not affected. A boarder is usually provided with accommodation and meals, but again, generally speaking, the pension rate is not affected. A tenant, on the other hand, is usually a person renting a suite of rooms, a flat or self-contained accommodation, and the pension rate in this instance may be affected.",23,Social Services

For any honourable member to suggest that new restrictions have been imposed is to confess complete ignorance of the progress that has been made in social services during the last twelve years, of which this aspect in which the old restrictions have been eased provides a classic example. The second pointI shall quote the absurd allegation-is "" the increasingly severe restriction on pensioner medical entitlement and the exclusion of unemployed persons from such entitlement"". The authority for the pensioner medical service, which was introduced by the Government in February, 1951, is the National Health Act which is administered by the Minister for Health. By 1955, liberalizations of the pensions means test and increases in pension rates had made it possible for a married pensioner couple to have a joint income, including a pension, of £15 per week. This was approximately £3 a week greater than the basic wage. Thus the situation had been reached where some pensioners were receiving incomes in excess of the wages being earned by many men with families who had to provide for their own medical needs. Clearly, many pensioners could not be person may be in receipt of unemployment regarded as coming within the indigent or sickness benefits, even though he may be group for whom the pensioner medical serin arrears with his insurance payments. vice was intended. It was not unreasonable to expect that these pensioners would insure, at very low cost, with a registered organizaqualifications since 1955, the reference in tion, and receive the benefits of the Comthe matter raised by the Opposition to monwealth's medical and hospital schemes.

To meet the condition I have mentioned, the Government was required to introduce an income means test, although it does not apply to persons in receipt of the tuberculosis allowance and their dependants and those persons whose pensions commenced prior to lst November, 1955. An unemployment benefit is designed to meet a temporary situation of short duration. It has no other purpose, and unemployed people have never been included in the pensioner medical service. Prior to qualifying for the unemployment benefit, it is normal for people to have been in employment, and, when in employment, it is usual for them to insure under the Commonwealth's medical benefits scheme. These benefits continue to be payable during any period when the insured Against this background of unchanged The third point directs attention to the",24,Social Services
72,Mr Speaker,Order! The practice,25,Social Services
73,Mr Roberton,"T have only a fewfor four weeks of the period of suspension. This has been the position ever since the Commonwealth commenced to pay pensions in 1909. Since 1942, pensions have been available for the wives of pensioners admitted to mental hospitals. Successive Commonwealth governments have declined to alter the law on the ground that the maintenance and care of mentally afflicted persons in State mental hospitals is the responsibility of the State governments. Because the mental hygiene laws differ from State to State, it is most difficult to solve with complete satisfaction the problem of providing pension payments for inmates of mental hospitals without prejudice to the payment of pensions to the wives of inmates of mental hospitals. The Opposition has used the coloured word "" exclusion "". The fact of the matter is that patients in mental hospitals have never been included, despite the fact that the Opposition, when in office, had plenty of opportunity to include them had it wished to do so. It was left to this Government in 1955 to make the most dramatic and outstanding contribution in the history of the Commonwealth to the welfare of mental patients by making a grant of £10,000,000 to the States towards meeting the capital cost of the construction of adequate and modern accommodation for the mentally sick. The fourth point, Mr Deputy Speaker, reveals the utter confusion in the minds of Opposition members. Let me quote the distortion in full. . . apparent in the operation of the supplementary allowance and other similar restrictions. In 1958, the Government introduced the payment of supplementary assistance of 10s. a week to single or widowed persons receiving age, invalid or widow's pension, and to married age and invalid pensioners where only one party receives a pension, when they pay rent for their accommodation and are entirely dependent on their pension. This was the first time in the history of social services in our country that recognition had been given to the fact that there were groups of pensioners with special needs. In any large scale scheme of government assistance, it is necessary to draw lines to define limits of eligibility. No matter where those lines are drawn, there will inevitably be dissatisfaction among those who are just excluded. -Order! The Minister's time has expired. Deputy Speaker, the Opposition sponsors the proposal for the discussion of this question as a matter of urgency in order to direct attention to many hardships and irritations suffered by persons in receipt of social services. We have just heard from the Minister for Social Services( Mr Roberton) a romantic vocal refrain couched in colourful language of the kind for which he is becoming so well known. I challenge his statement that there are no new restrictions on persons letting rooms in their homes. IfI had time, I could quote from correspondence between the Minister and the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Clyde Cameron) in which a specific case was debated. That was the case of an aged pensioner who let two rooms in her home and was penalized for so doing. Yet we are now told that five rooms may be let to five individuals. I think that the statement by the Minister about the entitlement of pensioners to benefits under the pensioner medical service indicates that the Australian branch of the British Medical Association, which has now become the Australian Medical Association, the undue restrictions which have become has dictated to the Government or the Department of Social Services and said, ""Although income from property up to certain limits is not taken into account for social service benefits generally, all income from all sources shall be taken into account in determining eligibility for a pensioner medical card"". "" Hansard"" is studded with appeals by honourable members to the Minister for Social Services seeking to rectify hardships and anomalies. The Minister's answer is always the same. He invariably replies in these terms: ""The matter will receive sympathetic consideration when the next Budget is being prepared"". That is the",25,Social Services
74,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr Lucock).,,26,Social Services
75,Mr Sexton (Adelaide) [3.53],"Mrstock answer to all inquiries. We want the Minister to transform his slogan of "" sympathetic consideration "" to "" sympathetic administration"". The Social Services Act embraces many phases of our social life, and the question of sympathetic administration becomes a very important factor. We do not direct our criticisms at the department, because we recognize that it only reflects and carries out the policy of the Government and, in particular, the policy of the Minister in charge of the department. I cannot recall any instance in which the Minister has said ""Yes"" to the hundreds of representations on social services made to him during question time in this House. He always absolves himself with the standard formula: ""The matter will receive sympathetic consideration when the next Budget is being prepared "". Invariably, that is the end of the matter, because, when the next Budget is being prepared, the Government skips over the glaring anomalies and gives precious little to people who depend on social services. An exception, of course, is the budget before an election. That always contains some election bait by way of a few concessions in social service entitlements. Then we find a gradual tightening up in administration, presumably on the basis: "" Let us save money wherever we can"". Money is saved at the expense of recipients of social services. As the honourable member for Edenare questions of humanity and human Monaro( Mr Allan Fraser) pointed out, values, and they should be dealt with in there is a stiffening of administration in a very simple way. What moral right has regard to the treatment of pensioners in their the Government to hedge about with all own homes where they are trying to augkinds of "" ifs "" and "" buts "" its provisions ment their meagre pensions by letting one or two rooms. If a pensioner commits the sunset of their lives? terrible crime of letting two rooms to one person, the value of the rooms is taken into account and used against the pensioner in the assessment of pension. If the two rooms sioner who lets the major portion of his are let to two individuals, that is OK and home to tenants can be deemed not to be no sin has been committed. What greater living in his own home, and the value of anomaly could there be? What greater the property is then taken into account to irritation could be inflicted on any penreduce his pension entitlement. This is sioner than to be treated in this manner? another instance of the need for sympathetic Invariably, a pensioner who has to let a consideration. On the question of symroom and, as a consequence, share the pathetic consideration, it is pertinent to conveniences in the home, does so only recall a statement made by one of South because of financial stringency. in the Minister's argument. ber says, there is certainly no logic in the Minister's argument. The sharing of conveniences is a hardship in itself, and a pensioner who is forced into the unfortunate position of having to do this is doubly penalized. Not only has the pensioner to suffer the irritations of sharing conveniences with other people, but also the value of the rooms let is taken into account and used against him in the assessment of his pension entitlement. We on this side of the House say that this is an important matter that needs to be rectified. The Minister should take heed of the appeals that we make to him on this matter. The Government could change the situation if it wished to do so, but, unfortunately, it does not wish to do so. Therefore, the anomaly remains, and it probably will continue until a Labour government takes over the treasury bench. As has been said before, the letting of rooms by pensioners has been a highly controversial matter. I was saddened to read in correspondence sent to the honourable member for Hindmarsh that the Department of Social Services has had to invoke legal opinion in order to justify its attitude in this matter. Matters such as these involving pensioners should never end in a resort to legal interpretations. These in relation to pensioners who are trying to improve their standard of existence in the Under this Government's policy, the penAustralia's early statesmen, who said, "" You",26,Social Services

Civilian widows are harshly dealt with in the matter of allowances for children. The referred to by the honourable member for widow's pension is reduced as soon as one Eden-Monaro( Mr Allan Fraser). First, of her children reaches the age of sixteen there is the question of the home in which years. In most cases this means that the a pensioner resides and the letting of rooms child cannot continue its education, even in such a home. In this respect no alterathough it may have a great deal of intellition of the legislation has been made since gence. In practically all cases the widow this Government came to power. The law cannot afford to maintain the child through is exactly as it was left by the Labour the period during which a higher education Government. The act says that the value might be obtained.

The next item of social services about which I shall make a few remarks is child endowment. Here is the greatest opportunity of all for the Government to increase the family wage, by a review of the child endowment system.

If an honourable member of this Parliament is not satisfied with a decision of the department he is perfectly entitled to bring the matter before the Minister or to raise it in this House. I think the experience of all honourable members is that the department is very fair and just in deciding what is the home in which a pensioner resides. Let me pass to the second point raised by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, concerning the supplementary allowance. A Labour Government was in office for",27,Social Services
78,Mr Deputy Speaker,Order! The,28,Social Services
79,Mr Wilson (Sturt) [4.3],"Her e weeight years, and it did nothing about granting a hardship pension of this kind. It was left to this Government to realize that there were cases of hardship, mainly amongst single persons, and particularly amongst single persons paying rent, and that these persons needed financial help in addition to the pension. The Government provided the supplementary pension of 10s. a week, which has proved of tremendous benefit to a great number of single people. I have no doubt that this Government, just as it has liberalized allowances, removed restrictions and provided additional and improved benefits every year in the last twelve years, will continue to provide additional benefits as the circumstances justify such provision and the economy of the country permits. Let me now pass to the next matter raised by the honourable member, that of free medical attention and free medicine. Once again we find that after eight years of Labour rule there was no provision for free medical attention and free medicines. It was left to this Government to provide for pensioners the benefits of free medicine and free medical attention. At the present time 88 per cent, of pensioners receive these benefits. The people that the honourable member for Eden-Monaro spoke of represent only 12 per cent, of all pensioners. Who are these people? Every one of them receives, if single, at least £2 a week, and, if married, at member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Allan least £4 a week, more than the pension. In other words, the single person is at least £2 a week better off than the pensioner who is entirely dependent on his pension. It is possible for such a single person to join a medical benefits fund and to be reimbursed for most of the fees paid for medical attention. If a provision is in a certain form it does in State mental hospitals. Therefore, if not necessarily follow that it will remain in that form for all time. This Government is a dynamic one. When it finds that inustices and inequalities exist it takes steps to remedy them. If the honourable member for Eden-Monaro believes that these people who now receive £2 a week or more above the pension, and who represent 12 per cent, -Order! The honourable member's time has of pensioners, should have free medical expired. ittention, he is perfectly justified, as any other honourable member would be, to ask Speaker the Government to consider providing such a benefit when it is preparing the next Budget. But to propose this subject for discussion as a matter of urgent public importance and suggest that this Government has not given the greatest consideration to pensioners is complete nonsense. This Government has provided the free medical scheme, and it will review the free medical scheme for pensioners from time to time in the light of the economic position of the country and the needs and justice of the particular case. Let us now look at the supplemental allowance. In eight years of Labour government nothing was done in that category, but this Government has provided the benefit. It is clear that at present it is harder for single pensioners to make ends meet than it is for married pensioner couples. Where two pensions come into the home it is much easier for the married couple to live on twice the amount of pension received by the single pensioner, who still has to pay rent or meet the cost of maintenance of a home on the single pension. That is the reason why this Government introduced the supplemental allowance. AndI have no doubt that where it is proved that hardship still exists the Minister and the Government will give consideration to this matter in the light of other calls on government finance. The last matter raised by the honourable Fraser) with which I wish to deal is the subject of mental hospitals. Health is a State matter and one which comes entirely within the jurisdiction of the State concerned. The Commonwealth pays substantial grants to the States, and, in addition, has paid special grants to the States for the provision of mental hospitals. As far as I know there is no charge to mental patients pensions were paid to mental patients while they were in mental hospitals, that would obviously have to be taken into account in relation to the grants by the Commonwealth to the States.",28,Social Services

LOAN (INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR Second Reading. Debate resumed from 7th March (vide page 515), on motion by Mr Harold HoltThat the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this bill is to sanction the raising of a loan of 100,000,000 dollars, or £44,700,000 Australian, from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The proposed loan is in keeping with the Government's policy of borrowing overseas. This is in every respect a borrowing government, and here, may I observe that of recent date this Government has borrowed a plank or two from the Labour Party's platform with respect to current economic policies. In his second-reading speech the Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt) has not made it clear what is to be bought, and no reason was given for the change of policy in financing the Snowy Mountains project, for which this borrowing is to be made. The adequacy or otherwise of our overseas funds has not been mentioned, and our own financial capacity to continue to provide the necessary funds has been dismissed without a word. The problem associated with the repayment of principal and the payment of interest on a loan from abroad, and the outflow of capital has not rated the sketchiest consideration of the Treasurer. Because the Government has not established a case for the loan, because it has ignored our balance of payments problem, and in view of the Government's wretched record of national housekeeping, the Opposition intends to vote against the authorization of this loan. It has been said that our overseas trade has a murky future. I think Sir John Crawford made that observation, and that factor dictates a policy of restraint in overseas borrowing. The Government hopes to evade the unpalatable truth that there must be a day of reckoning with regard to the repayment of loans and with regard to our capital outflow. Mr Speaker, there is no evidence that our overseasfinancialposition will improve while this Government remains in office and while the Government continues to rely on borrowing its way out of the economic morass that Australia is in at the present time. The Government has a strange conception of national housekeeping and sound economic policy. It shifts its policy from day to day, from week to week, veering first to the north, then to the south, then to the east, and then to the west, without anyfixedideas, and, when it reaches a stage of desperation in financial matters, it seeks to borrow money overseas to solve its problems. I assert that it is imperative that we be more self-reliant. Our bank deposits are high, and we have already proved that the Snowy Mountains project can be financed internally. The figures relating to bank deposits indicate a healthy position at home even if the people are not prepared to endorse this Government's handling of the nation's affairs. This borrowing forms part of the panic measures associated with the credit squeeze. The Australian Labour Party is deeply interested in the progress of the Snowy Mountains project, this magnificent undertaking, which was conceived by visionaries and patriots, planned by a Labour Government, with faith in our skilled engineers, technicians and workmen to carry out this challenging task. It also has faith in the capacity of the people of Australia to finance this important work. It is to be regretted, indeed it is to be deplored, that this grand concept, this great Australian project, the Snowy Mountains scheme, should be blighted by this Government resorting to overseas borrowing in view of the fact that we have gone half the way in completing the project, and so far have been able to finance the undertaking from revenue. No less than £181,183,249 has been made available by the taxpayers of Australia. In all, as a result of our own efforts in this country, some £212,250,000 has been provided for this work. Mr Deputy Speaker, I have here a table setting out the financial arrangements with respect to the Snowy Mountains scheme from 1950 to 1961. It is from the official report of the Snowy Mountains Authority",31,Capacitors
85,Mr Luchetti (Macquarie) [4.25],"and I ask that it be incorporated in "" Hansard"" for the edification of honourable members and others who may care to read it.

Total The speech of the Treasurer was significant not for the information which it made available to the House, but for its lack of justification for the proposal to borrow from abroad. From the figures that I have already submitted to the House it is clear that failure to obtain this loan from abroad would not result in the cessation of work on the Snowy Mountains scheme. This nation has the capacity, as it has had in the past, tofinancethis undertaking. The loan which we are being asked to authorize is for 25 years' duration-fro m 1962 to 1987. As1 remarked previously, the total cost of the Snowy project has been estimated at £400,000,000. Already, £181,200,000 has been found by the taxpayers of this country. This loan is for only £44,700,000 and it is to be regretted that we are obliged to go overseas to borrow this money when it could be made available by the people of Australia. The Australian Loan Council is obliged to approve the loan. No doubt that is a mere formality, but an important aspect of the matter is that the cost of flotation of the loan is 1 per cent. It may be said that this is a normal procedure and practice. But it is also important that this loan will bear interest at the rate of 5 i per cent. All other government loans have been floated at considerably lower rates of interest. In view of fact that we have the capacity to raise this money in our own country, I say that the imposition of 1 per cent, to cover the cost of flotation is not justified.

But the 18,350,000 figures indicate that the countries that are 24,000,000 drawing the most from this bank include 18,500,000 India, which has borrowed 558,500,000 dollars, France, which has borrowed 181,183,249 337,000,000 dollars, Japan, which has had 323,000,000 dollars, and Australia, which has had 317,750,000 dollars, excluding the loan now under consideration. This, of course, will add to our liability another 100,000,000 dollars. These sums of money ought to be made available to backward countries to lift their standards of living and help them overcome their problems. We could have a happier world, a better world, and a more contented world, if we were to proceed along the lines that I have suggested, but this country with its capacity to develop and with its capacity, financially, to commence all sorts of magnificent undertakings is vieing with backward countries for loans from the International Bank. The Government ought to say precisely what we will buy overseas with the dollars that will be raised by this loan. We should also be told from what nation we are to buy the skills, the materials and the equipment needed. We should also be told why dollars have to be borrowed to finance work by Australian workmen using Australian equipment on an Australian task. The bill has appended to it a schedule which gives our position in relation to the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development but there is no schedule to indicate precisely what Australia will buy with the money that it is borrowing. I am disturbed, too, to think that the Snowy Mountains scheme, this grand Australian undertaking which is a show place for the world, will in future be subject to inspection by representatives of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The bank's inspectors will look over the project to see how we are spending the money that we have borrowed. Instead of being in that position, Australians should be able to say proudly that this is their project, that this is what they are doing themselves, and that the funds for this project are being provided by the people of Australia. ] think it desirable that a table setting out the equipment which will be purchased with the dollars borrowed should be provided for honourable members. The Associated Chambers of Manufactures of Australia, in a letter, copies of which have been made available to honourable members, has pointed out the great problem that is facing Australian manufacturing industries many of which are not working to full capacity. The letter, which is dated 28th March, statesThere is a real necessity for the Government to use tariffs ancl quotas to get back into use the large amount of unused plant capacity at present lying idle in Australia. Delay in doing this is costing the nation untold millions of pounds. Despite that need, it would appear from this loan proposal that we are to buy overseas goods that could be manufactured, and services that could be obtained, within Australia. The history of the Snowy Mountains undertaking has conclusively proved that this loan of 100,000,000 dollars is unnecessary for the purpose for which it is being raised. When we borrow money we create a debt. We also create unemployment when we buy goods which could be made in Australia. Our great electrical organizations are not working to full capacity. Skilled workmen who have been thrown out of jobs by the credit squeeze continue to be unemployed and on the dole while equipment which could be made by them is imported. Mr Deputy Speaker, this loan is a liability on ihe future national effort. With the prospect of falling earnings ment has disregarded sound financial pracfrom trade, our balance abroad could reach tice. It has gone along as though these unmanageable proportions. The Governproblems belonged to another day. It has ment seems to disregard these problems. It failed to preserve our balance of payments seems to be thinking in terms of sufficient overseas and we are facing grave difficulty. unto the day is the evil thereof. If it can borrow to-day, it does not worry about who will have to pay the money back or the overseas, and it has been condemned conditions under which it is repaid. It has no concern for the possible condition of the national economy or whether Australia will be forced into devaluing the f l . Will these things come about because of our impoverishment or bankruptcy? These are things the Government disregards. I have a sneaking suspicion that the Government cares less about these prospects because it knows that a Labour government will be in office and will have to face a legacy of such responsibilities in the future. Consequently, the Government is adopting a reckless attitude in borrowing from abroad. This disregard of sound finance characterizes the conduct of the Government. If this loan is being sought to help bolster up our balance of payments, it deserves the condemnation of the House and the nation. If the real purpose of the loan is to try to retrieve our hopeless trade situation, again the Government invites the censure of the House because it has failed to face up to its responsibilities in dealing with overseas payments and trade matters generally. Quite recently, the overseas shipping lines increased shipping freight rates from Australia.

87,Mr Luchetti,"I have referred tothroughout the country. I am indebted to the honourable member for Bonython( Mr fidence in the leadership of the Labour Makin) who recently asked the Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt) a question regarding loans raised overseas by the Commonwealth Government since 1950. The Treasurer informed the honourable member that the Government has borrowed £530,000,000 in that time overseas. This Government will not face up to its obligations and responsibilities. It will not adopt sound financial practices. In a sort of rake's progress, when it is in trouble it runs off to the moneylenders seeking loans to carry it on from day to day and from week to week. I am indebted to the economist of the "" Sydney Morning Herald"" for the following statement published in that newspaper on 24th October, 1960:A country with a heavy burden of external indebtedness clearly is in a weak state. Earlier generations discovered this to tbeir bitter cost when the 1880's and 1920's-tw o previous boom periods similarly showing increasing dependence on overseas capital-cam e to their close. In Australian economic history, one generation regularly forgets the experience of its predecessor. and its uncertainty. This is the sort of Memory of the past undoubtedly guided the Chifley Labour Government in its restraint concerning overseas borrowing and for a time a similar restraint was reflected in the policy of the Menzies few months. It is the sort of thing which Government. Political attitudes, however, bave changed, showrestraint and turned it into one of spending. ing increasing forgetfulness of the past. After each This is typical of the uncertain, panicof its forays into the world's money markets, the Government represents the sums borrowed almost as a great national victory, naturally coupled with has no long-range policy for economic a reminder of the service that is being rendered to planning. If the Government got its objecthe electorate. The"" Sydney Morning Herald"" economist certainly went directly to the point. For an example of how the economy should be run, one bas only to turn to the Budget Papers for 1961-62. There we find the proud record of finance under the Chifley Labour Government in war and peace. This Government wants to borrow its way out of its financial difficulties. Despite bad government, the nation is sound and so are the people. Only the Government is bad, and we should not confuse the problems of the people with those of the Government. If it is not the desire of the Government to finance the Snowy Mountains scheme out of revenue, it could do so with internal loans. During the Second World War, the Labour Government raised £1,227,636,924 within Australia from the people for war purposes. The people had faith and conGovernment. It was inspiring leadership. The people knew that they could invest their money in war loans knowing that the money they lent would not be destroyed by inflation, and they responded magnificently. For war and allied purposes, the Chifley Labour Government raised £1,783,966,435. This Government cannot raise anything unless it receives the wholehearted support of State governments, shire councils and everybody else. Then, when it raises a few pounds, it boasts about its achievements. If it is prepared to raise money internally, we are willing to help it out. That is to be preferred to going to the international money market. The loan proposed in this bill is the natural outcome of the Government's disastrous economic policies. We have challenged those policies and we say that this loan is one of the worse features of the Government's policy. It is in accord with the Government's panic-stricken record thing that gave us higher sales tax on motor cars, which was reduced within a reversed the Government's policy of stricken outlook of the Government. It tives clear, made up its mind where it was going and worked to that end, we could appreciate its problem and difficulties; but all this uncertainty shows that it is a desperate government. It has thrown sound monetary principles overboard and proposes to raise a loan at a time when it is faced with grave trade and economic problems. In its panic, it is seeking money abroad. It has already been established that the Snowy Mountains project can befinancedfrom revenue, that savings bank deposits are high and that the internal loan market is healthy if only the Government inspires confidence. In July, 1961, there was a total of £1,594,600,000 in savings bank accounts. By February, 1962, the figure had grown to £1,664,900,000-a n increase of £70,300,000. That indicates that the people of this country have money. If appealed to, and if they had confidence in the GoCommon Market, that are now affecting us. vernment, they would subscribe to loans. Our overseas trade position is disturbing, We had the view expressed by Mr Common Market threaten rural industry, Prowse, who is the representative of the the recent increase of 5 per cent, in shipbankers' £700,000,000 in bank overdraft money form of invisibles-freight , interest and available and unused in this country.

Why, even the loan of £55,000,000 which the Governbe disregarded by those honourable memment raised recently was over-subscribed by bers whose responsibility it is to look at £35,000,000! All this surely indicates that these matters. there is no need to go overseas in search of monely to continue with the Snowy Mounstatement by the Minister for Trade( Mr tains undertaking.

At present favorable terms. If one looks at all those it seems to be on the way up, and more matters in an honest way, and faces up to healthy than hitherto. That is to be comour responsibilities, one must hold that mended, and it is pleasing to know that our action should be taken now, and not left to overseas funds position is improving; but if the future, to meet our impending difficulthose funds have taken a new lease of life ties. We have been told that adequate and if this is the result, to some extent, of safeguards are a long way off.

Of charges for the Australian people which course, this has been made up by borrowings will fall with the utmost severity on the from the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and elsewhere. As I insisted from the outcommunity at a time when we may be set, the Government is maintaining the less able to bear the burden than we are country's overseas funds by borrowing. to-day. To me the lesson is clear. If we Borrowing has become the chief means by are able to pay our way now we should do which this Government is retaining its so. In the past, we have paid for the position. The Government seems to have comadmits to bankruptcy at home and abroad pletely disregarded long-term problems in we should continue to pay for this great relation to our balance of payments.

A case has not been made, Mr Deputy Speaker, for this loan of 100,000,000 dollars, l f a private person were to engage in the kind of financial dealings that this Government has engaged in with other countries, and borrowed in the same reckless fashion as this Government has done, and evaded an honest, decent way of managing the household purse in the same way as this Government has done in respect of the nation's purse, that person would be derided in the community and regarded as a very bad risk. The Minister for Trade has left no doubt about the seriousness of the position, yet this Government, with all its difficulties and problems, continues with its reckless borrowing throughout the world. According to the ""Sydney Morning Herald"" of 4th April, the Minister for Trade said that he feared that the Common Market countries were thinking of arrangements for Australian trade that would lead us to a precipice. He saidIt makes me fearful that they are thinking of them in terms that will lead us to a precipice. He went on at length in the same strain. No less a person than Sir John Crawford said that we were glossing over the danger to our trade. A report of Sir John's statement readsThe way Australia was glossing over the effects of Britain's entry into the European Common Market had shocked him, Sir John Crawford said to-day. This appeared in the ""Sydney Morning Herald"" of 4th April. The report continued"" Let us have no nonsense that our exports will not be seriously affected "", he said. "" It is too early to say ' conclusively', but that word is not too strong if some modification to the common agricultural policy is not made. Sir John Crawford is one of the most trusted officers of the Government. think that the honourable member has pursued the subject of the European Common Market for long enough now. Deputy Speaker. I have tried to deal with this matter in my speech because it affects our physical problems and our capacity to repay a debt. Without canvassing your ruling, Mr Deputy Speaker-becaus e I do not intend to proceed on the line I was onI want to say that any person borrowing money privately or publicly should have his position thoroughly examined, and his capacity to repay the debt, and all the problems affecting the repayment, should be carefully analysed. It is the duty of the Parliament to scrutinize these matters and to consider our ability to repay loans in the foreseeable future. Unless we look ahead and consider our earning capacity, the amount that will flow into Australia, and the amount that will flow into our international payments, we will not do justice to the problem. The trend of capital outflow is a matter of ever-increasing concern for the Parliament. Before we borrow overseas, we should carefully count the cost. We should clearly and surely establish the need to borrow and we should be certain of our ability to repay the loan without impoverishing our people. If the Government were about to commence a new major project for which there was a shortage of equipment, plant and skills, a case could be made for the borrowing of money from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. If the loan were to be raised for the long-promised Burdekin scheme and if our resources of capital and labour were strained, favorable consideration could be given to the proposal. If the Government were shaken out of its inertia and proposed to go ahead with a great scheme of development in northern Australia, again favorable consideration could be given to the loan proposal, provided that our resources of capital, skills and labour were exhausted. But the Snowy Mountains scheme has proved beyond any shadow of doubt that we have the capacity to finance huge undertakings, and that we have a work force with the necessary ability. Consequently, no case has been made to justify the Government rushing off to the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development in search of a loan of 100,000,000 dollars, which will impose a have to pay it.",34,Reconstruction And Developivient Bill 1962
88,Mr Deputy Speaker,Order! I,37,Reconstruction And Developivient Bill 1962
89,Mr Luchetti,"Thank you, Mr burden on the future generations that willThe strange conduct of the Government is revealed in its stark absurdity by the recent repayment of loans of £78,000,000 to the International Monetary Fund at interest of only 2 per cent., whilst the Parliament is being asked to approve a loan of £44,700,000 at 5* per cent. If there is any justification for this course, I should like to hear of it from the Minister assisting the Treasurer ( Mr Bury), the Treasurer himself or some person of responsibility in the Parliament. Truly this is a paradoxical situation and it cannot be justified. The position of our overseas balances, largely built up on borrowings and capital inflow, has been ignored by the Treasurer. The figures tell of a growth in the capital structure of overseas companies whose interest in Australia depends on their capacity to make profits here. 1 refer the House to one special case which shows the threat to our ability to meet our debts, and that is the development of General MotorsHolden's Proprietary Limited. In its last published balance-sheet honourable member should let that subject rest and get back to tbe bill. is of vital concern, because £8,400,000 was sent out of this country in one year. If the trend persists, our ability to meet repayments of loans must be damaged. There cannot be any evasion of these facts. What is true of General Motors-Holden's Proprietary Limited is true also of overseas companies in other spheres. This is a damning indictment of the financial policy of the Government. The Government has not taken these matters into consideration, either in the flotation of the loan that is now before us for consideration or in any other financial matter affecting the nation. In reluctantly passing over the sad and pathetic story of General Motors-Holden's Proprietary Limited, I commend the general thought in that subject to honourable members. The matter of overseas investments in Australia is linked with our financial problem. We cannot dissociate the two. They are very closely linked because they both relate to our capacity as a nation to repay money borrowed overseas. The honourable member for Scullin( Mr Peters) raised the question of our capacity to meet these repayments abroad and, in replying, the Treasurer acknowledged that the service charges on overseas investments were quite a substantial burden for the nation to bear. Having regard to all these matters, I say that there are dangers in borrowing abroad instead of adopting a more Keynesian philosophy of skimming off the available funds in this country to meet our commitments internally so that we will not be condemned in the future by the people who will be called on to meet payments on overseas loans. I repeat that the repatriation of profits by overseas companies is seriously affecting our capacity to meet our loan repayments. The full effect of overseas investments has not yet become apparent. Quite a lot of money has been re-invested and these compounding profits will eventually leave Australia. In doing so they will pose serious problems for the nation and for the parliaments of the future. The outflow could cause serious damage to our balance of payments and to our national solvency. For that reason we should not borrow unnecessarily and not load the nation with a serious interest burden. I have looked at some very interesting statistics on overseas investments in Australia. They have a direct relationship to our borrowing and are certainly most startling. The"" Annual Bulletin of Overseas Investment in Australia, 1959-60, New Series No. 5"" shows that the inflow in 1947-48 was £38,400,000, and in 1959-60, £108,900,000. We have to take into consideration the effect this inflow will have on the country in the future. The Australian Labour Party is not opposed to the inflow of capital, but we must always remember that profits will leave the country, either when earned or later. It is not for me, in this debate, to weigh the advantages and disadvantages of capital inflow, and I do not propose to do so. I merely state that the repatriation of profits imposes a serious burden on the nation and accordingly we should carefully consider the dangers of further borrowing. A recent report from the Commonwealth Bureau of Census and Statistics shows that the annual inflow of capital in 1959 was",37,Reconstruction And Developivient Bill 1962

The Government has decided to old arguments have been trotted out again, borrow overseas in order to make additional but they have not been applied on this money available for the more rapid developoccasion as directly as in the past. BeforeI discuss the bill and the borrowing from the International Bank for the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric project, I shall deal with some matters raised by the honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr us what is to be bought with the money Luchetti). He said that this is a borrowing government-that this Government has adopted borrowing as a means of maintaining its position abroad. What he fails to see is the conclusion which must be drawn from this: We are able to borrow merely because we are a country with a very high credit rating. The honourable member said, also, that we should borrow money. As I have already mentioned, I looked through the reports of the debates on the occasion of previous borrowings such as these. I found some remarks made by the present Leader not then Leader of the Opposition-o n 7th December, 1950, at the second-reading stage of the Loan (International Bank for Reconstruction and Development) Bill 1950. As reported at page 4018 of Volume 211 of "" Hansard "", he saidOne plank of the platform of the Labour Party is, "" No more overseas borrowings"". We have development of the scheme, if possible, in had enough of that policy in the past. . . . the Chifley Government . . . did for capital development-by obtaining loan not raise one penny by way of loan overseas during funds, so that the scheme can be paid off its term of office.

There has been a great declaration that the Australian Labour Party deal of complaint from the Opposition about has no interest in developing this country as rapidly and as effectively as possible. true one. the Minister for Air, the statement is not even a true one. However, the declaration ment of our great Commonwealth. I think that another thing that the honourable member for Macquarie said is worthy of some attention. He said that the Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt) had not told borrowed. I would have thought that the Treasurer's second-reading speech made it perfectly clear that the money borrowed is to be used to finance what may be described as the Murray stage of the Snowy Mountains project. The Treasurer said that, as money was paid to the contractors, funds would be drawn from the International Bank. That is the way in which the proceeds of the loan will be spentin the completing of these works on the Snowy Mountains project. Evidently, the honourable member for Macquarie did not take that in when he heard the Minister's speech. The honourable member said also that he wanted to know the reason for the changed policy on the financing of the Snowy Mountains project. The reason can be only that we want to find the money for the the classic way in which money is found over a period as the capital works come",38,Reconstruction And Developivient Bill 1962

96,Mr Snedden,"As I am reminded by the Government financing capital works from revenue. Capital works are now being financed from loan moneys, but Opposition members still complain. Really, they just do not know what they want! The honourable member for Macquarie said that the Government should have told -the House what goods will be bought with the money borrowed from the International Bank and where the goods will be obtained. It appears that the honourable member has confused past borrowings from the bank with the present loan. In the past, Australia has borrowed from the bank what were known as basket loans. These enabled the Commonwealth to provide the exchange for individuals to purchase equipment from other countries. When earlier loans were obtained, the bank was prepared to let Australia have a lump sum which was paid over by the bank on the presentation of certificates of payment. Under that arrangement, a person in Australia who wanted to import heavy machinery, perhaps from the United States of America, was able to apply to the exchange control authorities, obtain the necessary exchange and pay for the goods in the normal way as an ordinary business transaction. The Commonwealth Government then presented to the International Bank what may be described as the receipt and the bank made dollar funds available. That was the way in which a basket loan worked. The bank gave Australia the right to borrow in that fashion at a time when it refused other countries borrowings on the same terms. The bank has since turned its back completely on these basket loans and will now lend only on a specific project. So, the Commonwealth, in order to borrow from the bank, has had to nominate a specific project as the basis for the borrowing. The specific project proposed is the Murray stage of the Snowy Mountains project. It is true that investigators from the bank came to Australia and examined, if one so wishes to describe them, the economics of the Australian Government. In any event, the investigators decided that this developmental project was a sound economic proposition. The recommendation of the investigators prevailed and the loan was made available. Those are the reasons for this loan, and I would have thought that they were rather obvious to anybody who proposed to speak in this debate. The honourable member for Macquarie said that Australia's overseas position would not improve under this Government. He stated that this country is in a morass. He himself said that at present our overseas reserves total about £440,000,000, notwithstanding the fact that, only a matter of weeks ago, £78,000,000 was paid back to the International Monetary Fund because the money was no longer required to meet any possible decline in our overseas funds. The honourable member said, also, that he would expect under-developed countries to borrow from the bank rather than countries like Australia. The very basis of the bank's lending is an assessment of whether or not a sound economic project is proposed. We in Australia have been able to satisfy the bank's tests, whereas other countries have not always been able to satisfy those tests. If my memory serves me correctly, 57 countries are members of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Therefore, there are 57 potential borrowers. Loans have already been made to, I think, almost 50 countries. If my memory serves me correctly again, 27 loans were made to various countries in the financial year 1960-61, as is disclosed in the bank's last annual report. These are the things which demonstrate the illogicality of the arguments of the honourable member for Macquarie. All the countries of the world seek to borrow from this bank, because funds available from this source make it possible to undertake development projects over a long term when they cannot be financed out of revenue or, alternatively, there are competing demands for the revenue funds available. When the honourable member for Macquarie, for the fifth time, says that the Treasurer should tell us from what countries goods are to be bought and where we are to get the skills required, we may find the answer in the report of the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority. This report will show where the money is going to be spent. It will be spent on payments to contractors. I will come to that in a moment, when I talk about the schedule to the bill, which describes the projects on which the money will be spent. The honourable member talks about the ment-although , mark you, Labour spokeschambers of manufactures and about emmen still conceal this objective when ployment. The honourable member may not speaking at election campaigns. be aware of it, but to my knowledge at least two of the contractors performing work bill. It is not a very remarkable docufor the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric ment. It has very few clauses, but it has Authority are members of chambers of a number of schedules. The first schedule manufactures. I am quite sure that if the contains the agreement between the Aushonorable member took the trouble to ask tralian Government and the International representatives of the Associated Chambers Bank for Reconstruction and Developof Manufactures what their attitude is toment. This schedule contains several wards this borrowing he would find that they articles which are themselves important, wholeheartedly support it. To suggest that because they set out the terms upon which they do not is to depart from reality. The honourable member tells us that Austo go into them in detail. One of the tralian workers will be on the dole while sections of the agreement covers provisions equipment is being imported. This is absofor paying back the money. It is worth lute nonsense, for reasons that I wiil point noting that the first date set down for the out later.

This is the kind 1961. The successful tenderers were Utah Construction and Engineering Proprietary The contract amount was The contract for the Eucumbene-Snowy June, 1966. For the Murray1 pressure tunnel the contract was signed on lst March, 1962, the contract again being let to Thiess Brothers Proprietary Limited. For this project the contract amount was £8,800,000 and the completion date, June, 1966. In the case of the Murray1 pressure pipeline no contract has yet been placed. Tenders closed on 5th March, 1962, and the contract calls for completion in June, 1966. As for the Murray1 power station, tenders are to be advertised in the immediate future, and the contract will call for completion in June, 1966. The work that will be carried out by the expenditure of this loan money will result, of course, in a build-up of the work force on the Snowy scheme. At present there are 4,700 employees of contractors on Snowy projects. This figure does not include any administrative staff of the authority itself. It is expected that by December of 1962 this number will have increased to 5,500, and the peak level of between 6,500 and 7,000 is expected to be reached in the last quarter of 1963. Of course, the rate of increase of the work force cannot be accurately predicted. It will depend on factors that are themselves unpredictable, sucb as the nature of underground rock conditions and the severity of winter weather. It is quite clear from conditions in and regarded as very great, especially when you around capital cities, and from information know that the bank itself raises a tremenavailable to the officers of the Commondous amount of its funds by debentures wealth Employment Service, that there is in and recently raised money on the New at least two sections of industry a rapidly York money market and had to pay somedeveloping condition of full employment. thing of the order of 4$ per cent.

In addition, we have a public amount to 317,200,000 dollars. Of the total works programme which I think could of those loans at 31st March last there safely be described as more extensive than remained outstanding 235,800,000 dollars. any other programme in Australia's history. But one should make the point that all I think I can safely say that the public those repayments have been made comsector of the economy is more active to-day pletely and directly in accordance with the than it has ever been. In these circumamortization schedule set out in the stances, we may well consider the numbers of persons who are now registered as unemployed and wonder where these people will be re-absorbed in the work-force. There is no doubt that this legislation providing for extra money for the Snowy project is a good bill, and a proper one for this House to pass. I think is it worthwhile reading a statement which appears in the Twelfth Annual Report of the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority for the yearended 30th June, 1961:Since 1949, when the Scheme was started, the interest rate has increased from 3i per cent, to 5i per cent. Such a significant variation has had a marked effect on the cost of energy since interest is by far the major cost factor. When one considers the increase of the interest rate as set out in that statement, one sees that the rate of 5$ per cent, provided for in this legislation is by no means unreasonably high. When you look at the 5i per cent, you realize that it includes a 1 per cent, commission. Actually it is a gross misnomer to describe it as a commission and I think the word "" commission "" has misled the honourable member for Macquarie. The1 per cent, which is called a commission charge is the amount charged to all borrowers and goes into a fund to build up the lendable funds from the bank itself. So the amount of 5i per cent, cannot be The5 i per cent, has to repay the amount agreements under which those moneys were borrowed on each occasion. I think this bill is a good one and that the consequence of it, the authorization of this borrowing programme, will have a tremendous effect on the development of our great national projects. I do not believe, as many people express themselves as believing, that borrowing overseas is, per se, bad. On the contrary, I believe it is desirable to raise loan funds for great development projects. I believe, further, that we ought to borrow overseas whenever loans on reasonable and appropriate terms and conditions are available to us, because the money we borrow adds to the great sum of money which the people of this country can put into its development and the development of projects necessary to creating conditions where our population and our standards of living can grow. I think anybody who holds a contrary view completely overlooks the realities of our economic development which history has shown over the years.

The basic purpose of this bill is to obtain the approval of Parliament to an agreement made between the Commonwealth and Queensland governments to regulate the production and marketing of sugar within the Commonwealth for a period of six years from lst September, 1961. The 1956-61 Sugar Agreement expired on 31st August, 1961, and the two governments agreed, by an exchange of letters, to extend the agreement in its existing form time for consideration of the report of the Sugar Inquiry Committee which was then investigating the sugar industry and its financial relationship with the manufactured fruits industry.

98,Mr Adermann (Fisher,"Minister foris covered by various protective and preferential trading arrangements. In the case of Australia nearly one-third of our production and well over 50 per cent, of our exports have to compete on the free market, so our sugar industry is exposed to world market forces far more than most other producing countries. In some people's minds the words "" protected industry"" carry with them the idea of a permanently inflated home consumption price, but this is not true in the case of sugar. Because of the sugar agreements there have been extended periods when the domestic consumer has been able to purchase sugar at a cheaper price than would have been the case had Australia been purchasing her sugar on the world market. The sugar agreements, therefore, are not one-sided arrangements by any means. Of equal importance to price is the frankness and full publication, as I think assurance of supplies. Past agreements have every one will appreciate, do nothing but ensured, and this one will continue to provide ensure, that no matter how attractive the competitors. overseas price might be, the Australian market has first call for all its needs at the prices fixed by the sugar agreement. I am our sugar exports have to compete on the sure all honourable members will agree that world market and I am sure all honourable to have guaranteed supplies at stable prices members will agree that it would be foolish, is a very desirable position to be in with any especially at this difficult period, when for basic commodity, and also that this position every buyer there are many sellers, for us can only be achieved when the industry to publish an authoritative report on the producing the commodity has a guarantee workings of our industry and its cost strucof long-term stability.

In 1960, the Government appointed a a quantity of sugar which is, by and large, committee of three, under the chairmanthe aggregate of domestic consumption ship of Sir Mortimer McCarthy, the former and export quotas under international Chairman of the Tariff Board, to investisugar agreements plus a safety margin to gate the industry. I have already tabled allow for a bad season-that is, ""mill extracts from the committee's report, and peaks"". This term is not to be misconit will be seen from them that the comstrued as meaning all that the mills can F.2789/62 -R -[59 J mittee found there was no inefficiency in any section of the industry and that there was constant striving for even greater efficiency. The committee's report cannot be published in full because, although the inquiry was essentially a public inquiry, and public hearings were held in every State, the committee was also commissioned to accept information in confidence, and it did accept information from the sugar industry on that basis. The main body of the report which the committee submitted to the Government contains frequent and extensive reference to this confidential material, and publication of the full report would not be possible without betraying the trust placed in the committee. This Government is all in favour of open investigations and reports, but under certain circumstances undesirable advantages to As I said earlier, over 50 per cent, of and the recommendations which I have The Government has already announced is designed to return to growers and millers the average cost of production in respect of produce; it represents the quantity which the Queensland Governnient guarantees to acquire or, in the case of New South Wales mills, purchase in any year. Sometimes, and this year is a case in point, the Queensland Government decides it will take more than "" mill peaks ""--exces s sugar this is called-bu t when it does, this sugar is taken at "" producer's risk"" and does not enter into the domestic price formula. Our exports exceed domestic consumption and this has been the case for some considerable time. The suggestion made by the majority of the committee was that the quantity of exports taken into account in determining the domestic price should only be equal to the quantity consumed at home. They further suggested that this formula should be written into the agreement and immediately applied, and that the domestic price of sugar be reduced by one half-penny per lb. The Government has not accepted this recommendation. It seemed to us wrong in principle to throw overboard the mill peaks formula which has been at the core of all the previous agreements. All the controls on production imposed by the Queensland Government are based on the concept of mill peaks, and the industry has been brought up to its present stage of development because of the assurances inherent in the agreements that domestic price would be based on such a quantity. The majority recommendation on the price of sugar was qualified in a very important way. The report says with reference to that recommendationThe Committee's conclusions regarding the domestic price of sugar are based on a continuance of conditions that have existed in the past. It then directs attention to some clouds which it indicated were then appearing on the sugar marketing horizon. The committee's report was completed in August last year when the free market price was about £stg.28 per ton, and at that time the biggest cloud had not yet appeared. I refer, of course, to the suspension of quotas under the International Sugar Agreement. This has thrown the whole free sugar market into confusion. The price has since dropped as low as £19 15s. sterling per ton and, although at the moment it has recovered to about £25 sterling, there seems little prospect of a sustained recovery from these very low prices for some time at least. Apart from other considerations, it would clearly have been unreasonable to have introduced a new concept into the domestic market price formula at a period when the future prospects for export prices are anything but bright. The Government therefore decided to retain the existing formula for determining the domestic price and the prices in the new agreement are unaltered. The wholesale price of refined sugar for domestic use will remain at £90 5s. 2d. per ton which, with the customary sellers' margin, permits sugar to be retailed at l i d . per lb. in all State capital cities. The prices to manufacturers will also be unchanged. This agreement is probably one of the most important between the Commonwealth and a State, because although it is called the Sugar Agreement, and is between the Commonwealth and the State of Queensland, its ramifications, through the system of domestic and export sugar rebates, extend far beyond the sugar industry and Queensland. They affect every grower and processor of canning fruits and every exporter of goods containing sugar. The new agreement provides that the sugar rebate system will continue in substantially the same form as at present. The rate of domestic rebate remains at £5 per ton of sugar used in products made from Australian fruit for which a reasonable price has been paid. The method of calculating the export rebates is basically the same as in the present agreement. Such changes as have been made in relation to the rebates have been dictated by the experience gained in administering the rebate arrangements. The domestic rebate system is designed to stabilize the canning fruit growing industry and, despite the apparent smallness of the incentive provided to induce processors to pay for fruit the minimum prices which are declared each year by the Fruit Industry Sugar Concession Committee, it has worked effectively, as growers of canning fruits know. The committee, which was appointed to investigate the sugar industry, was also commissioned to investigate the financial relationship between that industry and the canning fruits industry. In its report the committee said that it could see no fundamental reason why the stabilizing factor for the canning fruits industry should be provided through the domestic rebate system, and it recommended that future policy should be directed towards reducing the rebate, and restricting its field of operation with the ultimate object of removing the rebate arrangement from the sugar agreements. Despite any weaknesses there may be in the system, it works, as I said earlier, very for changing it, especially at this time when the future of the export markets for canning fruit is far from assured. The agreement provides that the State of motion for printing a statement on West Queensland shall, on behalf of the sugar New Guinea made by the Minister for Exterindustry, continue to contribute £264,000 nal Affairs( Sir Garfield Barwick).

IfI might say so with respect, the Leader of the Opposition falls into this state of frantic uncertainty because he confuses policy with an instrument of policy. I should like to illustrate that point by taking up the topic of war. I am sure the honourable gentleman, were he present in the House, would agree with me that war is not a policy but an instrument of policy; or perhaps, more frequently, it is just an expedient which is adopted when all other instruments of policy fail. But still, in his speech, the honourable gentleman repeated a statement which he made outside the House on 7th February. He saidIf Indonesia seeks to use force to create a potential threat to Australia's security, then 1 say, that clear view, then he was only talking with all due regard to the gravity of the situation, that threat must be faced. It is true that a little later in his speech he said some words which, if one tries to interpret them might be taken to mean that he really did not mean war; he really meant to use, in his own words, "" renewed diplomatic activity"". But in the meantime, since 7th February, whatever he might mean now, the honourable gentleman has obtained in certain quarters outside this House a warm approval for his firm and war-like showing. He has been hailed as a man who was prepared to face up to the threat of war, to answer force by force, to show strength and fight, if not to the last ditch, at least to the next self, and all honourable members, would election. Is the Leader of the Opposition in fact Guinea dispute. Even if it came to hostilisuch a war-like character and is this, in ties against our soil, the hope would be not fact, Labour policy? Are these words of in war as a hope in itself but for a settle7th February an expression of Labour ment. Was the Leader of the Opposition policy? The honourable gentleman certainly really thinking that he was prompting a conveyed the impression that he was a strong settlement by talking as he did? This, of man even if he does not clearly maintain course, is a matter of judgment. I wonder that role now. Perhaps-particularl y in whether it is the judgment of all view of the silence of his own party when honourable members in the ALP, that I asked them if this meeting of force with the Leader of the Opposition was force was Labour policyI might criticize helping a settlement when he talked him for having changed his mind and ask: as he did on 7th February. I suggest What made him do so? When the bugle that it was a thoughtless statement, first was blown, did the awkward squad of the because it was not going to improve the Labour Party refuse to fall in? Did he have second thoughts? Did he realize that he had spoken in rather a foolish way? But I am not going to take that line of criticism or attack. I will not criticize him for changing his mind, because I recognize that I would have great difficulty in trying to prove that a man had changed his mind when all I could demonstrate was that he had only a muddle inside his head. How could I argue that he had changed his mind when we had difficulty in understanding what his mind was and what was the reality behind these muddled werds and the silence of the Labour Party concerning them? Let us apply one test to him by asking whether these words of 7th February were well-considered words. Let us apply the test by asking what he really did mean when he said that force should be resisted. Did he have a clear view about when and where and how, with what and at what time it was going to be resisted? If he did not have wildly and dangerously. On the one hand he was misleading the Australian people, and on the other hand he was offering, not resistance but only a tangle of words to the comfort of the people of New Guinea. Let us apply a second test to this question of whether his words of 7th February were well considered. Did he really think that this was the best way in which he could improve the situation in West New Guinea? Did he really think that talking in this fashion was the best contribution he could make to bringing about a happy state of affairs in New Guinea? I am sure the honourable gentleman himagree when I say that we do not want war. We want a settlement of the West New situation and, more seriously, because it showed a disregard of the surrounding world circumstances. On this point I would quote some words of which I wholly approve, and which were spoken by the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley) in the debate which followed. IfI might say so without appearing to patronize or praise or offer anything gratuitous, the honourable member for Fremantle expressed the reality of the situation when he said as reported in «' Hansard ""at page 1173I do not think there is any doubt that Indonesia is being urged on to war by the Soviet Union. . . I have no doubt that Communist China, the Soviet Union and the P.K.I -the Communist Party of Indonesia-desir e Indonesia to start a war but it is extremely doubtful whether they desire Indonesia to succeed in that war. Lenin had a policy of revolutionary defeatism which could be put into effect in several ways. If a situation which involves disposing of the Indonesia entered upon an unsuccessful war with the Netherlands, and if as a result Nasution and Soekarno were discredited, the Communist Party's chances of taking over the country would be enhanced. Communists have a vested interest in disaster. It is not necessary for me to commit myself to total agreement with what the honourable member said, but I do suggest that he showed a real awareness of the fact that the situation in West New Guinea is surrounded by many other situations which must be taken into account before we reach judgment on it. This statement does remind us of something that we must never forget-that there is a great conflict going on in the world to-day, and that it is impossible to separate any international incident from that total conflict. Of course, all these matters with which we are dealing would be very simple if it were not for the fact that a world contest of power is being waged. All these matters would be plain and straightforward if it were not for the ideological conflict, and for those forces which are dividing the world on such false issues as race and colonialism. honourable member for Yarra( Mr Cairns) publicly confesses that the people who are stimulating those forces of division are shocking fellows. I think he said it ironically. If he said it ironically it is less to his credit than it would be had he said it sincerely. What is the issue here? If we separate from this great world conflict the issue that is peculiar to West New Guinea surely it is the issue of what happens to a few hundreds of thousands of people who live in West New Guinea-peopl e who cannot speak for themselves and most of whom are quite unaware of what is going on to settle their fate. The honourable member for Fremantle, whom I seem to be quoting rather freely, spoke against what he called "" trading in people"". It is an effective phrase and a true phrase. The issue here does concern that question of trading in people. Is the fate of a few hundred thousand people to be decided against their will without any opportunity being given to them to express their own choice? Let those who talk a lot about colonialism in various parts of the world remember that the situation here is present and the future of several hundred thousand people without bothering about their own views. It might seem a trifling In the world to-day only the matter to a world which has murdered millions but surely, close to our doors, it is the paramount question that must concern us. I should like to give a second example of what I call the confusion between policy and instruments of policy in the mind of the Leader of the Opposition. I find this illustration from his references to the United Nations, and I quote his speech. He saidI charge the Government with having failed to take the initiative in the United Nations. And he quoted from his own policy speech of last November to this effectWe believe that the dispute over Dutch New Guinea should be resolved in the United Nations. That is all very well and good; but what he does not say and what he should be expected to say is what precisely it is that he intends to place before the United Nations, and in what terms. He overlooks the fact that this issue has been before the United Nations on several occasions. He ignores the results of the previous debates, and he ignores the pattern of voting revealed in the United Nations on each occasion. He overlooks the efforts made by the Secretary General of the United Nations to bring the parties into negotiation with one another. Once again, does not the honourable gentleman realize the political realities of conditions in the United Nations to-day?",46,Sugar Agreement Bill 1962

We know as a sad fact the principle that they had fought to of the post-war world that force and the establish. threat of force have succeeded. This is another point where we who want peace, we who want the aggressor to fail, must again apply our minds as best as we can to of self-determination, probably the most that particular problem.

In the particular case under notice this prinpromote ciple of sovereignty is surely linked with policy that we hope will be observed in the idea that any settlement of a dispute is any settlement regarding the future of West reached by a negotiation between two New Guinea. sovereign powers, and that except by agreement by those sovereign powers there further discussions towards a settlement in should be no change in sovereignty. There West New Guinea are taking place. This is can be changes in sovereignty and territory, primarily a matter for the Netherlands and but not by disregard for territorial rights or Indonesia.

I personally, on behalf of the Government, have That is the policy that we have tried to in our own territory. That is the It is a matter of common knowledge that but as a close neighbour of both parties and as a nation that wants to live in friendship and harmony with both of them we hope that whatever settlement is reached will be reached without force or the threat of force, and that it will respect sovereignty, which means, in effect, that it will be reached only by agreement between the parties. Above all, we hope that it will reserve completely the right of the people of West New Guinea to choose their own future. It will be a bad settlement if it does not observe those three principles. It will not only be a bad settlement; it will be a settlement which flies in the face of international morality and, if the United Nations Charter is to be considered as law, a settlement which flies in the face of international law. -Order! The Minister's time has expired. of the principal reasons for the Government's being so slow and ineffective in putting the argument on self-determination in the United Nations has been the protracted and patriarchal performance of the Minister for Territories ( Mr Hasluck), who has just spoken, in the administration of Australia's own trust territory. Under Article 76 (b) of the charter of the United Nations, Australia's obligation is to promote the political, economic, social and educational advancement of the inhabitants of the territory. In relation to political advancement, how genuine will our plea of self-determination appear when, after 80 years, we have failed to train one Papuan to the stage where he is capable of casting a vote? If, however, we have trained any Papuans to that stage, how genuine will our plea appear when we have failed to give one Papuan a vote? Again, how genuine will our plea appear in relation to economic advancement when we have imposed some limitation, if not a complete limitation, upon the production in the Territory of so many of the crops that it can produce and the world can consume? Then, how genuine will our argument of self-determination appear in relation to educational advancement when we have provided primary education, which the Government recognizes, for only one child in five in the Territory; when for a school population of well over 500,000 we have provided secondary education for some 1,500 or 1,600, technical education for some 700 at the most, and when we have provided three undergraduates, all in their first year? Whenever anybody makes so bold as to reveal this performance in the Australian Parliament, the Minister for Territories seeks to stifle discussion by appealing to our patriotic reticences. I do not suggest that there have not been successes in Australia's administration of its two New Guinea Territories, but as in so many of these matters, what successes this Government has had have been inherited from its predecessor. Before the war Australia spent nothing in the mandated Territory of New Guinea and spent £40,000 a year in Papua. Under the administration of my colleague, the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward), the legislation was passed under which the Territory of Papua and New Guinea was given a legislative council, local government councils and cooperative societies, the indenture system was terminated and administration schools were set up in Papua. As in so many matters concerning the Territory the Government has been too complacent since that time. In 1957, without consultation with Indonesia which was known to be a claimant to West New Guinea, the Government made an agreement with the Netherlands concerning the administration of the whole island. Now the Government says that the Netherlands is proceeding too fast. The Government has still done nothing to harmonize and synchronize self-determination in the two halves of the island. The position in West New Guinea derives from the fact that this Government has not inherited a policy but has had to devise one for itself. Indonesia was recognized as independent on 27th December, 1949, and was admitted to the United Nations ten months later. In all other matters of foreign affairs in the last decade, the Menzies Government has followed the United States, or where, as with Cyprus and Suez, the British Government has followed a more war-like or colonial attitude, it has followed the United Kingdom. But in West New Guinea the United States and the United Kingdom have studiously avoided any involvement. The Menzies Government has had to devise a policy unaided and accordingly its policy is now in ruins.",48,Sugar Agreement Bill 1962

106,Mr Whitlam (Werriwa) [8.20],"On eThe fumbling fatuity of the Government's foreign policy sufficiently emerged from the speech delivered almost four weeks ago by the latest Minister for External Affairs( Sir Garfield Barwick), but the defeats and retreats of the Government were fully exposed by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr blooded lie arises, it cannot be sheeted home Calwell) a fortnight after that. He was followed in the debate, not at the usual week's interval but immediately, by the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies). The Prime Minister sought to avoid the whole issue first with a hoary chestnut-deplorin g the personal abuse of his friend, the Leader of the Opposition, and saying that he always afterwards received an apology for it. Even jurymen give a wan smile as that one is trotted out these days. But more ominously, the Prime Minister then said that the Leader of the Opposition would be caught in a coldblooded lie on the question of self-determination. The Leader of the Opposition, in fact, was completely factual in his analysis of the Government's attitude on self-determination. He traced the history of this Government's belated acceptance of and emphasis on the principle of self-determination in respect of the western half of the island. Then he deplored the fact, that, having at last come to emphasize that issue, the Government was abandoning it. He had previously quoted the following words from the Prime Minister's own statement a year ago:What Australia has done in the United Nations when the West New Guinea item has come up there is to support sovereignty and domestic jurisdiction. Sovereignty is basic for Australia no less than for others, including Indonesia. The Leader of the Opposition demonstrated from the Prime Minister's own words that in the United Nations Australia has never pushed the argument of self-determination in respect of West New Guinea. The Prime Minister, who had had two bours in which to read the speech of the Leader of the Opposition before it was commenced-the e hours by the time he had commenced his own speech-deliberatel y misinterpreted it and quoted from his own speeches to this House in the past. He quoted from a speech made a year ago, after the visit by General Nasution, to show that he had in fact mentioned self-determination. The Leader of the Opposition showed from the Prime Minister's own words that the right honourable gentleman had never urged self-determination in the United Nations. Indeed, the record shows that Australia has never emphasized it in the United Nations. If the question of a coldto the Leader of the Opposition. In the United Nations, this Government has always emphasized, as the Prime Minister said, sovereignty and domestic jurisdiction. It has taken the same attitude as it took on Algeria and on Cyprus-inci dentally, long after France and Great Britain were no longer seeking to emphasize this attitude. It is interesting to note the transformation in the Prime Minister's own attitude. If one looks through his speech of three years ago after the visit by Dr. Subandrio and the communique of Mr Casey, as he then was, one finds that self determination was mentioned fifth and last in the list of objectives. A year ago, after the Prime Minister's own conversations with General Nasution, he at last realized the point. He saw the validity and the logic of it and mentioned it under nearly every heading. He was some years behind Mr Casey. Mr Casey, in 1954, in the first edition of his book "" Friends and Neighbours "", did not mention the question of self-determination in respect of West New Guinea. He first mentioned it in the second edition of that opus. The question of West New Guinea had arisen on four occasions before the last session in the United Nations. In 1954, Mr Casey spoke in the General Assembly and Sir Percy Spender in the First Committee; in 1955, Mr Casey in the General Assembly and Sir Percy Spender in both the First Committee and the Assembly; in 1956, Mr Casey in the General Assembly and Sir Percy Spender in the committee; and in 1957, Mr Casey in the First Committee. On each occasion, self-determination was given no more than a perfunctory nod. It was never in the forefront of our arguments. We always relied on matters of defence or on the fact that West New Guinea was alien to Indonesia in race, language, history and religion. All the specious arguments were put forward, and the only logical and moral argument was never emphasized. Selfdetermination is a good argument, and its strength has never yet been put in the United Nations by this Government's representatives. The strength of the argument lies in the fact that for more than 40 years the League of Nations and the United Nations have said that the inhabitants of the eastern half of the island of New Guinea are not yet fit to govern themselves, and they have accepted Australia's offer to train them to the stage at which they will be fit to govern themselves. In all logic and morality, the same argument should apply to the western half of the island. But the comparison between the eastern and the western halves bas never been put by this Government's representatives in the United Nations. The argument might well have succeeded. I recall that when my colleague, the honourable member for East Sydney, was Minister for Territories, and Dr. Evatt, who is now the Chief Justice of New South Wales, was Minister for External Affairs, Australia obtained the permission of the United Nations to administer jointly its own colony and its own trust territory. Are our arguments no longer effectively put? The argument is just as effective. The same argument could have been put for the whole of the island, and could any one have gainsaid it? several years past, has put the argument that we merely wish the people of the whole island to be given the opportunity, in sections, if you wish, to determine how they shall be governed-independently , as part of Indonesia or as part of some Melanesian federation, if they wish, within the British Commonwealth of Nations. But this Government still puts the argument of self determination in only a subsidiary place. The Minister of Territories tonight put it third after territorial integrity and sovereignty. Territorial integrity and sovereignty, of course, can be served just as well by Indonesia incorporating the territory as by the Netherlands retaining it. The argument of self-determination is put by this Government only to be undermined by the argument that we shall forget about self-determination, first, if the two parties to the dispute, peaceably and without threats, settle their differences, or, secondly, succeeded in having it handled there. But if the International Court of lustice decides the matter one way or another. So ingenuous are we about this reference to the World Court that we persisted in the suggestion in 1957 when the matter was last raised in the United Nations and more recently through the Prime Minister's own lips in this place, even after Sir Percy Spender became a judge of the court. And Sir Percy Spender is one judge whose earlier misconceptions and misrepresentations of the Indonesian case could not command that country's confidence. The Minister for External Affairs, a month ago, was at pains to distinguish between the obligations of member countries to non-self-governing territories like the Australian and the Dutch colonies under Article 73 (b) of the United Nations Charter to develop self-government I quote his gloss, "" not, it may be observed, independence""-and , on the other hand, their obligations to a trust territory under Article 76 (b) to promote development towards self-government or independence. Indonesia accepts the obligations under Article 73 (b), which applies to self-government but not independence. The Netherlands now accepts, and Australia always has accepted in respect of Papua as well as the trust territory, the obligations under Article 76 (b). If Indonesia were to accept those latter obligations, there could be no objection to the Indonesian claim. The object My own leader, for of Australian diplomacy should be to ensure, through the United Nations, that Indonesia accepts as fully the enlarged obligations to the inhabitants of West New Guinea as Australia has always accepted the obligations to eastern New Guinea and as the Netherlands latterly has accepted the obligations to West New Guinea. We cannot assume that Indonesia would be less able to train for self-government than the Dutch are. The Dutch might spend more. But in West New Guinea, as we know from the Australian part of New Guinea, a great deal of the expenditure is for the benefit of expatriate citizens. I dealt earlier with the special pleading by the Prime Minister. Then there was the special pleading by the Minister for External Affairs. I point out that, under the Labour Government, Australia persuaded the United States of America to join with it in taking this matter to the United Nations, and under the Menzies Government, we have deliberately by-passed the United Nations. This is probably because, in 1954, 1955, 1956 and 1957, we voted on every occasion -and not only voted, but also were foremost in speaking-agains t successive propositions that the United Nations should deal with this very matter. Sir Percy Spender and Mr Casey, at every session of the United Nations General Assembly in 1954, 1955 and 1956, said that there was no threat to peace in this area. On every occasion, they said that this matter should not be discussed, because discussion of it would only put heat into the argument. They buried their heads in the sand in these three sessions, and Mr Casey did so again in the 1957 session. Is it any wonder, Sir, that our neighbours have come to regard the Australian coat of arms as featuring not an emu but an ostrich? I ask honourable members to look at the text of the four successive resolutions. The Government is now too shame-faced to sponsor in the United Nations the very propositions which it opposed on four previous occasions. The Minister for External Affairs would have us believe that the resolutions we supported failed last year because of the new members of the United Nations since 1955. There were sixteen new admissions to the organization in 1955 and seventeen in 1960. If the vote on the Brazzaville resolution had been confined to the countries which belonged to the United Nations before 1955, the resolution still would not have succeeded in obtaining the necessary two-thirds of the votes. It would have received 34 votes to 21, with 9 abstentions. If the countries admitted in 1960 had been excluded, the resolution would also have failed to obtain a two-thirds majority of the votes. It would have received 38 votes to 36, with 9 abstentions. The point of view which we took on the Indian resolution, similarly, did not receive two-thirds of the votes. Nor would it have come any nearer to receiving such a majority if the vote had been confined to the countries which belonged to the United Nations before 1955, or, again, before 1960. It is of no use to blame the new members of the organization for the lack of success of our diplomacy on the question of New Guinea. Up to the end of last year, we had never persuaded the United States to our point of view. It had always abstained from voting on the question. We had never persuaded any of the Commonwealth countries in Asia, and we had never persuaded any of the Asian countries which are members of the South-East Asia Treaty Organization. We have done our best to discourage and belittle the United Nations, but we now say that we used to have the numbers there. We not only voted in the United Nations against these propositions which we now say we would support. We also led the opposition to them. We failed in our diplomacy, and Indonesia has succeeded in hers. Ours has been less successful and persistent. We nevet»' pushed the question of self-determination with determination. On this question, Sir, as in so many other external matters and so many internal matters, the Menzies Government has shown its increasing incompetence. member's time has expired. [8.40] -As always, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) has been very fluent and vigorous in putting his view before the House. Following his argument as best I could, I can understand his endeavouring to make out a strong case against the Government, but I have completely failed to discover just what the Opposition wishes the Government to do. I am perfectly well aware of the statement which was made publicly by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Calwell). From that statement a certain conclusion could be drawn, but the honourable gentleman adroitly side-stepped any suggestion that it was proper to draw such a conclusion. I am not concerned this evening merely with making points in a debate. I want to bring before the House and the people of Australia a realization of the seriousness of the question that the Parliament is called upon to debate. There is not the slightest reason why we should not try in this House to clarify our thoughts on the proper course to take in certain circumstances. I do not agree with the Leader of the Opposition that this Government has failed in a world of constantly changing conditions. Every one who has had political experience will agree with me that in",50,Sugar Agreement Bill 1962
107,Mr Speaker,Order! The honourable,53,Sugar Agreement Bill 1962
108,Mr Drummond (New England),"domestic politics there is no more useless method of attacking an opponent than to dig up statements made by some opposition leader or some Premier or some member, three, four or five years ago. What is to the point is what is being said and done in the light of the principles espoused by a particular party or a particular government, and in the light of current events. The salient fact that we have to consider to-day is a dispute between an old and valued friend and ally on the one side and a newly emergent nation of some 90,000,000 people on the other side. We must consider the further fact that somehow or other we have been caught up in this dispute. In preparing my speech for this evening, I made some study of the history of the Indonesian people. As the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said, in 1945 Indonesia declared its independence of the Dutch nation, which had ruled that country for about 350 years. For a long time before Sir Stamford Raffles had withdrawn from Malaya at the request of the British Government, and for a long time after, the Dutch were in possession of Indonesia. Now Indonesia, following the course of many other nations that were colonial, in the sense that they were ruled by other nations, has achieved its independence. There is one remark that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition made which I think calls for some passing reference. The honourable member said he had not the slightest doubt that Indonesia was as capable of developing West New Guinea as were the Dutch people. Is that correct? Let us consider some of the material facts about Indonesia. In Java and Madoera there are 58,200,000 people. In Sumatra there are 14,600,000. In Borneo, a relatively small portion of which is British North Borneo, and which, I believe, is the third biggest island in the world, the Indonesians have 3,900,000 of their people. In the Celebes they have 6,600,000 and in the Lesser Sunda Islands, 5,900,000. There are a few in other small areas who make up the total. It is quite obvious that Indonesia, with her newly acquired independence, has a tremendous task to build up and develop her economy. With an island like Borneo, which is very big but virtually uninhabited, Indonesia has a major task on its hands. I rather think that my friend begs the question when he suggests that Indonesia is anything like as well equipped to develop West New Guinea as is a highly developed European nation with abundant know-how and resources at its disposal. In making this statement. I cast no reflection on the natural ability of the people of Indonesia. There is one further point I would like to make in this debate. It is of not the slightest use getting up in this House and suggesting that the matter we are debating is not of first-rate importance to Australia, and even a matter affecting our survival. When I say this I do not cast any aspersions upon the good intentions of the Indonesian people. But has anybody taken the trouble to discover and point out that from Daru, which is, I believe, our oldest settlement in Papua, to Cape York Peninsula by way of a string of islands, is 74 miles, while Merauke, which is in the territory of West New Guinea, is at no great distance from these places? WhatI want to make clear is that the matter we are discussing is not one that Australians are justified in considering lightly. It is not the Indonesians, with whom we bave enjoyed the friendliest relations, that we have to fear. If by some freak of chance an arrangement were made, by force or otherwise, for certain nations to instal their offensive devices in West New Guinea, many things could happen. Such nations could use that territory as a base from which to launch an attack on our mainland. We have been thinking-and quite rightly so-of what might happen to the Territories of Papua and New Guinea, which we hold either as original possessions or in trust. But in our statements to the public we have not pointed out how close is the southern portion of West New Guinea and of Papua to the Australian mainland. We must remember that the nearest part of the Australian mainland to the disputed area is Cape York Peninsula, where we have discovered some of the richest mineral deposits in the world. I have dealt wtih that from the Australian point of view. I follow it up by saying that if the attitude of the Indonesians is a complex in regard to the nation which ruled over them for something like 400 years, that is quite understandable. They have secured their independence. West New Guinea is the one remaining possession of the Netherlands in the region surrounding Indonesia and the attitude of the Indonesians is quite understandable. If they had some tremors in regard to the Netherlands, remembering that in days gone by it was a military and naval power of no mean strength, I could understand it. But what is not understandable to me is Indonesia's claim to sovereignty over West New Guinea and its refusal to consider the Netherlands' offer to transfer this territory to the control of the United Nations and to guarantee to its people self-determination in that process. That offer was quite definite as was brought out in the paper which is before the House, where it is stated frankly by our Government that at first the Netherlands had indicated that the adoption of a ten years' plan for West New Guinea did not necessarily mean that the Dutch would retire from the territory upon the accomplishment of that plan. But of course the 1961 proposal to internationalize the administration of the territory of Dutch New Guinea was of a different order. It was a proposal that the territory should be handed over to the United Nations, an international authority, for the purpose of bringing the people of the territory up to the point of self-determination. It is all very well for people to talk around the subject of self determination. I appreciate the debating point made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, but let us face the facts. We live in a different day and age from the early times in our own country when, as is recorded, a man and his wife and children could be listed in the sale of things which could be transferred to a new power or a new owner. I hope the day has gone for ever when 600,000 people, unable properly to take charge of their own affairs in a complex world, could be handed over willy-nilly, whether they liked it or not, to some other power that claimed sovereignty over their territory. I discussed this question once with an Indonesian diplomat of fairly high rank. I asked him, "" On what do you base your claim to West New Guinea?"" And he replied, "" Upon legal grounds "". I said, "" Then you do not base it upon an ethnological grounds? "" And he replied, "" Oh no. We stand on the legal grounds."" Of course, he did not stand on racial or ethnological grounds. He knew perfectly well that he could not sustain that stand because there is no resemblance between the Papuans of West New Guinea and the Indonesian people. The suggestion that is now brought in that there is more resemblance between the people of West New Guinea and the Indonesians than between the people of West New Guinea and those of the Netherlands is beside the point. The point is that they are people, as far as a people can be, of one nation with those who occupy the eastern territory of Australian New Guinea and Papua. I then asked my Indonesian friend, "" What do you mean by ' legal grounds'?"" ""WeU"", he said, "" it was administered by the Dutch and when they went out it reverted to us"". ""Well, my friend "", I said, "" if that is the basis upon which you argue you will get yourself into a considerable tangle throughout the world, because Great Britain has left a good many countries from which she formerly administered others, and if those countries start claiming the territories formerly administered from within their boundaries there will undoubtedly be blood on the moon "". I feel that behind Indonesia's claim to West New Guinea there is a complex of fear of what the Netherlands might perhaps do under certain circumstances to try to retrieve the possessions she lost in Indonesia. While I sympathize with and understand that point of view on the part of a people who had 400 years of foreign rule, at the same time. I think it is so unrealistic that one can scarcely see how they could entertain that view on grounds other than those which I have put forward. If the Netherlands to-day tried to reconquer Indonesia the whole force of world opinion would be against it. I do not think there is the slightest ground for believing that the Netherlands would attempt to do that. I do not believe that the people of the Netherlands are other than fair when -hey say they are prepared to give the peopit "">f West New Guinea self-determination. I hf.,-' watched, with considerable admiration, the speed with which the Dutch have built up their attempts to bring the people of West New Guinea to self-government. I think these are things which have to be taken into consideration even more than the matters mentioned by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. I believe that in the final analysis, if does not face up to the real issues, and that Australia stands firmly on the ground of it does not answer tbe questions which belief in self-determination for the people many people in Australia to-day are asking of West New Guinea she will be on solid and which they are wanting this Governground before the nations of the world. ment to answer.

"", the United Nations in the eyes of the the Government will never state exactly people of the world. But if it is what its attitude is. Ministers simply say, taken up on the basis that the people of "" That is a hypothetical question "".

Do honourable members know what we had proposed at that time? In the pre-war period the natives received between 5s. and 7s. 6d. a month plus rations, of course, and their accommodation. The Labour government of the day did not propose anything tremendously drastic. It proposed to lift the monthly pay to 15s. as well as improving their rations and conditions. We had decided to do that as a temporary measure and we intended to examine the situation in order to see what improvements we could The Prime Minister himself effect in the immediate future.

He was a member of the party which now says it wants self-determination for the natives. In 1957, the Prime Minister said that Australia was in New Guinea and Australia would remain there. There was no question of a ten-year developmental and educational programme. There was no question of self-determination. He went on to sayWe do not regard our presence here as temporary. In those days, members of the Liberal Party intended that Australia should remain in permanent occupation of New Guinea. It is only as a result of the pressure of world opinion and of opinion from the Australian Labour Party and the trade unions of this country that the Government has now altered its attitude. The Prime Minister now saysAbove all things we stand for the principle of whom pressure to leave is now being self-determination. But members of the Government do not mean ""independence"" when they talk ment with the Netherlands Government in about "" self-determination "". The Minister 1957 and it was quite obvious, at that for External Affairs has saidThere is no simple definition of selfcause with the Dutch, even to the extent determination.

111,Mr Killen (Moreton) [9.18],"A greatrumbled in a tumbril-like way from the lips of the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward). I hope that the House will accept it as a form of penance on my part if I resist the temptation to follow him through the labyrinth of argument to which in the course of the last twenty minutes, he has treated us. Nevertheless, I would like to make one or two comments on his speech. First of all, I should like to say, with some pain and, indeed, with some anxiety, that the honourable gentleman did not seem to me to-night to be his usual self. The usual style of his speech had gone. The lofty, detached, academic approach which has long distinguished the honourable gentleman was missing. The tranquillity of sentiment that has long endeared itself to this House and to the people of Australia was missing. The sweetness and charm that flowed so naturally and so easily from the honourable gentleman was missing. Instead of exhibiting the characteristics to which I have made fleeting and, no doubt, imperfect reference, the honourable gentleman to-night fussed and fumed and fulminated with all the impatience of a bull in splendid isolation. I would have thought that if any person in this Parliament or in this country would have sworn himself to a trappist style of silence on the matter of New Guinea, it would have been the honourable member for East Sydney. The honourable gentleman has referred to-night to history. Of course, again he did so with his infinite respect for truth in these matters. I hope that he will regard it as tolerable impertinence on my part if I remind bim of certain events, because memory is an imperfect carriage in these matters. Some years ago, the honourable gentleman went on record as sayingIt is amusing to hear people say we will not give up New Guinea. To those people and one can imagine the ecstatic way in which this was saidI would say that if it should become necessary to defend our mandated Territories, they should defend them themselves. Yet the honourable gentleman talked to-night about defence. Then he said, with what I thought was an impartial reference to the Government's record of defence, "" We can't do it alone. We can't go it alone."" The honourable gentleman knows that in any contest for power you cannot achieve much unless you have the numbers, but he ignored that as he ignored other things. I shall come back to the honourable member, because, despite what I have said, I have an affection for him, although I might say perhaps that it is cunningly concealed. I shall move on now to the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Calwell), who led for the Opposition in this debate. When I listened to my honourable friend, I was tempted to forgive him because his mind, on the matter of New Guinea, is like a jungle; it is over-grown. It is over-grown with bitter prejudice and sordid confusion. The honourable gentleman based a great deal of his argument on two bases. First, he launched an attack on the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies). Does it add anything to the galaxy of understanding that the Leader of the Opposition should make a personal attack on the Prime Minister? The honourable gentleman referred to the fact that the Prime Minister led a deputation of sorts to Suez. I would have thought that every person in Australia, irrespective of party politics, would have taken a quiet and decent pride in the fact that the leader of the Australian nation was asked by eighteen nations to lead a delegation to see President Nasser on the Suez dispute. Is a man's integrity impeached and is his argument to be regarded as impaled because he has failed? If that is the test in this matter-and according to the Leader of the Opposition that is to be the test-al l I can say is that the Leader of the Opposition has been an inglorious failure. Then the Leader of the Opposition attacked my honourable and learned friend the Minister for External Affairs( Sir Garfield Barwick). He said that the Minister had presented what was, in fact, a lawyer's brief. Does the Leader of the Opposition expect the honourable member for Parramatta to desert the discipline of his profession? Or is the honourable gentleman, with his well-known allergy to facts, unable to reconcile his allergy with the fact that in the presentation of his case the Minister for External Affairs showed a sharp relevance to facts? I turn from that caricature of events to what I consider to be the substance of this tremendous and crushing issue so far as the Australian people are concerned. There is doubt and a genuine anxiety in the minds of many millions of Australians on this issue. None of us is at liberty to be content with the modest view of the hymn writer. We must ask ""to view the distant scene"" because one step in this matter may be fatal and may lead to great danger. IfI might say so with great respect, I find that sovereignty is the key to this issue. If honourable members study critically the statement of the Minister for External Affairs, they are left with the conclusion that that also is his view, because he referred to sovereignty on seventeen occasions. I do not disguise for one moment that I was enraptured by his views on it because sovereignty in recent years has come to be used, in the minds of many people, with undertones of shame. Sovereignty has indeed been despised. It has been thought of as something unclean. I thought the Minister's use of the word was quite refreshing. I hope the House will pardon my reflecting on this matter in a personal way, but sovereignty to me personally conjures up something that is solid and comforting. Without doing too much violence to Keats, I would sayYet did I never breathe its pure serene TillI heard Barwick speak out loud and bold. That is on the issue of sovereignty. Sovereignty is the very centre of this conflict, and to ignore it is to ignore the conflict completely. Putting to one side the IndonesianDutch dispute as such, I think the country should be advised to consider the relative attitudes of those who sit in this Parliament. The Government's attitude has been made quite plain. Sovereignty is not dismissed and not despised. But what of the Opposition? I think that at least one of the things that must be said is that there has been a partial eclipse of regard for sovereignty. If you go through the Minister's speech, Mr Speaker, you find that two questions are brought out clearly. The first is the issue of sovereignty. Then we have the Minister's statementAustralia is neither a party principal, nor a But there was no section of the Dutchself-appointed arbitrator in these matters. I put it to you, Mr Speaker, that the two matters can be commingled. I am assuming for the moment that the Opposition's attitude is a fragile tenderness for sovereignty and that the Leader of the Opposition is no ebullient busy-body. I think the kindest thing that may be said about the Opposition is that there has been little constancy of love for the two principles that this question enshrines. The great truth of the matter is that no party in Australia in this century has propounded a policy compounded of mischief and muddle that could rival the Australian Labour Party's policy on the Dutch and the Indonesians. That proposition can be readily tested. Look to the immediate post-war years. Sovereignty was trampled on by the Labour government of the day. Admittedly, the Labour Prime Minister of that time stated on 25th September, 1947The Australian Government is not taking sides in the dispute and never made any attempt to do so. The record shows that that statement was demonstrably false. What of the ban on Dutch shipping in Australia for nearly three years when the leader of the Australasian Council of Trade Unions of that day was driven to express the view that there was no more mischievous form of industrial unrest and expression of opinion than this ban. Who determined the foreign policy of Australia in those days? It was determined by the Waterside Workers Federation. The honourable member for East Sydney was a Minister of the Crown in those days. Was he heard to complain? Did he bleat in his characteristic way? Did he protest that here was sovereignty being despised? The Labour Government's attitude at that time could be described in one wordcowardice. There is no other word for it. NowI turn from the domestic scene to the international scene. The Labour Government was, or at any rate claimed to be-and for the purposes of my argument I will concede it-responsibl e for bringing the dispute before the United Nations. The United Nations charter in this matter is quite explicit. Clause7 of Article II . refers to non-interference in domestic disputes. Indonesian dispute in the immediate postwar years that could be perceived by the government of the day as being domestic. It regarded the whole thing as being the concern of the whole world. Where, Sir, was the fervent expression of regard for sovereignty on that occasion when the government of the day-that is, the Labour Government of the day-no t merely interfered but took sides? When the dispute came before the Security Council on two occasions the Australian vote was against the Dutch. To-day, the Labour Party poses as the great friend of the Dutch. There was a conference in New Delhi in 1949 to consider the Dutch-Indonesian dispute. Various countries were invited. The Australian Government was invited to send a delegation, and it sent a delegation. Australia was not a party principal, but a delegation went from this country. The Netherlands, a nation which was plainly a party principal, was not invited. Was there any protest by the Labour Government of that day against the failure to invite the Dutch to that New Delhi conference in 1949? Did the honourable member for East Sydney complain about it? No, he was as silent as the Sphinx and, I suppose, as useful as the material that composes it. But, Sir, to-day the Leader of the Opposition is trying to give the impression that he would like to dethrone President Soekarno. He has described the President in unbecoming language, to put it mildly. We wonder whether he would mind recalling his language-the honourable member for East Sydney made reference to thiswhen he was discussing Papua-New Guinea in 1949. This is what he had to say then. . . under the Linggadjati Agreement and other agreements the Dutch will eventually set up the Federated States of Indonesia which will be a portion of the Dutch realm, but it will be the Indonesians and not tbe Dutch who will govern Dutch New Guinea and the rest of the Federated States. DidI hear some one mention the word "" twist""? This is no twist on the part of the Leader of the Opposition. This represents a most violent convulsion. He said this, not with complaint but with utter resignation and, if not explicity, most certainly implicitly, approved the fact that it would be the Indonesians who would run Dutch New Guinea. Yet to-day the honourable gentleman rivals the honourable member for East Sydney in his fussing and fuming and fulminating about the issue, and takes the view that Australia has done nothing about it at all. There is wide Australian concern over the honourable member for Moreton( Mr position. I should like to say a word or Killen) was not up to his usual form totwo about the fact that several Asian night and I may say, Sir, that I do not countries have regarded the DutchIndonesian dispute over Dutch New Guinea with, if not reservation, then with suspicion of the Dutch-on e might even say hostility. I think it is fair to say that this is something that springs from the naturally and environmentally conditioned view of many Asian countries concerning colonialism, but I hope that they would not think it impudence or impertinence on my part to point out to them that there is a form of colonialism far more grievous to people than the old-style colonialism which is now rapidly disappearing. There is a form of surrender of power which can be more violent and more oppressive than the old style of colonialism. I should like to make a very genuine appeal to people who find themselves in that position to realize the enormous consequence of ignoring the vital issue that is involved. It is very easy for people to try to dispose of other people's property, but when you are put into the position where you have to make a sober and determined judgment on your own account I believe you should at least be prepared to consider all the elements. So before I sit down I should like to advise, not only my friend the Leader of the Opposition but also all those who feel as though they have a great interest in this matter, to recall the language of a man who wrote with impeccable good sense, though it was many years ago. The words, the language, the sentiment are quite pertinent to our time and our circumstances. He wroteTerror is not always the effect of force; and an armament is not a victory. If you do not succeed, you are without resource; for, conciliation failing, force remains; but, force failing, no further hope of reconciliation is left. Power and authority are sometimes bought by kindness; but they can never be begged as alms by an impoverished and defeated violence. It would seem to me that not only the Leader of the Opposition and President Soekarno but every person who feels as though he has an interest in this dispute would do well to contemplate by day the sentiment expressed in those words, and to meditate on it by night.",59,Sugar Agreement Bill 1962
112,Mr Makin (Bonython) [9.36],"Theintend to follow him through his maze of .rrelevancies. However, there was one matter on which he placed great emphasis, a matter with which I should like to deal -the subject of sovereignty. The honourable member's speech proves beyond all doubt the charge that has been made by both the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ,. Mr Whitlam) and the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) that sovereignty and not self-determination is the Government's first concern in regard to West New Guinea. I certainly do not remember the honourable member for Moreton devoting a single word of his speech to the principle of self-determination. So it is not for me to try to review the honourable member's remarks, having regard to the unfortunate way in which he sought to express himself in terms not strictly related to the matter at issue. The Australian people are very concerned about the situation to our north. They are concerned about the future of West New Guinea, and their undoubted thought is that the people of that area have a rightful -laim to self-determination. The Labour Party has declared in emphatic language its absolute adherence to the principle of self-determination. I shall read to the House from the declaration made in April, 1961, by the Federal ALP conference on this very issue. It readsThe Labour Party asserts that the only people who have the right to determine the future of the island of New Guinea are its indigenous people. The United Nations holds that the inhabitants of the Trust Territories of New Guinea are not fit yet to govern themselves. The Labour Party believes this to be true of the inhabitants of the should have been under the direct superrest of the island. The Labour Party will support and co-operate in the efforts of the United Nations to resolve the present dispute over West New Guinea so as to avoid armed conflict. [ wish to associate myself emphatically with the declarations of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Calwell) on this issue. He expressed the policy of the Australian Labour Party on this issue when he spoke in the debate a week or so ago. Independence and the right of self-determination are as precious to the people of West New Guinea as to the people of any other nation. I remember the loyalties of the people of New Guinea in both war and peace, and we should give no impression of forsaking them now. This situation could have a serious reaction for other than those directly affected in West New Guinea. As has already been said, we do not resolve the problem of colonialism by substituting one colonial power for another. There is another aspect that has not yet been mentioned in this debate. This also has relation to the security of Australia. If a military power becomes a dominant influence in New Guinea, will this delay the withdrawal of Australia from that part of New Guinea we are preparing for self government and nationhood? It is to be earnestly hoped that this will not be so. But there is only one way that security can be assured to these people and to ourselves, and that is for a trusteeship of the United Nations to guarantee the rights of the native peoples concerned. This is a very important aspect of the situation. The Netherlands Government in the past may not have been perfect in its administration of distant dependent territories, but at least in this instance it is endeavouring to lead the native peoples of West New Guinea towards self government. In this, it is expending considerable amounts from the revenues of Holland so that it may maintain some care of these people. I believe that the Netherlands Government wishes the people of these parts to achieve self-determination at the earliest possible moment. It is welcome news that Indonesia is to return to the preliminary talks in Washington concerning an agenda for a conference on settlement of the West New Guinea dispute. I believe that these proceedings vision of the United Nations. The Secretary General of the United Nations is, of course, attending as an observer, but in my opinion that is not sufficient. The whole matter should have been subject to the direct intervention of this international authority. It is in this respect that Australia could have given good offices. The Government has failed in a signal responsibility in not taking the initiative to present the matter to the appropriate instrumentality of the United Nations. Of all the nations in this area, Australia could have done much to preserve the peace and to safeguard against disturbed relations, or at least to curb anything in the way of fanaticism on one side or bad faith on the other. Australia should have made its voice heard by the disputing nations directly. This should have been followed by positive action in the General Assembly of the United Nations, even if the Security Counof the then Minister for External Affairs, cil had refused to intervene. But no posiDr. H. V. Evatt, who is now the Chief tive action was taken by the Australian Justice of New South Wales. In his stateGovernment. What a different attitude would have been of good offices. There was an outspoken taken by a Minister for External Affairs in rebuke for any breach of the peace or any a Labour government! Let me recall the threatened breach of the peace. He sought actions of the former leader of this party, through the United Nations the peaceful Dr. Evatt, when he was Minister for Extersettlement of all issues in dispute. I know nal Affairs. When matters were in dispute something about this matter.

I shall read what object of giving added weight to the good Dr. Evatt had to say during a foreign affairs offices of this and other nations that were debate at that time. This reveals the differoffered in an attempt to avoid any breach ence between the attitude adopted by a of the peace.

When referring to the action of bestowed on the people of that country which the Indonesian leaders had comsince. These good offices cannot be swept plained, Dr Evatt said, according to aside or denied. Proof of that is the "" Hansard"" of 9th February, 1949Australia accepted part responsibility for that versities and other schools of learning in intervention, not only on its own account but as the subjects of engineering, education, nursa member of the United Nations, and for one purpose only-to see that fighting in this territory ing, medicine, science, agriculture, accountso close to our shores should be stopped and that ancy, arts, economics and food technology. conciliation or arbitration should be substituted The ships and brave men of this nation, in for warfare. That is the fundamental principle of the United and aggressor of those days from the shores Nations and it applies everywhere. There is no of the islands that to-day comprise the question of who is right in the present dispute. An honourable member has interjected that the Indonesian area during the last war. Surely present dispute is not our business. Nobody can say that it is not our business. It is the business these things cannot be forgotten by a people of the United Nations organization, of which worthy of that help. Australia has spent we are a part, and of the people of the world £3,650,000 in recent years on the training because the life or death of a Dutch or Indonesian soldier is just as important as that of any man of the students that I have mentioned.

113,Mr Currin,Who said that?,64,Sugar Agreement Bill 1962
114,Mr Makin,"That was the statementGuinea much more effectively than could most others. The weak and vacillating voice of the Australian Government has done nothing to try to bridge the difficulty. This Government's attitude has given an entirely wrong impression of the Australian people's view concerning any threats of a war-like character. In faet, the Menzies Government's inglorious inactivity has encouraged certain people to become more vocal in their threats of recourse to military force. The language that they have used is not the sort of language that the people of this country appreciate. Any nation that employs military force which amounts to aggression forfeits the right to respect and to the trust of nations with peaceful intentions. I may say that there seems to have arisen in recent times a new technique by which, in times of negotiation, people continue to make threats of armed aggression. I believe that that is an entirely wrong point of view. It is contrary to the spirit and the letter of the Charter of the United Nations. I come back to the issue that I introduced at the beginning of my speech-self-deter mination for the indigenous people of West New Guinea. The Right Reverend Philip Strong, who has been Anglican Bishop of New Guinea for 26 years, declared a view that I have no doubt is widely held by the natives of those parts, when he saidGain by aggression was morally wrong. Signs of weakening in Australia's policy of self-determination for West New Guinea have distressed me. Australia's policy of self-determinataion apparently started to weaken when the policy did not receive full support from some other nations. New Guinea natives trust Australia. Failure to give full support to the policy of self-determination would be a great shock to them. I add that Australia cannot afford to allow that to happen. There should be only one consideration when we remember the Charter of the United Nations. There seems to me to be one course onlya form of trusteeship for West New Guinea. The Dutch remaining in the area or annexation by Indonesia will not bring a setdement. The only prospect is for some nation apart from those two to be charged with the responsibility for trusteeship until the people themselves can express their intention regarding self-determination. This, I believe is the only course that will resolve the aggravated situation in West New Guinea in a satisfactory manner and avoid sacrifice and suffering for thousands of Papuan natives. This will, at the same time, be the surest way to promote peace and, ultimately, ordered government by the people 1 of this territory. The longer the present dispute is allowed to continue, the more bitter become feelings on both sides, and the more difficult becomes the problem of achieving a settlement. Now is the time when every effort should be made with the nations concerned and in the councils of the United Nations to find an answer. Australia, with trust territory immediately adjoining West New Guinea, cannot remain complacent and indifferent to the situation. Australia is a land with peaceful intentions. honourable member's time has expired. Mr Deputy Speaker, we have been listening to a debate which I deplore very much indeed, because it has shown, on a matter which is of paramount importance to all parties and people in this country, that there has developed a partisan viewa party view, to put it more accurately. This, I think, is to the great detriment of the Parliament and the country. We all know that the sword of Damocles hangs over both the Government and the Opposition, for the numbers in this House are very evenly divided. The Government has a voting majority of only one. However, I hoped that on this vital issue we could have come to some common attitude. What are the questions posed by this issue? In my view, they are these: First of all, have we a moral responsibility for the people of our own Territory of Papua? I say that we most definitely have. There can be no question about that. Nor can there be any question that we have a responsibility to discharge our obligation to the people who have virtually given their lives-in some instances, lives have in fact been given-in the administration of that Territory. The next question, as I see it, is this: Do we lightly accept the possibility of the people of the Territory being taken over by another power? This, really, is the crux of the argument, and I think that it has been ignored rather too much",64,Sugar Agreement Bill 1962
115,Mr Deputy Speaker,Order! The,65,Sugar Agreement Bill 1962
116,Mr Falkinder (Franklin) [9.56],"by some people. We have aa obligation to the people of Papua and New Guinea. That obligation is not to say that we want to go to war with Indonesia. No sensible, thinking person wants that for one second. But we have an obligation to say to the people of Papua and New Guinea, "" Should the snowball threaten to roll over you, we will protect you "". I shall explain what I mean by using the word, "" snowball "". At the beginning of the dispute over West New Guinea, President Soekarno of Indonesia said that Indonesia's campaign to win control of West New Guinea is a rolling snowball that will run down everything and everybody. If we are quiescent and apathetic and do nothing in the face of a statement of that kind, we abnegate our responsibility to the people of Papua and New Guinea. We who have a trusteeship over these people cannot allow them to be put in a situation in which they may be overwhelmed by a snowball. NowI want to deal with a contentious point. No doubt there will be many honourable members on both sides of the House who will not agree with my statement. It has been said by certain members of the Government that all of the peoples of Asia support Indonesia's claim. I have been to some of the Asian countries in recent years, and I have had direct information from people in certain Asian countries, including the Philippines, Formosa, Japan and Borneo. 1 say positively that the people in many Asian countries do not necessarily agree with this attempt that is being made by Indonesia to establish some form of colonialism in what they call West Irian. 1 would say quite bluntly that the people of these countries are a little wary of Indogestion in this regard. He asked, "" Why nesia's future intentions. In addition, they are people who have experienced, in their time, various kinds of colonialism. They do not support Indonesia's claim because they believe it is an attempt at colonialism, an attempt to grab a bit more territory, if I may use a few plain words. Therefore, I suggest that the statement made by some members of the Government, that Indonesia's claim is supported by the people of Asia, is entirely wrong. We cannot abnegate our responsibility for were given a completely impartial adminisone moment, Mr Deputy Speaker, because tration, presided over by the United with our history and tradition we must be Nations, with people appointed to carry out pretty solidly opposed to any form of colonialism. We passed through a period in which our country was a colony. For this reason I believe that the people of Papua and New Guinea and of South-East Asia as a whole will accept our statement that we are opposed to colonialism. For this reason also I believe that they will accept our word when we say that we will grant self-determination to the people of Papua and New Guinea as soon as we possibly can. The Minister for Territories ( Mr Hasluck) has, I think, done quite a remarkable job of policy making, as have his predecessors. The people in the Administration of the Territory have done a dedicated job, as no one can deny. It is up to us as a Parliament and as a people to support the officers of the Administration and the Minister, and to stand right behind them. more? that we could do more, but I am not going to argue that matter. I have been to the Territory on two occasions, and I am very well acquainted with it. I would say that, man for man and £1 for £1, we are doing as well in the administration of the Territory as any country could possibly do with a trusteeship of this kind. NowI want to move on to a point which, I think, is important. If we do not agree with Indonesia's claim to West Irian, as it is called by Indonesia, then what is our stand on this matter? I believe that U Thant, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, made one valuable sugnot let the United Nations take over that territory, with no single country being particularly concerned? "" There is a problem inherent in this proposition: Whom would you appoint to do the actual administration? However, I see no reason why that should be an insurmountable barrier. Do the Papuans want Indonesia to take them over, or do they want the Dutch to continue to control them? I do not think there is a complete answer to either of those questions. However, I think that if they",65,Sugar Agreement Bill 1962

118,Mr Falkinder,"I think, perhaps,the administrative jobs, it might well constitute the happiest solution for the people of West New Guinea in the long run. We have heard a lot of legalistic argument to-night. We have heard honourable members going through the various United Nations resolutions on the matter. Let me suggest that we have to make up our minds on two simple questions. The first is: What is our attitude? I have suggested that we should simply support the proposition that West New Guinea be put in the hands of the United Nations. We would not do this simply for the purpose of disposing of the question completely, but merely so that the people concerned could be given the right to determine their own future. We have heard a lot of loose talk to-night about self-determination. I suggest these people should be given the right of self-determination, and the suggestion that I have put forward would provide the best possible solution to the problems con* fronting the people of West New Guinea. evening we have heard, Mr Deputy Speaker, many views expressed on the destiny of the people of West New Guinea. The only speaker on the Government side who has made any attempt to clarify the matter has been the honourable member for Franklin( Mr Falkinder). The Government claims that its policy in respect of West New Guinea is one of self-determination. I doubt whether that is really a policy. If we have a policy we must be prepared to implement it, given the opportunity to do so. The Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) has said during this debate that if the Indonesians and the Dutch can reach an agreement, we will recognize it. That is not consistent with a policy of selfheld Indonesian territory. But there is determination. That is an attempt to establish a proposition that if two persons have custody of a third person's property it is quite legal for them to divide that property up among themselves. That is not self-determination. Selfi-determination for the people of West New Guinea means, if it means anything, that those people shall have the right to establish their own independent government. The honourable member for East Sydney surplus food and could not produce clothing ( Mr Ward) was quite correct when he said for the Indonesians. It would not even add that if this Government said to Indonesia, to them an indigenous population that would "" We will assist in protecting the people of be of use to them. But it has nickel, cobalt. West New Guinea from aggression "", there would be no aggression. I think the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley) was quite right when he said that perhaps some of the Government's powerful friends, about whom they talk occasionally, are not so much concerned that the Indonesians could take West New Guinea, as that they might fail to do so, and that a government of a different complexion would then arise in Indonesia. Let us have a look for a moment at the facts about West New Guinea. First, there must be the problem of administration. If it passes to Indonesia, has Indonesia the economic and financial resources to administer it on anything like the scale that the Dutch have? Remember that from 1955 to 1961 the cost to the Dutch of administering West New Guinea has risen by 600 per cent. The population of the territory is stated variously to be from 700,000 to 800,000. In an English language paper published in Moscow Russia puts the population of this territory at 1,200,000, but I think that figure is probably more associated with propaganda than with fact. Why should Indonesia want this country of 750,000 natives, 18,000 Dutch, 10,000 Chinese and 8,000 Indonesians-mos t of the latter being Eurasians, who of course would not like to see the Indonesians there? They cannot wish to take it for its economic value. It has none, for them. It could not help feed them and would be a drag on them. They have no claim to it from a racial point of view. Racially, they could not be farther from the Papuans. Politically the territory has value to the Indonesians only because it can be exploited at home as a conquest and a triumph over the people who formerly something else in it which might be worth looking at. To-day the Indonesians are being provided with arms by certain nations that must have a very slim chance of ever being paid. There is a possibility that if they can urge the Indonesians to get possession of more territory they may be paid. There may be possibilities. Let us look at what is known of West New Guinea. It does not produce",66,Sugar Agreement Bill 1962
119,Mr Gray (Capricornia) [10.7],"Thisiron, tin, copper, gold, silver, uranium, pyrites and platinum. The extent of the occurrence of these metals is not known, or at least we do not have the information. But is there a possibility that those who are loading Indonesia with debt in return for arms hope they will be paid in these things which would be of great value to the people providing the rifles and ammunition. So perhaps the powerful friends of the Government might be making a mistake. The native people of West New Guinea have organized themselves into political groups, which have their own views, the only views that we are likely to get from the primitive Papuans of West New Guinea. They have some five political parties. There is one which they call the D.V.P. and there are the Sama-Sama, the Parsepp, the Epang and the Pong; and all of them are opposed to Indonesia. The Indonesians claim they have a legal right to West New Guinea. They say the Dutch promised that twelve months after the signing of the original agreement they would hand the territory to Indonesia. But the Dutch said no such thing. I have perused the agreement, which says. . . that the status quo of the Residency of New Guinea shall be maintained, with the stipulation that within a year from the date of the transthat is so, they have no claim at all. But fer of sovereignty to the Republic of the United States of Indonesia, the question of the political status of New Guinea be determined through negotiations between the Republic of the United States of Indonesia and the Kingdom of the Netherlands. That is not a promise to hand the territory over, but to discuss the matter and arrive at a decision. Article2 (a) of this agreement contains the phraseThe status quo of the Residency of New Guinea shall be maintained. The Dutch, as an afterthought and realizing that they could be misunderstood, in an effort to ensure that they should not be misunderstood, on 22nd November, 1949, wrote to both the Indonesian delegations, in identical letters, explaining that "" it shall be maintained through continuing under the Government of the Netherlands"". One cannot misinterpret that provision. It is quite clear. Remember that there were two Indonesian delegations present at this conference; and neither of them has any control in Indonesia at the moment. The first delegation was from the "" Federal Consultative Assembly"", and the other from the ""Indonesian Republic Union"". Both of those have since been replaced by a dictatorship. Remember, also, that had the stipulation, which the Indonesians claim, been contained in the agreement, it would now have been quite useless because the agreement was broken by the Indonesians themselves. Any one who reads the agreement will realize that clauses such as that ensuring full protection of the rights of foreign residents in Indonesia, quite apart from the Dutch, have been broken. That protection has not been given to the Chinese residents who were there when the territory was transferred. How many of the Dutch have been expelled, and their property confiscated? So the Indonesians have broken the agreement. What about that part of the agreement which provided that the United States of Indonesia should remain within the Dutch empire? That has been thrown overboard. And once an agreement is broken by one party to it, it is null and void. One cannot just uphold the sections of an agreement that happen to suit one and disregard the rest. And the position is that the Indonesians were given no such promise. If in their view they have a very good reason for their claim. They must bolster up the political position of their dictatorship which is unable, economically, to maintain its grip on domestic affairs and thus needs foreign adventure to maintain its power. The Indonesians are not the first to discover that fact. It is a course which has been followed by dictatorships from time immemorial, and these people are no exception to the rule. They say "" We have no further territorial claims"", but we have heard that said before. Such a statement has never meant the termination of claims by a dictatorship. Who can say that if the Indonesians succeeded in getting sovereignty over West New Guinea, which has a frontier common with our Territory of Papua-New Guinea, we would not find them making claims to further territory? That frontier is very illdefined except for the portion which follows the bend in the Fly RiveT. I repeat that what the honourable member for East Sydney said is correct. If this Government were even now to say, "" There will be no aggression in West New Guinea"", there would be none. We have been told that if we interfered-thi s has been stated by the and Africa would support Indonesia. Is it therefore contended that the majority of the people of Indonesia must be right, although 90 per cent, of them would not know what the argument is about? They base their claim on racial grounds and, as the Prime Minister admits, all Asia and Africa will back them. Does that make it right? I would suggest, as did the honourable member for Franklin( Mr Falkinder), that we have a moral responsibility to these people. The people of West New Guinea are a primitive race. I suggest it would be quite safe to say that 99 per cent, of them do not even know there is a dispute. They live in a tribal state and have no means of learning about these things. They speak neither Dutch nor Indonesian. They have no newspapers, and they listen to no radio broadcasts. They do not even have the advantage of listening to the broadcasts of the proceedings of this Parliament. But even then they would not know what it was all about. I repeat that we have a definite moral responsibility for these people. We have in our care the greater part of this island and the greater part of its population and, insofar as anybody can have a moral responsibility for somebody else, we have a moral responsibility for all the people of Papua and New Guinea. We on this side have often been twitted by Ministers of this Government and asked what we suggest the Government should do. what to do. told them, they would not do it anyway. This Government has a definite responsibility to make up its mind on its policy said that if Indonesia was given West New and to adhere to that policy. One of the Guinea, or if she took West New Guinea, we oldest questions ever to be asked and in Australia would be in grave danger, recorded in the history of mankind is, because then we would have a common "" AmI my brother's keeper? "" If we fail frontier with a country that might turn its to stand up to our moral obligations in this eyes towards Australia. That is one of the instance we are denying the great principle facts of life that we have to face. Throughunderlying that question, and a moral out the whole of our history to date we in responsibility clearly does fall upon us here. Australia have lived in isolation, we have with great interest to the contribution by we were sheltered by such things as our the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Gray) to this debate. It was a reasoned contribution which indicated that he had given more thought to the subject than was given to it by some of the other honourable members who have taken part in the debate. It is a great pity that in the year 1962 the mere fact that there are primitive people living in a country does not have any great effect upon the deliberations of the United Nations organization. It is a great pity that the United Nations should be making decisions affecting primitive people who have little chance of looking after themselves, because those decisions are based not on whether people are primitive, but purely on what colour the people concerned happen to be. If we study the composition of the United Nations we see that the scales are heavily weighted against any decision we might make in the best interests of the people concerned in this instance. I believe that the solution of the West New Guinea problem is the great testing point for the United Nations organization, especially in Australia, because most Australians have been led to believe that their one hope of future peace, that their one hope of life on this planet rests in the United Nations being able to solve the major problem of war. If an organization like the United Nations organization eannot solve the problems of West New Guinea, then it will have no possible chance of solving problems like the Berlin question, the Formosa question, or any other question in the world to-day.

125,Mr Chaney,"That is the sort of intera nation such as ours to say that any nation alongside us or away from us has not the right to build up armed forces. American policy has always been based on two things: First, it has been based on the need for a country to have a defence against probable aggression from without. The Americans believe that they should assist a free nation to build up its arms if there is any fear of aggression from without. Secondly, American policy has been based on the need for a free nation to have small arms to enable the maintenance of internal order against subversive activities which would not be of great proportions and which would not be stimulated from abroad. Those two conditions have always decided wbether the Americans would assist with arms any nation that asked for assistance. In 1958, when Indonesia's attempt to have this matter brought to the United Nations failed, that country immediately commenced a large purchase of arms programme. The Americans believed that the purchase of arms was designed to build up forces forcibly to take West New Guinea and decided not to supply Indonesia with arms. Indonesia immediately turned to somebody who was only too willing to help her with the supply of arms. Most honourable members on both sides of the House will remember that high-ranking Indonesian officers went to countries behind the Iron Curtain to purchase arms such as warships from Czechoslovakia and Poland,fighteraircraft and bombers from Russia, and any other arms that they could secure. The securing of arms almost immediately ties a country to the country from which it purchases them because technical advice is required on the use of modern weapons. This is especially so in the case of a country at the stage of development which Indonesia had then reached. So there was a slow infiltration of Communist technicians into Indonesia which, together with the infiltration of technicians from other Iron Curtain countries, offered a threat to the future of Indonesia's so-called democratic government. It is significant that the Indonesian army has always been considered as one of the strong forces against communism in Indonesia. It is interesting to realize, therefore, is called Netherlands New Guinea. The primithat the failure of the Indonesian army would remove this obstacle to communism in Indonesia. I think it is true, as the honourable member for Capricornia said, that very few of the people of West New Guinea would know that Indonesia existed and that very few of the people in the villages of Indonesia would know that West New Guinea existed unless they had heard the propaganda that has been carried out. In 1960, Dr. Helmi, who was the Indonesian ambassador to Australia, was asked to attend a summer school in Perth to discuss the situation in West New Guinea. During the talk that he gave there he said that his country's industrial undevelopment, poor finances and military insecurity meant that there could be no alternative to peace for Indonesia. He said that Indonesia's foreign policy was absolutely independent of the two opposing blocs. That reminds me of a statement that you can be neutral only if you have something to be neutral against. The nations of the world have an opportunity to be neutral only because there are two opposing blocs. The moment that there are not two opposing blocks there will be no neutrals. Whether Dr. Helmi was speaking with the full authority of his Government or not I do not know. But at least he believed at that stage that an attempt to take West New Guinea by force would be in the worse interests of Indonesia in view of its economic and military situation. A lot has been said by leader writers in Australia on this question. I want to read to the House an extract from a leading article, the source of which I shall disclose when I have finished my quotation. It reads as follows:For an Anticolonialist, Sukarno Is Building Quite an Empire Despite his frequent sneers at colonialists, President Sukarno of Indonesia cannot look in the mirror without seeing one. Not content with holding many parts of his present empire against the will of the inhabitants, he is reaching out to annex half of the second-largest island in the world, New Guinea. Sukarno, who already rules 90,000,000 brown subjects in his misnamed "" guided democracy,"" opposes self-determination for the black folk to the east of Indonesia. He has threatened war unless the Dutch turn their last colony over to him. The gigantic island lies directly north of Australia, and its eastern half is under Australian rule. The western half, controlled by the Dutch, tive people whom the Dutch are civilizing axe 700,000 Papuans, many of whom have never learned that eating people is wrong. Such epicures also like to save the beads as trophies of battleThere are places where a woman suckles her child at one breast and an orphaned little pig at the other. These are the people of whom I think that the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) said that it is now time to see what they want. These are the people who should make a decision as to how they want to be ruled and by whom. The article continuesBecause the Papuans have been isolated in tiny groups by the stupendous mountains and the swamps and jungles, they have developed more than 200 separate languages. The vast majority of tbe people belong to what is known as the melanodermic (black-skinned) group. If Sukarno, the empire grabber, should succeed in annexing Netherlands New Guinea, he will then go on to demand the Australian half. There are nearly 1,500,000 Papuans there, and he will insist on getting them without a vote. The Dutch have told the UN. that they are willing to keep on contributing 30,000,000 dollars a year to guide western New Guinea out of the Stone Age. Working hard and skilfully, the Dutch are developing an educated minority. About 50,000 Papuan children receive elementary education. More than half the government jobs are held by Papuans. Some Papuans are legislators. Missionaries from the Netherlands and the US. are active in educational and medical work. In a speech at the UN. General Assembly, Foreign Minister Luns of tbe Netherlands has asked that the UN. set up an authority to administer the territory. The Dutch will request their civil-service staff to remain as UN. employees as long as they are needed, and thus prevent such terror and bloodshed as followed Belgium's withdrawal from the Congo. What proposal could be fairer That article comes, not from an Australian or a Dutch newspaper, but from the ""Saturday Evening Post"". Honourable members may think what they like about the views of that journal. I think that the Dutch attempt to get the United Nations to take the responsibility for this matter is the most important point of all. I believe that the United Nations, in failing to do this, has failed the world in fulfilling the purpose for which it was formed after the Second World War. In view of the expenditure undertaken by the Dutch in West New GuineaI think it is only a matter of time before the Netherlands Parliament will decide that that money has been spent to no purpose. If the Dutch leave West New Guinea a vacuum will be created which the United Nations ought to be prepared to fill if there is to be any hope of law and order in the world to-day. So, Mr Speaker, I believe that West New Guinea is not a question for the Australian people or the Australian Government to handle. It is a question for the United Nations. It is a question on which the future of the United Nations depends and on which the peace of the world depends. If the United Nations fails it will have failed, not only the Papuans in that island who know little about the world and what goes on in it, but it will have failed every citizen of this world. It will have failed the world as the League of Nations failed it once before. Debate (on motion by Mr Duthie) adjourned.

This is emphasized by the fact that, once New South Wales meets its obligation to construct the Blowering storage works, the Snowy Mountains authority and the Snowy Mountains Council under the agreement are no longer responsible for loss by flooding below those works. Accordingly land-holders below the point seven miles downstream from Tumut whose properties are affected by power station releases should approach the Government of New South Wales.

What are the details, under appropriate headings, of the manner in which the contribution was expended each year? 3. How many Australian personnel in each year were part of the United Nations representation in the Congo, and what were their designation and activities? Mr Harold Holt -The answers to the honourable follows:1. Australia has contributed to the cost of the United Nations force in the Congo in accordance with the United Nations scale of assessments. In 1960-61 the contribution amounted to £193,644 and in the current financial year contributions so far amount to £985,114. A further payment of approximately £591,00 is expected to be made in the near future. Thus, by the end of 1961-62, total contributions will have amounted to approximately £1,769,758. In addition, Australia made a voluntary contribution of £334,932 in 1960-61 towards a special fund established to provide emergency technical assistance to the Congo. 2. Australia's contributions have been paid into the United Nations' account for the Congo Force and thus have lost their individual identity.

Mr Whitlam asked the Treasurer, upon noticeDoes he propose to remove the £2,750 limit which he fixed on 9th January, 1960, on housing loans to individuals by the Commonwealth Trading Bank or the Commonwealth Savings Bank? Mr Harold Holt -The answer to the member's questions are as honourable member's question is as follows:The Commonwealth Banking Corporation Board periodically reviews the maximum amount of individual credit foncier loans made by the Commonwealth Savings Bank for housing purposes under Part VI . of the Commonwealth Banks Act 1959-1962. In making these reviews, the Board takes into account the funds available to the Bank for such loans, the extent of the demand on the bank for such loans and other relevant circumstances. As a result of a recent review by the Board, the maximum amount of a credit foncier loan was raised last February from £2,500 to £2,750, which happens to be the maximum amount at present prescribed under the Commonwealth Banks Regulations. This was the extent of the increase which the board, after full consideration of the factors referred to above, felt to be practicable for the time being. It needs to be appreciated, of course, that the funds available to the Commonwealth Savings Bank for credit foncier housing loans are not unlimited. An increase in the amount of individual loans must, unless it is accompanied by an increase in the amount of funds available for such loans, mean a corresponding reduction in the number of loans the bank can make. The board has, therefore, to strike a balance between the objectives of assisting the greatest practicable number of the bank's customers to obtain homes and of pitching the maximum individual amount at the highest practicable level. The board would like to be able to raise further the increased maximum individual amount it fixed last February. However, it naturally wishes number of new decimal coins on an economical to examine the effects of the increase to £2,750 before considering further action. If as a result of experience in regard to the present maximum of £2,750, the board felt it could increase the maximum further, the Government would sympathetically consider the question of increasing the present limit to £2,750 under the Commonwealth Banks Regulations. Although Part VI. of the Commonwealth Banks Act, which provides for the making of housing loans on special terms, formally apphes to the Commonwealth Trading Bank as well as to the Commonwealth Savings Bank, all such business is in practice undertaken by the Commonwealth Savings Bank. The Commonwealth Trading Bank does, however, provide some housing finance on an ordinary overdraft basis and the limit of £2,750 does not apply to this lending. Decimal Currency. Mr Uren asked the Treasurer, upon notice1. Is it likely that Australia will adopt a for the majority of the items. The United States decimal system of coinage? 2. Would this require a large issue of new which tenders may be expected for items which coins? 3. Would the existing mints in Melbourne and prices. Each tender will be examined in accordance Perth be unable to cope with the job? 4. If so, what are the reasons for the inability taken that a specific item of equipment will be of these mints to expand their capacity? 5. Have proposals been considered for the establishment in Canberra of a mint equipped with American machinery? 6. Would this involve a net cost of dollar coins would balances and result in the production of coins intention of American size and weight? 7. Would this involve the obsolescence of country. existing parking meters, slot machines and teleto be given to sucb matters in due course. phone appliances and their replacement by American-produced meters, appliances? Mr Harold Holt -The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:1. The Government has on a number of occasions affirmed its support in principle for a system of decimal carrency, but it has not yet decided upon a precise time-table for a changeover, nor on the procedures which would have to be adopted prior to the changeover date. i 2, 3 and 4. If a system of decimal currency were introduced into Australia, a very large number of new coins would need to be available by the changeover date, or very shortly afterwards, in order to ensure that any inconvenience caused to the public would be reduced to the barest minimum. The two Mints situated in Melbourne and Perth are the only remaining oversea branches of the Royal Mint, London, but the buildings and equipment are owned by the Governments of Victoria and Western Australia, respectively. Subject to the limitations imposed by some of the out-of-date equipment installed, both mints are efficiently operated but they would be incapable of producing the requisite basis and within an acceptably short period. It has been decided that the only practicable method of overcoming the problem of replacing every coin at present in circulation while at the same time providing for the increasing annual requirements of an expanding population, would be to establish a new national mint centrally placed in Canberra and equipped with modern machinery suitable for large-scale production techniques. This machinery is such that a single installation would be adequate for Australian requirements for many years to come, and it would not be practicable to equip one or other of the two present mints (neither of which is in any case under Commonwealth control) with new machinery of this type, without a major reconstruction and extension of the buildings well beyond the limits of their existing sites. 5. It is expected that tenders will be called in due course, in Australia and overseas, for most items of equipment to be installed in the National Mint. While some of the equipment has not been produced in Australia so far, it is expected that Australian manufacturers will be able to tender of America is only one of several countries from cannot be produced in Australia at competitive with normal practice, and no decision has been purchased from a particular country. 6 and 7. No final decision has been taken on the precise sizes and weights which new decimal have, but the Government has no that they should necessarily be identical in size and weight with the coins of any particular A great deal of consideration will need machines and Tobacco. Mr Harding asked the Minister for Primary Industry, upon notice1. What weight of tobacco was grown in the Clare-Millaroo-Dalbeg area this year? 2. How much was sold? 3.

Wheat. Mr Beaton asked the Minister for Primary Industry, upon notice1. Is the Minister in a position to state whether China has honoured its agreement in connection with the buying of wheat on credit from Canada? 2. Has China met all payments which have fallen due in respect of its purchases of wheat from Australia? honourable member's questions are as follows:1. Australia has no first-hand knowledge on the subject, but I have not heard any suggestion to the contrary. 2. The Australian Wheat Board has not experienced any difficulties in this connection up to date. Assistance to Primary Producers in Queensland. Mr Gray asked the Minister for Primary Industry, upon notice1. Has his attention been drawn to the serious plight of primary producers in central Queensland who are still suffering from the effects of a prolonged and disastrous drought? 2. If so, can he say whether many of these producers, owing to the adverse conditions and on hire purchase the payments for which, under 3. Will the Government consider proclaiming follows:1. For some years the monsoonal rain influences which are so important to primary production in Queensland have not fully benefited many parts of the State, including the area represented by the honourable member for Capricornia. The patchy and spasmodic nature of the rainfall has had an adverse effect on primary production, particularly on crop production, but I have not been informed that primary producers in central Queensland are in serious difficulties, nor has the Government been approached for any form of relief. The provision of drought relief within a State is of course primarily a matter for the State Government. 2. Information available to my department indicates that hire purchase debts represent a comparatively low proportion of total farm borrowings in central Queensland. It is appreciated that this is a broad picture and that in individual cases difficulties might well be experienced in meeting hire purchase payments. However, I am not aware that these difficulties are as widespread and serious as has been suggested by the honourable member. 3. Any measure to provide relief from debt by way of moratorium or otherwise on a regional basis within a State is a matter for the State government concerned.",77,Rural Credits Department
