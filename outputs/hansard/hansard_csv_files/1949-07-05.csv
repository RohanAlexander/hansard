3,Mr Thompson,"In view of thepossible by the use of substantial quantities of oil, and at great expense, to provide a certain amount of work in industry during the ooal strike, will the Prime Minister accede to the request of the Premier of South Australia for additional quantities of fuel oil for this purpose? tice during coal shortages or break downs of coal-fired electricity generating plants for the Minister for Shipping and Fuel to endeavour to provide sufficient fuel oil to operate auxiliary generating plants with a view to minimizing unemployment in industry. That was done with complete satisfaction in Western Australia some time ago when a general instruction about the use of fuel oil was issued. However, the Oommonwealth has not now the control over oil supplies that it had in those days. The Premier of South Australia has approached me on this matter. I have already discussed it with the Minister for Shipping and Fuel in respect of New South Wales, where the situation is probably more difficult than it is in South Anstralia. I have arranged with the Minister for the Navy for the release of 20,000 tons of fuel oil, and import licences for a further 20,000 tons have been issued. Tbe Oommonwealth will do everything possible in thia direction to prevent unnecessary unemployment. representing the Minister for Social Services say whether the Government bas considered paying unemployment benefit to members of unions associated witb coal-mining when those members bave been stood down through no fault of tbeir own? Social Serviees is now considering the scope and volume of unemployment benefit payments in connection with the present dispute. The matter baa been discussed, and it bas been left to tbe Minister to draft a statement explaining to whom unemployment benefit will be paid, and the limitations that will be placed upon it. that only one-third of tbe miners voted in favour of tbe strike, and that certain lodges seem anxious to organize opposition to its continuance, I ask the Prime Minister whether the Government can guarantee protection to all tbose miners wbo would oome out into tbe open against tbeir leaders but for fear of victimization ? Can tbe Government do anything to allay tbe real fear of tbose rank and file miners, numbering two-thirds of tbe total, wbo did not attend tbe aggregate meetings? force, acting under tbe laws of tbe State, will ensure that no one is intimidated to the point of physical violence. The police are tbe only ones wbo can ensure the maintenance of law and order. As for the general question of tbose who, because of fear of intimidation, voted at the aggregate meetings in support of the strike, or refrained from attending the meetings, it seems ito me that tbe matter bas gone beyond sucb considerations From iray knowledge of the coalminers I should say that, once ia' decision .has been taken by the federation, it will receive tbe almost unanimous support of tbe men or, at any rate, of a very large proportion of tbem. I have tried to be as tolerant as possible, and to indicate to tbe miners that tbey cannot by any threat enforce their demands. Whatever tbeir grievances are -and I am not' now debating the merits of their claims-the y must be dealt with by the properly constituted authority. I do not tbink that anything can be done, except to await a move by the miners themselves, witbin tbeir own ranks, to reverse tbeir former decision. By that, I mean a move by tbe miners as a body. My experience of tiie miners is that tbey cannot be moved by screeching speeches, but that they can be moved by reasonand logic to have some consideration for tbe people of the country to which .they belong. tions to tbe Prime Minister. 1. Has tbe Joint Ooal Board intimated to tbe Government that it is prepared to accept tbe principle of a 35-hour week and long service leave for tbe miners ? 2.

9,Mr Lang,"I direct a series of quesrepresentatives of the Deputies and Shotfirers Association offer at the compulsory conference, to concede the mechanical extraction of pillars, if the board accepted the 85-hour week? 4. Would the mechanical extraction of pillars compensate for the 35-hour week, according to the board's figures? 5. Has the Joint Coal Board advised the Government that it would be possible to increase production, even with long service leave and the 35-hour week, by increased mechanization? 6. Finally, failing a settlement of the strike at a compulsory conference within a week, will the Government consider having aggregate meetings called at which terms of settlement would be submitted direct to the miners by representatives of the Government and of the Australian Council of Trades Unions? the .honourable member's question involve reference to the authorities that he has mentioned. However, I think that I can make a couple of points clear. I know of no offer by anybody to make a settlement with relation to thc claim for a 35-liour week in the coal-mining industry. That matter would be determined by the Coal Industry Tribunal. service leave could not be granted to the miners unless some provision was made to meet the cost involved. Some time ago the Minister for Shipping and Fuel and I were asked whether the Government would be prepared to make finance available if the Coal Industry Tribunal decided that long service leave should be granted to the miners. We indicated to the Coal Industry Tribunal that it was of no use his making an award granting long service leave unless there was some provision for meeting the cost of it, ancl that because of the existing conment, in Sydney particularly, and, of ditions in the coal-mining industry, that could not be done by the various owners. I then intimated that if, in the judgment of the Coal Industry Tribunal, the principle of long service leave for the coalminers should be established, I should be prepared to recommend to the Government that it apply an excise on coal to provide the necessary money. It was of no use his granting the long service leave claim unless he had some indication that money would be found. No [04] attempt was made on the Government's behalf to persuade the tribunal in one way or the other. being as good as a hod. generally agreed that the principle of long service leave is sound. I expressed no opinion about the duration of long service leave, or the conditions on which it might be granted. Those would be matters for the Coal Industry Tribunal to determine. would the miners have to be concerned in order to qualify for long service leave? honourable members inquiry whether the Government would be prepared to call aggregate meetings on the coal-fields for the purpose of addressing the miners, is "" No"". If aggregate meetings are desired they should be called by the miners' federation. I do not think that the honourable member is getting anywhere by these tactics. As I have said before, I hope that the miners themselves will see the wisdom of reversing their decision'. I understand that there is no suggestion Long that the miners on the northern coalfields are Communist-controlled. I think that they are mostly supporters of the Australian Labour party. I am certainly not going to attempt to call aggregate meetings unless they are organized by representatives of the coal-mining industry. concerning the coal strike which I wish to address to the Prime Minister with the very short observation that there is a very large and growing volume of unemploycourse, elsewhere; and ho doubt at some time in the future, if the strike lasts long enough, there will be also the problem of other supplies to citizens. I ask the right honourable gentleman how the Government is proposing to relieve the position by enabling employment to be carried on by immediate supplies of coal? Last wepk, I raised the question of the open cut and suggested that a speedy development of open cut mining would yield from 120,000 tons to 150,000 tons",11,Tuesday 5 July 1949

15,Mr Menzies,"I preface a question of coal a week. Has the Government taken any steps, and, if so, what steps, to proceed with the immediate development of open-cut production ? Last week, I referred also to the fact that there is a substantial quantity of coal at grass in New South Wales. What steps is the Government taking to make that supply of coal, which I believe is actually in trucks, available to industry for essential purposes ? of coal in trucks on the northern field and 16,000 tons at Cullen Bullen on the Mudgee line at grass at the side of the railway. I think that I mentioned previously that the shifting of that coal might draw other unions into the dispute ; but the matter of shifting it should that become necessary in order to meet the requirements of hospitals and for other urgent purposes, has been and is being examined. not believe that anything can be gained by shifting it because it is fifths of a day's production. I do not propose to say anything further about that General been advised of the proceedings aspect at the moment. As I also explained previously, a number of unions which are involved in deep mining are also involved in open-cut mining. I mention, for instance, the Federated Engine Drivers and Firemen's Association, and that at Cullen Bullen the open-cut coal is handled from the stacks into the trucks by members of the miners' federation. I do not believe that anything can be gained by involving a great number of other unions hy widely extending the field of tbe dispute until the coal-miners themselves have had a reasongation is proceeding in two courts. Action able opportunity opportunity-a month? be gained by involving other unions at present because open-cut production represents only from one-fifteenth to oneJustice Kelly from proceeding further. fourteenth of total production. Therefore, by taking that action we should widely extend the dispute without gaining any substantial advantage. Prime Minister, Mr Deputy Speaker, I ask him whether he does not realize that General whether discussions have taken there are already hundreds of thousands of other unionists involved in this issue through no fault of their own? The Prime Minister must be permitted to make his own reply. the interjection by the Leader of the Opposition, that nobody has a better realization of the position than I have. Prime Minister do something about the matter? a short period the Combined Mining Unions Council will realize the wisdom of acting upon ths declaration iby both the Australian Government and the New South Wales Government that disputes involving the mining industry must be settled by arbitration. It may be that At the moment I do reason and understanding will not prevail, in which event the matter will then have to be considered in. all ite the equivalent of only twoaspects. in Sydney which have arisen out of the direction by Chief Judge Kelly to the representatives of certain trade unions to make documents available to the court and to furnish assurances concerning money drawn from the bank accounts of those unions?

26,Mr Spender,"I ask the Attorneyplace between himself and the Attorney General of New South Wales with a view to having efficient legislation to control union funds passed by either the Commonwealth or the New South Wales Parliament. If there is any doubt at all about the constitutionality of the act recently passed by this Parliament, the Attorney-General discuss with the State authorities the passing of complementary legislation so that, with measures un the statute-books of both Parliaments, there will be no possibility of a successful challenge? cussion on that precise point; but I appreciate the importance which the honourable member's suggestion would have should any legal difficulties arise. I do not think that I can say any more about the matter at present. mentioned recently that the Government was examining the possibility of importing coal from abroad, and had made certain inquiries. I ask the right honourable gentleman whether he has received any reply to those inquiries, and if so, whether he can say what quantity of coal can be made available for purchase by Australia, and how soon it can be brought to this country? that the Government had already sponsored the importation of quantities of coal for the Government of Victoria. Without Commonwealth sponsorship, the fndian Government will not make an allocation of coal to this country. I understand that Victoria ie making every endeavour to charter sufficient shipping to import 150,000 tons of coal. The Premier of South Australia has asked for Commonwealth sponsorship for the importation of coal from the United Kingdom to enable concentrates to be carried from BrokenH ill to Port Pirie. An import licence is, of course, aot necessary. I understand that a quantity of coal can be obtained by South Australia for that purpose. The Commonwealth has not yet been informed of what quantities of coal will be available for importation to Australia or what shipping can be obtained for the purpose. Inquiries have been instituted. for Civil Aviation what are the results of the preliminary investigations authorized by the Regional Superintenwill dent of Air Navigation and Safety, MrH . E. Fry, into the tragic crash last Saturday of a MacRobertson-M Her DC3 aircraft near Perth in which eighteen people-fourtee n passengers, three pilots and one air hostess-los t their lives. In view of the seriousness of this and other recent air crashes, particularly the Bilinga fatality, will the Minister order a public inquiry into the air accident at Perth? tion of the Perth disaster has already begun. The honourable member for Perth has already inquired about this matter. T he Prime Minister Investigations by the Regional Superintendent of Air Navigation and Safety, MrH . E. Fry, into the cause or probable cause of the accident began on the spot within half an hour of the crash. Mr J. E. Schofield, inspector of accidents, left Melbourne by air for Perth on the morning of the accident, and Mr J. H . Harper, Chief Inspector of Accident Investigation, arrived at Perth on Monday to take charge of the investigation now being held. The investigation is being conducted by qualified pilots. A ll circumstances of the crash and the conditions which may have caused it, will be thoroughly examined, and a report will be made to the department and to me as early as possible. There is evidence to show that the load on the aircraft was witliin the permissible weight limit when it took off from Guildford aerodrome, and that the engines were functioning normally immediately prior to the take off. When the report is available, immediate consideration will be given to whether any steps can be taken to prevent similar accidents occurring. WnEAT.

Does the Prime Minister propose to give the House any opportunity to discuss the basic issues that will come up for consideration at that conference? Will the right honourable gentleman consider making a statement to the House to enable a debate to take place? I suggest that he might move that the documents concerning the dollar position in relation to petrol which he recently circulated be printed so as to enable a debate to take place.

I understand that the Chancellor of the Exchequer proposes to make a statement in the House of Commons to-morrow. I do not know how far that statement will go. I have been kept very fully informed concerning the position, which can be expressed in a few words. Expenditure on imports for the United Kingdom and the rest of the sterling area has not increased because of the severe restrictions on their earning power. For example, we shall not be able to sell to the dollar area more tban half the quantity of wool that we anticipated selling to it. That also applies to a large number of commodities which the British Commonwealth sells for dollars. We are not getting the prices or soiling the quantities desired, witb the result that our dollar earnings have been reduced very considerably. At the same time the cost of imports has not been reduced proportionately. That is the crux of the situation that must be confronted at the forthcoming conference. It is hoped to evolve a policy to restrict our dollar imports to the minimum, and also some positive policy for the future. I should be glad to afford the House an opportunity to discuss the matter, but, quite frankly. I could not, without placing myself in a most invidious position, place before it all the information that has been given to me in complete confidence by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who has to deal with the financ'al authorities of other nations. He has given me a very close confidential view of the whole position, and I believe that if I were to make that information the subject of public discussion I should not be kept well informed of Empire developments in the future. SinceI desire to obtain the maximum information concerning such matters, I think that the debate on international affairs would be the appropriate occasion to discuss the matter mentioned by the honourable member. with the Government's socialization policy, its present Micawber-like attitude towards the great industrial crisis, and its reluctance to deal with communism The honourable member is quite familiar with the Standing Orders.

That is tbe reply that 1 make to the honourable member for Warringah. Only four members of the Opposition participated in the debate on this bill. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) was so distrustful of his followers that be would not allow any more of them to speak. He was not certain what they would say. A loose word, an expression of opinion at an inopportune moment, might have put the Opposition parties at a disadvantage in the next general election. The Leader of the Opposition was the only authorized speaker for the Liberal party. The Deputy Leader of the Australian Country The honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Turnbull) stumbled in, and made an unjustified attack on the honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr predecessors administered it. I have Fraser) for his sapient utterances. The right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) felt that he had to speak, because he had spoken in 1901 when the first Immigration Restriction Bill was before tbe Parliament, the bill which became the act that we are now his recent speech was very different from that of 1901. A t least, I stand now where he stood in 1901. Perhaps he is trying to find a reason for bis change of front, but I shall deal with bis observations as I proceed. As for the rest of the Opposition members, not a word was heard from them. Everything they had said outside the House about immigration was forgotten once they got inside. In compliance with requests by the Melbourne Herald management to criticize my views, the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Holt) attacked me daily when the Parliament was not sitting, but he has offered no criticism here. Simiwas representing the Opposition parties larly, the honourable member for Henty( Mr Gullett) once had a lot to say here and elsewhere, but he, too, has been singularly silent since the bill was introduced. What is true of him, is true also of other mesmibers of the Opposition. It has been an education to sit and listen to those honourable members opposite who did speak authoritatively for the Opposition-the Leader of the Opposition, and tbe honourable member for ducked his way through the debate. The Leader of the Opposition said that we were on common ground. So we were regarding a good deal of the debate. We ceased to be on common ground when he departed from the established policy of the nation, and said that we should make exceptions in individual cases. Then, he said, everything would be all right. I could make exceptions, and that would be the easy course to follow, but I refuse to do so because I know that the making of exceptions would establish precedents that ' would destroy our immigration policy in a few years. I am not going to haul down the flag which the people of Australia have kept aloft for 49 years. I repeat that, as the honourable member for Eden-Monaro also said, I have administered the law as every one of my made no departures from previous practice. I bave maintained the same set of principles. I have refused to make exceptions, in the saone way as tliey refused to make exceptions in identical cases. For that, I am criticized by tha briefly educated leader writers of the Australian press, criticized and attacked by amending; but his story in tbose who put political prejudice above patriotism, who seek to score a cheap political advantage over the Government, even if it means damaging the influence and prestige of this country among Asiatic peoples. We have no enmity or hostility against our near neighbours. All the criticism is directed against me with the intention of giving the impression that we desire to be at enmity with our neighbours, when the opposite is the truth. I appreciated the speech delivered by the honourable member for Bendigo at an Australian Natives Association conference in tbe city of Bendigo a few months ago. Paradoxically enough, he at the conference, and he proclaimed his faith to be the same as mine in maintaining our immigration policy. His speech and mine were delivered before a very representative cross-section of the public,",19,Calwell

76,"Indi ( Mr Mcewen), Wbo Twisted And","because the delegates to the Australian. Natives Association conference are drawn from all political parties and from among members of all religious creeds. There were at the conference members of the Victorian Parliament, including members of the three parties in it. What he said and what I said was unanimously accepted by the delegates to the conference. The issue in this debate is simple, and it ought approach to this matter. Let ns turn to not to be too much to expect a plain statement as to where the Opposition stands on the issue. Simply stated, the issue is that Australia has a restrictive immigration policy. It has had that policy since 1901. I did not establish it in 1949; I inherited it. It is something in which I believe and in which the Leader of the Opposition has said that he profoundly believes. I have inherited what every other member of this Parliament has inherited, and what every Australian government has practised since federation began. It is a policy which the Australian people at every federal election since 1901 have supported. The question to-day is, shall we continue witb that policy or shall we alter it? If we support the policy we endorse this legislation. If we are to throw away our halfcentury old policy, then we must throw out this bill which I have introduced. It is my opinion, however, that honourable members opposite do not like to have a simple decision like that posed to them. They do not care for a simple affirmative cr a simple negative. They prefer a "" maybe "", a "" however "", a "" nevertheless "" or a "" perhaps"". They want to translate this policy into the subjunctive mood and conjure up hypothetical cases. The real answer to their muddled talking is that they do not know what it is all about. Some honourable members opposite have declared: ""Yes; we are wholeheartedly behind the White Australia policy "". The Leader of the Opposition has proclaimed that faith on bebalf of bis party. Others have said: "" This policy is causing resentment among Asians "". Some have said: "" We in Australia are doing only what others are doing in tbeir countries"". Still others have said: ""Let us keep politics out of this "", and have then proceeded to try to make party political capital out of the issue. To the people of Australia listening to the expression of this muddled Ur. Calwell. thinking on the part of members of the Opposition, this must be a revelation. But I can add further revelations to make their bewilderment more profound. I do this not out of a sense of devilment but purely to imprest on them further, if further impressing is required, how insincere and inconsistent are honourable members opposite in their the views expressed iby tbe right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes), who has been in personal touch with this legislation for a longer period in this House than has any other honourable member. The right honourable gentleman is the last surviving sitting member of this Parliament who has been in it from the establishment of the federation Surely, one would think, his viewt of this subject have had time to crystallize over tbe long years during which he has sat in the Parliament. But not a bit of it. If anything, the right honourable gentleman is more muddled on this question than are his muddle-headed associates. Honourable members opposite will recall tbe finding of the JapaneseWar Crimes Tribunal at the close of the Pacific War. One of tbe representative* on that tribunal was Mr Justice, Pal. of India. In his finding the learned judge said that he believed that the right honourable member for North Sydney wa? to .blame for having contributed to the Japanese psychological preparation for war. It was recalled by the judge that at the Treaty of Versailles the right honourable gentleman, who was tben Prime Minister of Australia, had denied the proposition of racial equality. I referred to this incident in the House during a previous debate. Honourable members will recall from their reading of history that it had been desired to write into the Versailles Treaty a clause granting racial equality, and that the right honourable member for North Sydney had been responsible for having that proposition turned down. The Sydney Morning Herald of the 15th November last reported Mr Justice Pal's finding and also reoorted the right honourable member for North Sydney as having said this by way of comment on it Yes: I opposed tlie racial equality clause. HadI not done so, I would have been a traitor to Australia. [ leave it to honourable members opposite to judge how sincere were the protestations of the right honourable gentleman about this bill and how far they fit in with his declaration of November last when he was asked to comment on what an Indian judge had said in regard to his alleged responsibility for having contributed to the psychological preparation of Japan for war. To-day, when I , as Minister for Immigration, explain that the purpose of the bill is to maintain our homogeneity the Liberal party press tries to suggest that I am seeking to promote a superior race theory in Australia. Apparently the Liberal party press is confusing the superior race ideas of the right honourable member for North Sydney with what I have had to say on this subject. Labour Argus have to say on the subject? that the Argus is a Labour newspaper, although I admit that it does try to tell the truth more often now than it did a few weeks ago. The right honourable member for North Sydney made no secret of his racial prejudices. It was those prejudices which caused the Bombay Chronicle to make this commentMr Justice Pal did not exaggerate when he charged Mr Hughes w it h having provoked racialism by his conduct at the Versailles Peace Treaty. That comment appeared in the Sydney Daily Telegraph of the 13th December last; but within a little more than a month, the wily right honourable gentleman had again shifted his ground. Late in January of this year Mr Fandit Nehru, the Prime Minister of India, stated that India did not object to Australia's exercise of its right to select those who should settle within its boundaries, provided that the basis of the selection was not racial. According to thc Sydney Morning Herald the right honourable member for North Sydney said.Racial? Certainly not. He changed bis ground from racialism to that of economic theory. The Sydney Morning Herald of the 25th January carries his spirited declaration that the White Australia policy has always been based on economic grounds and on nothing else. This all gives great cause for wonder, a wonder which a columnist writing in the Sydney Daily Mirror, on Australia Day, the 26th January, expressed in these wordsH r . Hughes' published statement that White Australia is dictated by economic considerations does not square with what native Australians regarded in 1908 as his ""colour conscious pronouncement"", repeated in 1915 in defiance of censors and at various times' since then-that And this is a quotation from the right honourable gentleman's statementAustralia is a white speck i u a yellow ocean. Yet the right honourable gentleman has the hardihood to come into this House and sneer at a policy which I have consistently maintained and which is in line with that of all the governments with which he has been associated and of all the parties to which he has belonged. I could say a great deal more about the right honourable gentleman and the statements which he has made in the past. The right honourable gentleman once wrote a book called The Splendid Adventure. I am reminded of the passage in the Scriptures which readsOh that mine adversary had written a book. The Leader of the Opposition has cause to remember that passage. In The Splendid Adventure which was published in 1929 the right honourable member for North Sydney wroteThe"" W h i te A u s t r a l i a "" policy-as it is generally called-is an integral part of the national life of the Australian people and although the subject of much hostile criticism, the geographical, racial and economic circumstances of the Commonwealth amply justify it . That appears on page 357 of the book. Also on that page appears the following:For a people so situated the only alternative to national and racial extinction is a policy of rigid exclusion . . . We could not assiniiliite Asiatics without radically changing our racial, social and economic character. All those people who support the same political party as the right honourable gentleman opposite have delivered tlieir attacks at me not because I have altered anything that has been in existence since 1901, but simply because I have said on behalf of the Australian Government that",20,Calwell

On subsequent pages of this work honourable members will find quite a number of examples of attacks upon Asiatic people on racial grounds. But that does not deter the right honourable gentleman from coming here and trying to get into line with his press backers and with all of the people who say that we should break down our established policy because we happen to have on our hands 800 people to whom we gave refuge during the war, who were not entitled under the laws of this country to come here at all, but whom we admitted on humanitarian grounds at a time of great danger and on the condition that when the war was over they would return to their native lands. The Leader of the Opposition has made a number of statements concerning the bill. AlthoughI do not want to go through them all, I shall make some replies to those that I think are important. right honourable gentleman said that the attempts that I had made from time to time to raise party issues where none existed, and to arouse outside Australia an impression that there is in this Parliamember for Kooyong will do several ment a general Opposition attack on the national policy, is as gratuitous as it is mischievous. members to note the observation, "" a general Opposition attack"". He did not deny that the Opposition had made an attack, but objected to the impression being given by me that the attack that it desired to be specific had been couched in general terms. Honourable members opposite do not mind having a little bit each way. political reasons they want to be described at protagonists of the White Australia policy. They also want the right to say, "" We want to break it down here, there, or somewhere else"". I use the term ""White Australia policy"" for the purpose of convenience so that it will be readily understood. IfI talk about a ""restrictive immigration policy"" there will be many people in this country who Mr Calwell. will not quite understand what is meant, because White Australia is a journalese expression that has been in current use in this country since the '80's or '90's of the last century. My reply to the right honourable gentleman on this matter is that the members of the Opposition are careful to pay lip-service to the Australian selective immigration policy because they know how the Australian people feel about that matter. If they want a division on this bill we shall be most happy to see them divide; nobody would be happier than I to see them stand up and be counted. I think that they will "" squib "" the issue. They already are on record once as having voted against it when they moved the adjournment of the Parliament a few months ago. They attacked me on that occasion, but refused to accept my invitation to move a want of confidence in me as Minister for Immigration or to bring down a private member's bill to test the feeling of the House. Now when they have before them a bill on which they can vote, if they so desire, they are determined to be political "" squibs"". When the bill reaches the The committee stage they will have the opportunity to divide or to move an amend-. ment; if they fail to do so, thereafter they should not criticize the policy or the administration. The right honourable things. He will adopt one attitude in the Parliament and another attitude outI should like honourable side the Parliament. position, that if the Opposition supports a piece of legislation it must never thereafter criticize the administration? legislation is neither intricate nor comFor plex. It provides that certain people shall be allowed in, and that certain other people shall not be allowed into Australia. The right honourable gentleman cannot support the proposition that certain people must get out, and then later criticize the Minister who gets them out. It is as simple as that. Apparently it is too simple for the lawyers of the Opposition, who like to have all sorts of escape provisions to meet everything that they do.",22,Calwell

80,Mr Calwell,"That is right. This1 do hot wonder that the honourable member for Parramatta ( Mr Beale) haa hot been made a King's Councillor in New South Wales up to date. I further observe with relation to the criticism of the right honourable gentleman, that the general, concerted and organized attack of the Opposition on the administration of the policy was made because it knows that if it can hinder the administration sufficiently, and make it ineffective, the policy will fail and they will not have to take the blame for it. tf honourable members opposite had been permitted to succeed with this plan, no doubt they would have blamed the Government, and would have found their friends of the lickspittle press as eager to help them in that as they have been to rave against the immigration administration. I consider that the right honourable member for Kooyong believes in the maintenance of this policy, but cannot speak for the members of his party in this Parliament let alone the people who support his policy outside of the Parliament. On the other hand the members of the Australian Labour party can speak with one voice. We know where we stand and have always stood in the same position. ago the Minister complained that we had with different labels on them.

I wonder how honourable gentlemen opposite feel about bit observations? 1 remember reading in the Sydney Sunday Sun of the 27th March the report of an interview witb a young lady who had returned to Australia from Singapore. She was Mrs. Shierlaw, formerly a socialite in this c o u n t r y . He r m a i d e n name was R a d a P e n f o l d H y l a n d. T h a t is a hyphenated name, and people w it h hyphenated names do not vote for the Labourp a r t y . The r e p o r t is headedThe town is simply awful. She proceeded to criticize Sydney. Her story, as reported' in the Sydney Sunday Sun, is most interesting. She saidNice people were shunning Australians in Singapore beconse of Immigration Minister Calwell's enforcement of thc White Australia policy . . . Personally, I don't really know what to say ahout it . Think of all the coloured servants we could have in this vast continent of ours. Of course, inter-marriage is a frightfu l thing, but Mr Calwell ought to let the coloured people in to do a little work for us. Tliey are such wonderful workers. Quite lazy, of course, but tliey do respect the quality of leadership in tlieir bosses and they obey . . . In Singapore, things are demoralizingly easy. Quite sinful, in fact. Then this lady, with plenty of money hut apparently insufficient interests to stop her talking nonsense, saidFrom Mondays to Fridays you entertain in your own home or are entertained by your friends. Tip-illy, most of tbe business is done after «ix o'clock I always say. In Singapore, of course, you just don't have to do it thing for yourself. The servants do everything. I wonder w h a t p a r t y she votes for ? party. toria she would vote for the Liberal Country party, and if she were in New South Wales she would vote for the Liberal party. That shows that the leopard does not change his or her spots, or the Ethiopian the colour of his or her skin. These people are just the same as their forebears: the people who made money by exploiting unfortunate Asiatics, and Australians, too. I have cited those instances to show that honourable members opposite, in spite of what they may say, stand just where their political ancestors stood. ""Joe Palooka""? honourable member for Warringah with "" Joe Palooka"" the comparison would be all to the disadvantage of the honourable member. A member of the Conservative party of Great Britain visited Australia recently. I refer to Mr Anthony Eden, whom we were privileged to honour during his stay here. The honourable member for Warringah would not be able to get into even the right wing of that party if he went to that country. The Sydney Morning Herald of the 28th April last reported Mr Eden as sayingAustralians are acutely conscious of the racial problems which confront countries like Soutli Africa, and the recent outbreaks in the Union have strengthened the Commonwealth's determination to preserve a white Australia. Whether that is right or not, it is a different story from that told by honourable members opposite who say that I should make exceptions here, there and everywhere, tliat I should break down the White Australia policy or change the administration of it even if the policy were maintained and make it something altogether different from what it has been during the last 50 years party's platform, is your White Australia ? ence earlier in my speech; it appears on the first page of the party's platform under the heading, "" Methods"".

That statement contains none of the nonsense about "" the preservat on of the ideals of a White Australia policy "" as the Liberal party puts out.

Whilst in one column that newspaper attacked me alleging that I was endangering the White Australia policy, it published in an adjoining column an article written by a distinguished Indian, who is a graduate in law arr arts, in which 1 he saidWe Asiatic people do not know why a country like Australia should adopt a closeddoor attitude at this stage . . . Asiatics feel that they have suffered tremendous injusof the House on the subject. tices at thc hands of the white people; . . . There can be no doubt about that last statement at any rate; but we have never been part of the exploiting classes, the imperialisms that have robbed them and ruined them. That article continuedMorally, or in common justice, the White Australia policy is untenable. The Melbourne Herald, it will be observed, had no objection to publishing that statement alongside an editorial in which it attacked me. The article continuedEconomically there is much to be said in favour of abandoning the White Australia Policy. Australia suffers severely from shortat the committee stage or vote against age of man-power. Why not allow Asiatics to come here and help? This would unburden unemployment problems in Asiatic countries and be of inestimable vali:e in raising Australia's production, ultimately leading to a decrease in prices of essential commodities. That means, in effect, cheap labour and the slashing of living standards. The Melbourne Herald had no objection to propagating those ideas under cover of a contributed article, whilst, at the same time, it made its attack upon me. So long as the Labour party remains in office it will uphold the White Australia policy, and wliile I have the privilege of administering that policy it will remain unchanged and unchangeable.

Eric Spooner said in advocating the quota system, and also what Sir Henry Barwell, who at one time was Premier of South Australia and later a member of the Senate, said on the same subject.

It supports the bills that provide that war-time refugees must leave Australia. The AusW e do not deport tralian Natives Association has said the same thing in a letter addressed to me, which was signed by the federal president of the organization. It readsYou may he assured my dear Mr Minister that the members of tliis great Australian association, together with, 1 firmly believe, every other good Australian comprising the overwhelming majority of the Australian people, stand four-square with you in your declaration "" that irrespective of who criticizes or who complains, and irrespective of whatever practices the opponents of our immigration laws may resort to, these laws will remain unchanged and unchangeable.

If they will not move to diminish my powers, then they have got to put up with me and my exercise of those powers. I shall not be influenced by what honourable members opposite said when they asked me to treat certain cases differently from other cases. All cases will be treated alike. There will be no favouritism 9hown to one case or another nor will there by any fear shown in the administration of the law. That is the only honest way in which this law can be administered and it is tbe way in which it has always been administered. What is proposed in this clause is to restore the legal position to what we thought it was before the High Court of Australia gavo its decision in the O'Keefe case. The court said that the Government oould not do certain things. The Government's legal advisers advised that if certain languages were used in the statute those things could be done. In this clause I propose to take the power to do them. Those who do not want me to have that power may vote against the clause or move an amendment, perhaps to .provide for a quota system. They can move for the insertion of a completely new clause if they choose. The title of the bill specifimoderation and that I made great concescally statesA bill foi an act to amend the Immigration Act 1901-1948, and for other purposes. The words "" and for otlier purposes"" were included so that honourable members opposite would not be precluded from moving an amendment merely on the technical ground that the title of the bill was not comprehensive enough. If the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender) desires to move his "" black, brown or brindle"" amendment, he can do it now. the Opposition) [4.47] I rise primarily to express to the Minister my profound sympathy. Never since I came into this Parliament have I seen a man so bitterly disappointed. All his heroics have been wasted. All his attempts to create a false issue have been frustrated. He reminds me of nothing so much as the celebrated passage in English literature which described the Mauretanian tiger as lashing himself into a fury with his own taila word which might be spelt either way and still be completely appropriate. It may or may not be necessary, but I have decided that it is necessary for the Opposition to state once more where it stands in this matter. I do not feel any embarrassment in speaking on behalf of the Opposition because I had assumed that the Minister was speaking on behalf of the Government. As Leader of the Opposition, I see nothing odd whatever in making our position perfectly clear-althoug h the Minister appeared to experience considerable embarrassment in speaking on behalf of the Government-o n a matter in which the Minister's chief ambition has been to create false impressions and to give a false impression to the people. SoI restate the position. We, on this side of the chamber, have been responsible for the administration of this national policy for 36 of the 48 years of the history of the Commonwealth. I bave only to say that to indicate what nonsense it is to assert that there has been some division in the Opposition parties about the immigration policy. The criticisms that have been made by the Opposition-and I believe that I have voiced my criticism with singular sions to the Minister by so doing-ar e that the Minister has assumed that he has no discretion whatever in any individual case. I point out to the committee once more that again and again the present legislation confers a discretion upon the Minister. Indeed, I repeat something that I said on a former occasion, when I say that tbe real point of criticism is that the Minister, on his own showing, has declined to exercise that discretion, although the very law which he invokes imposes upon him the necessity for exercising discretion. That its our point. Of course the Opposition is in favour of the Immigration Act. Of course we are in favour of altering a law. a loop hole in which has been discovered by a decision of the High Court. I make no secret of that. The decision of the High Courta majority decision-produce d a",29,Calwell
128,Mr Menzies (Kooyong,"Leade r ofresult that none of us had ever thought of before. It produced this state of affairs: that the act nieant something that no one in the Parliament ever understood it to mean in the course of 48 years of administration. To overcome that difficulty the Minister has introduced a bill to amend that act. We support him in endeavouring to overcome that difficulty. However, we take advantage of the occasion to point out that as the act stands at present, andeven when it has been amended, it will still contain a dozen difierent provisions which repose a discretion in the Minister who has to administer it. When the Minister is confronted by a case which falls within any of these provisions he will have to consider the facts of that particular case. In fact, all the debate on the Immigration Act that has taken place in this chamber recently has arisen out of two or three cases. I , myself, participated in the debate on one of them, the O'Keefo case. I remind the committee that in that case the matter to be decided was uot whether the O'Keefe's were to be left here in perpetuity, but whether, in spite of tlie circumstances, they should be sent out of the country. That was, I repeat, a matter of discretion. I do not begin to understand why the Minister, whose views on the national policy are identical with my own, should rigidly get himself into a position of saying: "" I cannot exercise my discretion in favour of an individual without automatically opening the flood-gates and destroying the whole policy ""-as he expressed himself on one occasion. So, I simply repeat that the Opposition has made it clear that it supports the Immigration Act and it supports the principle of this amending legislation. The Opposition has urged upon the Minister that he should apply a discretionary mindindeed, a discreet mind-to the matters that, come before him for decision. That is the whole line that we have adopted throughout the discussion of this act, and that is still our view. I deeply regret that the Minister's ambitions should be frustrated or his feelings wounded because he cannot persuade the Opposition to cast a vote that he will then describe as a. vote against the policy that we have upheld consistently when our Sir. Menzies. parties have been in office. I am sorry to disappoint him in that respect, but I have risen to make it quite clear that notwithstanding the Minister's disappointment, we stand as we have always stood on this matter. I have repeated our position merely so that it will not be obscured by anything that the Minister has said. for Information and Minister for Immigration) [4.55] -The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) has offered me his sympathy. I think that he had better save it for himself and the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes). They will need a lot of sympathy when they are explaining away their attitude before the electorate. I promise them my best endeavours to elucidate their position when they are endeavouring to explain it to the electorate. The Leader of the Opposition said that the political parties which he represents have been in power for 32 years, but I remind him that a long time has elapsed since they were last in power. Indeed, that time has been so long that they have nearly forgotten the taste of power. The Leader of the Opposition said that when they were in office they bad power to administer this law with discretion. So they did. We have had the same power for eight years, and we have administered it with precisely the same discretion as they exercised. What he wants me to do now is something that they would never do when they were in power during those 32 years. No non-Labour administration would ever admit the right of an Australia to bring in an Asiatic-born wife or husband. None of them would permit it. In the course of my second-reading speech I cited instances of their refusal to do so. Sir William Glasgow, Sir George Pearce, the Hon. J. A. J. Hunter and several other members of non-Labour administrations who administered our immigration laws at various periods said to Japanese pearlers and others, "" You cannot stay in Australia merely because you have married an aboriginal woman; you have to go "". That is all I am doing now. In this debate the Opposition has dishonestly failed to face up to the issue that the people whom I have refused permission;",30,Calwell
129,Mr Calwell (Melbourne,"Ministe rto stay in this country are not those who were admitted to Australia in accordance with the provisions of the act as it was ordinarily understood, from 1901 to 1939. Our critics deliberately ignore the fact that the cases under discussion are those of war-time refugees and not of individuals who are ordinarily admitted to this country under our laws. Members of the Opposition do not criticize my administration in connection with those who have entered this country under the ordinary operation of our laws, because they cannot find anything to criticize.. They criticize me in regard to those people, of Australian citizenship, the right to who came in as war-time refugees and. now remain in Australia. Those people are a recalcitrant minority who have refused to go home. Approximately 6,000 Asiatic war-time refugees entered Australia during the war. Four thousand left Australia others were persuaded to go under threat of deportation, whilst others were actually deported. There remain a comparatively small number who like this country and are endeavouring to remain here. The right honourable gentleman said that there were a score or so of such cases and that they should be aUowed to remain here. I remind him that when anti-Labour administrations were in office none of them ever permitted any such persons to remain. The Leader of the Opposition complained of my having refused to exercise a discretion to permit them to remain. I say that I have exercised that discretion neither more nor less than did the Opposition parties when they were in power. He has asked me to make exceptions in the case of those who came to this country during the war because they were refugees, but I have refused to do so. Because he speaks on behalf of the Opposition parties, I say that tbey are breaking down the ""White Australia policy to the extent that they seek to establish such precedents that it would be impossible to maintain the White Australia policy in future and be consistent. More and more of these cases wil] arise. Every day in the week-and I am not speaking figuratively, but literally-peopl e are coming to us and saying, "" Why cannot Australian-born people bring in wives or fiancees from Asiatic countries ?"" We have a large Australian population 1941 who are of Chinese ethnic origin. They have some tradition that they should bring their husbands or their wives from China to Australia. I refuse to allow them to do so. As Australians, they are entitled to no more rights and no less rights than any other Australian has, and they cannot be Australians on the one hand, and Chinese on the other. If I agree that refugees who were washed up on these shores during the war may remain here, how can I deny to Australians of Asiatic origin, to whom we have given all the rights and privileges bring in their wives and husbands from Asiatic countries? I refuse to make that alteration in the practice of my Labour and non-Labour predecessors, who have administered our immigration laws. Bewithout causing difficulty; cause I take that attitude, I am attacked by the Opposition and the press. The Leader of the Opposition has said that he has attacked me on the case of Mrs. O'Keefe. That is true, but there are other people who attack me because I will not allow Gamboa to live in Australia. AfterI have twice refused him the right to reside here permanently, he dishonestly suggests that he should be allowed to enter as a visitor. Once he entered Australia, I should have to go through all the processes of the law to put him out, and the fifth column press of the country would write up the case, and publish photographs of the woman as she was putting her children to bed at night, thereby playing on the sentiment and tearing at the heartstrings of other women in order to depict me as a heartless creature. There was a time when a wife went with, her husband to her husband's domicile. We have now reached a new order, apparently, in this age of sex equality, when a wife determines or has an equal right in determining where the husband shall reside. I am not letting Gamboa. into Australia. The Leader of the Opposition has not attacked me for that', but some of his followers have done so.. The Tower of Babel is not to be compared with the differing voices that are raised among members of the Liberal party and the Australian Country party on our immigration policy. They make attacks on me on the ground that I am not using my discretionary power. I throw their charges in their teeth. I have not acted contrary to the established policy that my predecessors followed. None of them had a war-time refugee problem to handle. £t is a new and special problem, and it must be handled in a special way. In 1943, Cabinet decided that all the refugees should leave Australia by 1945. However, in 1945, Cabinet said, in effect, ""Well, conditions are still disturbed in the world. We shall allow the refugees to remain until June, 1947 "". If I had got rid of them in 1945 discretionary power -It is most diflicult to follow the Minisstance, the discretionary power was not invoked. There were physical difficulties in the way of returning the refugees to their native lands. Minister invoked his discretionary power. can twist words any way they like. In 1945, Cabinet decided that the war-time refugees had to leave this country by June, 1947. There had to come a limit some time. I gave some exemptions did. power. tions for various purposes after 1947, but all the time, I indicated to the persons concerned that a final date for their departure had to be fixed. The final date was fixed, not immediately the war ended but from three to three and a half years after they should have gone to their homes. But they dug in tlieir toes, and said, "" We will fight "". A newspaper raised subscriptions to help tbem to fight. For what reason? To enable them to remain longer? Not at all! Thc purpose was to enable them to remain here permanently. The honourable member for Warringah has a distinguished colleague, Mr J. Cassidy, JX.C, of Sydney, and his name appeared with that of Ah Fat iii the subscription list. The name of another Liberal, Dr. F. A. Maguire, appeared with that of Lee Jan Sing, and the jockey,. Darby Munro, was bracketed with Asiatics in the subscription list which had been opened for the purpose of defeating the whole policy, and enabling certain, refugees to remain permanently in Australia. A sum of £1,000 was raised by this anti-Australian newspaper for the purpose of defeating the White Australia policy, and allowing those people to remain here permanently. They are not staying here permanently. I repeat that. A time had to be fixed, and if I had not been so considerate, I would have none of the problems and none of the headache* that I have since acquired. ter for Immigration ( Mr Calwell). ne ranges from China to Peru, from the subject of Mrs. O'Keefe and Sergeant Gamboa to the White Australia policy, for which 'he has stood these many years, but which he discovered only a few days ago. The honourable gentleman is what I call a psychological problem. I need not go back any further than this afternoon to find an instance of his method of dealing with this matter. He has questioned the sincerity of honourable members on this side of the chamber who have supported the White Australia policy. That was a most impudent thing to do. The Minister must know perfectly well what the position is. I remind him He exercised his discretionary that I voted for this White Australia policy in 1901, long, long before the dreadful calamity of his coming overwhelmed an already burdened world. I need not particularize about it further, for there he is in front of us. However, it was in 1901 that the White Australia policy was introduced by a Liberal governmeut, and was supported by all the parties in the Parliament, irrespective of their political views. It worked so effectively and so smoothly for nearly 50 years that no incident occurred with our eastern neighbours. case or Gamboa case, and admittedly the High Court had not told us about the constitutional difficulty regarding certain aspects of our immigration laws.

He believes that every hand is against bim, and that every criticism of his administration is inspired by malice or party political considerations. That means, of course, that every public man and every clergyman in Australia who has dared to suggest that the Minister might have been wrong in his administration of our immigration policy has been speaking maliciously or in bad faith. The fact is that every criticism of any substance that-1 have heard or read has been only of the manner in which the Minister has administered a policy with which everybody in this chamber agrees. The Minister claims that the policy must be administered' in the same way as it has been administered by his predecessors; but everybody knows that throughout the 48 years of Australia's immigration policy there have been countless exceptions made in individual cases. The telescope has now and then been put to the blind eye. Tbe very fact that thousands of people came to Australia in wartime and that the Minister is now attempting to deport some of them is an admission that discretion has been exercised in the past. Yet he says that he must never exercise discretion. I shall draw the attention of tbe committee to a recent case in which the Minister did what he now claims he must not do. Everybody in this chamber is familiar with the case of Gwenda Yee, a Chinese girl of seventeen or eighteen years of age, who was born in China and was brought to this country with otber members of her large family by her Britishborn Chinese father. A couple of years ago, her father decided to take his family back to China and made arrangements to do so. Tbe family had required landing permits upon arrival in Australia. Gwenda wanted to remain in this country and she ran away from home. There was a newspaper story that she was to be taken back to China to marry a Chinese. The Minister announced his intention to enforce the law against Gwenda Yee, and, in the jargon of the courts, he sought to have her ""picked u p "" so that the dictation test could be applied to her. She was in love with an Australian cry by various people, including members of returned soldiers' organizations, who wanted her to be allowed to remain in this country. Her father still wanted her to return with the family to China and the Minister sided with him. Subsequently, officers of the Crown Solicitor's Department appeared in the police court proceedings at which tbe girl sought leave to marry, and leave was refused with the Government's support. The attitude taken was that the girl must go. Public agitation continued, and another application was made for leave for the girl to he married. Once again the Crown was represented, but this time not to oppose the granting of leave, but to urge that the matter be left to the court. member know why? business. the Minister to say one thing and then to do the very opposite and now say that he must not do so. However, the girl was eventually given leave to marry, and the Minister abandoned his previous attitude and permitted her to remain in this country and marry the Australian soldier. I am not saying whether the Minister was right or wrong in doing that. view that the father's wishes should prevail and that she should return to China. However, that is neither here or there. I do not complain because she is now here and is the wife of an Australian citizen, but I do draw the attention of the committee to the fact that the Ministerquite properly perhaps-di d exercise his discretion, and permit the girl to remain in this country. I shall offer no opinion on that decision. The fact remains that he took action under the Immigration Act which he now says he had never taken. Both the Minister and I know that special circumstances were associated with that case. However, if the Minister's action was proper in that instance, why should he not exercise his discretion on other occasions when the",34,Calwell

Therefore, in Australia policy. peace-time, the only question that arises is the exercise of discretion to admit Asiatics to Australia on a temporary basis.

There is no doubt about my position regarding the White Australia policy, and I am absolutely certain that other members on the Opposition side of the House take up the same position, although they may argue about minor aspects of it. I believe that the Minister for Immigration ( Mr Calwell) should exercise some reason and fairness in his dealings with war refugees, especially those who might be risking their lives by returning to their own, countries.

In a recent speech in this House, I repeated what I had said in 1901 when the original Immigration Restriction Act was under consideration. I was entirely in favour of Mr Deakin's proposal, although it stopped short of what the Labour party desired. BecauseI was a member of the Labour party then, I naturally would have preferred its policy to be embodied in the legislation. However, members of the Labour party accepted Mr Deakin's proposal because tliey were satisfied that it would achieve, in effect, all that they desired. It is perfectly true that, by virtue of our geographic circumstances, the attitude of the Labour party was directed towards the exclusion of coloured labour.

For «. people so situated the only alternative to national and racial extinction is a pnlicy of rigid exclusion.

He has charged me with all sorts of things. I did not note his exact words, nor did I read a word of his speech as reported in Hansard or in the press; but I knew from the general tenor of his observations that he was seeking an opportunity to pay back a few old scores. He is entitled to that privilege if he desires to exercise it. ""What The honourable member for Bourke( Mrs. I propose to do by this bill is to strengthen Blackburn) has foreshadowed an amendlegislation we have just passed, so that if the Immigration Act does not suffice, this special measure will meet the situation. This bill specifically deals with the ease of war-time evacuees. If the House agrees to this bill it will decide that all war-time evacuees, without exception, must leave Australia. If honourable members opposite want a division to be taken on the second reading of this bill, I shall be most happy to hear the division hells ringing. Mr Francis interjecting, ber for Moreton( Mr Francis) does not want a division to be taken on this bill any more than do other Opposition members. The honourable member for Reid has been in this Parliament for only a couple of years. honourable member for Boothby( Mr Sheehy). The honourable member for Reid has indulged in a lot of bitterness in the speeches which he has made in this Parliament. I do not suppose he was ever more violent or vicious in his attack than he was in the few words which I heard him say when speaking on this measure last week. In my charity I ascribe it all to his senility. One cannot expect an elderly man past the middle seventies to have the alertness which he exhibited in his earlier years. The honourable member is well aware of what I , perhaps more than anybody else in Australia, did to depose him from the leadership of the Australian Labour party in Few South Wales. So, these bitter speeches from the honourable gentleman are not unexpected. If honourable members opposite join him in calling for a division I shall be most happy. On this occasion, however, although he is their de facto leader they will not follow him.

In this bill he is relying on the war-time powers to uphold what may be done to certain individuals.

I put it to the Minister quite seriously that he would lose none of the effect of this legislation, and that he would get rid of the possible effect of a misunderstanding, if he omitted the word "" removal"" from the title, merely describing the measure as the War-time Refugees Act. Such an omission could not weaken the substantive provisions of the legislation. They would still give discretionary authority to the Minister to order certain people to leave Australia, if he thought fit. Having regard to the form of the legislation it may not be necessary for the honourable gentleman to order some of them to leave Australia at all.

The measure excludes nonaliens, whether or not they are undesirable, at the discretion of the Minister. If they are undesirable the Minister can deport them under the provisions of the Aliens Deportation Act 1948. However, if the Minister must deport war-time refugees, let him use section 5 of that legislation instead of the clause we are now considering, which gives the Minister absolute power. Accordingly, I moveThnt the clause be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the following clause:""5 (1.) If it appears to the Minister that the conduct and character of a person to whom this act applies is such that that person should not be allowed to remain in Australia, the Minister may, by notice in writing, summon the person to appear before a Commission, at the time and place specified in the summons. (2.) A Commissioner for the purposes of this section shall be appointed by the Governor General and shall be or shall have been a Judge of the Supreme Court of a State or of a Territory which forms part of tha Commonwealth. (3.) The Commissioner shall make a thorough investigation of the conduct and character of the person without regard to legal forms and shall not be bound by any rules of evidence, but may inform himself on any relevant matter in such manner as he thinks fit. (4.) After the investigation the Commissioner shall report to the Minister as to whether the Commissioner considers that the person is a fit and proper person to be allowed to remain in Australia. <5.) If (a) the Commissioner reports that he considers that the person is not a fit and proper person to be allowed appear to the Minister to be unworthy to remain in Australia; or (b) the person fails to appear before the Commissioner at the time and place specified in the summons, the Minister may make an order for deportation of the person from Australia and the person shall be deported accordingly."". The suggested substitute clause contains a discretionary power and something more: it gives protection also. TJnder the Aliens Deportation Act 1948 a certain protection is provided for the alien or person to be deported. In this bill thsro is no such provision. Because they are war-time refugees there is to be no proteccumstances ? tion. Why not? By this clause I think that the Minister is breaking a promise Although we shall be as compassionate that he gave to the honourable member as we have always been, those who have Mrs. Blackburn. for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley) when the former bill was before this chamber. No provision is here made for the alien or undesirable person to obtain assistance of counsel, or any other form of guidance. TJnder the clause the Minister has the power in his own hands. That is contrary to all ideas of justice, and is extremely dangerous. I oppose such a provision. In its present form this measure is not worthy in law, for it is not based on justice. Furthermore, it is not even common sense, because it is not sensible to offend inoffensive people. for Information and .Minister for Immigration) [5.57] -The clause that the honourable member for Bourke( Mrs. Blackburn) seeks to amend gives the Minister power to order the deportation of any person to whom this measure applies.

They have abused our generosity and hospitality, and just do not want to go. If we apply to them the ordinary processes of law, with the right of appeal, they will be here for another twelve months, and it will then be even more difficult to remove them. The honourable member proposes that these people shall be allowed to remain, except those that to remain hecause of their conduct or character. The honourable member further suggests that such persons amongst these people whom the Minister regards as undesirable, because of their conduct or character, should have their cases adjudicated upon by a commissioner. The purpose of this bill is to get rid of all of them, not only some of them. The honourable member seeks to allow all of them to remain.",40,Calwell

Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m. the Opposition) [8.0] -Before the sitting was suspended the honourable member for Bourke( Mrs. Blackburn) had moved an amendment to clause 5, which is now being considered, that was in line with an existing piece of legislation dealing with aliens. The effect of the amendment would be that if it appeared to the Minister that the conduct and character of a person to whom this legislation applied was such that that person should not be allowed to remain in Australia, certain steps may be taken, including an investigation by a commissioner who mu9t be a judge of the Supreme Court of a State or of a territory forming part of the Commonwealth. The amendment, if accepted, would confine the power to deport to two classes of cases, first, the class of case in which the person concerned has, by conduct, disqualified himself or herself from remaining here; and secondly, the class of case in which the person concerned has, by character, so disqualified himself or herself. I am not able to agree that those two matters are the only matters that .ought properly to be considered. I should have been content to vote against the amendment and for the clause as it stands if i i had not been for the very remarkable statement that was make by the Minister for Immigration ( Mr Calwell) before the suspension of the sitting. In order to justify my claim that the statement was a remarkable one, I shall remind the committee of the terms of this clause. The clause provides as follows:The Minister may make an order for the deportation of a person to whom this Act Without applies and that person shall be deported in accordance with this Act. I emphasize the word ""may"". Clause be the 4 specifies the categories of persons to which the legislation shall apply. They include every person who entered Australia during the period of hostilities and is an alien, and every person who, during the period of hostilities, entered Australia as a place of refuge, and who may not be an alien at all. Those are the persons described in the title of the bill as "" wartime refugees"". The clause we are now considering provides that the Minister may make an order for the deportation of a person to whom the legislation applies. The word "" may "" normally imports a discretion. There is nothing in the clause to suggest that in this instance it has any other meaning. In point of fact, the clause makes a sharp distinction between "" m a y "" and "" shall "" by providing that the Minister may make an order and that the person shall be deported. It is evident that "" m a y "" is intended to mean may and, therefore, that the clause is intended to confer on the Minister a power only. It is a power which, in his discretion, he may or may not decide to exercise. Before the sitting was suspended the Minister said, in substance, "" I do not",41,Calwell

The Minister has said that tbey will either go quietly of their own accord or by compulsion, but they will all be gone by August. In other words, the honourable gentleman has told the committee that he is going to treat the clause as if it meant that the Minister shall make an order for the deportation of any person to whom the bill applies. This is a convenient place and a convenient occasion to bring the Opposition's' view on this bill to a point. As I have said time after time, we have not, and we shall not, challenge the principle of the legislation as such. It represents a common, view in this country. But we have said that the Minister has a discretion and that be ought to exercise that discretion from time to time with good sense and fairness, and without being afraid to exercise it. Therefore, when the amendment that has been moved by the honourable member for Bourke has been dealt with, I sball move an amendment designed to bring into focus the whole point of issue on this legislation. I shall move that before the word "" may "" in clause 5 there shall be inserted the words, "" after consideration of .the facts of the. particular case "". If that amendment is accepted, the clause will readThe Minister, after consideration of the facts I asked the question to find out what could of tiie particular case, may make an order for thc deportation of a person to whom the Act applies. I that that is what the clause means now, but the Minister proposes to treat it as involving no discretion at all. He has said , in effect, "" I am not going to look at 1 the facts of any particular case. They will go quietly or not, but all of them will be out before the end of August."" able gentleman claim that the words will make a difference? what I should have thought was already clear, that is, that this is a discretionary power. ""We have not yet reached the stage in Australia where we have to toss people out of the country by act of Parliament. The amendment that I have foreshadowed, if accepted, will ensure proper consideration by the Minister of whether at any given moment he ought or ought not to make an order of deportation under the power that is to be conferred upon him by this bill. I cannot move that amendment now because there is another one before the Chair. While I do not think that the amendment which is now under discussion is without merit, I think it puts the whole matter on far too narrow a basis and, therefore, I am unable to support it. Mrs. BLACKBURN (Bourke) [8.71. Under this clause, to which I am opposed, it seems that the Minister orders and the person goes. It is as easy, as that. I for one cannot be party to the introduction of such a despotic law into this country. When I was speaking on the second reading of this bill I asked the Minister for Immigration ( Mr Calwell) a pointed question. I askedMayI assume that the Minister is not actuated by any racial prejudice in introducing this bill. The Minister answeredThat is right. I had a reason for asking the question. The honourable gentleman had said previously that he regarded the term "" White Australia "" as offensive to non-Europeans and that he considered it to be an inaccurate description of our immigration policy. be the reason for the introduction of this hill. The Minister said that it was not make no secret of any belief colour prejudice. I then enumerated a number of other factors that might afford reasons for the introduction of the bill, but I could not fit the measure in with any of them. I was forced to conclude that the Minister had introduced the measure in a fit of pique. I should be loath to accept that as a good reason. However, I am again wondering whether colour prejudice is not really behind the measure, and whether the Minister is not simply inconsistent. What he said last week does not hold good this week. This measure affects the position of persons who came to Australia during the",42,Calwell

223,Mr Menzies,"Let us make clearrecent war. They came here to seek sanctuary or they were brought here because they could not go to any other country. TJnder what is known as British justice they should have the right of asylum, particularly if they are not a danger to the country and if their character and conduct are not in question. Why deny to them what is sound and just? They were torn from their own country during the recent war in which, probably, they had no interest. Now they are to be dumped back in those countries unwanted by Australia and, probably, unwanted in the countries from which they have come, where conditions for them have changed considerably. The Minister will not accept my amendment, but I have presented it in the words which he himself used only a few months ago. It promises counsel for those who might need counsel. Under this measure these persons can be thrown out of Australia without any further warning. When the Minister administered the law as he found it, no doubt to the best of his ability and understanding, I refused to criticize his actions even though I was asked to do so publicly on a number of occasions. However, when he makes a law to suit his own purpose, after having found that a mistake had been made and a weakness revealed in the law, I must strongly state my objection. I oppose the clause and, because of it, I oppose the bill. for Information and Minister for Immigration) [8.12] I wish to re-state the position which I thought I had made clear. The purpose of this bill is to remove from Australia all war-time refugees, to the number of 800, who have refused to go voluntarily. The power which the Minister needs arises from the fact that the judgment of the High Court in the case which involved Mrs. Annie O'Keefe places in jeopardy to some degree the powers which the Minister can exercise under the Immigration Act. The only way by which these people could be told now to go would be to give them a dictation test and issue new certificates of exemption, but if they have been here five years or more it is doubtful whether the court, in view of its recent judgment, would not hold that they had acquired [65] some right of citizenship. It was never intended by the framers of the Constitution that the Immigration Act which in this respect has remained unaltered for 49 years would permit any such people to acquire permanent residence. The act was intended, as the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) has said, to exclude all Asiatic people; but it did not go as far as the Labour party at that period wanted it to go. There are 800 war-time refugees in Australia. They have refused to leave the country. It is necessary to pass special legislation to effeet their repatriation, compulsorily if necessary. That is all that the bill sets out to do. The amendment proposed by the honourable member for Bourke( Mrs. Blackburn) would, as I said previously, allow all the people who we say should go to remain, except those who, because of their character or their conduct, are held to be undesirable and then only after a commissioner, appointed to adjudicate on the subject, had found them to be undesirable and unworthy of citizenship. The honourable member for Bourke has referred to the use of the term White Australia. I said in my second-reading speech that I did not like it. But the platforms of each of the three parties represented in this House, from which I quoted to-day, use the term White Australia. The expression is also used in party literature to describe succinctly the policy known as restrictive immigration. The honourable member for Bourke said that I have acted despotically when I have ordered the removal of these people. In doing what I have done I am at least in line with American policy with regard to deportations, and one never hears criticism in the press of the United States of the action of .the United States Government in removing people who have broken its immigration laws. Mrs. BLACKBURN -But what is wrong with British policy? diverted from drawing attention to American immigration law because the United States of America, like Australia, has restricted immigration laws whereas Great Britain has not. Our own immigration law has not been",43,Calwell
224,Mr Calwell (Melbourne,Minister,44,Calwell
225,Mr Calwell,"I shall not bepopular with British political parties, and least of all with the British Labour party. It creates difficulties for them, but they are far removed from the scene of these happenings. I again draw attention to the figures which I cited during the second-reading debate. During 1946-47, the last year in respect of which figures are available, the United States deported 33,038 persons which represented approximately one deportee to every 4,200 of the population. During the same period Australia deported 143 persons, or approximately one deportee to 48,000 of our population. The Tjnited States Government deports its unwelcome guests to Asiatic and European countries alike. So far as I tion of its deportation law is very rarely the subject of comment in tbe American press. However, great play is made in the Australian press on these few cases. AlthoughI expect to remain Minister for Immigration for a long time yet, I shall eventually be succeeded by somebody-n o doubt by a Labour man. However, I refuse to allow to stay here the twenty-odd persons to whom the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr prets it the Minister shall-no t "" may "" Menzies) referred, because should the Opposition parties ever again form the government of this country, which the Lord forbid, I would thereby have created very undesirable precedents which would make it very difficult for them to administer .the law. I desire to preserve now and in the future the ideals underlying our restrictive immigration law. Out of consideration for them in the dim and distant future, as well as having in mind my own difficulties at present, I say that people who come here under certain conditions should be obi ged to fulfil those conditions, and if they will not do so they must be told that they cannot stay here any longer. The Leader of the Opposition has told the committee that he proposes to move an amendment to add certain words which he thinks will emphasize the discretionary nature of the clause as drafted. We shall debate that particular proposition after we have dealt with the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Bourke, which cuts Mr Calwell. right across the hill. In effect, it says, "" Let them all stay except the undesirables; and let a commissioner adjudicate on who is to foe considered undesirable, but don't let the Minister do that. And when the commissioner decides, compel the few who come within his condemnation to go, but not otherwise"". I now trust that the committee will clearly recognize the difference between the opinion expressed by the honourable member for Bourke and that expressed in the clause and the bill as a whole. I should have refrained from addressing myself to this bill had it not been for tha can ascertain America's applicaremarks made by the Minister for Immigration ( Mr Calwell) in the last five minutes, compared with those which he made on the same matter before the suspension of the sitting. I do not know precisely what the Minister intended to convey to the committee. As I understand it, his proposition is that this bill presents to the Opposition the choice of voting or not voting for a provision that is clear, namely, that under this clause as he inter-depor t all aliens to whom the act applies. There are two points that arise in regard to that. I cannot support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Bourke( Mrs. Blackburn), although I support some of the views that she has expressed, since I do not believe that the deportation of an individual who is an alien within the meaning of the act should depend upon character or conduct. That is not the purpose of the law, and it is not the purpose of the Opposition to support any such proposition. But it is thc purpose of the Opposition to make it plain that, whilst we support the general principles of this bill, as we did during the second reading stage, we are opposed to the Minister interpreting the passage of tbe bill by this chamber as a direction to him to deport all aliens irrespective of the circumstances that may affect individual cases. Before the suspension of the sitting I received two replies to an interjection that I had made, in which I had asked the Minister two things. First, the Minister said that he did not know whether there were any white people who would",44,Calwell
226,Mr Spend Eh (Warringah) [8.20],"be covered by the measure; and, secondly, that in any event all wartime refugees would be out of tiie -country by the end of August. That is to say, all aliens are to be deported within a matter of eight weeks. Some of tbe people to be deported may be suffering from serious illness. Are we to understand that, under the interpretation that will be given by the Minister to the passage of the bill by this Pari anient, it will policy must be maintained. But we have be interpreted that we are giving to this Minister, whose blundering administration has done more to destroy the White Australia policy than anything else, the power to deport all these people irrespective of circumstances? we to understand that we are to give, by passing the bill containing this eiause, an absolute warrant to this Minister to bundle these people out of the country inside eight weeks, no matter what their individual circumstances may be? It may be that we shall have to deal with people who are desperately ill , or with young children who are not in a condition to be transferred to some other country. The Minister is apparently seeking to make this an issue in which, if we vote for the bill, we shall authorize him to remove immediately every one of these people from the country. I cannot imagine that any chamber in any democratic country would be prepared to give that authority to any Minister, least of all to the present Minister for Immigration. eiause. been endeavouring to engage in that kind of nonsense for the last three hours. He has endeavoured to create an issue where, in reality, no issue exists. The point that the Opposition has made time and time again is that it takes the view taken by our predecessors who were responsible for the White Australia policy, which the right honourable member for North Svdney( Mr Hughes) has made abundantly clear, but does not believe that the White Australia policy is supported by a completely arbitrary and inflexible approach to every case no matter what very special circumstances may exist in a particular case. The attitude of the Government seems to be that if a person is Asiatic he may not remain here for any length of time. It does not matter what his particular circumstances may be, he must be deported. What we on this side of the House have said in plain terms, which are not capable of any misinterpretation except by a Minister who is determined to misinterpret them in his own way for the purpose of mere political advantage, is that the White Australia also said that in some instances there may be circumstances in which there is no justification for bundling people out now. We have never suggested for a moment that an Asiatic has any right, Are or should be enabled, to become an Australian citizen or to remain here permanently. We have said that in each case the question whether certain individuals should be deported now or be given some time before they must leave sliould be determined on its merits. For three or four years past, as. the Minister's own speech revealed, he himself has given extensions of time to various people. Why did he do so? Because the circumstances justified the granting of extensions of time! But apparently if we pass this bill without objection, the Minister will take it that we have empowered him to throw all the wartime refugees out of the country in eight weeks, no matter what special circumstances may apply to individual cases. If that is what the Labour party believes in, let it say so. I should have thought that the clause that we are discussing meant what the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) said it meant, but apparently that is not so, judging by the interpretation placed by the Minister on it. The clause readsThe Minister may make an order for the deportation of a person to whom this Act applies, and that peison shall be deported in accordance with this Act. I should have thought that the word "" may "" quite clearly confers a power of discretion on the Minister. If it was intended that no discretion was to apply, then the wording of the clause would have beenThe Minister shall make an order for the deportation of a person to whom this Act applies, and that person shall be deported in accordance with this Act.",45,Calwell

228,Mr Spender,"The Minister hasI think that we should have that matter cleared up by the Minister, who, all the afternoon, has been fighting himself, shadow sparring, and engaging in scurrilous attacks on various honourable members, which is not unusual for the Minister. The Minister has attempted to make it appear that for him to make any concession in any case that comes before him would be to break down the White Australia policy. Nothing could be further from the truth. The truth is that the White Australia policy ean only be maintained by the Strength of our own hand and by the help of the friends that we have around us. If we have the kind of administration that this Minister has characterized by his application of ruleof-thumb methods, we shall only create ill will against ourselves that cannot advance the cause that all parties, I believe, stand for. This clause must be read in relation to the preceding clause, which gives to the Minister the power to certify that a person is a person to whom the act applies, and that that ia "" prima facie evidence of the fact so certified"". If the Minister certified a man as an alien to whom the act applies he can issue an order to deport him without further ado. It is important to realize that there is no time limit on deportations. As I understand it, the bill provides that a man may be held without trial or without having any recourse to law for an indefinite period. That is the power that we are giving to the Minister. I know that my objection will be deliberately misinterpreted and that I shall be branded as one who has criticized the White Australia policy, but I shall take that risk. I desire to go on record as saying that if this clause means what the Minister says it means, and that he must deport all these people immediately, 1 am not prepared to give him, or any other Minister of any political persuasion, that power. member vote against the clause? been engaging in this stupid manoeuvre all the afternoon. The words in the clause the people to whom the bill shall apply. I i mean what they say, and there will be an opportunity of voting on it later on, as the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) has foreshadowed another amendment. But this stupid trickery that the Minister has been engaging in for the purpose of trying to create false issues and covering up his own blundering administration, will not get him very far. There is a second matter, about which nothing has been said by the Minister. I asked before the suspension of the sitting whether any white people were covered by this legislation. I think that that is an important matter, because if there are any white people covered by it we cannot let the matter be clouded by the term White Australia policy. Clause 4, which is the key to clause 5, providesThis Act shall apply to every person(a) who entered Australia during the period of hostilities and is an alien which covers persons of any colour, whether they be white, brown or brindle(b) who, during the period of hostilities, entered Australia as a place of refuge, by reason of the occupation, or threatened occupation, of any place by an enemy, and has not left Australia since he so entered or (c) who, during the period of hostilities, entered Australia by reason of any other circumstances attributable to the existence of hostilities and has not left Australia since he BO entered, Will the Minister give a plain answer to this question whether there are any white people to whom that clause can apply. If there are, I shall seek to have amendments made in other clauses of the bill to protect such white people. ber is dealing with clause 5. sibly the honourable member had forgotten it as he is dealing with clause 4. of following the provisions of the measure without the assistance of the honourable member for Watson( Mr Falstein).

I am not in favour of any white alien being forced to go from this country on the say-so of tbe Minister. I refrain from saying anything further at the moment about white aliens because I want the Minister first to assure the committee that the provisions of the bill in its present form will not apply to any white alien. I shall support the amendment foreshadowed by the Leader of the Opposition. in sub-clause 2 does not mean what I think it should mean, its meaning will be made clear by the amendment which will be submitted by the Leader of the Opposition. -It, seems to me that the clause under discussion has aroused a lot of rather ill Minister desired to deport any particular timed suspicion in the minds of honourable members opposite. Clause4 is the vital part of the measure. The bill is intended to deal with people who came to Australia during the time of hostilities and were not dealt with by the immigration authorities as they would have been in ordinary circumstances. I think that that is clear from the measure itself and from our knowledge of the circumstances associated with its introduction. The honourable member for ""Warringah ( Mr we are considering and also the preceding Spender) referred to the definitions in clause 3, although he should have done so when that clause was before the committee. He wanted to know whether clause 4 would apply to any white person who was not an alien within the terms of the Immigration Act. Some of the people who were landed in Australia during the war are more undesirable than many of those who are expressly prohibited, because they are Asiatics, from remaining in this country. Because persons are Asiatics their characters are not necessarily objectionable. The reasons for the restriction of Asiatics have been explained, and honourable members opposite know as well as I do that some white people who are not very desirable entered this country during the war years. The clause now before the committee simply confers power on the Minister to deport such people. I regret very much the interjection made by the Minister for Immigration ( Mr Calwell), that all the people who will he affected by this measure will have to go from Australia by August, because I believe that he has no intention of arbitrarily removing all the individuals concerned by that time. I know him well enough to realize that if the summary deportation of any individual would involve hardship or inhumanity, he will not deport that individual peremptorily. I agree with members of the Opposition If the word "" may"" that in all cases the Minister should exercise discretion. We cannot discuss the amendment foreshadowed by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) at the moment because a prior amendment is already before the chair. From the language of the clause it is clear that the Minister enjoys complete discretionary power. If the individual, he could quickly satisfy himself before making the order by having only perfunctory inquiries made. However, I believe that the clause is necessary. As honourable members are aware, the real reason for the introduction of the measure was a recent decision of the High Court, and it cannot be doubted that but for the limitations imposed, upon the Minister's powers by that decision this legislation would not have been introduced. We must realize that the clause one go together and are necessary to enable the measure to 'be implemented. If we believe that the Minister should have power to deport persons who entered this country during the war years, but who would not have been entitled to do so in ordinary times, we should not cavil at the inclusion of this provision I support the clause because I believe that it is merely intended to confer on the Minister the right to exercise a power which we all formerly believed that he could exercise. Many instances have been quoted by honourable members of that power having been exercised by members of various administrations who have fidministered the Immigration Aet. On occasion, they had, in accordance with their oath of office, to exercise their power of deportation without compunction. I",47,Calwell
235,Mr Thompson (Hindmarsh) [8.33].,"believe that it may also he necessary for the present Minister to do so in certain circumstances. Despite all the criticism launched at the present Minister by members of the Opposition and by the press, the Immigration Act has never been Administered by a more humane individual. All honourable members must agree with me that whenever they have had occasion to approach the Minister with a case of genuine hardship he has always considered their representations most sympathetically. Despite his unfortunate interjection that all aliens will be deported ejected from this country by the end of by August, I believe that he will deal with them just as humanely as he has dealt with previous cases. I remind honourable members that we appear to be pre-occupying ourselves with the fate of approximately 800 persons who are likely to be affected by the passage was agreed to almost unanimously by of this bill to the exclusion of the thousands of war-time refugees who left Australia of their own accord after the war. undoubtedly bave become most desirable Australian citizens, but they realized that they had been given only temporary sanctuary in a time of distress, and they were prepared to discharge their obligation to leave this country voluntarily when the emergency had expired. However, others have refused to do so, and many of them have had their permits extended from time to time. There seems to be little doubt that many of them intended to remain here permanently by making application for an infinite number of extensions of time. Indeed, had the war not lasted so long as it did those people may not have remained in this country for the statutory period of five years, and there would have been no need for the Parliament to pass the legislation that is now before us. If we believe that the act is right and just, and that the refugees who have already departed from Australia have honoured the undertaking that they gave on their arrival here, it behoves us to say to the remaining refugees, "" If you are not prepared to honour your obligations, we must compel you, by legislative enactment, to do so "". With much figurative wringing of hands and rending of clothes, the honorthat it is; hut, at the same time, tbe able member for Warringah ( Mr Spender) has treated the chamber to a sob story, the like of which we have not heard since the Yoizuki incident. The honourable member has told us that the Minister will interpret this provision in a mandatory manner, that he will disregard the claims of sick persons, and women and children who may be entitled to compassionate consideration, and that he will rigidly adhere to a schedule which will ensure that 800 persons, who were given asylum during the war, will be August. The amendment which has been submitted by the honourable member for Bourke( Mrs. Blackburn) would, if adopted, emasculate the purposes of thi> bill. The Minister has made it plain from the outset that ihis legislation is complementary to the Immigration Bill, which the House this afternoon. The only dissentient voice was that of the honourable member for Eeid( Mr Lang). The object Many of the latter class would of this bill is to give to the Government an additional legislative ground for taking action, of which the House has already approved, by agreeing to the Immigration Bill. The Opposition has deliberately evaded the fact that the application of the War-time Refugees Eemoval Bill is limited to 800 persons who have refused to honour the obligations which they entered into when they came to this country during the war. The bill is not intended to settle immigration policy, either in respect of temporary or permanent admissions to the Commonwealth. It has a limitedpurpose, and that is to remove the.=e persons who have declined to fulfil obligations which they are hound to discharge. It is of no use for the honourable'member for Warringah or any other honourable member of the Opposition to say that the Minister should exercise further discretion, or that the clause under consideration gives room for the exercise of further discretion. The Minister has chosen to treat this provision as mandatory, and. therefore, he intends to implement it by removing the 800 persons concerned. ber consider that the clause is mandatory!",48,Calwell

If the Minister considers that there are certain circumstances, such as those to which the honourable member for Warringah has alluded', to warrant his exercising a further discretion, he will doubtless exercise that discretion. In my opinion, that further discretion has been exercised over and over again in the vast majority of the cases to which I have referred, until it has been absolutely strained to finality. When discretion is aot exercised in favour of the view of the honourable member for Warringah, he chooses to say that the Minister has excluded from his mind the possbility of exercising discretion. However, it is plain that discretion has been exercised in favour of those persons who have had the benefit of asylum in Australia. It is of no use for the Opposition to cavil at this particular provision. The purposes of the bill are clear, and it is also abundantly plain that the Government intends to implement this legislation at an early date. for Information and Minister for Immigration) [8.45] -The honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender) has treated the committee to some police court histrionics and cheap legal melodrama. He has asked, in effect, "" Will you attempt to deport a sick person? Are you going into the bedroom to grab the unfortunate individual and put him on board a boat? If the clause under consideration contains that power, I shall oppose it. Indeed, I shall certainly do so because the Minister said earlier that the whole lot of them would be out of the eountry before the end of August"". I did say that the whole lot of them would he out of the country before the end of August; but obviously, if a person is very sick or happens to be an inmate of a mental institution or some other institution, he would not be regarded in the general category of persons to be removed. WhatI meant, and what every body would interpret my words to mean, was that every healthy person who was deliberately attempting to frustrate the operation of the law would be required Warringah has spoken of my so-called blundering administration. It is honest and frank administration, and is in complete accord with precedent. The honourable member and certain of his friends, backed by the press, have used the words "" blundering "" and "" crass stupidity "" as a part of their smear campaign. Outside the Parliament, they make all sorts of violent speeches one to talk about a smear campaign. He is the greatest smear expert that I have ever met. compared with the honourable member for Warringah. contemptible thing before the dinner adjournment. ber is one of those who ascribe to other people sins of which they themselves are guilty. pathological case.

They are only humbugs and hypocrites, and they stand exposed as such. They were not prepared to speak in the second-reading debate on this bill. The honourable member for Warringah comes here in his unctuous Uriah Heep style, once a week at the outside, and talks of my blundering administration. I have much more justification for talking about his craven attitude on this matter. Let him divide the committee on this issue if he will. I doubt even now whether he can muster sufficient",49,Calwell

The description of a "" larrikin lawyer "" is not confined to one person. I refugees generally will be required to go. They have got to go. If there are any sick persons among them, humanity will be shown to them, as it always has been shown. I have got into trouble over these people because I have shown them humanity for four years. If I had administered the law vigorously and pushed those persons off on all sorts of cattle boats or under all sorts of troopship conditions at the end of the war, there would not have been any trouble at all. There would not have been a word of criticism had this matter not been played up by the press and by the honourable member for Warringah, who always plays to the gallery. He posed to-night as a paragon of all the political virtues and as a defender of liberty. Minister referring? that the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr obtained an extradition order against him Menzies) is trying to protect his brood like an old hen which fears that one of her chicks may fall into the water and be drowned. He does not want any more discussion on this clause. The speech by the honourable member for Warringah tonight was as intellectually stimulating and just about as convincing as was his explanation for retaining his membership of the Advisory War Council some years ago. He is following his own line as he always does. If he wants a division on this clause let him call for it. If he does not let him keep quiet. The Minister for Immigration ( Mr tage of it. The Australian Government Calwell) has, at times, rendered great service to Australia in his administration of the Department of Immigration, but he is in grave danger of cancelling out at least portion of the credit that is due to him for that service by harsh, and and apparently inhumane action in one or two individual cases. He has said that this bill, and therefore this clause, would not have been necessary had it not been for the judgment of the High Court of Australia in the O'Keefe case. That is quite true. I take no exception to the clause as it stands, or to the granting of power to a Commonwealth Minister to deport certain persons; but I do say, and have said that the war-time. I believe that here the majority of the people of Australia, keen as they are on the maintenance of the White Australia policy, will agree, that justice should be tempered with charity. This bill is aimed substantially at Mrs. O'Keefe and one or two others; it is in respect of these individuals that the Minister's power will be exercised. Mrs. O'Keefe went to the High Court and won her right to remain in Australia. That should have been sufficient for the Minister, but apparently he is determined to show the High Court and every one else who has opposed him on this issue, particularly the newspapers, that he is the Minister for Immigration and that he intends to carry out his original intentions. The law is being amended to vindicate the Minister's point of view. I am reminded of what happened in Great Britain when Gerhardt Eisler, a communist leader, arrived there as a fugitive from the United States of America. The United States of America but he appealed to a Bow-street magistrate, who held that, as Eisler had not committed any offence against the laws of Great Britain, he could remain free in spite of the fact that he was wanted by the authorities in a country which was most friendly to the United Kingdom. Subsequently Eisler escaped to the Continent. Although the decision had been given by only a magistrate, it was upheld. No special session of the British Parliament was summoned to pass overnight a law to permit the arrest of Eisler. The British Parliament stood by the existing law, and permitted Eisler to take advanshould stand by the decision of the High Court in the Q'Keefe case. The Minister, however, has decided that he will administer the law rigidly and without the exercise of discretion. He believes that it is mandatory upon him to deport every one of the individuals concerned. But do the Minister and his colleagues administer other laws in the same way? If they did, many people would be found",50,Calwell
248,Mr Menzies,To which clause is the,51,Calwell
249,Mr Calwell,Claus e 5. I realize,51,Calwell
250,Mr Anthony (Richmond) [8.52],"guilty of offences against our arbitration laws and even the Crimes Act. We all recognize that our laws are not made to be administered in a cast-iron fashion as tbe Minister proposes to administer the Immigration Act. He has said that within two months of the passage of this measure by the Parliament, every one of the individuals concerned will be outside Australia. By that declaration he has disclosed his hand. He has done more damage to the White Australia policy by this pretence of upholding it than he could ever have done had he been an opponent of that policy. The White Australia policy cannot 7,000,000 people alone. It must have the backing of some world opinion, and particularly the opinion of white races. During World War II . , the then Australian Prime Minister, Mr Curtin, appealed for American assistance to this country. He appealed not to the President or to the American Congress, but to the American people, and amongst the troops who came from the United States of America to defend White Australia were several negro divisions. It is to America that we should have to turn again if we were assailed in the future. The population of the United States of America is not entirely white. There are people of many colours, including a large number of negroes. I am not suggesting for a moment that the power sought under this clause is not necessary. The clause readsThe Minister may make an order for the their lives might be forfeited within a deportation of a person to whom this Act short time of their arrival there. applies and that person shall be deported in accordance with the Act. Honourable members will observe that the word "" m a y "" is used. It is not mandatory for the Minister to make such an order. The White Australia policy and the Immigration Act have been administered by Ministers of all political parties, all of whom have had to face problems, if not parallel to this, be a vote against the White Australia at least of a similar humanitarian character. I recall placing before one Minister for ImmigrationI think that he was a Minister of the Liberal party -the case of a missionary and his wife who had gone to F i j i and there had adopted a Fijian baby. Eventually they brought the child back to Australia and she was allowed to remain in this country under permit. She went to an Australian school and was brought up as a member of the missionary's family. However, the immigration authorities finally rooted the case out, and said that the girl, then seventeen or eighteen years of age, would have to be returned to the islands because she was a Polynesian. But the Minister did not send her away in spite of the advice of his departmental officers. He allowed the child to remain in this country. I have no doubt that the be maintained by present Minister for Immigration himself has exercised his discretion at times in a similar way. I hope that when this measure has been passed-it will be passed because the Government has a majority in both Houses of the Parliament-the Minister will not be harsh and unreasoning, particularly to the O'Keefe family. I do not know any of them, nor do I know anything about them except what I have read in the newspapers, but I know that they had the: courage to take their case to the highest tribunal in the land, and were upheld by it. This measure seems to be an attempt by the Government to assert its autliority over a decision of the High Court. I hope that these people will not be made victims of this clause. I am of the opinion that if the O'Keefes, and a handf u l of people like them, who .were the friends of the Dutch, are sent back to Indonesia after seven years to what will be a completely foreign environment, with the Dutch taking them back to Holland? wrong with allowing them to remain in Australia? I am not going to join issue with the Minister over the question whether a vote against this clause would policy. No one on this side of the committee advocates any alteration of that policy, and during the last fifteen year9 there has certainly been very little evidence that it is being broken down. In 1933, there",51,Calwell
251,Mr Calwell,What would be wrong,52,Calwell
252,Mr Anthony,"What would bewere 22,000 Asiatics in Australia, and in 1947 there were only 21,000, including the 800 refugees now under, consideration. The White Australia policy is not heing endangered by the presence of such a small number of Asiatics. I trust that the Minister will exercise with mercy and discretion the power with which this measure will invest him. I must detain the committee again because I have not yet received a reply from the Minister for Immigration ( Mr He said that I had used the word Calwell) to tlie question I asked. In the couree of his attack upon me, he overlooked the fact that the committee is discussing a bill. I asked him in plain enough terms whether the bill would apply to any white persons, but he did not reply. It is about time we had a reply to that question. I should think there are white people in Australia to whom it might apply, and I mention Dutch people, in particular, who came down here from Batavia. There may be others. I recollect that many British children were brought to Australia early in the war. The Minister should be able to say unequivocally whether there are or are not in Australia white people to whom the bill applies. If there are, I for one am not prepared to give this power to the Minister. I also draw attention to the way in which the Minister, in order to serve his own political purposes, has twisted what was said by members of the Opposition. He said that I had agreed with the statethe Commonwealth against individuals. ment of another honourable member that Australians were entitled to marry E ersons whether they weve black, white or rindle, and to bring them into Australia. Of course, I did nothing of the kind, as the records will show, and as the Minister himself knows perfectly well. ber agreed with the statement. I said, because I expect that the Minister will deliberately repeat his misconstruction of it on many future occasions. I said, when asked by the Minister, whether I agreed with the statement that an Australian was entitled to marry any person, black, white or brindle, that I did agree. 1 suppose the Minister wants power to tell us whom we may marry. to unionists. the right of an Australian overseas or at home to marry any one he likes whatever that person's colour, but my agreement with such a statement has nothing to do with the breaking down of the White Aus1 tralia policy. However, the Minister deliberately twisted my agreement with the statement in order to serve his own ends. "" blundering "" in referring to hi3 administration. I did use that word, and I used it advisedly. Indeed, I thought I was being kind to the Minister. I could haw said that he was despotic. I could have said that he had a pathological desire for publicity and power, and that he had frequently exercised his power without clemency. All those statements would have been true. The Minister has exercised despotic power against individuals. I can imagine nothing more pitiable than for a Minister, invested with all the powers of State, to use them against some poor individual whose case merits mercy. One hears strange statements about the philosophy of the Labour party. For instance, we heard the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Holloway) say that communism had its foundation in the teachings of Christ. I have heard of the brotherhood of man, but I have seen the Minister for Immigration exercise all the irreat powers of If he is given further power under this clause, I cannot imagine that he will not use it against an individual, whether he be rich or poor and whether his case deserves special consideration or not. There is one further case to which 1 wish to draw attention. Some alien refugees in Australia married Australians while here, and children, now of tender years, were born to them. The Minister knows of many such cases. What does he propose to do about them? Apparently, he proposes to bundle all of them out of the country. He says that when they reach the age of 21 years, they may return to Australia from the Celebes or from Sumatra, or from wherever they were",52,Calwell

257,Mr Spender,"No doubt. I assertsent, and claim their rights as Australians. Indeed, they are Australians now, and their right to citizenship could be established by any one who made the claim on their behalf. However, the Minister will have the fathers removed, and the mothers will go with them, taking the children who were born in Australia. That is the way a Labour governnient proposes to exercise power, and it is well to understand that once power is put in the hands of the Minister for Immigration, it will, on his own showing, be exercised ruthlessly and without mercy. for Information and Minister for Immigration) |9.S] -The honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender) is trying, with a great deal of bluster, to cover up his attempt to break down the White Australia policy. against it, but he has not the courage to vote against it. This bill was deliberately drafted to cover Europeans and non-Europeans, and it was drafted in that way so as not to give offence on racial grounds. There may be Europeans in Australia who will be affected by the bill, and there may not. I do not know. The honourable member wants me to say that 1 know, for certain, that there are no such Europeans in Australia. Then he will say that the bill was conceived in racial prejudice and born of a hatred of Asiatics, and that we propose to put it into effect because we despise Asiatics. I am not going to give him the opportunity to say any such malicious tiling. This bill has been designed to get rid of people who came here as war-time refugees. There may be no Europeans left. I do not think that there are. Any Dutch people who have come here since the war ended have entered the country on landing permits. Such permits are issued to Europeans but not to Asiatics. They are not issued to Asiatics even if they are British subjects, such as Chinase or halfcaste Chinese born in Hong Kong, Indians, Chinese or Malays born in Malaya, or Indians, Chinese or Fijians born in F i j i . always been the law. The fact of being a British subject confers no right upon any person to enter this country. The only person who has such a right is a person who is Australian-born or who, by domicile, has become an Australian. That dictum has been upheld by the High Court of Australia. A celebrated case was that of Mrs. Freer. The honourable member for Warringah will remember that case. well. that she could not land in Australia, and many people, including a number of members of the Labour party, attacked the government of the day for what it did. Had1 been a meinber of this Parliament at the time, I should have supported the Minister for the Interior for keeping Mrs. Freer out of Australia. I consider that it was scandalous that the Minister of the day was abandoned ultimately and that Mrs. Freer was allowed to enter Australia after she had been admitted to New Zealand and had then returned here. Her exclusion in the first place was a proper exercise of authority by the then Minister for the Interior, who was the representative at the time of the electorate of Gippsland. ber for Warringah, of course, plays up to the sensational press by declaring that it was a scandalous decision. There was nothing scandalous about it at all. It was a proper decision. I am afraid that scant justice has been done to the predecessor of the honourable member for Gippsland for taking his courage in his hands and doing the right thing on that occasion. decision. the Minister. with that now. in point to which I can refer in order to confound the honourable member for Tbat has Warringah. man does not need to say ""confound""",53,Calwell

I have been subjected to a lot of violently abusive criticism by the honourable member for Warringah tonight. He wants me to say that there are no Europeans in Australia who may be deported. There may not be; I do not know yet. We shall wait and see whether there are. Any person who is required to leave will be required to do so because he has outstayed his permissible period of residence here. No exceptions may be made. If I were to do as the honourable member for Eichmond( Mr Anthony) suggests and let the O'Keefe family stay, and as the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) suggests, and let twenty other families stay, I should have to let back into Australia all the Malays and Indonesians who married here and were sent out of Australia. How could I refuse to do otherwise? Their wives and children are still here in many instances. How could I then refuse to re-admit the people who did not marry and who left voluntarily but who liked this country and would be happy to return? One cannot discriminate against groups of cases. If we are going to operate the whole policy equitably, we must do what is proposed in the bill or let all .those people come back. The alternative would involve the re-admittance of 6,000 people. There has heen a lot of sob-stuff talked about this matter. As the honourable member for Watson( Mr Falstein) has said, it has been made a niinor Yoizvki case. The newspapers made Yoizuhi steam into synthetic cyclones, hoping that somebody would be drowned so that they could attack the Government for having sent women and children back to Formosa. It was regrettable that those people had to go, but that was the law. They cried because this country was the best country that they had ever known or ever will know, and because they had to return to bad conditions of living. But the law that forced them to go must be maintained if the homogeneity of the nation is to he upheld. Amendment negatived. the Opposition) [9.15] I have been listening to this discussion, as I suppose some other people have been listening too, with a great deal of amazement. Ancient history and more or less modern history have been both dragged into service. The longer the discussion proceeds, the more clear it becomes that the Minister for Immigration ( Mr Calwell), having brought in a bill which will give him a power to deport, is insisting that it imposes upon him a duty to deport. The Minister has a genius of a somewhat curious kind. I describe it, with great respect, as a genius for distortion. He has made up his mind, for example, that I have said on behalf of the Opposition that there are twenty families who must be allowed to remain in Australia. The simple truth, of course, is that I said on behalf of my colleagues of the Opposition that there might be twenty people who had come here as aliens during the war and had married or acquired family obligations here, and that, in respect of those people, the Minister ought to exercise a discretion according to the circumstances of each case. The honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender) asked the Minister whether any European persons were involved in that category. The Minister first of all said "" No "". Now he thinks that there may be, though he cannot say so positively. that he cannot be certain about that matter. I do not quarrel with him about that; However, I point out once more that the bill, in its terms, does not cover aliens only. It covers any person who came to Australia as a place of refuge during the war, or who, during the period of hostilities, entered the country by reason of any other circumstances attributable to the existence of hostilities. For example, the hill would cover the case of an Englishman who came to Australia during the war from Hong Kong, Shanghai or Singapore. The bill in its terms covers an unknown number of ordinary British citizens who are Englishmen, or, much better than that, Scotsmen. Any such persons who came here during the war and are still here come within its scope. I cannot believe for one moment that the Minister considers that, under clause 5, he is under a duty to bundle",54,Calwell

Should there be a real exercise of a real accusation. When I have a lot more to discretion? That is the whole point. Time learn about distortion, I shall go to the after time the Minster has been given feet of the right honourable gentleman, an opportunity to say "" Yes, I realize who is a past-master in the art of disthat there is a discretion and I am pretorting my statements and of distorting pared to exercise it "" , and time after time the intention of this legislation.

We on this side have a unanimous Cabinet and we know where we stand. That is why we have remained in office for so long and why we will continue to remain in office for another twenty years. The Leader of tbe Opposition has said that the Minister takes power to deport British citizens who sought refuge in Australia during the war which might include an Englishman or a Scotsman who came from Shanghai or Hong Kong. This bill has been drafted to cover all classes of people, orientals and occidentals alike, in exactly the same way as was the parent legislation. Under the parent legislation, an Englishman could be deported or refused admission to this country. Opposition has not made a point at all. He is guilty of the very nonsense of which he has accused me. said that the bill provides for that. I did not say that the Mimster wanted to deport any of these people, and therefore, it appears to be a discretionary power. The Minister begins now to understand, my argument. stand the right lionorable gentleman's argument and neither can the Australia people. It is because his arguments cannot be understood that he is where he is. This legislation cannot be faulted because it follows the pattern of all previous legislation. We have had to include Europeans or we would have been accused of racialism. The original act was framed to give the government of the day the right to apply the dictation test and not to discriminate against Asiatics as such. This legislation has been drafted to give the Minister discretionary power and it applies to all classes of people. What the Leader of the Opposition proposes does not add anything to the Minister's discretionary power nor does it make that power any clearer. The MENZIES'S amendment) be so inserted. right honourable gentleman's amendment simply provides that the Minister shall examine the facts of each particular case. The Minister is already doing that and he has been doing that for some time past. Those refugees who remain in Australia are people who are determined that they will not leave in any circumstances. They are not being offended against. On the contrary they are offending against us by remaining here longer than they sliould. I return the compliment of the Leader of the Opposition, and say that his amendment is utter nonsense. is a pity that the enslavement of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) to the use of words has prompted him to propose what is clearly a completely tautological amendment. The right honourable gentleman has said that this legislation may apply to some Englishman, Scotsman or Irishman, or other white person, who is caught up in the categories defined in clause 4. That argument is especially interesting because when clause 4 was before the committee, not one Opposition voice was raised to challenge the categories of persons who were to be included in the provisions of this legislation. That clause was passed by the committee without debate and we proceeded at once to the consideration of clause 5, which was the subject of the first amendment; it was moved by the honorahle member for Bourke( Mrs. Blackburn). That fact in itself is significant. It indicates to the conimittee that the argument upon which the amendment proposed by the Leader of thc Opposition is shallow -aud unconvincing. Indeed, it is so unreal as to give rise to the belief that after all what the Opposition is endeavouring to do is to probe every possible angle in the hope that in some way or another it may discover a weakness in the legislation which, so far, it has not heen able to find. In the light of the explanation which attended its submission this amendment is so unnecessary tliat it could be described as frivolous.

The officer would not have to go before the court in the ordinary way, but only before somebody charged under the particular State law with the power of prima facie inquiry as to whether the circumstances justify the issue of a warrant. That is normal police court procedure. Some safeguard, although not a complete one, would be provided by requiring an officer to obtain a warrant. As the honourable member for Eichmond( Mr Anthony) has pointed out, under the clause in its present form an officer may, without any preliminary inquiry and without going through any kind of judicial process, grab hold of any person who he thinks is a deportee. Some brake should be put upon that power. We are familiar with the growth of official and what we loosely call bureaucratic power. Honourable members on both sides of the chaniber must be becoming very uneasy at the degree to which officials are being authorized to do almost anything at all with respect to the citizen. Step by step we are getting closer to the police state. Let us see what may follow from the clause in this form. An oflicer-presumably that means an officer of the Department of Immigration-may, having first obtained a warrant, as police officers, who, although highly experienced men, are required to do, arrest a person whom he supposes to be a deportee. That means any person, including you, Mr did it in 1905, long before Hitler was Temporary Chairman, me, or anybody else. There is no appeal against that decision. It is entirely for the officer to say whether he thinks that the person he is arresting is a deportee. TJnder the clause, the person who is being arrested must not resist or prevent the arrest. It will he a pretty poor state of affairs in this country if somebody can come up to me, without a warrant or any authority of that kind, and say, "" I think you are a deportee, and I propose to haul you off to a police station or a lock-up"", and if I am not entitled to say, "" I am an ordinary citizen. You have no power over me. If you seek to take me by force, I shall punch you on the nose "". The healthy reaction of the average citizen is to demand to know from where an official derives his authority to do a certain act, but, under this clause an official can say, "" I do not care who you say you are. I think you are Mr Beale. a deportee. I am going to lock yon up. Come along with me."" I agree entirely that some brake should be applied to that power. I have already pointed out that it is provided that a person shall not resist or prevent his arrest under such circumstances, as any red-blooded Australian would wish to do if he were an innocent person. If he does resist, he is liable to a fine of £100 or imprisonment for six months. That is going too far. I do not believe that any official should be clothed with authority of that kind. for Information and Minister for Immigration) [9.44] -The honourable member for Parramatta ( Mr Beale) has discovered one of his famous mare's nests.

There has been a provision of this kind in the Immigration without Act since 1905, or for 44 years. The honourable gentleman is 44 years out of date. The honourable member for Bourke( Mrs. Blackburn) has said that Hitler did this to the Jews. The Liberal party thought of. There was nothing wrong with it then. The analogy of the honourable member for Parramatta is neither complete nor fair. The Immigration Act is not the only other legislation containing a clause of this kind. The Aliens Deportation Act of 1948 contains a similar provision, but no member of the Parliament in 1948 or of the committee that considered that measure raised any objection or made a wild and ferocious attack regarding denial of the liberty of the ordinary citizen. If the honourable member for Parramatta will look at the interpretation clause, he will find that "" officer "" is defined as an oflicer of the Department of Immigration and includes an oflicer of the Commonwealth or an officer of the police force of a State who is authorized in writing by the Minister for Immigration to exercise certain powers.

Debate resumed from the 28th June (vide page 1579), on motion by Mr the result of the direct pressure of That the bill be now read a second time. long title to this measure states that it is a bill for an act to provide for the prevention or settlement by conciliation and arbitration of industrial disputes, extending beyond the limits of any one State, in connection with stevedoring operations; to regulate industrial matters in connection with the performance of stevedoring operations in the course of trade and commerce with other countries or among the States; and for other purposes. I have referred to the long title because I am certain that to many honourable members it has a familiar ring. It has a familiar ring because a bill with precisely the same objects was presented to the Parliament by this Government in 1947, two years ago. Therefore, this measure, on the face of it, bears the stamp of failure. In his second-reading speech on this bill the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction ( Mr Dedman) described the Stevedoring Act 1947 as a bold legislative experiment. I remind the House that what was done then was to remove the stevedoring industry from the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration and to establish, by legislative action, a body to deal with certain matters in connection with the waterfront. That legislation was based upon certain war-time experience, but, so far as legislation in this Parliament was concerned, it was an experiment. As honourable members know, the experiment of removing an industry from the jurisdiction of the Arbitration Court and placing it under the jurisdiction of a specially appointed tribunal has not heen confined to the stevedoring industry. Far from being a bold legislative experiment, as the Minister claimed, that was a cowardly legislative experiment. Instead of revealing courage on the part of the Government in venturing into a new field it represented on the part of the Government a surrender in three important industries which are vital to the economy of the Commonwealth and the successful conduct of our trade and commercial affairs. It was a surrender by the Commonwealth to Communist pressure. These special tribunals were created as Communist leadership upon the Government to take away from the authority of the Arbitration Court matters which for many years had been dealt with by the court. That .pressure was exerted not because those Communist leaders who put their thumb upon the Government believed that in that way they would get more effective arbitration upon the problems arising in these industries, but because they were determined to smash the arbitration system of this country, and because they believed that by a policy of dividing they would he able to conquer and implement their policy of industrial"" anarchy.",59,Temporary Chairman Ms Of Twelve Months After The Bill Comes Into
293,Mr Holt (Eawkner) [9.47],"Th ethe coal industry. followed the events of the last two years since the Parliament passed that legislation will realize just how successful that Communist policy has been. The three particular industries in which this realize that these three vital elements in experiment was applied were: First, the stevedoring industry, which we will examine in some detail in the course of our consideration of this legislation; secondly, the other maritime industry, the seamen's industry, for which a special tribunal was created; and, thirdly, the coal industry, for which also a special tribunal was created. Those industries were taken outside the scope of the Arbitration Court. To-day, the people of Australia are experiencing something of the consequences of this bold legislative experiment insofar as it was applied to the coal industry. In passing, it is interesting to note that efficiency and more harmony in the the central leadership in each of those industries domination, and that that leadership remains under Communist domination. The coal industry is under tbe leadership of Idris Williams, who is a selfconfessed Communist; the Waterside Workers Federation is under the leadership of Jim Healy, another confessed Communist, Union is under the leadership of Mr provided benefits for some of those who Eliot Valens Elliot, another Communist. Those men are not merely members of the Communist party; each of them exercises leadership in the central organization of the Communist party in Australia. It may be a bitter reflection for hundreds of thousands of Australian trade unionists who are out of work at present as the direct result of the policy which this Communist leadership has pursued, thanks to the weak-kneed submission of this Government to the pressure that they put on it in the course of the last few years, to realize that each of these men is not a native of Australia. He is not a man native to this country who knows its problems and wants to see it advance and progress as the result of help that he personally can bring to it. Those men have come to this country, and Australia has been kind to them. It has placed them in positions of authority in the industries which they have been elected to control hy methods for which they themselves will have to answer at the proper time. We may well pause in our consideration of th* special problems of these industries to our economy, the operations on the waterfront^ on the sea and in the coal mines, are all under Communist leadership and under the leadership of men who have come as migrants to this country and to whom this country has proved a generous motherland. So far as the stevedoring industry is concerned, the Minister told us that this legislation was to follow that already on the statute-book. He said that the Governinent is making an earnest endeavour to retain for this industry and the community the benefits that wer* obtained by its former legislation and to provide for further progress, greater industry. I emphasize the Minister's was under Communist reference to the benefits that were obtained by its former legislation for the industry and for the community because, whilst we shall not have an opportunity in this debate to examine what has happened with regard to the seamen and on the coalfields, we can have a close look at what has happened in respect of operations on the whilst the Seamen's waterfront. The legislation certainly came within its scope. It had a very direct benefit, for example, for "" Comrade"" Healy, because during the short period for which the legislation has been in force and prior -to his summary dismissal from the Stevedoring Industry Commission because of his repeated defiance of the orders of that body, he hag collected in fees from the Government an amount exceeding £1,100. retain that. interjection from the Minister; but at least that legislation conferred that benefit on "" Comrade"" Healy. period of about two years. that.

So far as "" Comrade"" Healy is concerned, that benefit is to be cut down by the passage of th s legislation, the hours worked have on the average but the workers in the stevedoring industry may fairly feel that since the commission began its operations they, too, have received some very substantial benefits. So, when the Minister says that he is proposing to continue the benefits already obtained, we should refer to what has been received by those workers because, as has also been tbe case in the coal industry, the existence of the special tribunal set up in this industry has conferred great benefits upon them. Despite the fact that it is a casual industry and its wage level was computed by judges of the Arbitration Court on the assumption that those employed in it would work on the average only thirty hours a week, the commission during the brief period that it has been in operation has found it practicable to prescribe annual leave with pay. Despite the fact that wage rates in the industry were computed on the basis that thia work would be casual and intermittent, it has been found practicable to pay attendance money to members of the Waterside Workers Federation who may not receive a call on any day they attend for work or, indeed, on any day they receive notice that they will not be required to work. When we examine the figures in relation to those employed in the industry, we find that since the commission was set have earned what may be regarded as a high average rate of wages for a comparatively short working week. For the information of the HouseI sball give figurps showing the average earnings during that period, and the average hours worked for those earnings, for the main ports of the Commonwealth, which I shall give in their alphabetical order. The figures relating to hours worked are approximate, as I do not wish to weary the House with decimal fractions. In Adelaide from July to December, 1948which is the last period for which I have been able to obtain figures-the average weekly earnings of waterside workers were £11 4s. 3d. for a 3S-hour hour week; Fremantle, £11 16s. Id. for a 37-hour week; Hobart, £10 Os. 3d. for a 34-hour week; and Melbourne, £12 ls. 9d. for 41 hours. I pause here to mention that Melbourne is the only port in which been more than the regulation 40-hour week. The Sydney figure was £9 12s. Id. for 34 hours. The average for the whole of the Commonwealth, taking all the .ports into consideration, was £10 9s. 8d. for 35 hours worked. The Minister has interjected to say that some night work would be included. That may be so, but, on the other hand, there would have been periods when, as the Minister will acknowledge, no day work was required. I have gone into some detail regarding that matter because I am certain there ar« many members of trade unions throughout Australia, particularly of those unions that cover tradesmen who have gone through their regular apprenticeship, perhaps for six years, who will hear with some envy of the rates of pay now received by waterside workers for the hours of work that I have mentioned. But, in addition to those facts, there was one other important fact to which I shall refer in a moment in more detail. That is, that by a process that I regard as unprecedented in this country-and I should be interested to learn whether the Minister could find any other illustration of ita particular union, the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia, has had conferred upon it by legislation a monopoly of the proup they vision of waterfront labour. TJnder this measure it is impossible to become a waterside worker without being a member of the federation. By a process tliat I shall explain in more detail later, it was the case that unless the federation nominated a particular person to become a waterside worker, that person was not appointed even if the Stevedoring Industry Commission as it was formerly constituted required the appointment of additional watersiders. Employees engaged on the waterfront may well accept the Minister's statement that substantial benefits have been conferred upon them since the Stevedoring Industry Act 1947 came into force. But what about the community? The Minister made some reference to the fact that the community also had benefited. I do not know what tests could be applied to this claim that the community has benefited. Has the community benefited from the fact that there has been more efficient 1947. When we examine the impact of labour on the waterfront in return for those high wages that I have mentioned? Is it claimed that there has been a speedier turn-round of shipping? Is it claimed that freight rates, because of greater efficiency brought about by the act, have been substantially reduced? Of course not, because on all of those counts the results have gone against the interests of the community. The honourable memvery telling speech that he made some time ago in this chamber, provided some details that I shall mention now, without attempting to quote them fully, so that we may have a balanced view of the Minister's claim. He pointed out that at the present time there is a little more than 40 per cent tonnage iu excess of that available for coastal shipping in the pre-war period. He also pointed out that despite the fact that we have this 40 per cent, increase of tonnage available the actual cargo carried last year was 1\ per cent, less than that carried in the year before the war started. What is true in that illustration we find exemplified for us in another direction. In Victoria recently, the Chamber of Commerce issued a report showing that compared with the cargo handled in that State in 1939, there was a falling off by more than 500,000 tons in 1948 So here we have the situation-additional cargo handled. discharging and loading rates, for which I shall again quote the figures given by the honourable member for Wakefield, we find that the discharging rate during the three-year period 1937 to 1939 was 804 tons a day but in the three-year period 1945 to 1947, which were the last figures that he quoted, the average rate had dropped to 355 tons a day, or a fall of more than 50 per cent. We do not get a very much better picture regarding Mr Holt. the loading rate. The average loading rate before the war was 434 tons a day. In the three-year period 1945 to 1947, it had dropped to 321 tons a day. So there we have another illustration of how the conduct of this industry has failed to secure the efficiency of operation that was hoped when the Stevedoring Industry Bill was submitted to us in these factors on freight costs we find that the freight rate for general cargo between the port of Sydney and the port of Melbourne has increased from 27s. a ton in 1939 to 82s. a ton at the present time. It would be difficult to find in any other field of industry a rate of increase of cost as high as the alarming increase that I have mentioned. That is a consequence for which the Government cannot escape some share of the responsibility, because of the policy pursued hy it during the period in question. When we are told that the present measure, which is designed to supersede the legislation of 1947, is intended to continue the benefits conferred on the community by the previous legislation we may ask ourselves what those benefits are. What was then a turbulent industry has continued to be a turbulent industry despite the efforts made by the present Government to appease the waterside workers. We cannot appease the unappeasable. We cannot appease the Communist leaders of the waterfront, the shipping and the mining industries. They cannot he appeased because their avowed object is to smash the arbitration system of this country. Although the present Government has gone as far as any administration could go in placating them, it has found that the Communist leaders of the waterfront industry have, by their own available ships, less deliberate act, shown themselves to be If we examine the unappeasable. Coming now to the legislation before us, we ask ourselves to what extent it represents a departure from the experiment that was made in 1947. Admittedly there are one or two variations. The previous legislation established a Stevedoring Industry Commission to deal with administrative matters, such as the regulation of conditions on the waterfront, the establishment of a bureau for picking up labour, and the provision of amenities.",61,Dedman
300,"Ber For Wakefield ( Mr Mcbride), In A","tt also dealt with other matters of the kind that were formerly dealt with by the Arbitration Court. The Government realizes that its failure to placate the militants has been abject and costly, as it has also been in the coal industry, where its failure has brought us to the brink of national disaster. The Government has therefore decided to bring the waterside workers once more under the jurisdiction of the Arbitration Court. On behalf of the Opposition I say that we welcome that decision as a consummation much to be desired. When the Stevedoring Industry Act, which removed them from the direct control of the Arbitration Court, was introduced in 1947 we contended that its enactment would weaken the authority of that body. We told the Government that the establishment of special tribunals for particular industries would create anomaUes that would cause a great deal of friction. It is obvious that the head of a tribunal which deals with one particular industry must tend to become blind to the requirements of other industries and their employees and to ignore the effect upon other industries and workers of his decisions. Because of his isolation from other induscontained in the previous legislation, but tries it is obvious that although the decisions which he makes may meet the desires of those with whom he is concerned, he will inevitably create problems for other industries for which special tribunals are not provided. Soi t has proved. I recall that a very serious strike occurred in a sugar refinery in Victoria because some of its employees who were handling goods brought from the wharfs complained that they were not being treated exactly similarly to waterside workers who also handled the goods. That is an example of the kind of dispute occasioned by the establishment of special industrial tribunals for particular industries. Members of the Opposition have at all times stressed the need for maintaining the supervision of the Arbitration Court over all industries in order that uniformity of treatment may be given to all industrial workers. Uniformity of treatment can oome about only when the arbitrating authority has some recognition of the consequences upon other industries of the decisions to which he makes. The provision of special treatment for any section of industrial workers must inevitably increase the difficulties of maintaining industrial peace, develop friction and cause industrial disturbances. Insofar as this measure intends to bring waterside workers back to the authority of the Arbitration Court, the Opposition welcomes it. However, I dotibt whether the legislation will achieve the Government's objective. Why are special provisions included in the bill concerning the matters that may be referred to the Arbitration Court? Why should special provision be made for this industry when no such provision is made for other industries? Most of the industrial workers of this country come under the jurisdiction of the Arbitration Court without any special legislation having to be provided, and, that being so, waterside workers would automatically come within the ambit of that court. Despite the Government's claim that it is returning the waterside workers to the jurisdiction of the Arbitration Court, the bill provides for special treatment to he given to this particular section of the industrial community. Furthermore, the remaining parts of the measure do not remove the weaknesses perpetuate them. Let us review the provisions of the measure from the point of view of industrial discipline. Force without justice may be tyrannous, but justice without force is futile, as we have so often learned. The bill contains no effective disciplinary provisions, although this particular industry, _ of all industries, requires strong disciplinary provisions. . It is not sufficient to say that the legislation which has returned the supervision of tbe industry to the control of the Arbitration Court gives added power to that body to control waterside workers. The disciplinary powers of the Arbitration Court itself have proved ineffectual. In his annual report the late Chief Judge of the Arbitration Court, Mr Justice DrakeBrockman, informed the Government that the power to enforce awards and orders against employees still remains ineffectual. He statedThere have been too many instances of the refusal to accept decisions of Conciliation Commissioners made in settlement of claims. Although that complaint was made many months ago the Government has done nothing to rectify the position. It certainly does not propose to strengthen the disciplinary powers of the Arbitration Court under this bill. Section 16 (3.) of the Stevedoring Industry Act 1947 provides thatA person shall not contravene or fail to comply with any provision of an award or order made by the Commission whicli is applicable to him. Penalty: Where the offence is committed by a waterside worker, Five pounds; in any other case. One hundred pounds. A waterside worker may refuse to comply with an order to load cargoes which must be loaded urgently. A ship which is carrying valuable food or other cargoes to Great Britain or other parts of the world may he held up in consequence, but the maximum penalty provided in that legislation, and repeated in this bill, is a fine of £:""). That provision is sufficiently in nocuous, but its ineffectiveness is even more clearly demonstrated when I assert -and the Minister will correct me if I am WVO r i g t h a t there has never been a fine of £5 imposed upon a waterside worker, notwithstanding (hat no one will contest that there have been many breaches of the act that would warrant the infliction of a fine. Of course, the Minister may rejoin, "" Oh, hut tliere is a power of suspension "". That is so, but I understand that that power has been exercised most sparingly. But there again, that is not an effective penalty. A man who is engaged in casual employment, in an intermittent occupation, may be suspended for two days, from, say, Tuesday to Thursday, but he can still obtain employment at the week-end when the penalty rates of pay apply, and thus earn more than he would have earned had he worked from Tuesday to Thursday. In practice, it has been found that the penalty of suspension carries no real sanction whatsover. The maximum penalty that may be imrepresents a most remarkable development posed on the employers' organizations is in Australian legislation. The develop£100, but I cannot find any provision ment is all the more remarkable because for the imposition of a penalty on the it emanates from a government which has Waterside Workers Federation, which has always expressed its abhorrence of been given the monopoly of engaging the evils of monopolies. Doesi t not men in this industry. the Minister that there have been times which is able to say whether or not an when the union has been requested by the Australian citizen shall enter a particular Stevedoring Industry commission to make industry has an extreme powera power available at certain ports an additional which a government itself would hesitate number of employees. Ifr. Holt. to do so in so many words, the federation, has delayed, evaded or avoided nominating additional employees, and, in consequence, the ports have been without the additional labour that the commission has required. In those instances, nopenalty has been exacted from the federation, and I cannot find any provision in this bill for the imposition of a penalty or sanction on the federation if it does not carry out the direction of the Australian Stevedoring Industry Board. Tf there be a penalty at all, it is to be found in clause 17, to which I have already made reference. That clause provides for a maximum fine of £100. To a union which, on the facts disclosed in recent proceedings, is able to withdraw many thousands of pounds from the bank in order to assist a striking union, the penalty of £100 does not appear very formidable. In relation to this industry, the Government has not been prepared to go so far as it went, in the act of 1946, with the coal mining industry. In that legislation at least the Government did provide for the imposition of a fine of £1,000 and sis months' imprisonment on those who did not obey the direction of the Coal Industry Tribunal. It may be that those provisions have not been enforced, but at least, they were inserted in the legislation by the government at that time. There. fore, I say to the Minister that the Stevedoring IndustryB ill , now under consideration, will prove just as futile as the act which it supersedes, unless those who are given by the Government the authority to make orders are also given power to ensure that those orders are obeyed. Earlier, I mentioned that the Waterside Workers Federation had been given by legislation the monopoly of engaging labour. This House should consider the position for a few minutes, because it I remind the strike this Parliament that a union Without refusing to exercise? When that right to admit «r exclude an Australian citizen from working in a particular industry is given to a union which is notoriously dominated by Communist leaders, I say that the Australian people as a whole should not countenance the situation forfiveminutes. The Port of ""Sydney is one of the most important ports of the Commonwealth, and the kind of person, and the number of persons who may engage in waterside work there is determined by the Waterside Workers Pederation, the deliberations of which are dominated by '* Comrade"" Healy, a notorious Com munist. That is wrong. The Stevedoring Industry Bill, which is now under consideration, provides for the appointment of waterside employment committees on which the Government, the employers and the union will be represented. If anybody is to be given authority by the Australian Government to determine whether or not an Australian citizen shall have the right to work on the waterfront, it should be a waterside employment committee and not a union which may be exercising its choice either in a capricious or vindictive manner, or from motives of a political character. I wonder why the Government, having taken the power to set up waterside employment committees, has not given to those bodies the responsibility of determining who shall be employed in the industry. ployment committees will have that power. t.he Minister say that the waterside employment committees will have that power. Will the honourable gentleman inform me whether the existing port committees have that power, and whether the waterside employment committees will have that power in future? have had that power in the past and the position will not be changed under this legislation. The port committees decide how many hundreds of men shall he admitted or dismissed. catch me with that one. He says that at present, a port committee decides how many men shall he admitted to the industry if lahour is short, and how many shall be dismissed from it, if the number of the employees is excessive. Thati * not the point which I am making. . decide who shall be registered. point. The bill provides that a person shall be registered with the port committee; hut, speaking broadly, the only persons who are eligible for registration are those who are members of the Waterside Workers Federation. 1 invite the Minister to correct me if I am misstating the position, but I believe that this is what happens in practice at the present time. The port committee says to the Waterside Workers Federation, ""We want 500 additional employees in the Port of Sydney "". The Waterside Workers Federation then nominates to the port committee an additional 500 persons. That is not the same as if the port committee were to advertise for 500 additional employees for ths waterfront, make its selection from the applicants, and then, perhaps, say, "" Now, boys, you must become members of the Waterside Workers Federation, because we register only those who are members of that organization"". Such a position would still confer great benefits on the federation and give to it a virtual monopoly of employment in this industry, but that situation would not call for the same criticism that I make of the present practice. However, that has not been done. Once the number of additional employees has been indicated, complete authority for their reci'uitment rests with the Waterside Workers Federation. How many men will be enlisted as members of that organization in the port of Sydney who are not men whom "" Comrade"" Healy regards as suitable material for his propaganda and his particular brand of tactics on the waterfront? That is one of the most serious criticisms which honourable members on this side of the House level against this legislation and against this Government. The proper course in future would be for the waterside employment committees on which T he Minister cannot the Government, the employers, and 'the Waterside Workers Federation will be represented, to recruit and select new",63,Dedman

306,Mr Holt,"Again, that is not the labour for employment on tbe waterfront. Then let the committee, if it will, tell the new men that the act provides for preference in employment to members of the federation, and let the recruits join the organization. At least, the waterside employment committee would have some supervision over -.the personnel to be enlisted for this responsible work which is so vital to the efficient transport of Australian goods within the Commonwealth and to other parts of the world. There is one final point that I wish to make. The normal means whereby fair dealing and discipline are assured in an industry is the relationship between employer and employee. The Arbitration Court and other tribunals have laid down the relationship that should apply between employer and employee, but they have left to the employer, as I think all fair minded members will concede to be necessary in any occupation or industry, a reasonable measure of disciplinary control over those whom he engages. Efficient industry is impossible unless those who pay the wages and fulfil the conditions laid down for employees by the industrial tribunals of this country are permitted to enforce a reasonable measure of discipline, and to expect a fair day's work from those whom they engage. In this industry, as the result of legislation which the Parliament has already passed, the normal relationship between employer and employee does not exist. there is a sort of "" infernal We have the employer and the employee, but standing somewhere in between them are the government authorities, and unless those administering on behalf of the Government the strong powers that this bill confers upon them are very careful, we shall have a situation in which discipline will become impossible. In practice, that has already happened. Let us suppose, for example, that, at a pick-up centre, there is an unruly waterside worker who refuses to obey the orders given to him. Such orders, I remind the House, would be issued to him, not by his employer, but by the port committee. The"" boss "", on the other hand, wants the labour. He has a ship, perhaps carrying perishable cargo, to be unloaded. It has to make scheduled calls at various other ports in this country or overseas. Mr Bolt. be represented on the port committee. not suggest that that is how it works out in practice so far as the pick-up is concerned. He is not the boss directly engaging men for a particular ship. He may be represented on the port committee, but the Government's representative has the casting vote. It cannot be claimed that the person who really employs and pays the labour, has any direct supervision of the pick-up. Therefore, if the government authority is not prepared to redres* a breach of discipline, it will be impossible for efficient operations to be carried on. That is why I refer to the position as an "" infernal triangle"". Unless that administration is exercised with skill, authority and judgment, the relationship between employer and employee will become utterly unworkable. I do not wish to detain the House at greater length at this stage. There are other matters that can be dealt with more effectively when the bill reaches the committee stage. I merely repeat that, in introducing this measure, the Government is having another "" go "" at bringing peace to this section of industry, and facilitating more efficient working on the waterfront. Events since the first attempt was made in 1947 have been disastrous, and costly. From the point of view of the community, the experiment has failed completely and Instead, I am afraid that this measure will not triangle"". be any more successful than the last because it still contains the weaknesses to which I have referred in the course of this debate. We on his side of the chamber prophesy-no t happily, I assure the Minister, but with some confidence-that unless these weaknesses are eliminated, he will come back to this Parliament ibefore long, if he has the good fortune to remain in office, and confess that the second experiment has failed to produce the results that the Government seeks. The Minister will have to strengthen the authority of the tribunal; he will have to provide for a greater measure of discipline on the waterfront both between employer and employee, and between the Stevedoring Industry Board and its employees. If he is to remove what my colleagues and I regard as a very obnoxious provision from this bill, he will take away from the",66,Dedman

It should have been introduced in the Senate, where the Minister for Shipping and Fuel (Senator Ashley) sits. He is the Minister who controls this industry; but apparently he is too deeply involved in negotiations with Mr Healy and Mr Roach to handle the bill, and so its introduction has been transferred to this chamber. Mr Healy was in Canberra a fortnight ago. He had a long discussion with the Minister for Shipping and Fuel and finally he O.K.'d this measure. The Minister once again turned out to be merely a rubber stamp in the hands of the Communists. That is typical of the recent history of the Stevedoring Industry Commission. The Communists climbed into power and have remained there with the support of the Curtin Government and the present Government. We have heard a great deal about "" my good friend Jim Healy"" from Labour party members. Mr Healy appears to have the "" Indian sign "" on the Government. He gets what he wants. The Government says that Mr Healy is a good negotiator. What does that mean? Does it mean that he gets away with the Communist line? But for the support of Mr Healy and Mr Roach by this Government, the Communists would have lost all their control over the Waterside Workers Federation long ago. I was interested to hear the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Holloway) say that the port committees had done good work. They were supposed to be under the control of the Stevedoring Industry Commission. Actually, in some instances, they were dominated by Mr Healy and Mr Roach. When Mr J. A. Beasley was Minister for Shipping, he appointed Mr a board, but the board will be without Lewis as chairman of the Sydney Port Committee. Mr Lewis was appointed because he was a member of the Labour party, a member who was acceptable to the wharf labourers on the Sydney waterfront. He did his job conscientiously, and because of that he clashed with Messrs Healy and Roach. Mr Justice Kirby issued a direction to the members of the union that they were not to stop work on a Communist judge. Lewis took his .position and his responsibility seriously, and promptly stood down those who followed the Communistdirection. What was the result? Lewis was dumped by the Government, and by the commission. He found his position as chairman of the port committee untenable. How could he stand up to the Communists if the Government was giving in? When the Government had a choice between a Labour man and the Communists, it backed the Communists. It allowed Healy and Roach to declare a blockade of the Dutch Government in Indonesia. It allowed the initiative on an important issue, affecting thia country's relations with a friendly power, to pass into the hands of the Communists. This bill represents another step on the road of appeasement. Mr Healy is delighted with the bill. He approves of it, and has given it his O.K. He is not worried that he will no longer be drawing appearance money as a member of the commission The union funds will make up the leeway. But Mr Healy will be able to stand for the next election of officers in his union olaiming that his policy still has the endorsement of the Government. He will point out that notliing has been lost, that the Government abdicated when he refused to be supplanted on the commission. Healy said, "" No Healy, no Roach-n o union representative on the commission "". The Government said that it would not accept Healy and Roach as nominees to the commission. Then, instead of having a show-down, and saying that two other union representatives should be appointed to the commission, it backed down, and changed the name of the commission, calling it non-Communist representatives. The bill provides for the appointment of a",67,Dedman

No doubt, Judge Kirby will be the sole arbiter, but Healy and Roach will have the right to appear before him as union advocates, and the shipowners will still have the right to be represented by advocates. difference, therefore, will there be under the intention of the Government, it the new arrangement as compared with the old? When the commission was in existence, there were Healy and Roach on one side of the table, two representaWhy should the Government allow itself tives of the shipowners on the other side, to be bluffed into abandoning a Labour and the judge at the end to give his decision. Now there will be Healy as before as an advocate, and the owners will be represented by their advocate, and there will be the same judge on the bench to give his decision. The only difference will be that the judge will be wearing a wig, whereas he did not wear one before. How can it be claimed that Healy and Roach have been disciplined ? The difference between the old commission and the new board will be the difference between Tweedledum and Tweedledee. Communists will make a mockery of both the board and the Government. Healy and Roach defied the commission and they defied the Government; yet Healy and Roach will be recognized by the board. The next part of the bill is a typical piece of bureaucracy. The board is to consist of a chairman and two members; but, according to the Minister, members of the board must not be associated with the industry. A knowledge of the industry is to be a bar to appointment. Retired magistrates or political friends of the Government will be regarded as eligible, but not any one who knows anything about the job. Of course, it could happen as happened in the case of the AusThe government was responsible for the tralian Broadcasting Control Board. We were assured by the Minister in charge of the bill under which that board was to be set up that the members of the board were to have no connection with any broadcasting station. In fact an interpretation to that effect was incorporated in the bill, but when the appointThe task is not difficult. By taking the ments were announced it was found that one of the members came straight from a broadcasting network. ment was, perhaps, technically accordance with the provisions of the Mr Lang. act, but I say deliberately that the House was deceived over that measure. In regard to the matter now under discussion, it may be that some shipping man will resign his present position and What -be appointed to the board. If that is should be frank about it, and say so now. The board should have on it a representative of the waterside workers. principle just because of Healy and Roach? There is no need to accept the Communist nominee, or nominees. The Government is responsible for any body that it sets up. It can make its own appointments. There are plenty of good anti-Communist men on the waterfront capable of representing their fellowunionists on a body like this. It is the Government's job to find, a man acceptable to the industry and capable of doing the job, who would not be a catspaw of Healy, and who would safeThe guard the interests of the union members. This is not the first occasion on which a Labour government has had to meet that kind of a situation. In New South Wales, Labour governments have invariably appointed trade union representatives to statutory bodies, and have accepted responsibility for the appointments. When they wanted conciliation commissioners, they did not ask the Trades Hall to accept responsibility. They appointed the men whom they considered to be most suitable for the positions. They appointed trade union representatives to the Meat Board, the Milk Board, the Transport Board, and other bodies that were set up. But they did not ask the unions to nominate anybody. men whom it appointed, and it accepted that responsibility. The same principle should apply in this instance. There are men inside the union who are well fitted to represent the waterside workers on this board. It is the Government's job to ensure that it finds the right man. present course, the Government is strengthening the position of Healy and Roach, whereas by appointing anti-ComHis appointmunists to the board, it would be taking in the first step to destroy their power. The honourable member for West Sydney( Mr O'Connor) should be able to Advise it who would be suitable for such a position. I could name, not one, but several men with the necessary qualifications. If we are to smash communism on the waterfront, anti-Communists should be placed in key positions. The Government's present policy is only consolidating the positions of Healy and Boach. Lt is playing right into their hands. When the Government wants to do anything on the waterfront, or when the board wants to know something about waterside conditions, it will still have to go to Healy and Roach. Put a Labour man on the board, and the influence of Healy and Roach will vanish! Then, instead of getting concessions from the Government by virtue of Communist activities, the wharf labourers would be looking to a Labour man. That would completely circumvent the Communist .plan of action. Instead of the Government doing that with this bill, it is appeasing Healy and Roach. The Government also proposes to perpetuatetwo major strategic weapons valued most highly by the Communist party. It will perpetuate the "" dogcollar "" principle. The Communists are all for the "" dog-collar ""-the compulsory registration of waterside workers and the issue of discs to govern employment on the waterfront. oppose the "" dog-collar "", They oppose it because it can become an instrument of political repression either in the hands of their Communist opponents or in the hands of an anti-Labour government. That was recently pointed out by the honourable meniber for Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons) in this House. The"" dogcollar "" can lead to the permanent loss of the right to make a living in the industry as the result of a fight on industrial principles. It can be perverted so that admission into the industry can be governed by the Communist controllers of the union. By permitting the acceptance of only Communists into the union, the "" dog-collar"" can become a means of poseddrafting potential members of the Communist party. It can be used as an instrument of industrial victimization, as it was used against Freeman, a Labour Leader of the Australian Country party) man on the Sydney waterfront. By ex[11.1] I desire to take this opportunity pelling a Labour stalwart from the union, the Communists can not only deprive him of a living, but also put an end to his opposition. That is why the Communists favour the "" dog-collar "". In that fight, the Government sided with the .Communists, not with the members of the Labour movement fighting the Communists on the wharfs. The second instrument that will be perpetuated by this bill is what is known as the "" redundancy clause "". The board will at any time be able to declare that there is a labour surplus in the industry, and the "" last to come, first to go "" principle will apply. That means that men who were away at the war may be victimized. The board will be able to say that 600 men are redundant in the industry. The last 600 will lose their "" dogcollars "". The young men will have to go first. Those men will tben be thrown on the industrial scrap-heap. The Communists have always welcomed such a state of affairs. It makes material for them. They are then in a position to restrict membership at a future date, when more men are needed. It can become a vicion? circle. It creates vested interests that have no place in a democracy. The Government would have been well advised to consult-rank and file anti-Communists instead of sending for Healy. I know that the Government will not accept an Labour supporters amendment of this bill. It never does accept amendments. So, it must accept the responsibility if Healy and Roach exploit the advantages given to them by the Government under this bill. This is half-baked appeasement at best, but it is all we can expect from a government that believes in appeasement and has very little regard for the genuine Labour man working on the waterfront. adjourned.

312,Mr Fadden (Darling Downs,"consider, cuts across the principle of the effective representation of constituents in this Parliament. I refer to the following statement which was made by the Minister for Shipping and Fuel (Senator Ashley) last Thursday night:The.Leader of the Australian Country party has been bleating all over the country about petrol rationing. He has been complaining ever since I refused permission for the movement of a bus from Melbourne to Queensland for one of his friends. The facts of the case are as follows:I was approached by one of my constituents, Mr Ron Grimley, of Warwick, who asked me to make representations on his behalf in order to obtain from the Liquid Fuel Board sufficient petrol tickets to enable him to bring overland a bus which he had purchased in Melbourne. The bus would have to be run in before it could be used for passenger services, and, accordingly, petrol for that purpose would have to be used after it had arrived at Warwick. On the 8th March, I addressed to the Minister for Shipping and Fuel the following letter:Enclosed is a letter received by -me from Mr Ron T. Grimley, Globe Hotel Building, Warwick, Queensland, who runs a BrisbaneWarwick bus passenger service. This is the only direct route to Brisbane through Cunningham's Gap and, as I have travelled on the service several times, I can aay from my own personal experience that it is of very valuable assistance to the persons in the areas which it services. You will see from Mr Grimley's letter that he has purchased a new thirty-one passenger bus to be delivered to him at Melbourne about the middle of this month. He desires to accept delivery of the vehicle in. Melbourne and drive it by road for use in Brisbane. He points out that, although the Liquid Fuel Control Board in Brisbane is agreeable to supply him with suflicient petrol, namely 100-120 gallons, the Commonwealth Government is not in favour of allowing delivery by road but wishes him to use the alternative methods of rail or ship. No doubt you will have some idea of the delays entailed in endeavouring to obtain shipping space to Brisbane as well as the possibility of taking up space which would otherwise be used by essential cargo. Mr Grimley points out that, even when delivered in Brisbane by ship, the bus will have cannot be arranged. to be run in and a certain amount of petrol will be required for that purpose. As the bus is needed urgently for the Brisbane-Warwick run, and also as I know that Mr Grimley would not put up a case through Mr Fadden. me unless he was convinced of its justice, 2 should very much appreciate your personal and, if possible, favorable consideration of h i i request for a grant of the necessary petrol. I p o in t out t h a t it was d if f i c u l t to f r e i g h t the bus from M e l b o u r n e to W a r w i c k byr a i l , because the r a i l w a y s f o u n d the accommodation of so large a vehicle as a 31-passenger bus v e r y a w k w a r d and it was d if f i c u l t to t r a n s p o r t it expeditiously by sea because of the p r i o r it y a l l o t t ed to more essential goods. The Ministerd i d not r e p l y u n t i l the 2 3 r d M a r c h , w h e n he w r o t e me a l o n g letter, as follows:I refer again to your letter and enclosure of 8th March in which representations were made on behalf of Mr R. T. Grimley of the Globe Hotel Building, Warwick, Queensland, who runs a Brisbane-Warwick bus passenger service, and who desires a sufficient allowance of petrol to enable him to drive a new bui from Melbourne to Queensland. The position is that petrol cannot be made available for interstate movement of new vehicles unless alternative means of transport, such as sea or rail, cannot be obtained within a reasonable time. The fact that these alternatives are more expensive cannot be taken into consideration as the object of the restriction is to save fuel. Mr Grimley states that General MotorsHoldens Limited had previously been permitted to issue sufficient petrol tickets at Fishermen's Bend for overland movement to Brisbane. The facts are that this firm draws ration tickets against an imprest ncc-ount provided by the Victorian Liquid Fuel Control Board for the delivery of vehicles. A t the time the imprest account was established, there was no suggestion of interstate delivery. General Motors bus manufacturing programme was expanded early in 1948 to provide for requirements in all States, and subsequently, thc firm provided ration tickets from their imprest account for a few interstate deliveries. This, however, was done without the knowledge of the Fuel Board, which, in fact, was at the time refusing special allowances to otlier vehicle builders for similar movement. When the matter was brought to the notice of the board, instructions were given to General Motors and other car manufacturers and distributors that issues were not to be made from their imprest accounts for interstate movement without specific authority from the board in each case. Such authority is not given except when alternative transport I am informed that normally shipping space to Brisbane can be obtained within a reasonable time, and I tlierefore regret that petrol cannot be made available to Mr Grimley to drive his hus overland. The Queensland Fuel Board will, of course, issue an allowance for the movement from Brisbane to Warwick. I understand that this decision has already been conveyed to Messrs. E. G. Eager and Son Proprietary Limited, through whom Mr Grimley placed his order for the bus. Tliose are the facts in connection with the matter to which the Minister has unfairly referred. Things have come to a pretty pass if a member of this House cannot make representations on behalf of his constituents without a responsible Minister unfairly distorting the facts, as was done on this occasion.

326,Mr Holloway,"The Commonwealth4. If not, why were exports not calculated on such a basis as to meet the local demand? honourable member's questions are as follows:1. It is not practicable to give the quantity of timber cut for general construction and building purposes separately from that cut for industrial &c, and information available at present is not sufficiently complete to provide figures of sawn production for periods later than the 31st March, 1949. The total sawn cut in Australian timber, excluding railway sleepers, for the twelve months ending 31st March, 1949, was 1,097,722,000 super, feet. It is considered that this figure can be regarded as a reasonably reliable indication of the cut for the twelve months ending 31st May, 1949. 2. Of the total sawn cut of Australian timber, excluding railway sleepers, during the twelve months* ending 31st March, 1949, 1,077,(589,000 super, feet was used locally and 20,033,000 super, feet was exported overseas. 3 and 4. No specific quantity of timber was set aside for home consumption, but with the addition of timber imports of 217.993,000 super, feet, making a total of 1,295,682,000 super, feet available for consumption in Australia during the twelve months ending the 31st March, 1949, it is considered that having regard to shortages in complementary materials suflicient timber was available to meet all essential requirements if transport facilities had been adequate to enable equitable distribution to be made throughout Australia. As far as the Commonwealth Crovernment was concerned, no permit for export overseas of timber from any State was granted unless the advice of the relevant State authority was first obtained to the effect that the material was not required for essential purposes with the State, nor in general were they granted where reasonable traffic facilities were available for the transfer of any surplus timber from one State to another Statei n short supply. merce and Agriculture, upon notice1.

(o) 78,300 tons; (6) 84,500 tons. The difference between the total of these two quantities and the total production over the period is due to changes in stocks in cold stores. 3.

I refer to the difficulties being experienced by many people who wish to send fa t to Great Britain. In view of the shortage of tinplate, w i ll the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture consider amending the present regulations which restrict the weight of a parcel of f a t to 2 lb.? Has the British Government indicated to the Australian Government that it is prepared to reduce the rate of postage on g if t parcels? If not, w i ll the Australian Government approach the British authorities to see if a reduction can be made of postage rates on such parcels? The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:The Tinplate Board places no restriction on the supply of tinplate for g if t food parcels for supervision of officers of my department. The 2-lb. weight l i m it has been retained to ensure more equitable distribution in Britain and to avoid exploitation. It is considered more desirable to send edible fats in bulk as the Ministry of Food can handle the distribution to the best advantage. Increased quantities of bulk edible fats are now being shipped to Britain. The 2-lb. l i m it applies only to parcels forwarded has been stated previously, the position is that the postage charged upon parcels for Britain takes into account the factors of cost of oversea points for delivery. The current postage scale has been in operation for many years and was fixed at a time when handling costs were at a much lower figure than applies to-day. Over the past two years, however, sea freight costs for parcel mails have risen substantially, and these costs have been accepted without increasing postage charges for parcels.",76,Introduction Into Australia

334,Mr Poxlard,"On the 21st June, theThese unavoidable freight costs nav represent a considerable proportion of the postage prepayments collected from the senders of parcels,, and it is impossible to have them reduced. The question of reduced postage upon food parcels for Britain has been canvassed with the British authorities from time to time in recent years. However, it was found that the small reductions possible ia the handling charges at cither end would not suffice to allow any appreciable relief so far as senders are concerned on account of the factor of the heavy freight charges necessarily incurred. Notwithstanding this, information available to me indicates that the Australian postage rates upon food parcels for Britain are still more favorable than those operative upon similar parcels from the nearer countries ol South Africa and Canada. For that reason, and in view of the marked drop in food parcels, it was deemed inadvisable to make any reduction at the present time. right honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page) asked the following question :.Will the Government consider waiving the customs duties on insulators and pins which local authorities have been advised by their State governments to import from overseas! The Minister for Trade and Gustoms has now supplied the following information Normally Australian manufacturers are able to cater for a considerable portion of Australian requirements of insulators and pins, but owing to the acknowledged shortage, specific importations of these goods are being admitted under customs by-law, free of duty when qualifying for admission under the British preferential tarifl and 121 per cent, ad valorem otherwise. Free admission from countries other than those entitled to British preferential tariif rates is not accorded in view of thc fact that the United Kingdom commercially produces these articles and is, in fact, exporting them to Australia. In certain instance* no concession is granted because it has been ascertained that even after paying full duty the imported goods land at a price below the Australian manufacturers' wholesale telling price for a comparable article.
