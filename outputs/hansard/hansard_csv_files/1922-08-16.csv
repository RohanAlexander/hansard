19,Motion (By Mr Hughe S) Agreed To,,15,Ployment Of Dismissed Railway
20,Mr Parker Moloney (Hume),"SupplyB ill exactly what has happened in regard te' it. ment let a number of contracts for the building of wooden ships. Amongst the many contractors was ° the firm of Messrs. Kidman and Mayoh, who contracted to build six such vessels, and by the year 1919, they had made some progress with the construction of two of them. touched. When the war ceased, the Government decided to relieve the various contractors of their contracts, and compensate them, and in respect of the four ships which Kidman and Mayoh had not commenced, the Government paid them £13,000 each, or a total of £52,000. The contractors asked to be allowed to finish the other two vessels, the Braeside and the Burnside. In other words, they preferred not to take £26,000 in compensation for the cancellation of the order for the construction of those two vessels. I wish to make that point clear in refutation of the statement that is sometimes made that the building of these two vessels was a war-time measure. The war was over at this stage, and the contract was simply a business transaction. A t one stage during the course of construction, the Government had arranged to sell the ships to Burns, Philp and Company. One of the ships, the Braeside, was launched in due -course with much ceremony, but immediately following the launching, it was discovered thab the vessel had developed what is known in shipping parlance as a ""hog."" The launching was a failure, and because of the ""hog,"" and the fact that the contractors could not get Lloyd's AI certificate, which they had undertaken to get, Burns, Philp and Company became suspicious. They made inquiries, and soon discovered that the ships had not been built in accordance with the agreement and plans and specifications, that a number of dummy bolts had been used where through bolts were specified, and, generally, that the whole work of construction was slummed from start to finish. Upon these grounds, Burns Philp and Company refused to proceed with the purchase, and they were supported in that attitude by statements made by workmen employed on the job that the work had been slummed. The contractors, finding that they could not get Lloyd's certificate, asked the Government to relieve them of their contract. They said in effect, "" We undertook to build these [53] [16 AUGUST, 1922.J (No. 2) 1922-23. 1345 vessels in accordance with plans and speciDuring the year 1918 the Governfications approved by Lloyd's and to get Lloyd's A l certificate. We have failed to deliver the goods, and we ask to be relieved of our contrast."" Honourable members are aware of what followed. The contractors approached the Government and said that they would be satisfied if the Public Works Committee were asked The other four they had not to decide whether or not they were to be relieved of their contract, and, if so, upon what terms. I do not desire to conceal anything in connection with the charge I am bringing against the Government, so I shall read to the House an' extract from a letter which the company wrote to the Government, and in which they gave a. definite undertaking to abide by the decision of the Public Works Committee. That letter showed that the contractors had in mind the possibility that, if such an inquiry were not held, there would be costly arbitration and possibly litigation. The contractors wroteIf the Commonwealth Government took over the work, it might reasonably be assumed that they could complete the vessels to their own satisfaction, and obviate the necessity for protracted delays which must occur to secure a settlement of the many points at present in dispute. Some of these would mean submission to arbitration, and possibly litigation. There is a clear statement that they desired to obviate arbitraiion and litigation, and they proceededI t is suggested for consideration that if the Government can see its way clear to relieve us of our contract, we would urge that the matter be referred to the Parliamentary Public Works Committee, witb a view to their making a report on the whole question, and considering the question of the amount of compensation which might be allowed us. If the Government can see its way clear to meet our . request we hereby undertake to abide by the decision of the Public Works Committee, whatever it may be/ The contractors stated in unambiguous terms that if the question were handed over to the Public Works Committee they would abide by the decision of that body. The Public Works Committee undertook the inquiry. No member of the Committee was a shipping expert, but we thought it our bounden duty in the public interest, before completing the inquiry, to bring to our aid the best shipping experts in the Commonwealth. I claim that we had one in Mr Parquhar, who, at that time was manager for the f i r m of Walkers Limited, Maryborough, and who had previously been offered employment by the Commonwealth, but refused it on account of the salary offered. He has since, however, been appointed chief executive officer in connection w i th the Commonwealth shipbuilding activities, and that is proof of his qualifications and ability. We obtained all could get from the Government oflicials, and the Committee paid several visits to the ships themselves. members may know I am not exaggerating when I say that the ships were "" slummed over,"" I shall read extracts i r o m the Committee's findings in their report. my point of view, because I think it necessary that honourable members should know exactly the method of the construction of these vessels. am about to read from the Committee's report is based on the definite statement made by Mr Farquhar as follows:The plans for the construction of the vessels they had the authority of those represenwere prepared by Messrs.

Kidman and Mayoh into Court the Government must necessarily have gained a complete verdict. whether these men should not be standing their trial. said that they should, and a member of the Ministry has actually said the same. If any individual member of this House, or of the Government, or if any business man outside, had let these contracts and the contractors had complained that they oould not deliver the goods, would not that individual have sought to get the whole of his money back, together with interest ? And would he not have had an absolutely sound case in any Court of law? Would he not emphatically have won his claim? What is right for an individual should be right for the whole of the people. In this instance the taxpaying public are the aggrieved parties. Have they not every right to be repaid in full, together with interest? money will come out of the pockets of the people. Are they not to be entitled to a fair deal? I emphasize that no Court of law would have allowed these contractors to escape. When I last spoke upou this subject in the House, the Minister in charge, who had probably not carefully examined the whole issue, complained that I had not fully stated the reference which had been made by the Government to the Public Works Committee. His complaint was unfounded, but I now set out that reference in detail. Committee were asked to decide uponThe advisability ot complying witb the request of Messrs. Kidman and Mayoh to be relieved of the obligation to complete the conplaced upon our finding. tract entered into by them on the 4th August, 1919, to build two wooden vessels for the Commonwealth, and the conditions upon which such relief, if deemed advisable, should be granted, and that the Committee be authorized to proceed with its investigations whilst the House is sitting. We were required to investigate and reThese are the words of a port, first, upon the question of the Government complying with the contractors' request to be relieved of their obligation to finish their job; and, if we so decided, we were secondly desired 'to go into the In the face of such statements, financial aspect. We deliberated, took evidence, and arrived at a twofold decision : first, that the contractors should not be relieved of their contract; and secondly, that the two vessels had not been built in accordance with the plans and specifications. Our finding, after it had been: presented to the Government, was made known in the ordinary course to Messrs. Kidman and Mayoh, who, I stress, had said that they would abide by the decision of the Committee. The Government then proceeded to interpret our finding; and, as an outcome, they issued a writ against the contractors for £114,000. May I be permitted to place the case in the light of the contract being a private one, between ordinary commercial men in the community? if , after twelve or eighteen months, the contractors had told this person that they could not deliver the goods forwhich they had contracted, that they could not build him his two ships according to plans and specifications, that they could not secure the necessary certificate from Lloyd's, what would he have done ? He would undoubtedly have demanded the whole of his money back. with interest. If an individual could rightly make such a claim, then it is) equally right that such a claim should be made on behalf of the Government. 0 member say that the Government issued a writ? first place a writ was issued against the Government by Messrs.

Since we found, that they should not be relieved of their contract, we considered it unnecessary to deal with the question of terms. That the position taken up by us in that regard was correct is shown by the fact that the Government so interpreted our finding as to make a counterclaim for £114,000 against the contractors. It was not until some eighteen months after the issue of our report that Messrs: Kidman and Mayoh made a move. The Government then made a counterclaim, and then followed what is perhaps one 'of the most discreditable features of the whole of this unsavoury business: Instead of having the issues determined by a Court of law, the Government, appointed a secret Commissioner, or, as the Attorney-General prefers to say, an Arbitrator, to deal with the whole matter. decided to go over the heads of the Publio Works Committee, by whose decision the contractors had agreed to abide, why did they order a secret inquiry? When the Public Works Committee weut to Sydney, it found that the rooms usually occupied by it were in the possession of the Arbitrator, Sir Mark Sheldon, who was then conducting his secret inquiry. less than a fortnight he had to be on his ' way to America, so that his inquiry was necessarily hurried. I would like to know what peculiarity attaches to these individuals, Messrs. Kidman and Mayoh, that they should have been accorded the privilege of asecret inquiry-the very thing for which they asked-in order that all the facts which I have attempted this afternoon to lay bare might be hidden from the publio gaze? The inquiry was held iit> camera-the public was not allowed to know what transpired before the Arbitrator.

In recognition, apparently, of their services as good supporters of the Government, they were allowed this secret inquiry, and, later on, Sir Mark Sheldon forwarded his; findings from F i j i to the Cabinet. The Government, as I have said, counter-claimed £114,000. Sir Mark Sheldon awarded them £75,000. I think it would be only fair to add to the sum of £114,000. two years' interest, which would bring the amount up to about £125,000. I believe that any Court of law would have found for the Government for that amount. between the finding of the Arbitrator and the amount claimed by the Government? for two years' intereat, there was a difference of £50,000. In other words, these When the Government good Nationalist supporters received a present of £50,000.

It is one of the most discreditable of which WithinI know in connection with the history of this or any other Government.

Of that, however, I make no complaint, since it is just what we might have expected of him. He concluded his speech with some utterances of a bitterly partisan character. That, also, one would naturally expect of him.' ' I intend to ask the House to consider the actual facts. The honourable member devoted something like nine-tenths of his speech to a condemnation of the contract itself, and of the way in which it was carried out. A t no time has the Government approved of tlie way in which it was carried out. As a matter of fact, it was because the Government realized that the contract was not being properly carried out and consequently took up a firm attitude as to the responsibility of the contractors, that the whole cause of dispute arose. Having been advised that the contract was not being carried out as it should be, the Government resisted the claim of Messrs. Kidman and Mayoh, and when they pressed it was agreed that it broke that Public Works Committee. The honourable member for Hume has referred to the fault y construction of these vessels, and has attempted, wholly without I justification, to saddle the Government with the responsibility. He has been deliberately throwing mud at the Government in the hope that somo of it will stick. f u l statue, if bespattered with mud, would be injured to some extent. This slinging of mud again is what we might naturally expect from the honourable member. It is abundantly clear that there is no justification for his attempt to blame the Government, for what has taken place. They maintained proper supervision over the work. bound to do that. The whole they made f u l l inquiries, and did all that could be expected of them in the discharge of their public duties. A dispute having arisen, Messrs. K i d man and Mayoh wrote to the Governmentresisting their claims under the contract, and a question arose as to how the dispute should be settled. The Prime Minister brought the matter before the House, announced the action which the Government proposed to take, and, by the decision of the House, the question was. referred for inquiry to the Public Works Committee. In a letter addressed to the Prime .Minister's Department by Messrs. Kidman and Mayoh on 30th October, 1920, the following passages appeared:In view of all the circumstances it is desired that the Government would consider some means of relieving us of our contract and considering the question of allowing us some compensation for the work and time which has been expended in a genuine and conscientious effort to meet the country's needs in a time of great distress. . . .

The matter was accordingly referred, by the decision of the House, to the Public Works Committee, and .officers of the Department gave evidence before that Committee. terms of the reference? Prime Minister, the House decidedThat the following matter be referred to the 'Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for investigation and report:-""The advisability of complying with the request of Messrs. Kidman and Mayoh to be relieved of the obligation to complete the contract entered into by them on the 4th August, 1919, to build two wooden vessels for the Commonwealth, and .the conditions upon which such relief, if deemed advisable, should be granted."" Evidence of very discreditable work in connection with the carrying out of the contract was given before the Committee, which found, as set out on page x i i . of its report, that the request of the contractors be not complied with. Where did that finding leave the Government? the question on a previous occasion, the honourable member for Hume assumed that it settled the whole question. .That, however, was not the position. The finding left the Government with this contract still in hand. another findingThat in the opinion of the Committee it is doubtful, even with the expenditure of an unwarrantable sum of money, that the ships could be made seaworthy. Thus the Government had the finding of tiie Committee that the contractors should not be relieved of their contract, and that it was doubtful whether, even with the expenditure of an unwarrantable sum of money, the ships could be made seaworthy.

The honourable member for Hume( Mr Parker Moloney) overlooks the fact that the Committee's finding still lef t undetermined all legal questions as to responsibility and liability. not asked to determine those things. with the Committee; they did all that they were asked to do. But the mover of the amendment has found f a u l t with the Government for sending this question to another tribunal after a report had been made by the Public Works Committee. The answer to the honourable member's complaint is t h a t although the Public Works Committee reported, in accordance with the terms of the reference to it , the legal questions-were still undetermined. Immediately upon the presentation of the Committee's report we cancelled the contract, and notified the contractors of a claim for a refund of the amount to which we thought the Commonwealth was entitled.

Since the session opened the Government have been trying to get on with the public business of the Com.nionwoalth, but week after week we have been obstructed by amendments moved with the deliberate parently, of blocking the conduct of public business. It is about time that such conduct ceased. Address-in-Reply there was opportunity to discuss all grievances relating to administration, . but instead of availing themselves of that, honourable members opposite have held up public business by a series of electioneering amendments, and I have no hesitation in describing the present amendment as another of those political placards designed to serve, not in the House, but in the country. ' It is all very well for the Minisber( Mr .Groom), i u concluding his speech, to say that the amendment is a political "" placard,"" but what the people of the country are concerned about is the unnecessary expenditure from time to time in connection w it h this and other matters. We on this side have raised various questions at times in order to focus public attention on them. Such opportunities as the present are the only ones we have, and I must say that I have never heard related to a Parliament such a state of affairs as in connection with this contract. When I heard the case put before us by the honourable member for Hume( Mr Parker Moloney), the thought struck me that the Government has been recreant to their duty in not taking criminal action against the men responsible for these acts of deception, which might have been the means of losing many lives. not seem to have ever heard of the crime of conspiracy. remember the time when Mr Sam Smith, in the New South Wales Parliament, discussed the subject of unseaworthy ships and the Plimsoll mark; but there has never been a greater scandal in Australia than that associated with the building of these ships by Kidma^i and Mayoh. I action has been taken in the direction of prosecuting these^ people. Narrowed The House down, the case resolves itself into one point. The Government, after they had The contract referred this matter to the Public Works Committee, and after they had received the report-afte r the culprits who were responsible for this fault y building had received £114,000 in progress paymentsdecided, simply because the contractors had the audacity to take action in the intention, apCourts for breach cf contract, to give the matter further consideration. And in giving the matter further consideration, On the niotion for the the Government looked for an easy way out; they did not face the facts, but altogether brushed aside the findings of the Committee. In order to prevent the cost of litigation, or, perhaps, to prevent the consequent exposure of men who are well known in this country, and one at least of whom has big financial interests here, the Government decided to submit the matter to-arbitration. Sir Mark Sheldon was selected as the arbitrator. I do not know whether he took evidence, but certainly, while on a sea voyage, he drafted his report, which simply means relieving these people from the payment of a large sum of money. Contrast this action of the Government with their action in regard to income, tax prosecutions. Where a poor man is concerned, who has been unable to pay his income tax, a prosecution follows, and, no matter what representations may be made as to the disability of the defendant, he is fined, and must pay the fine or go to gaol. It is a very different matter when wealthy people are concerned-peopl e who have a contract w i th the Government, and who build unseaworthy ships. That is a very deliberate statement for me to make, but it is one which I believe to be true. These people ""slummed "" the work ; they did not put in the bolts necessary to make those ships seaworthy. Whereveri n this contract they could save money, they did Government do so; and I remind honourable members that all this happened under the system of contract, about which we hear so much from time to time.

What would the publio know of this matter if it were not brought up in this House? know all about it . about it because the facts have, been placed before us by the honourable member for Hume( Mr Parker Moloney). The object of Uhe Government is to escape as far as possible from criticism, and, at the same time, to make it as easy as possible for certain wealthy people, to also escape. I say with the Postmaster General( Mr Poynton) that, if these men had their dues, they would be committed for trial before a jury, in order to answer for their work. That is the point that the Government have to answer; it is the only point in the indictment. The Minister( Mr Groom) complained that the honourable member for Hume had devoted nine-tenths of ihis speech to details; but when all ie boiled down we come to the fact that, after the question had been submitted to the Public Works Committee, and a report had been presented after a thorough investigation, the Government took no action on that report. We appoint Committees for the purpose of inquiring into matters and affording the Government advice. Public Works Committee find fault with the Government's action? did not. It is the subsequent action of the Government of which I complain. When they got that report, we expected them to take action in accordance with it. were threatened with litigation by Kidman and Mayoh. What about the wool tops case, which is costing the country be paid a large sum of hundreds of thousands of pounds? There was no proposal to submit that case to the arbitration of Sir Mark Sheldon, but, for some reason best known to the Government, it was decided to submit the shipbuilding contract to that gentleman, who brought in a report which is favorable to Kidman and Mayoh. not think so! Mayoh may shake hands with themselves for getting out of this business in such an easy way. I venture to say that they never expected such a result, and I would like to know what put it'into their heads to take action. Of course, it is quite possible that they did not intend to go on with the action; there are many ways in which one can be extracted from an awkward position, and, probably, a threat of an appeal to the Courts is one. Instead of permitting these claimants to go on with their case, the Government decided to submit tb© inatter to arbitration, although they had agreed to abide by the decision of the Public Works Committee. As I say, Sir Mark Sheldon's report is more favorable to Kidman and Mayoh than, any result they could have hoped for in a Court of law. Had the case gone to Court, the country would have rung from end to end with the disclosures made. been no more disclosures than there were when the evidence was being taken by the Committee.

An explanation of the kind cannot be made in the middle of another honourable member's speech. to your ruling ber cannot discuss m y ruling. your ruling, but ber is out of order. for Wilmot ( Mr Atkinson) has called honourable members on this side of the House"" dingoes."" an expression, b u t if the honourable member for Wilmot used it I ask him to withdraw it . honourable "" d in g o e s "" ; I said they were behaving in an unfair way in trying to howl me down, "" like a lot of dingoes."" member for Wilmot did make such a statement by way of interjection, he was doubly out of order, and I ask him to apologize to the House for having done so. last week to draw the attention of honourable members to the inconvenience that arose, not only to the House, but to the member addressing the Chair, and also to tbe members of the Hansard staff, from interjections and .cross-interjections. I then appealed to honourable members to refrain from interjections, especially'such as are certain to lead to counter inter-, jection, and I again ask honourable members on both sides of the House to desist from interjecting. Mr CH ARLTON tion to delay this matter, but I assert again that the Government are deserving of censure for their attitude upon this question subsequent to the submission of the report of the Publio Works Committee in coming to terms with Messrs. Kidman and Mayoh, by which the firm was enabled to draw a large sum of money from the Commonwealth instead of refunding what it had already received in the shape of progress payments. The 'Attorney-General complains that honourable members on this side of the. House are constantly endeavouring to bespatter the Government w i th mud for political purposes. My reply is that it is the duty of an Opposition to expose such happenings as this, so that the public may be in a position to realize that the adminisI n a l l due deference tration of the affairs of the country is not in the best interests of the people. Honourable members are sent to this House to protect those interests and safeguard I aim not questioning the public purse, and to assist in effecting legitimate economies. They are not justified in countenancing any waste of public <money. Sincei t has been shown clearly, time after time, that the best interests of the people have not been conserved by the present Government, Ministers cannot complain of the attitude taken up by the I did not hear such Opposition. Rather should tbey take steps to p u t matters in proper order and avoid rendering themselves open to attack. It is idle for the Attorney-General to I d id not say that Bay that if one throws sufficient mud some members opposite were of it may stick. We have heard that remark frequently in this Chamber; b u t , unfortunately, there are so many big questions affecting the national life of If the honourable Australia in which the Government have done wrong, and in which they are continuing to do wrong, that the public outside are beginning to form an opinion in regard to their qualifications to ' remain in office. For this I had occasion only the Government have' only themselves to blame. During the last seven or eight weeks it has been shown that in almost everything Ministers have' touched there has been a screw loose, and that the affairs of the country have not been conducted as they should be; and since it is the duty of honourable members to give the fullest publicity to this, the Opposition will exercise its right, every time the opportunity presents itself, to expose the Government's incapacity. The mistakes committed cannot be glozed over. TheyI t is not my intenmust be laid bare to the light of public criticism. The public must be placed in a position of being able to judge whether there is "" m u d t h r o w in g"" or not. The people will be the masters of the situation in the very near future. A t the very latest we must appeal to them withi n the next few months. Statements are in circulation that a general election -is desirable immediately. If the Government are so secure in the belief that they are. legislating in the interests of the people they should be prepared to go to an election, as they will be bound",26,Ployment Of Dismissed Railway

126,Mr Speaker,"to do if any of the motions now being launched against them find acceptance by a majority of honourable members. Surely they are not afraid of the political atmosphere outside ? Surely they are not afraid to allow the people to have a voice in clearing up these matters which are constantly being brought forward? Honourable members of the Opposition are prepared at any moment to allow the people outside to decide these issues. The administration of afiairs in the last couple of years has been so disastrous to the welfare of the people that we are hopeful that the amendment submitted to-day will be carried, because it w ill give the I could not remain. The members of the public outside the opportunity of expressing their approval, or otherwise, of the present Government. If the people choose to return the Government to power once more, thus expressing approval of the Government's administration, it is their affair; they w ill have been given the opportunity of expressing an opinion. I venture to predict that this Parliament will run to its f u l l term if the Government can bring that about; but if honourable members would only vote in this House as they speak outside, instead allegiance to party to vote against their consciences, this House would' be meeting the people within the next few weeks. During the last few days we have seen the spectacle of honourable members expressing an opinion outside, and four of them being taken to task in grand council upstairs and whipped in , two of them to vote against their previous votes, and the oth«r two to vote against their own consciences, because their votes, if cast against the Ministry, would have meant its defeat at a time when the political atmosphere outside' is unsatisfactory to the Government. T4.421 -This matter has been handled very ably by the. honourable member for Hume( Mr Parker Moloney), who is, like myself, a member of the Public Works. Committee. He has treated the Government very severely, but I always prefer to deal with matters dispassionately. I wish to say that the Government cannot leave the question at the point where it was l e f t by the Attorney General. They must supply more information. They were too long in acting after thePublio Works Committee brought in their most emphatic report, which was sumcient to show even to a layman that Messrs. Kidman and Mayoh had not a nail on which to hang a hat, the case being so strong against them. Yet the Government allowed ten months to elapse before they took any further step in the matter, and then only when Messrs. Kidman and Mayoh issued a writ. They appointed Sir Mark Sheldon to arbitrate. My strongest objection to the arbitration proceedings conducted by that gentleman was the fact that they were held in secret. I walked into the inquiry and sat down, but was told that press, who had already been excluded,, iaughed at my discomfiture. There was no one present at the inquiry but Sir Mark Sheldon, the witnesses, and the lawyers on each side. I want to know the items of the claim submitted by Messrs. Kidman and Mayoh. The firm could not but at the same time have gone into a Court of law with simply a bald claim for £80,000. They must have itemized their claim. Then, again, the Government must have itemized their counter-claim for £114,000. The Attorney-General has told us that Sir Mark Sheldon's award was that the Government should be paid £ 7 5 , 0 0 0; but of being flogged by I want to know what items in the Government's claim were allowed. The Government had already paid Messrs. K i d man and Mayoh, not only £114,000 in progress payments, but also a further sum of £52,000, although there was no claim made by them for the repayment of the latter sum. D i d the Government itemize their counter-claim ? Mark Sheldon base his award of £75,000 ? I wish to know, g i r Mark Sheldon acted in the capacity of a Judge, and, surely, he ought to have said why he only allowed the Government' £75,000. U n fortunately, the member of the Government who was responsible for shipbuilding at the time is no longer in charge of it ; but I am sure that the present Minister for Works and Bailways( Mr Eichard Foster) would not have left the matter where it is if he had been in charge of the business. Surely honourable members on the Government' side of the H.ouse are prepared to ask the Government why only £75,000 out of £114,000 was awarded to the Government.

The Publio Works Committee recognised that if they had had to deal with the financial aspect of the question they would have been obliged to go into the matter in every detail, and Sir Mark Sheldon, -in conducting his inquiry, was in exactly the same position as the Committee. He should have explained his reasons for awarding £75,000, just, as the Public Works Committee would. have been obliged to do if it had given a similar finding. really in the position of a Supreme Court Judge. have said why he gave a certain verdict.

As a member of the Public Works Committee I went through the whole of the inquiry into the shipbuilding contracts, and I am surprised at the way in which the whole matter has terminated. However, I claim that it would only be doing justice to the people of Australia for the Government to supply further information as to why they should get not more than £75,000.'

The honourable member for Hume( Mr. Parker Moloney) reckoned, no doubt, that he had secured an opportunity to make a sensationl display. He has cen-sured the Government for having taken the whole subject-matter out of the purview of the Courts and handed it over to Sir Mark Sheldon for arbitration. If the contractors had beeu taken into the Courts, the best the Commonwealth could have hoped for would have been to secure a verdict for £114,000. I do not know whether the Government acted on the advice of counsel, or what may have in fluenced them; but they decided to call in Sir Mark Sheldon as arbitrator. He has arbitrated, and has given the Commonwealth what amounts to a verdict for .. ..20 £75,000. Knowing, as I do, how un.. . . 41 certain is the law, I cannot see that the Government have come out at all badly. 21 The (honourable member for Hume appears to have lost his sense of proportion.

136,Mr Atkinson (Wilmot ) [4.561,"the Public Works Committee, cancelled the contract. Despite that, the honourable member for Hume has come here to-day with a time-wasting proposition, and has sought merely to "" spread "" himself. I repeat that the Government are not to blame. ( Mr Charlton) has lately done himself an injustice on several occasions. cidentally, he misrepresented my position for the consideration of the motion has expired. I understand, sir, that you have announced, on the basis of the Standing Orders, 'that the time for the consideration of the motion has expired. I take it that you so rule understanding order 119, which statesIf all motions shall not have been disposed of unless otherwise ordered, the discussion two hours after the time fixed for the meeting of the House, the debate thereon shall be interrupted, and unless thc House otherwise order, the Orders of the Day shall be taken in rotation; but if there .should be no Order of the Day, the discussion on -motions may be continued. The consideration of motions may be resumed after the Orders of the Day are disposed -of. I submit that that plainly refers to matters which do not appear on the business-paper as Orders of the Day. If your ruling is correct, namely, that after two hours' debate an Order of the Day expires, then I hold that the motion 'for Supply must be discharged. It is Order of the Day No. 1, which is set down as "" Supply-furthe r consideration in Committee."" If that Order of the-Day is discharged because an amendment attached to it can be no further debated, owing to the effluxion of time-and the amendment of the honourable member for Hume( Mr Parker Moloney) is a direct amendment to a directGovernmenb motion-then , I take it , the matter of Supply cannot now be proceeded witb. I do not want that to be brought about; I desire that Supply shall be granted to-day. If your ruling is upheld, I submit that the House cannot proceed to go into Committee upon Supply -called on. son) -There appears to be some misapprehension regarding the position. The matter of going into Committee of Supply is not prejudiced in any way in consequence of failure of the-House to give any direction concerning the Governor General's message. I have announced its receipt, .and read it to the House, which is at liberty, if it so chooses, to go into Committee of Supply without any niotion being submitted. I point out The Leader of the Opposition that the Orders of the Day have not yet been called upon. The Inreceipt of a message from His Excellency the Governor General is usually followed by a formal motion which, however, is I rise to order. not generally moved by a Minister, but is The time put direct from the Chair. In the present instance an amendment has been moved, not to an Order of the Day, but to a forma l motion stated from the Chair for reference to the Committee for its consideration. The Committee is at liberty to consider it without any motion, but as a matter of courtesy a motion is made, and, unless something is done with it before ihe expiration of two hours, or on both must be interrupted, and I am bound to call on the Orders of the Day. Eveni f the motion were a Government niotion it would make no difference. The standing order does not differentiate between Government and private motions. I have in my marginal notes to the Standing Orders several references to this point, which has been raised on previous occasions. There are two in particular to which I draw the attention of honourable members. One is that, on 7th November, 1913, a motion of no confidence was interrupted at the expiration of two hours, and another refers to a motion which had been moved by a Minister (the Honourable K in g O'Malley), having to' do with the re-arrangement of the electoral divisions of Queensland, which was similarly interrupted by the expiration of tihe two-hour limit . I have no option now but to call on the Orders of the Dav, not only in accordance with the Standing Orders, but in keeping w i th the usual practice of the House.

141,Mr Bruce (Flinders,"Treasurer )When I introduced the first Supply Bill this session, I informed the Committee that I hoped the Budget statement would be presented before the Government again sought Supply. However, owing to the fact that Supply must be obtained before Friday next, on which date the fortnightly pay of the Public Service is to ba disbursed, it will be impossible for me to realize that hope. The Government have decided, therefore, to ask for Supply for one month. The Budget statement will be made to-morrow, and when they have heard it honourable members will be enabled to judge the position more closely than is possible at present. In the first Supply Bill for the present financial year we asked for £2,481,850. amount for which we ask in this Supply Bill is £1,763,025. Honourable members will see that the Bill is divided into three parts. The first deals with the ordinary £1,363,025; the second, with refunds of revenue, £100,000; and the third with "" Advance to. the Treasurer,"" £300,000. The Supply for which we ask makes no provision for expenditure of an extraordinary or. novel character, and is on the basis of one-twelfth of last year's Estimates. The total of the ordinary votes for that year was £24,715,282. Included in that amount, however, was a sum payable, under the funding arrangement, in respect of the debt that we owed to the Government of .the United That payment is. now provided for by a special appropriation, and so has to be excluded from the figures with respect to the present year. Deducting it, the total sum voted in respect of last year was £19,166,467, and one-twelfth of that amount is £1,597;206. stance £1,363,025 or about £234,181 less than onetwelfth of the amount voted on last year's Estimates. These figures-will'show honourable members that the amount for which we are asking is the minimum necessary for the ordinary services of the Commonwealth for one 'month. to the other two' item's, I would point out that funds for £100,000, whereas under the last Supply. Bill the amount voted was. £170,000. This item is to provide for repayments of revenue which have.been received in excess of the payments that were Mr Bruce. due. The reason it is smaller on this occasion is that during the month of July heavy .refunds of income tax have generally to be made. We do not anticipate that the same amount will be required in the month covered by this Bill. The Treasurer's Advance for which we are asking is £300,000. In the first Supply Bill for 1922-23, the Treasurer's Advance was £750,000. The position in regard to that item is that for the month of July we absorbed only £550,000 of the £750,000 that we expected to be called upon to pay. That means that we have £200,000 in hand. We are now asking for an additional £300,000, making the total for the month, £500,000. The With regard to the Treasurer's Advance, I would point out to honourable members that, apart from certain advances which are being made to the Department of the Postmaster-General, as service®, amounting to part of the scheme which will be outlined to-morrow to honourable members, there are no payments 'being made other than in relation to matters which have already been approved by Parliament. There is nothing else with which I think . it is necessary to deal. The Supply for which we are asking is foe one month, and it is on a lower basis than the Estimates of last year. It is a well-established rule of parliamentary procedure that Supply shall not Kingdom. be .grauted until grievances are redressed. There are many grievances which need to be redressed. . Amongst these is the fact that it is impossible in this Chamber to secure the proper elucidation of public questions if the Government makes up its mind to-use a brutal In this inmajority to prevent it. I.take this opporwe are asking for only tunity of bringing before the Committee for ordinary services, certain information, which, in the shape of sworn statutory declaration, came into my possession on Thursday afternoon last regarding certain of the sugar, purchases of the Commonwealth, but which, owing to the application of the "" gag,"" I was unable to set .before honourable members As last Friday.

From information which I have obtained from the Department of Trade and Customs, as well as from information given by Ministers on Friday, I have been able to confirm, to a large extent, the statements made in the sworn declarationto whicff I referred at the outset of my speech. I find that in certain eases the business ofpurchasing sugar did not go through the ordinary recognised channels. Three orders-^n e for 1,000 tons of white, at £72 12s. 6d. per ton f.o.b.; one for 5,000 tons, at 42 florins 60 cents per picul, f.o.b., on 11th November, 1920; and one for 10,000 tons of white, at 54s. per cwt., are stated to have been pur chased from James Nash, through Colonel Oldershaw. There should be the closest investigation of this departure from the ordinary safeguards which should have been exercised by the Government in the expenditure of huge sums of money. On 3rd instant I put on the notice-paper the following questions to the Minister for Trade and Customs:1. What quantities of sugar were purchased by the Government in Java in 1918, 1919, 1920, and 1921 respectively? 2. What are the names of the brokers or agents acting on behalf of the Commonwealth in each case? 3. What commission was paid to each broker in each case? 4. Tf no brokers wore employed, from whom was the sugar purchased? 5. What price per ton f.o.b. and ci.f. respectively was paid for each purchase? 0. To whom were the payments made? 7. What was the date of each purchase and the date of each payment? 8. Will the Minister lay upon the table of the House(a) All documents and correspondence relating to each of the above-mentioned purchases?

Instead of purchasing through the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, who were the Commonwealth agents in all. other purchases, I find that during the month of May, 1920, Mr W. E. Davies, who was engaged in the motor trade, and had not hitherto, any experience of importing sugar, was able to state that he was in a position to influence the business. He called upon Mr Ben. J. Lee, of Melbourne, who wastrading with Java, and informed him that the Government would, in the immediate future, be purchasing large quantities of sugar, and that he (Davies) was in a position to influence the business. He suggested that Lee should enter into an arrangement to make Davies his agent. Before entering into any arrangement Iiee asked Davies that the statement that the business was in Davies' hands should be confirmed directly to Lee by the Depart-, ment. Davies accordingly took Lee to Mr Deane, where Lee was informed that Davies would be given an opportunity of. quoting for the business, and that if the price was right there was no reason why they should not do business. An arrange-, merit was then entered into between Lee set out in and Davies that Lee should pay to Davies half the profits resulting from the sale of",32,Pairs

In stead of carrying out his arrangement with Leo, however, Davies purchased sugar ""from James Nash, of Sourabaya, and the three above-mentioned eales went through at '72s. 7$d. per cwt., 42 florins 60 cents per pieul, and 54s. per cwt. respectively. Davies went to Java, and during the time he was there he is stated to have collected as part of his profits on the transaction at least £30,000. Upon hie Teturn to Melbourne at the end of December, 1920, disputes arose between Lee and Davies on account of the latter having effected, purchases through Nash. the honourable member is reading? tion of a statutory declaration. A settlement was made between Lee and Davies after an interview they both had with Mr and writings held by me referring to the dealDeane, of the Prime"" Minister's Department. That interview took place early in 1921, and Lee states that as a result of the conversation at that interview Mr person or persons, or referring to any business Deane became aware that Lee had offered to supply sugar through Davies at a lower price than that paid by the Commonwealth to Nash on the same date and times that Nash supplied it. One of the terms of the settlement was that Lee was to receive £1,000 compensation out of the profits made by Davies, and a further term was that Lee should secure further orders for the supply of sugar through Davies from the Oommonwealth Goveniment. Davies was actually given orders up to as late a date as 8th February, 1921, although they were subsequently cancelled. On 29th January, 1921, when writing to Nash, Davies expressed regret tliat Mr the sugar market was in a more convulsed Deane had been drafted into another Department, and that the Sugar Board was now in control of a'll buying, and that all he could do was to place quotations before the chairman of that Board. Later, in November, 1921, Lee, having found out that Davies-had supplied the Commonwealth with larger quantities of sugar than were represented by Davies at the time of the first settlement when he paid . Lee £1,000, made a further claim for a share of Davies' profits. Davies then entered into an agreement with him, the original of which I have in my possession. ' Under this agreement Davies paid Lee a further £1,500 as compensation, making a total of £2,500, and Lee covenanted forthwith to hand over to the said Wm. Edward Davies all documents, agreements, papers, and writings, including copy documents, agreements, papers, and writings relating to or in any wise connected with dealings in connection with any business transactions or otherwise in which he, the said Benjamin Joseph Lee, and William Edward Davies, are, or were, in any wise interested, and all his right, title, estate, and interest in and to the same. member expect me to follow allthis statement when he is gabbling it at such a rapid rate?

Why was Davies placed in -A position to influence business through the Prime Minister's Department? Why were the documents and correspondence to remain private ? Why did the Government pay Nash £72 12s. 6d. f.o.b. for sugar on 13th September, 1920, when on the same date they only paid Maelaine, Watson& Co. £71 f.o.b.?

I am not making a charge of fraud against anybody, but I do say that these matters require explanation. They call for an instant reply from the Government, and for the placing of all the cards on the table. That is especially so in connection with the brokerage on the sugar purchases, so that we may be able to judge from the complete facts what the true position is. We find that Lee, who did not buy one pound of sugar for the Commonwealth, was given £2,500 by Davies. What for?

The position is just the opposite. The right honourable gentleman goes, up and down Australia as the protagonist of a White Australia, but what does he do for the white sugar-growers of Queensland? In 1918 he insisted that they should work for a price per ton which was practically the same as the world's arity, but he did not give them the enefit of the £6 per ton duty in the price of the commodity, although it was the declared policy of this Parliament and of the nation that the industry should get that advantage. 1918. On the 19th April of that year a deputation of cane-growers came down to ask the Prime Minister* to increase the price of raw sugar from £21 to £24 per ton, and because the Prime Minister had very little time for thedepiitation, and sent them away empty, there were 25,000 acres planted in that year less than in the previous year. Again, it was because the Government was not willing, for political reasons, as I have heard one of their protagonists say in this Federal Parliament, to give the sugar-growers as fair a deal as they were entitled to, taking into consideration the fact that we had always protected them to the extent of £6 a ton against black grown sugar, that we had to pay such a high price for foreign sugar in 1919 and 1920, and were led into these excessive purchases overseas. The question now is: What is the proper policy to follow in connection with the present price of sugar? Minister for Trade and Customs made his statement in this House that the price of sugar was to be reduced to 5d. per lb. on the 1st November next those people engaged in the fruit preserving and jammaking industries have been finding it an extremely difficult matter to get a f u l l complement of orders. of manufacturers have told me that they will soon find it hard to finance their operations, because every grocer is endeavouring to carry as little stock as possible for fear that on the 1st November he will be caught with a bigger stock of preserved fruit and jams than he can sell at a price which/will give him a fair profit. The proper policy for the Government to have followed was to have done exactly what was done when the price of sugar was raised-that is to say, to leave any alteration in price at the nearest possible time, either forthwith or next day, to the decision of Parliament. a standing agreement for three years.' to which the honourable member refers does not affect the question of whether the retail price of sugar should be 5d. or 6d. per lb. The Prime Minister occupied two hours last week in an endeavour to explain to honourable members that the Government could afford to sell at 5d. per lb. without. interfering with the sugar agreement. I am prepared to accept, at their face value, the figures of the right honourable gentleman demonstrating that the Government can sell at 5d. per lb. It is some concession, because I believe it would be possible to sell at less than 5d. per lb. without loss to the Government. The honourable member for Wide Bay contends that retail sugar cannot be reduced in price because of the agreement with the growers and millers. point. We have never heard from the Government any proper discrimination between the agreement with the millers and growers to pay them £30 6s. 8d. per ton, which is the only agreement of which the House has cognisance, and a second agreement which the Government has made with other people, and under which it is selling sugar at £56 per ton.' ThatSince the second agreement with which we have had very little to do was arranged by the Government quite independently of Parliament, and I would like to know what its terms are, and whether it is possible under it to alter the retailers' and wholesalers' profits at a month's, or six months', notice. We have not .been told this, and Quite a number we are entitled to be told it.

Leaving aside irrelevant, immaterial, and trivial matters, the honourable member has levelled a most serious charge, amounting to corruption, against some person or persons whom the honourable member has not mustered up sufficient courage to indicate. He has spoken of a Mr Davies and of a Mr Lee, two gentlemen who were intimate friends-in fact, partners-bu t who have apparently qiiarrelled. But he has not ventured tp directly connect these gentlemen's private quarrels with any member of the Government or public official. honourable member's curtain of words, he has tried to create an impression in the minds of honourable members and of our fellow citizens that there is corruption somewhere, if not in the Government, at any rate in the Government Departments. The honourable member demands an inquiry. No ordinary inquiry will satisfy him. He wants one in which summary justice' shall be done. He wants a detailed investigation-ever y step in these most complex and numerous transactions must be probed to the bottom; but justice must be done without a day's delay. The honourable member says that, even if he stands alone, he proposes to fight for justice. I shall not insult Justice by supposing that, after all these years of civilization, she is in such a poor and forlorn state as to depend upon the exertions of the honourable member. The honourable member has insinuated that there has been corruption. We are entitled to be told plainly who is' the guilty person. I ask the honourable member to have courage, and say what he means. If he means that there is some man in the Government, or in tbe employment of the Government, directly or indirectly, guilty of corruption, let him give the name of the man, that the Government and the Parliament may take action. To make charges which stop short of naming the accused is an act discreditable to his honour and our intelligence. Let us examine the transactions to which the honourable member has referred. He is insatiable in his demand for information. He complains that information has been withheld. He would have us believe that if this be supplied he would be satisfied. But no information, no matter how detailed or how complete, will satisfy him. It is not information he desires, but opportunity to defame and denounce the Government. The honourable member is best satisfied by finding himself in the position of being able to demand more and more, and still more. The Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Rodgers)' supplied him with a list setting out in detail the particulars of every purchase overseas from 1915 to 1920, giving the date upon which each purchase was made, the vendor, the country of origin, the quantity, the quality, the price, the invoice dates when shipped, and the ships on which each purchase arrived. One Behind the would imagine that these particulars supplied a full and complete return. Indeed, with a parliamentary experience extending over more than a quarter of a century, I say that the information supplied by my honourable colleague is a more complete return of Government transactions than I have ever known to be issued. My colleague has told the honourable member that the Auditor-General, whom, he has not yet charged with corruption, or with being a party to this conspiracy, if there be conspiracy, is preparing a detailed",38,Chairman Hon J M Which Has Had I T In The Past For The

I point out that he has stopped short in these revelations with which he has sought to make our blood freeze in our veins. He has stopped short of saying that such-and-such a person, or such-and-such a member of the Government, or such-and-such an officer in the employ of this Government or of any previous Government, has been guilty of corruption or improper practice. But the honourable member has sought to create an impression that there has been improper practice and corruption. into the matter closely. He has referred to three transactions. bered upon the return, which has been made available to honourable members, under the heading of "" Commonwealth Government Sugar Control-Contracts for Foreign Raw Sugar purchased on account of the Commonwealth Government."" I do not wish to misquote the honourable member. I did not catch the particulars of the statutory declaration which he presented; and I must be permitted a later opportunity to peruse the document from which he quoted. I shall not deal with it at this stage, but will ask honourable members to peruse the particulars contained in the statement information later. I am going to show of foreign purchases. I call attention first to item No. 61. In this instance the occurred. On 7th August, 1920, Colonel contract date is 15th September,1920; the vendor is John Nash; the country of origin Java; the quantity of sugar 1,000 tons; the quality "" whites""; the price per ton £72 12s. 6d..f.o.b.; the invoice date Sth October; the ship the Phranang, and the quantity invoiced 1,000 tons. The next item, No. 62, bears for its contract date the 1st October, 1920. vendor is again John Nash; Java the country of origin; the quantity, 5,000 tons;the quality ""whites""; the price per ton set out as Fl., 42.60 p. picul, or £63 10s. per ton f.o.b. voice dates are 9th November, 17th November, and 16th November, and the ships respectively are Nichiya Maru, Eoutman, and Canton Maru, and. the quantity invoiced respectively on those three vessels is 4,000 tons, 92 tons, and 908 tons. I next call attention to -item 66, the contract date of which is 18th October, and John Nash is again the vendor; the country of origin is Java, and the quantity of sugar 10,000 tons;"" With that I hope the the quality ""whites""; the price per ton is £54 f.o.b., and the invoice dates 9 th, 17 th, and 15th November, and 1st, 20th, and 5th December; the ships are, respectively, Nichiyo Maru, Homtman, Canton Maru, Malayan, Djebres, and Kenkon Maru; the quantities invoiced respectively upon those vessels are 1,086 tons, 408 tons, 2,000 tons, 600 tons, 2,742 tons, 3,167 tons, making a total of 10,003 tons. These are the three transactions to which the honourable member referred. It is in connection with them that the honourable member has Let us look levelled the charge of corruption by some person or persons whom' the honourable They are nummember has not had the courage to name. ' It is alleged that the Government are censurable because, at a time when-to quote the honourable member's words as nearly ' as I can remember them-the market was subject to violent fluctuations, we placed orders with one who was not, through long training, an expert in the business. About that I can say nothing. I have not had time to acquaint myself with the reasons why an order was placed with Davies any more than with any other person; but the Government will endeavour to supply the now what actually took place, and how it Oldershaw wrote me as follows: My Dear Prime Minister. P«ro7w.se of Foreign Sugar. The Colonial Sugar Kefining Company arc very insistent that if we do not purchase 50,000 to 60^000 tons of foreign sugar from Java and/or Formosa, immediately we may not be able to obtain tbe sugar at all later on, as The the stocks of sugar in tlie world are very short. Java or Formosa sugars are much stronger and better than Cuba, and worth £6 or £7 more per ton; so that in buying Cuba at, say £75 c.i.f., and Java or Formosa a,t £85, it is really only an increase in price of, say, £3 per ton. The inThe Queensland sugar will be refined principally at Brisbane and Sydney, and a smaller quantity sent to Melbourne and Adelaide,, because foreign sugar can be brought to Melbourne and Adelaide at cheaper freight, and sugar for the two latter refineries must bo here by 1st December. I strongly urge that approval be given to further purchases without delay; 15,000 tons of Cubas have been purchased, and approval has been given for a further 10,000 tons; but the Sugar Company consider it better to wait a little before purchasing further Cubas,, and, as stated, they are extremely insistent that -Java or Formosa sugar should he purchased at once up to, say, 60,000 tons. The letter clearly sets out the views, uot of a motor-car driver or of any other of the honourable member's friends, but of the Colonial Sugar' Refining Companya firm which knows its business. The company stated in plain and precise terms that unless we purchased between 50,000 and 60,000 tons from Java and/or Formosa immediately we should not be able to get any sugar at all. The Colonial Sugar Refining Company was insistent that we should buy, and that it would be better for us to purchase Java and/or Formosa sugars at £S5 per ton than Cubas at £75.

It was recommended by Colonel Oldershaw, acting upon the advice of the Colonial Sugar Kefining Company, and On the Sth September was approved by the Minister( Mr Greene) and myself. It passed through the usual channels. Colonel Oldershaw was in daily communication with the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. The price, the quality, the vendor, the agent This for the vendor, all were known to, and approved by, Colonel Oldershaw. The authority to purchase was given by the Minister for Trade and Customs aud myself. It has been freely stated that, for all practical imrposes, Colonel Oldershaw was the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. That is -not On 13th September the true; but he was in the closest possible touch with the company.

I trust the above will receive your prompt and favorable consideration, as the cable intimates that this price is the lowest that has been offered for some considerable time, consequently they cannot hold the offer open longer than above mentioned. On 27th September the Minister, dealing with Mr Davies' offer of even date, telegraphed Colonel Oldershaw at the office of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, Sydney, as follows:Following offer received white sugar:"" 1,000 to 5,000 tons No. 25 superior white sugar at £64 10s. per ton f.o.b.

Reply as soon as possible. To that Colonel Oldershaw replied by telegram as follows:In reply to your telegram, sugar company, in view of large fruit crop, favour purchase 5,000 tons Java whites at £64 10s. f.o.b., provided this is fixed price, and any variation in exchange is at seller's risk. Following upon that, Mr Oakley wrote, on 29th September, to the Secretary of my DepartmentSecretary, Prime Minister's Department,My Minister would be glad to receive consent of the Prime Minister to the purchase of this 5,000 tons of white sugar at £63 10s. per ton f.o.b.

Here, then, we have, in sequence, the documents which set out in full detail the that Mr Davies is, or was, the Melbourne agent of John Nash, a very well-known and reputable merchantof Sourabaya, and he was, therefore, making an offer on that this purchase of 5,000 tons, and that of the 1,000 tons with which I have dealt, were part of that 60,000 tons which the Colonial Sugar Refining Company said were immediately required, and that there was no certainty that the market would improve, but there was a possibility that it would harden, and that we could not afford to take the risk. Subsequent to the insistent advice of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company to buy large quantities of sugar, irrespective of price, the representatives of the fruit industry waited upon the Minister, and pointed out that the fruit season was coming on-, and that it was imperative that an adequate supply of sugar should be provided. When, therefore, Mr Davies; on behalf of John Nash, of Sourabaya, submitted .a firm offer to supply 5,000 tons of Java whites at £63 10s. f.o.b., the Minister telegraphed immediately to Colonel Oldershaw, who was in the Sydney office of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, to consult the company as to whether the Commonwealth should buy the shipment, and at that price. Colonel Oldershaw consulted the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, not a motor-tyre manufacturer, and the company advised us to buy the parcel of Java whites at £63 10s., taking the precaution that the price should be fixed, and pot be affected by fluctuations of exchange; that was the only reservation the company made. Immediately, the permanent head of the Trade and Customs Department communicated with me, and I , without delay, gave my approval of the purchase.

I do not know Mr Davies, but I promised to make some inquiries regarding him, and I find that he is the agent for a reputable and established firm in Sourabaya, the name of which was satisfactory to the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. I come now to the third purchase of 10,000 tons. * On the 8th October Mr Davies wrote to the Trade and Customs Department, offering to sell 10,000 tons of No. 25 Java whites, at £ 5 4 f.o.b. Sourabaya, November-December shipment. On the same date Colonel Oldershaw wrote to Mr Davies.as follows: With reference to your letter of this date, , addressed to the Hon.

Nash, of Sourabaya:"" The Commonwealth Government will buy up to 10,000 tons No. 25 Java whites, £54 .f.o.b. Sourabaya, November-December shipment, but will arrange earliest possible shipment."" That transaction was carried through on the advice and through the agency of Colonel Oldershaw, who was in daily, and almost hourly,touch with the Colonial Sugar Refining Company; indeed, he spent much of his time in the offices of the company. I shall now set out the details of this transaction. I ask honourable members to follow me, because, ried through in the ordinary way, the innuendo behind the statements of the honourable member for Cowper omission from other . copies is a is such that it is only proper that the country should know what value is to be attached to anything the honourable member says."" I have in my hand a memorandum prepared by Colonel Oldershaw for the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Massy Greene)'. It is dated 8th October, 1920, and the hour is stated as noon. There is nothing vague about that. It saysI have now given a Mr Cerutty, Secretary to the Treasury, asked me .to see him, and in his room I found Mr Heathershaw, Mr Percy Whitton, and I ask honourable Mr W. B. Davies, of 533 Collins-street. Mr Whitton handed me a letter, dated Sth October, from Mr Davies, addressed to the Hon. W. Massy Greene, with regard to an offer of 5,000 to 10,000 tons of No. 25 superior white Java sugar, at £56 per ton, f.o.b. Sourabaya. I pointed out that Mr Davies' letter stated ""prompt shipment,"" and that the CommonThe wealth Government would not buy for prompt shipment, as steamers may not be available so early-it must, be for November-December shipment. At the same time, every effort will be made to ship the' sugar at the earliest possible moment. Mr Whitton suggested that Mr Davies and myself should proceed with him to Parliament House to interview the Hon. W. Massy Greene, which we did. Mr Greene said he was anxious to buy a large parcel of Java whites, so as to overcome the shortage of refined sugar, and he considered that this parcel offered by Mr Davies should be purchased for £54. I said I would. so inform Mr Davies that he had authority to offer f54 for November-December shipment. Mr Davies came back with me to my ollice, aud I gave him a rough memorandum, reading as follows, as a draft cablegram for him to send to his principals, Messrs. Nash, of Sourabaya:Commonwealth Government will buy up to 10,000 tons No. 25 Java whites, at £54, f.o.b.. Sourabaya, November-December shipment, . but will arrange earliest possible shipment. Mr Davies said lie would at once go to his office and send a cable in the above terms to Nash, of Sourabaya. 4.30 p.m. Saw Hon. W. Massy Greene 'and Mr Whitton at Customs-office., and telephoned to Mr W. E. Davies from there. Davies stated he could definitely close the business for the purchase of 10,000 tons, at £54, if we cabled to our bankers in Sourabaya guaranteeing that when the sugar was purchased a letter of credit would be made available to pay for same. I told him to send a cable on those terms, and I would arrange with the Treasury to have the cable sent regarding guaranteeing.",43,Sefteubek Shipment Per Steamer

Whatever else it lacks this memorandum of Colonel Oldershaw i's certainly f u l l of circumstantial detail. That closes my account of the transaction to which the honourable member has alluded.

We acted on the advice of the company righ t through. the agent through whom all these purchases were made. that we sought, and the advice which he gave was obtained by him from the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. The relation between Colonel Oldershaw and the Colonial Sugar Refining Company was constant and obvious. Now let me set out, by way of summary, the salient features of these three transactionsOn 7th August Colonel Oldershaw recommended the immediate purchase of up to 60,000 tons of Java or Formosa sugar, stating, ""We may not be able to obtain the sugar at all later on, as the stocks of sugar in the world are very short."" This is an excerpt from a letter from the Colonial' (Sugar Refining Mr Eughes. either myself or the Ministerf or Trade and Customs. Tlie Prime Minister approved, minuting the fore action is taken."" Both the Minister and myself minuted this paper, and one or other, and generally both, minuted every other paper relating to the purchase of sugar. Mr Greene saw the papers, and on 10th August, 1920, approved. Colonel Oldershaw proceeded to place orders accordingly On 7th September, 1920, W, B. Davies, broker, wrote as follows:On 23rd ult. I receiyed instructions from Colonel Oldershaw to obtain a firm offer for 1,000 tons No. 25 superior .white quality Java sugar. . . . He then quoted 1,000 tons, at £73 9s. per ton. This price was accepted by Mr Massy Greene and the Prime Minister, and the order passed out for execution.

On 8th October, 1920,i Davies again wrote direct to Mr Massy Greene, offering from 5,000 to 10,000 tons of Java sugar, at £56 per ton. Mr Cerutty, Acting Secretary to the Treasury, with Mr Heathershaw, Mr Whitton, and Colonel Oldershaw, discussed the offer at We have not gone to the Treasury on the same day. Mr Whitton suggested that Davies and Oldershaw should proceed to Parliament House and interview Mr Greene. This was done. Mr Greene said he was anxious to buy a large parcel of Java, Colonel Oldershaw was sugar, and he considered Davies' offer should be accepted-bu t et £54.

Regarding the first transaction, 1,000 tons of sugar was purchased at £ 7 2 12s. 6d. per ton. A t the actual time of purchase the current market price was about £ 6 7 10s. per ton. In that transaction we paid £ 5 2s. 6d. above the world's price. The 5,000-ton lot was purchased at £ 6 3 10s., which was the current price at the time of purchase.

He has treated the Committee to a farrago of nonsense about the misfortunes of his party, and has invited honourable members to shed tears with him over the machinations of which, he says, I have been guilty.

I wish to deal with one of the right honourable gentleman's misstatements.; there were more, but The Prime Minister. stated on advice by Colonel Oldershaw that it was necessary, according to the ideas of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, that Australia should make heavy purchases of sugar. He led this Committee to believe that those operation* with Lee, Davies, and Nash were begun after that advice from the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. As a matter of fact, the date given by the Prime Minister for this information is the 7th August, and he said it was then communicated to the Minister in charge of sugar control, and the contract entered into on the 9th, whereas Lee was sent to Java by Davies prior to that. made between Lee and Davies was early in May. The agreement was actually reduced to writing on the Sth July, a mouth before the time when the Prime Minister tells us that he was advised by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company that it was necessary to buy this large amount of sugar, and when he used tliose unusual agents. That is one statement which can very easily be disproved by the facts laid before'the Committee., There is another point in connection with the statement. The Minister now in charge of the Oommittee ( Mr ference ? Greene) drew attention to the fact that there is a date given for those contracts made with Nash and Company; but under the statement which was issued to the House last week there is no such thing as a date to any of them. is wrong. the one time. have no dates shown for those three contracts, whereas there is a specified date for every other contract throughout the whole document. That is so marked that in my particular copy, I have written under each of these contracts "" ""no date."" ment, when the Prime Minister was dealing with this matter, he did not tell us . that the dates had been omitted from the paper, but he asked, '' What does it matter ? You have the date of the invoice."" It would seem that one in particular struck me. the dates have been interpolated since. that In any case, what does the date of the 7th August he was sent the invoice show? On page 6, as to contract 59, the date is shown as the 13th September, 1920, but the invoices are dated 1st, 15th, and 17th November, and 6th December. It is useless for the Prime Minister to tell us that the invoice date gives us the time of the contract. did say so before dinner, but when we met after dinner the Government produced a paper absolutelycontrary to what ;the Prime Minister had previously upheld. The right honourable gentleman then said, "" I will give you the dates of the contracts."" What sort of a way is The first arrangement that to play with the Committee-to treat the community at large?

What has become of Colonel Oldershaw? Why were these contracts put through Colonel Oldershaw's office direct from the Prime Minister in some cases ? Colonel. Oldershaw received word, from the Prime Minister concerning these matters, and went on with the business. In every business it is recognised that, besides the head man in charge of a particular branch, there must be some one to keep records;, but in Colonel Oldershaw's office, so far as we can find out, and so far as has been made publio in. the evidence given before the Public Accounts Committee, there was no one but his typiste. When Colonel Oldershaw was given leave of absence by the Prime Minister, not through the ordinary channel of the particular Minister in charge of the Department, to take this tour abroad, there were no records whatever left in his office, and no one to carry on. Is that a proper way to do business? Isi t a proper state of affairs that a man should be given leave of absence by the Prime Ministeri t proper that he should be given leave of absence when questions of this sort are being brought up every day. pay? tion with me. The point is that this officer has been sent away, or allowed to go away, on a holiday on full pay, and no records are left behind at a time when sugar is a burning question with the people of Australia. Isi t not proper that, when matters of this sort arise, and sworn statements and affidavits are produced, these should be ventilated here? [54] Davies and Lee were servants of the Commonwealth ? time the Government had put all its contracts through recognised firms of high standing, but all of a sudden, when the Prime Minister says he was advised by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, the Government started to put the contracts through the firm of Lee and Davies. Lee was sent to Java by Davies to deal with the matter there, but apparently they "" fell out,"" and then the contracts went through Nash, who became Davies' agent. It is of no use for the Prime Minister to talk about Davies being Nash's agent, when Davies had sent Lee over, in the first place, to do business, and then "" sidestepped "" him and employed the other man. I wish to go one step further and deal with the question of price, which, after all, is the live issue. The real cause of the high price that housewives in Australia have to pay is not the money that has been paid to the growers, but the large sums given for foreign-grown sugar. A contributing factor to the inflated retail price is the improper manner in which the accounts have been kept. Five years ago £415,000 was paid from the Sugar Account into the ordinary revenue. with, this Pool. to do with the fact that the Government are now recouping themselves. If the £415,000, which was paid over five years ago, had been left to the credit of the Sugar Account, it would have earned interest to the extent of a little more than £100,000, and that amount, at any rate, could have come off the price of sugar. There are possibly a number of other things that could be ferreted out if honhis orable members had a full statement of the position; but the Colonial Sugar Refining Company has had control, and the Government have given us no figures sufficient to enable us to form a true estimate'. We had no information to show at what price sugar could be sold until we dragged it from the Government in a piecemeal fashion.

I have heard many attacks launched in this House from time to time by various members against the Government of the day, but I have never listened to anything more contemptible than the attack to-night of the honourable member for Cowper( D r . Earle Page). heard a case so utterly paltry and weak, and based on such wretchedly poor premises, as those on which he attempted to build up a case. He had not the courage of an ordinary decent man. He was not prepared to say that the Government had. been corrupt over their sugar purchases. He had not the common decency to make a charge, and lay it against anybody, but he took refuse in the cowardly expedient of throwing out innuendoes, in the hope that they might attach to me. H is one object was to attack myself. ''associated with him know that just as well as I do. and he had no right, whatever to suggest that there was any corruption, which he did, unless he believed that the Government were a party to it . If doing the course to go to the Minister, under whom the officer was working, and say, "" Look, I man; I think you should inquire into the matter and see if he has been doing anything wrong."" That would be the straightforward and honest course for the honourable member to take, if he believed that the offioer was corrupt. No ; that was not his object at all. His intention was to attach to myself, and to other occupants of the Treasury bench, 'the imputation that we had been connected with some corrupt action. So the honourable member brings the matter up, not to make a charge, not to say that any honourable member has been corrupt, but just to throw out the dirty innuendo of corruption, without having the honour and common manliness to make any definite charge. I have seen some contemptible things done here, but never anything quite so despicable as that. Never have I seen any charge thrown against any Government that was based on such a wretched and miserable pretext as the alleged statutory declaration of this individual Lee.

250,Mr Greene,"There were many letthe subsequent ones. The first one referring to that particular year's purchases, so far as I can see from the file, is dated, not the 7th August, but the 20th June. first arrangement in May. It was reduced to writing on the 8th July. Colonial Sugar Refining Company is dated the 20th June. The arrangement referred to by the honourable member for Robertson became an agreement, according to the honourable member, in July. The letter from the Colonial Sugar Refining Company was mitten to Colonel Oldershaw, and deals with the whole question of the probable shortage, which., at that particular time was a matter of guess work. In. it the Colonial Sugar Refining Company statesUnfortunately, the local crop will not cover the consumption by at least 100,000 tons. Based on last year's deliveries all this shortage must be filled up by importing foreign sugar. The price of such sugar is, however, at present so high that a heavy loss will be incurred by selling thc refined products at the rates now ruling here; Taut, as it is quite impossible to forecast the future of the sugar market, it is also impossible to determine whether it would be wise to defer purchasing in the hope of the market falling later in tbe year. The danger of such delay is, of course, that the sugar may not be available when it is wanted, and if the Government wish to avoid that risk they should purchase now, at least, one-half their requirements, anil adjust the selling price, so as to provide for the high price of the raw article. The definite advice of the company, on the 20th June, to the Government, was that we should buy 50,000 tons of sugar, at least, to meet the anticipated shortage in 1920. That advice was repeated over and over again. I remember the period very well, because it was a time of tremendous anxiety for m.e, who was the Minister primarily responsible for that particular work. I have a clear recollection of taking the whole matter to Cabinet and stating exactly what I thought about it. At last we gave permission to buy 25,000 tons of Cuba sugar, and I think it was purchased in two or three lots. The company, however, as mentioned by the Prime Minister, kept hammering away at us to buy more sugar, and the reason was that they were afraid that we would reach a position when we could buy no sugar at all owing to the world shortage. Nobody knew, at that time, what the true world position was. Nobody could then say what was going to happen. At the time that the company gave us the advice on the 20th June, raw sugar, as nearly as I can remember at the moment, was about £85 per ton f.o.b., and the company advised us to purchase 50,000 tons. The great difficulty was that we did not know whether we would be able to get all that we required. At the same time we were extremely anxious not to buy more than was absolutely necessary while the market price was so high. Difficult as that position was, it was suddenly made infinitely more trying by the fact that we were faced with a strike, which hung up, not only all the shipping, but deprived the refineries of coal. We were in the.position of having our raw sugar coming in in the north to the mills, and we could neither ship, our sugar clown south, nor could we get coal from the mines in Newcastle to refine the sugar that we had on hand. It was not long, before the whole of the stocks of refined sugar were exhausted. We kept a little, it is true, for the hospitals, and for a few special industries that could not keep going without it, but the whole of the stocks of the refined article were absorbed, and on top of that we had the f r u it season coming on. My colleagues and I put in about as anxious a time as it is possible for men to go through, faced, as we were, with that position. Still we did not know where it was possible to get sugar, or even if we could get it at all, at any price. When the position eased a little, it was quite clear that it was impossible for the refineries to catch Up to the requirements of Australia for the refined article to meet the demands during the frui t season. The refineries depend upon the winter months and early spring, when the consumption of sugar is at its lowest point, to build up their supplies, so that they may meet the requirements of the fruit, season at that stage when the consumption of sugar goes up by leaps and bounds. It was quite evident that the refineries could not meet that demand, because, just at the very time when they ought to have been building up their supplies, the whole of their reserves of white sugar were swept away, and it became",49,Eaele Page Why Is There No Whilst The Transaction I N Itself Was Car

Over and over again the honourable member has said that we were to blame for not having bought, when sugar was £15 or £14 per ton, all the requirements of Australia to meet the expected shortage during the period of control. most extraordinary of all the extraordinary statements that have beeu made by honourable members of the Country party. deal with. the whole sugar position and with the many phases of it . However, I want to deal with this particular aspect of it. Surely the honourable member for Franklin is not aware that the Commonwealth Government were under contract to buy all the sugar that is produced in Australia, and that when he offered us, as he says, this fancy price in August, 1918, the year 1917-18 had just closed with a surplus of 53,000 tons of sugar despite the ravages of the cyclone. It was a little awkward for the honourable member to suggest at that stage that it was necessary for the Commonwealth Government to buy enormous quantities of sugar when we did not know what the crop that year was likely to produce, and had not even the foggiest of information as to what the crop in the next year was likely to be. I suppose that"" the honourable member, with that wonderful prescience which he has always exhibited in regard to the sugar question, knew not only what the crop was likely to be in the year 1918-19, but also what it would be in the year 1919-20. of sugar will have to be imported to cover the been a surplus of sugar for two years running in Australia? MT. ' GREENE -Yes. I do not need to go very far back in the history of the industry for an illustration. There has been a surplus in the last two years, and this interjection of the honourable member is typical of the colossal ignorance.he ment, whether, in your opinion, it is advishas always displayed in regard to this primary industry. We closed the year 1917-18 with a surplus of 53,000 tons, and the one fear of the Government at that time was that we would be landed with a big surplus -of sugar bought at a price above the world's parity with which we would not know what to do. However, as the season advanced and the crop came in, we discovered that, owing to the effects of a cyclone-on e of those big seasonal conditions which attack the sugar industry from time to time-the cane had been so shaken over a very large area that instead of 8 tons or 8-J tons of cane yielding 1 ton of sugar, as is customary in the north, it required 11 tons or 12 ""ton3 of that season's cane to produce 1 ton of This is one of the sugar. , 'Consequently, our estimate went to pieces. Of course, the honourable member knew all about it. He knew that all these happenings would take place. UnI wish I had time to-night to fortunately, the Government were not so informed, being only normal human beings. Nevertheless, we bought all the sugar required in that year at a price which enabled ns to sell it without any loss. That was the year 1918-19; but during the succeeding year, 1919-20, we were again confronted with a sugar season which looked very bad, and in February, 1919I want honourable members 'to notice the date particularly-jus t after we had got in the 1918-19 crop, I began to feel concerned, owing to the reports of the drought in the cane area in Queensland, as to the crop in the 1919-20 season. I knew that the sugar market was steadily rising. This was after the war. No one suspected for asingle moment that we were to see the most phenomenal rise in the price of sugar the world has ever seen. However, on the 14th February, 1919,1 wrote to the Colonial Sugar Refining Company in these termsProm a perusal of your letters, it would appear that probably from 80,000 to 90,000 tons gap between the date when the 1918-19 Australian sugar crop will have been consumed and the arrival of the next Australian sugar crop, in July, 1920. Asi t is a somewhat unusual course for the Government to undertake the purchase of such quantities of foreign sugar,, at high prices, for delivery, say, one year hence, I shall be glad to be fortified with' the benefit of your experience and advise, iu the matter. Will you be good enough to inform me, for the information of the Governable for the Government to make arrangements through your company to purchase at once all or any portion of the anticipated shortage?

269,Mr Mcwilliams,"Has there everwhich. I was writin g wonld he required for consumption u n t i l over twelve months after my letter was written. The Coloni al Sugar Refining Company wrote, in answer, as follows:. . . Under normal pre-war conditions we would not have thought of buying sugar in the beginning for shipment towards thc end of the year unless prices were, in our opinion, exceptionally favorable, which cannot be said to be the case at present. Seeing, however, that so large a quantity of imported sugar may be required by Australia, and that the future course of prices and the extent of the demand by Europe are unknown, we suggest that the position as affecting the necessary supplies of sugar should receive the early consideration of the Government. We know that, notwithstanding the large crop in Cuba, estimated at 4,000,000 tons, the American Sugar Commission has entered into an agreement with the Cuban planters to secure it at somewhat above £25 per ton f.o.b., that the next crop in Java is expected to be 15 per cent, smaller than the last one, and that the Royal Commission is reported anxious to operate in Java when tonnage is availablefactors which cannot be overlooked in any attempt to gauge the prospects of thc world's sugar market during the current year. In order-to obtain the latest information available about the future position we telegraphed to Messrs. Czarnikow asking their opinion, and they have replied as follows:According expected supply and increased consumption don't anticipate large surplus end year which case f.o.b. values unlikely decline materially under these circumstances, perhaps .advisable now purchase portion requirements OctoberNovember. from which it would appear that, while there is no urgency to secure full supplies at present, it would be prudent to buy a portion of these, and this seems to me to be sound advice. That letter was dated 3rd February, 1919. which they replied, as follows, on 17th February:. . . Since then furtheT advices have been received from London recommending us to commence buying, and these have, no doubt, been prompted by the strong demand especially from Japan. As things stand we would, if acting on our own account, and able command freight as well as control the selling prices for the refined products, buy now 40,000 to 50,000 tons, leaving the balance of requirements to he secured later, hut remaining ready to act quickly if the occasion calls for this. The Colonial Sugar Refining then advised us to purchase from 40,000 to 50,000 tons, in their letter, which is dated 17uh February, 1919. If honourable members will refer to the sheet which has been circulated, they will see how much Mr Greene. sugar we purchased shortly after that letter was written, and tlhey will find that, instead of the Government purchasing 30,000 to 40,000 tons, we bought, altogether 84,000 in the course of the next few weeks. I took the f u l l responsibility of doing that. Honourable members will see that the highest price paid was £ 2 5 10s. per ton. We bought immediately 66,000 tons. That sugar was not required for consumption in Australia for twelve months, and when it went into consumption the price was in the vicinity of £ 9 0 per ton instead of the price at which we bought it . We have heard a great deal concerning the ' alleged muddle which occurred in connection with foreign purchases, but if honourable members will study the table in conjunction with the correspondence that passed between the Government and the Colonial Sugar Refining Company they will find that the two outstanding facts are that when sugar was cheap-wit h one negligible exception-w e purchased more than the Colonial Sugar Refining Company advised, and when it was dear we purchased less. These facts can be proved from the files. The action of the Government in purchasing 84,000 tons instead of 40,000 tons saved the Australian consumer-takin g the price which was ruling for sugar when it went into consumption -nearl y £4,500,000. When we hear honourable members repeating the parrot cries that appear, day after day, in rubbishy statements in the press; written by persons who do not know the first thing concerning the matter, and repeating those statements without attempting to get at the facts, one cannot be other I wrote further on the matter, to than disgusted. The Committee which is to inquire into the whole matter will have all the information at its disposal, and when it reports to this HouseI believe, if the investigations are carried out honestly, and with a desire to get at the truth , as I believe they will be, the report will tell a story of which this Government will never have cause to be ashamed.

The honourable member will not be in order in dealing with a matter that has already been disposed of. merely given notice of an amendment which, when moved, w ill enable honourable members to record a vote. as I could understand his remarks, the honourable member for Cowper( D r . Earle Page) did not charge the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) or any other Minister with dishonesty. however, bring before the Committee certain information on which action should be taken. ister themselves into vituperation machines, and made vitriolic statements concerning a certain honourable member, merely because he brought before the Committee evidence of corruption, inasmuch as amounts of £1,500 and £1,000 were paid to hush up certain transactions. Prime Minister stooped to such low critioism as to refer to the voice of the honourable member and the general manner in which he presented his case. The right honourable gentleman mav be endowed with vocal powers which mav or may not be a credit to himself; but there is no reason why he should comment on the vocal powers of others. The Prime Minister, and,' subsequently, the Minister for Defence( Mr Massy Greene) were 'anxious to know where certain documents were. I hold in my hand a document signed, sealed, and delivered w i th a receipt for £1,500 attached. That is no myth. against the Government? reflects directly upon the Prime Minister or any other Minister, but we want to know on whom it does reflect. A week or two ago I moved for the appointment of a Select Committee, and no honourable such an investigation. In November,. 1921, Davies entered into an agreement with Lee, the original of which I have I intend in my hand, in which agreement Davies paid Lee £1,500 compensation which, together with £1,000 already paid, made a total of £2,500 in all. Lee covenanted therein as follows: Forthwith to hand over to the said William Edward Davies all documents, agreements, papers, and writings, including copy documents, agreements, papers, and writings relating to or in anywise connected with any business transactions or otherwise in which the said Benjamin Joseph Lee and William Edward Davies are or were anywise inI have terested, and all his riglit, title, estate, and interest in and to the same. A t the same time Lee was called upon to make, and did make, a statutory declaration in which he declared(1) That the documents set out in the schedule hereunder annexed and marked "" A "" are the whole of and the only documents, papers, letters, and writings and copy documents papers, letters, and writings held by me reHe did, ferring to the dealings of William Edward Davies and Alfred W.

275,Mr Prowse,"member a member of the Publio Accounts Committee ? man of that body will bear me out when I say that I opposed the proposal that the Committe should deal with the sugar question. So. far as one is able to ascertain, this spect to these agents of theirs, they will man Lee was in Java, and Davies, who had newly become a sugar broker, was in touch with Lee. The latter was Davies' agent in Java, while Davies was Nash's agent here.' I urge that an inquiry be instituted in order to learn the significance of that cablegram of 9th August, because on the day that the cable was despatched Lee was offering sugar at £71 9s. 6d., through his agent, Davies, here, to the Commonwealth Government. Buti t would appear that Davies was then playing up to two masters. A stage was reached when he realized that he could no longer serve two masters, when he perceived that there was more capital to be got out of his relations with Nash, wherefore he gave Lee the cold shoulder. I repeat that Lee, as agent for Davies, was offering sugar at £71 9s. 6d. on the same day when the Government bought sugar at £72 12s. 6d. from Davies as agent for Nash. When these transactions became known to this duplicate agency, friction very naturally developed, and these people had to divide their spoils. The whole of the truth was not told. They were supposed to have "" gone halves "" in these spoils. But when they were able, by other and closer transactions-wliic h Davies apparently had here with the Prime Minister's Department-to get further into the finances, Lee was left with a smaller amount; and, doubtless, he is now disgruntled. But whether he is an honourable or a dishonourable gentleman, such covenants as these-mad e in writing, and copies of which have now received the light of day in this chamber -shoul d be investigated without any question of the Government desiring merely to gloss things over with a statement to the effect that Lee is a dishonourable man-. Davies, only in the month of June, before these transactions occurred, was made an agent for Nash. He gets into the good graces of the Government, and obtains contracts such as have been revealed, while the Government are paying Colonel Oldershaw £1,000 a year, and providing him with a staff for the same work. This man, Davies, has been dignified by the Prime Minister with the title of "" sugar broker "" ; but he was only that for the matter of three months, or thereabouts. We desire that the Government shall assist us in instituting a proper investigation concerning this man. If the Government have made mistakes with rebe playing a more honourable part in admitting their mistakes rather than that they should try to bluff us out of an inquiry. Daylight should be let into the whole of this new phase of the business. These allegations may be only a "" dud "" ; but let them be proved as such rather than that the Government should content themselves with the use of epithets such as I regret to say they have uttered in bhis chamber, but which should never have been used between gentlemen. Now here is another; communication, which may or may not be authentic, but which leaves a very suspicious sentiment in my mind at least, and which, when I have read it , may possibly impress the minds of other honourable members similarly. The document which I am about' to read is said to be a copy of an original letter from the Prime Minister's office. Or, at least, it is said that it has been in the Prime Minister's oflice. It is written by W. E. Davies. I remind honourable members that the Prime Minister has said that he did not know Davies. That may be so; but there is somebody in the Prime Minister's office who knows him. had a personal interview with the Prime Minister. members to appreciate the true purport of the document which I am about to place before them. The matter, I assure them, is a serious one. This is a copy of an original letter from Davies to the Prime Ministera letter, however, which has been altered by some one in the Prime Minister's Department. The original, after it was altered, was returned; and here is a copy of it , as altered, tendered in this chamber as evidence. It is dated 30th December, 1920, and is addressed to "" The Right Honourable W. M . Hughes, P.C, K . C , Prime Minister of the Commonwealth of Australia. Melbourne.""

286,Mr Rodgers,"B y their support ofamendment before the Committee is the third adverse motion on the administration of the Government with regard to sugar control during the last fortnight. I supported the first, submitted by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton), and as I did not then have an opportunity of stating my reasons, owing to my absence through illness until the day when the vote was taken, I may now inform honourable members that I voted for the amendment as' a protest, because information which this House had asked for regarding the sugar transactions was not forthcoming at the time. Since then the information asked for has, in the main, been supplied, or at all events sumcient has been said to justify the Ministerial assurance that the price of sugar, ab the present time, cannot be reduced below 5d. As the whole question has been submitted to the Publio Accounts Committee for inquiry and report, I do not feel justimore trying, than those of the men assofied now in supporting any further motion of want of confidence in the Administration until the position has been inquired into. The statement made this evening by the Leader of the Country party (Dr. Earle Page) does not reflect in any way upon the Administration. The Government have not had anything to do with the transactions between Davies and Lee, and I think the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Eodgers) is quite justified in the view that if any inquiry is necessary, surely it may safely be intrusted to the Publio Accounts Committee. It is generally admitted that the question of the price of sugar has nothing to do with the question of control. The debate has certainly been very illuminating from the view-point of future control in the industry, and for that reason the time occupied may not have been wasted. I believe that the majority of those who so severely criticised the Government over this matter favour the principle of Government control, but I have no hesitation in saying that I quite disapprove of it , and I hope that this is the last we shall hear of Government control of sugar or any other industry, at all events in peace time. If we have Government control, even of a few of the more important industries in the Commonwealth, there is not the least doubt that 365 days in the year will not be sufficient for honourable members to deal with the administration and criticise the Government. We want to get away from Government control of industry, and give our attention to those questions that properly concern the functions of government. Many honourable members favour Government control of industries, and when the agreement was before the House, members generally held .that it was a very fine agreement indeed. A ll parties were satisfied. If all parties engaged in the industry are satisfied they must be doing very well. I am confident that those who have had to pay the high price ruling for sugar during the term of the latest agreement-that is to say, since I have been a member of this House-ar e not so well pleased. Many of them do not have the fine times that are enjoyed by those engaged in the sugar industry. They do not obtain the same good wages, although their working conditions are quite as hard, and, in many cases, even ciated with the sugar industry. To do justice to workers and producers alike, then, it would seem that we must control every industry and trade, and endeavour to strike a balance. We all know, however, that there is no possibility of such a thinobeing done by this or any other Parlia"" ment in the Commonwealth. The hondine) interjects. He, no doubt, would nationalize every industry. What we have learnt during this debate should cause any one likely to follow his lead, to hesitate and consider what we would be up against if we were to nationalize only some six of the principal industries of Australia. I do not think it necessary to apologize to any one for the vote T gave in support of the motion moved recently by tbe Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton)' to reduce the price of sugar to 4?Jd. per lb. The reasons I have given are sufficient to justify that vote. I had not at my disposal, at the time, the information necessary to guide me in determining whether or not sugar could be sold below the present price, and I supported the motion as a protest against the failure to supply such information. I admit, as a supporter of the Government, at the present time, that that motion did some good. But for it and the support that certain honourable members sitting bqhind the Government gave to it , I am afraid we should not have had supplied to us",57,Chaibman Member Should Have Endeavoured To Burke
287,Mr Bell (Darwin) [9.55],The,58,Chaibman Member Should Have Endeavoured To Burke
288,Orable Member For Barrier ( Mr Consi,"so quickly, and so completely, the information that is now before us. The position to-day, however, is quite different. There is no justification for the submission of motions of want of confidence, day after day, in regard to the sugar question, seeing that it has been thoroughly threshed out, so far as it is possible for the House itself, to. deal with it . Tho whole question is now in the hands of the Public Accounts Committee. I have no doubt that that Committee will inquire fully into it , and that its report will be accepted with confidence by the House, despite the fact tHiat two of its members have felt justified in criticising the Administration. The fact that they have done so, to my mind, is immaterial. If , because of that criticism, we should debar them from helping the Committee to render a conscientious report, there would be no justification whatever for referring the question to the Committee. We know perfectly well that some members of the Public Accounts Committee will be biased against the present Administration from the very start of the inquiry, inasmuch as the Committee represents all parties in this Parliament. During the debate the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Rodgers) told us that there was too much politics mixed up with this question of business. If we are to, have Government control of, and Government interference in, business, I do not know how we can escape from that sort of thing. If politicians interfere with business, we are bound to have politics in connection with it. The only course open to us is to leave businesses of this kind to those who understand and can control them. Despite the huge profits that certain people have made out of various enterprises, I think there has been a leakage of £2,500. that, in the long run, the product of an industry would be retailed very much funds.' cheaper under private enterprise than it would be under Government control no money came out of sugar. The departmatter by whom that industry was adminmental files show that Mr Davies, whose istered. I hope that we shall now get partner, Mr Lee, received £2,000 for away from this debate. We are anxious shutting his mouth, and handing over certo deal with other, matters that come tain documents and other things in conwithin the proper functions of governnexion with this business, was in direct ment, and in which the people outside are communication with the Prime Minister's deeply concerned. I hope that we shall secretary.

It is becoming abundantly clear that the Government is to be saved again. the Opposition will thank God for that. whether they will or not, but it is clear that the honourable member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr Foley) will do so. He will render thanks to the Deity for allowing him to remain in the position in which it has pleased Him to place him. I rose, however, not to deal with the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, but to discuss this lady-like attack that has been made upon the Government by the Country party. orable member think that it is a sort of lover's quarrel ? attack which has been levelled at the Government has been remarkable, not for what has been said, but for the delicate and gingerly way in whioh the whole subject has been handled. the honourable member going to make? the honourable member will appreciate. It has appeared to me while listening to the debate that those honourable members who have launched this attack upon the Government have in their possession material in the handling of which they are particularly careful.

Mr 'CONiSIDINE-It has become abundantly clear in the course of the debate that the forecast by the daily press, that the Government are safe, will prove to be correct. Tbe whip has been cracked, and I expected the honourable member for Darwin( Mr Bell) to finish his address by quoting something akin to ""solidarity."" The honorahle member is reported in the press to be the only Nationalist member who refused to give to tbe Government a pledge of continued allegiance and support, but whilst he voted for the price of sugar to be reduced to 4£d. per lb., he has this evening pointed out how impossible it is, in the light of information that has been given, to vote for a reduction to 5d. I do not know what influence has been brought to bear upon himwhether it was the Nationalist Council or the all-powerful Colonial Sugar Redeal of talk about Government control of sugar; since this debate started, however, I have heard nothing further of that, but I have heard a devil of a lot Colonial Sugar Refining Company. All the correspondence and all the speeches that have been inade in defence of the Government on this question bave gone to show that the Government did not dare to make a step in any direction connected with sugar until its proposals had been approved of, and permission had been granted to it by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company.

We have been reading in the press lately that the Country party has been complaining about the manipulation of some of its members; but no reference has been made by the Leader of that party (Dr. Earle Page), or by other members of the Country party, to the allegations that certain members who have been mentioned in the press are safe for the Government. the honourable member for Dampier( Mr Gregory^ to bring him into this. his name, and, as a matter of fact, I did not have him in mind.

There are two of them who have been mentioned as being safe for the Government to rely upon. It is no use for the Leader of the Country party, or the Deputy Leader( Mr endeavoured to act upon, that they should Fleming) to stand up and assail the Government for making unfounded attacks upon their members, or refusing the courtesies usually shown to one another in these political fights, while they are countenancing in their own party the membership of men who are not present, and upon whom the public press say the Government is quite safe to rely. Sir GBA.NVU.LE RYEIE -They are sensible men, anyway. the Honorary Minister's point of view. The debate having gone so far it is quite patent to everybody, as it should be to the public, that the Government have not been in danger, and are not now in danger, and that we might as well have a division and get on with something else. than once I have heard it suggested in the course of the discussion of the sugar queshim in his reading of what purported to tion that the reason for desiring to put the be a statutory declaration. It was not, inquiry into the hands of a Select Committee, instead of the Public Accounts Committee, was that a Select Committee could deal with the matter much more expeditiously. By direction of my Oommittee I asked the Government this morning to submit to the House a motion which, if carried, will enable the Public Accounts Committee to do the work quite as quickly, if not more quickly, than any Select Committee. The object of the motion is to enable the Committee to sit on days when the House is ordinarily sitting. leave the motion will be moved to-night. done. The Public Accounts Committee has appointed a meeting for to-morrow, and unless permission is given we cannot sit. conceded, as it was conceded in regard to -an urgent inquiry on a previous occasion, I think I can promise that the Committee will complete its investigation as quickly as any other Committee of the House -could. I would like to say that, while members of the Committee are also members of this House, and that while they are adherents of one or other of the political parties, they nevertheless generally take the view, which I have always held and leave their politics outside when they enter the Oommittee room. That is the only way in which the Committee can carry out its duties as an inquisitorial body, and exercise to the ful l its powers in connection with public accounts. It has nothing but a great and most earnest desire to arrive at the truth on the evidence submitted. It is a very great pity indeed that such matter has been brought into this debate as was introduced by the Leader of the Country party (Dr. Earle Page). I agree with those who say that if he had a charge to make against members of the Government, or against anybody connected with sugar control, he should have made a definite and distinct charge. I -More am quite sure that every member of the House found it most difficult to follow by the way, a statutory declaration. That was the extraordinary part of it. He informed us that he had a statutory declaration in his possession, but instead of reading it he gave us a summary of it. That was a most unheard of proceeding, and I confess that I , for one, found it most difficult to follow. I do not know now, and I question whether any member of the House knows, what significance even the honourable member himself attaches to that so-called statutory declaration. He says that it ought to be submitted to a serious investigation, and that insinuations have been made which ought to be investigated by a, Select Committee. I believe that no Select Committee ought to be appointed at any time to inquire into anything until a definite charge has been made. There is nothing to prevent the If the desired permission is honourable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page), the honourable member for Swan( Mr Prowse), and the honourable member for Robertson ( Mr Fleming) constituting themselves a Select Committee and making further inquiries into those matters in regard to which they have been making",61,Chaibman Member Should Have Endeavoured To Burke

I think it necessary, in a very few words, to make my position clear in regard to the amendment. There seems to be an extraordinary idea obtaining amongst members, and especially those who belong to the Opposition, regarding the character of the Nationalist party meetings. They seem to regard the room in which we meet upstairs as a kind of torture chamber. It has been suggested that upstairs the cane is used, and one honourable member, I think, in the corner, suggested that in some mysterious way the "" acid "" is applied. I am quite sure there are many honourable 'members in the ranks of the official Opposition who believe that the thumb-screw and the rack are also brought into requisition, in order to discipline members into subservience to the Government. It seems that honourable members opposite reason that because members on the Nationalist side are found voting solidly, that must be the result of the application of some form of torture. It is a most extraordinary circumstance-on e I have noticed since I came into this House-that on almost every occasion when a division is taken members of the official Opposition vote with absolute solidity. conclude that this wonderful unanimity, wonderful unity, and wonderful solidarity are the result of considerable external pressure MT.

The Prime MinScullin) will not be found voting against his party on any occasion; he has not sufficient independence to do so-h e dare not. side is impossible, and that is why we do not find it. Some of us on this side are being accused by the oflicial Opposition of voting with the Government because tbe Government whip has been cracked. At another time. I have been taunted by tbe Opposition with voting in a certain way because it has been dictated by the press outside. Which way are the Opposition going to have it this time? The press outside is denouncing me for supporting the Government. Are the members of the Opposition going to say that I am supporting the Government in defiance of the press because of the crack of the Government whip? I do not care a snap of the fingers what the press says outside in regard to my actions; and I do not care a snap of the fingers for the crack of the Government whip. I record my vote as my reason and my conscience dictate. I voted for the Government the other night only because I was convinced that they had done what they promised. I desire to state clearly, in a word or two, my position in regard to this question of the price of sugar. BeforeI do so, let me say that, when this Sugar Agreement was brought down to the House, in 1920, by the Prime Minister, there was not a dissentient voice in any part of the Chamber. We were told that it was a good agreement. agreement now. then, that the agreement ratified by the House in 1920 was a wise agreement, as it was then characterized by the honourable member for Swan( Mr Prowse). The House was told at that time, March, 1920, that the necessity for making foreign purchases of sugar would mean the raising of the retail price to 6d. per lb. One can only raised in 1920 to 6d., after the ratification of the agreement. ^ I am now told by the honourable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page) that the I am quite sure price was raised three months before tbe ister's speech,in which he foreshadowed the raising of the price to 6d., was delivered on the 25th March, 1920 ber, I think, is wrong. In March, 1920, the late Leader of the Labour party ( Mr Tudor) moved the adjournment of the House for the purpose of ascertaining whether the Government would be prepared to reduce the price from 6d. right. In any case, I believe that, in March, the Prime Minister said the price would have to be 6d., and the reason was the purchase of foreign sugar at a high figure.",62,Chaibman Member Should Have Endeavoured To Burke

350,Mr Maxwell,"I still believe I amSupply BiU that the price was raised to 6d. is correct, after all. I remind the Oommittee that, although there is so much fuss being made to-day because the Government have not brought down seasonal or annual balance-sheets from the time the sugar came under control in 1915, there was not, when the agreement was being discussed, any suggestion on the part of any member that the Government had been disregardful of its duty in this matter. If I remember rightly, there was no such demand even made by the press as that there should be such balance sheets. We bad from time to time tbe half-yearly and yearly reports 'of the Auditor-General, who went into the accounts of the sugar refiners as they affected the Government transactions. I repeat that, at the beginning of 1920, there was not a single demand from any part of this Chamber such as is being made now. When the agreement came into operation there was practical unanimity with regard to the past sugar control. 1920, and the price was fixed at Gd., and we were given to understand that part of the price of 6d. was to go to liquidate the shortage on the foreign purchases. Next the people began to be restive at the length of time they were called upon to pay 6d. per lb. We heard all kinds of rumours as to where the money was going. It was suggested in various quarters that the Government were making large sums out of the control. that the Government were making millions, ancl using them for ordinary governmental purposes. months ago I wished to check the Government control, and to find out whether it was possible to make a reduction in the price, I applied to the Government for information. I have been trying during those nine months to get information from the Government to enable me to make up my mind as to whether a reduction in the retail price is possible. "" I failed, and it is only now that I am beginning to understand how it was that the Government were unable to supply me with the necessary information. The Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr fooled you. again. [16 AUGUST, 1922.] (No. 2) 1922-23. 1393 Rodgers) himself has told us that it was only when he began to look into the matter and when the demand came for annual balance-sheets that he saw what a colossal task was involved. He was anxious not to give fragmentary information, but he desired to wait until he had the whole of the particulars before bim. Therefore, quite recently I , in common with other honourable members, was exceedingly anxious that the retail price should be reduced; but the Sugar Agreement of 1920 is still in existence. We have undertaken certain obligations under that, agreement. I saw that under it the price could not be reduced. that on the 30th March, 1920, Mr Tudor moved for a reduction. At -that time the Prime Minister said there would be a £220,000 deficit. . From that time onwards there has been no information, and what we have been in difficulty about is to know why we should be charged 6d. when there was only £220,000 owing then. The sugar agreement began in that I think the Government have been greatly to blame for not having placed at hand all the information at their disposal, because it put many honourable members in a false: position. When I failed to get the information from the Government, I took it on myself to go on the public platform, and state quite clearly that I was absolutely opposed to any renewal of the agreement, but that I had not sumcient information before me then to enable me to say whether, under the conditions still prevailing, it was possible to reduce the It was suggested price below 6d., because I recognised that until the deficit, whatever it was, was wiped out, a reduction in price was impossible. When the Government did come When nine down with some information it was of a meagre character. From the first statement we got I could not make up my mind as to whether there was a possibility of reducing the price below 6d. When ton) moved for a reduction to 4£d. per lb., I voted for it, not because I believed that under present conditions sugar could be retailed at 4£d., but as a protest against the failure of the Government to supply the necessary information.",63,Chaibman Member Should Have Endeavoured To Burke

The next point is as to when we can reduce the price from 6d. to 5d., and that is where the trouble lies. We were told, in the first statement of the Minister( Mr Committee will carry out its work exRodgers), that the deficit at the end of June was £255,000. said then about an amount of £415,000. Therefore, we ought to reduce the price to 5d. when that £255,000 has been liquidated, whenever that may be. That is for the Public Accounts Committee to ascertain. their report, the public will have paid more than is necessary. the sugar account should be saddled with that £415,000 in addition to the £255,000. The Government having made that profit, and passed it into the Consolidated Revenue, why should the consumers be called upon to pay that £415,000 over again? we have been borrowing money from the Treasury to purchase sugar abroad, while the Government have had £415,000 belonging to the people, and we have been paying interest all the time. for adjustment. I wish to make my position perfectly clear. As a supporter of the Government) I have not been satisfied with the way the Government have treated the House. I am pleased that we have as much information as has now been placed before us. I do not think that there is a shadow of corruption in the whole business, no matter what insinuations may be made. So far as the Government and their servants are concerned, I believe that everything has been perfectly open and above board. Up to 1920 the sugar control was a splendid thing for Australia. Under tbe conditions existing in 1919-20, regulation of the industry was necessary in the interests of the Commonwealth, and I believe -that, on the whole, the public got sugar at a reasonable price, when, probably, had there been no such control, they would have had to pay a great deal more. Boiled Supply BiU [REPRESENTATIVES.] (No. 2) 1922-23. down to one point the question is, How much of the deficit has still to be liquidated?

I have no doubt that the peditiously, and will be able, within a Not a word was few days, probably, to give the House a distinct statement that, having regard to all the facts, the public can be relieved to the extent of Id., which reduction can last until the agreement expires, and then the whole question can be re-opened for the consideration of the House. Whip, to contradict two statements made. I fail to see why by the Leader of the Country party (Dr. Earle Page) and repeated in this debate by the Deputy Leader of the Country party ( Mr Fleming). One was that the Country party had been refused a pair for. a sick member, and that in consequence the honourable member in question had to be brought from a sick-bed to record his vote in the House. That statement was utterly inaccurate. The honourable member for Parkes( Mr Marr), who negotiated the matter with the honourable member for Corangamite ( Mr Gibson), assures me that he offered to pair the Attorney-General( Mr Groom) with the honourable {member for Wimmera( Mr Stewart) for the division on the day in question, and that the offer was not accepted by the honourable member for Corangamite. He tells me, further, that when the Attorney-General arrived, complaint was made that the honourable member for Wimmera had been compelled to come to the House and vote, but if that was the case, it was entirely the fault of the Country party. The second inaccurate statement was thab referring to the pairing of the honourable member for Dampier( Mr Gregory). As long ago as last MarchI had the authority of the honourable member to pair him in favour of the Government on any no-confidence or censure motion submitted by the Leader of the Opposition, and that authority was endorsed by him between noon and 1 o'clock to-day, when I interviewed him, and he admitted that he had authorized me to pair him in the manner I have indicated.
