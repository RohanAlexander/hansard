That is why the Rudd government is fast-tracking funding under the $500 million Renewable Energy Fund, which over the next 18 months Tuesday, 24 February 2009 ----Ryan Electorate: Queensland State Election strongly support the state Liberal National Party candidates in the Ryan electorate-the candidates for the state seats of Mount Ommaney, Indooroopilly, Moggill and Mount Coot-tha, who are all going to be fantastic in their efforts to take up the fight to the Bligh-Beattie Labor government. The Queensland Premier, Anna Bligh, has called the election in Queensland, and I think that all the constituents of those seats of Mount Ommaney, Indooroopilly, Moggill and Mount Coot-tha, which fall within the Ryan federal seat, will know full well that they have a very important decision. The decision is whether to re-elect a government that has been quite incompetent; a government that has been awash in GST revenue; a government that has been awash in the rivers of gold, as the Leader of the Opposition in Queensland, Lawrence Springborg, has said; a government that has had a decade of enormous revenue but unfortunately has wasted, has squandered and has mismanaged the Queensland economy to the extent where today the Queensland government has absolutely no respect in the international marketplace. It has no respect in the financial marketplace. The Government’s ability to govern, its ability to invest in projects of enormous significance off its own bat, is simply not there. Its AAA credit rating has fallen over the cliff and, as Lawrence Springborg said, not even the Premier of New South Wales managed to allow that. So that speaks loud and clear for the state of Queensland Labor Party management skills. It is time for the Queensland Labor government to go. It is time for the people of Mount Ommaney, Indooroopilly, Moggill and Mount Coot-tha to endorse the LNP candidates very convincingly, because the Labor Party in Queensland has been in power now for nearly two decades, bar a couple of years of the Borbidge government. With all the infrastructure problems in Queensland, with all the mismanagement, with all the lack of investment in schools, it is just untenable that they could possibly be re-endorsed. SoI say to all the people of Ryan, who at this coming state election will be voting in their respective state seats: I strongly encourage you to give your LNP candidates the most considered thought, because they will represent you. They will come to the new state parliament with energy, with enthusiasm and with a vision for a new Queensland. We have had two decades, nearly uninterrupted, of Labor politics and Labor government. It is now time for them to walk off into the sunset and to leave the Queensland parliament for a new era of strong administration under the coalition and under the leadership of Lawrence Springborg. Page Electorate: Victorian Bushfires Page Electorate: The Land Sydney Royal Showgirl Competition Ms SAFFIN (Page) (4.03 pm)-There has been an overwhelming response of generosity and solidarity by the people of the Northern Rivers district, which takes in my seat of Page, to the people of Victoria affected by the devastating bushfires-and I acknowledge the member for McEwen, who is nodding at me affirmatively.

I pay tribute to it and its editor, Sue Short. Two individuals, David Dowd and Andrew Roberts, one of them unemployed, managed to organise and collect a whole lot of toys and other goods and also get the services of ARTC-the CEO, David Marchant, is originally a Grafton boy-and Queensland Rail, and they got the trains to Grafton to take the goods down to Victoria. SoI pay tribute to them. Grafton Public School have organised 29 boxes of books to go to Marysville public school-and there is much, much more. I really want to pay tribute to the outpouring of what I call generosity and solidarity. People wanted to help and help they did, and they will continue to do that for the people, families and communities of Victoria until their lives regain-although they can never regain what wassome sort of semblance of normalcy. The second matter I would like to talk about is the young people in my electorate of Page. I recently attended the Royal Sydney Show Miss Showgirl final for zone 1, held in Grafton and attended by 16 Miss Showgirls from as far away as Laurieton, up to Warialda, and all over my area. Thanks to the local show societies and The Land newspaper. There were five young women, all from Page, who were in the finals: Naomi Watson from Alstonville, Stacey Maslen from Casino, Danielle Bower from Grafton, Mardi Wilson from Kyogle and Amy Morton from Lismore. Amy, who is a local butcher, was selected as the winner, and Holly Jarrett from Bangalow, which is in Richmond, the seat beside mine, was runner up. They now go to the finals in Sydney, which will be held on 18 April. I will be there to see them. All the women are wonderful ambassadors for our community. All are budding community leaders. All acquitted themselves brilliantly and intelligently and are serving their local communities. Thanks to Neville Heyward, Grafton Show Society president, for hosting the night, and to the mayor of Clarence Valley, Councillor Richie Williamson, who did the MC-ing. Ms Roslyn Wilson is going to be missed by her family, her friends, her work colleagues and, indeed, her local community; I pay tribute to Roslyn Francette Wilson, who was the Principal of Elanora State High School. Last Thursday, she was farewelled in a very colourful service-to complement her very colourful personality-at the Sacred Heart Church at Clear Island Waters. Roslyn was a woman who just embraced life. She was a woman who passed away long before her time. The students of Elanora State High School formed a guard of honour to say farewell to Roslyn last Thursday. Roslyn-‘Ros’, as we knew her-was just weeks away from a school trip to China, but she died a week or so ago from unknown causes. She had become ill about a month ago and was admitted to Pindara Private Hospital on the Gold Coast. That was on 10 February. Unfortunately, on Thursday, 12 February, at around 4 am, Ros Wilson died with her son, Cassidy, by her side. The family still do not know what took Ros. They are waiting for a coroner’s report. Cassidy was there when his mum passed away and at the service last Thursday paid tribute to his wonderful mother. On behalf of all of us, eulogies that were given by Ross Smith, the Principal of Robina State High School, and Roslyn Fischer, a very close family friend, paid tribute to and painted a picture of a woman who had given so much to her community, to her school, to her students and to her family. MAIN COMMITTEE",110,Constituency Statements
206,Mrs May (Mcpherson) (4.06 Pm),"This afternoon I pay tribute to a very special lady whoThere are too few words to describe Ros. She was smart. She was clever. She was probably one of the best groomed women I ever knew-on the Gold Coast, when it was very hot, you always saw Ros in her pearls and stockings. She was never flustered; she was a very sophisticated, beautifully groomed woman; she greeted you at the school door with a huge smile. She was compassionate. She was warm. She gave so much to her community. She served in many ways: she was a Rotarian, a marriage celebrant, a justice of the peace, an area coordinator for Neighbourhood Watch, a community representative, and the electoral presiding officer, and she was twice nominated for Gold Coast Citizen of the Year. Through Roslyn’s family-her husband, Paul, and her son, Cassidy-through all her friends, her colleagues at Elanora State High School and the community at large, I say thank you to Ros for the contribution that she made to our community over many years, especially to the students of Elanora State High School. Holt Electorate: Volunteer Grants erosity of volunteers has, in recent times, been at the forefront of our minds. The vital work of so many volunteers in our community from the most noble and courageous effort to the most modest, the most private, is something of which we must always remain mindful. There are people and organisations in our community who help others. Just as we should not forget the contributions, the selflessness and the generosity of these organisations in these times when they are no longer in the spotlight we should also recognise that those contributing to our communities often need a helping hand themselves. Last month the Minister for Community Services announced over $6.3 million worth of funding for volunteer grants by the Australian government. I am proud to say that 25 community groups in my electorate of Holt were recipients of those grants. These included the Berwick Stamp Club, the Bunyip Black Sox Softball Club, Christians Helping in Primary Schools, the Cultural and Historical Association of Rodriguans and Mauritians, Endeavour Ministries, Eumemmerring Federation Food Garden, Friends of Frog Hollow, Gumnuts Parents Association, River Gum Primary School, Hampton Park Secondary College Parent Network, Indian Subcontinent Cultural and Community Welfare Association, the Lions Club of Endeavour Hills, the Narre Warren Chamber of Commerce, the Casey District Scouts and First Hampton Scouts, the Ventana Hispana and Hampton Park Community House. In particular, I would like to talk about the contributions of several groups who do so much for our community, and seek only the assurance that they can survive to keep on giving. One particular group, the After Breast Cancer Exercise Group, received assistance through the grant program. The group offers support services to women who have experienced breast cancer and have survived it. The group seeks to help these women with vital assistance such as helping them return to work and to maintain an active involvement in community life. The Casey and District Multiple Birth Association, which recently had its 21st anniversary, is another organisation that has received funding through this initiative. This association, particularly in an area that has a lot of kids, provides much needed support and information services to families with or expecting twins, triplets or quads. The Cranbourne and District Toy Library is also in receipt of a grant. This organisation promotes early childhood development in the Cranbourne area. The Fountain Gate Tennis Club is another fantastic community based facility. Another one is the Hampton Park Junior Football Club and that certainly speaks for MAIN COMMITTEE",111,Constituency Statements
207,Mr Byrne (Holt,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (4.09 pm)-The genitself. It provides an absolutely fantastic opportunity for kids and their families and the wider community to participate in sport and in social activities-and a lot of people who have spent time in the football club would understand that. The Hampton Park Primary School through its public relations subcommittee seeks to promote greater awareness of the school’s activities as well as promoting greater community involvement in these activities through the use of its grant. My time is running short but these organisations are fantastic organisations that are the glue with which our community is bound. Victorian Bushfires FRAN BAILEY (McEwen) (4.12 pm)-The trout and salmon industry has thrived in my electorate by making use of the cold waters of the Goulburn River below Lake Eildon and the numerous tributaries of the Goulburn River. The industry in just the Murrindindi shire produces about 1,500 tonnes of rainbow trout per year. These fish are processed and value added into a range of products: whole, gilled and gutted, trout fillets, various forms of smoked trout, pates, dips and caviar. These are then sold throughout Australia and exported into Asia. The significance of the trout industry to the Shire of Murrindindi simply cannot be underestimated. The synergies that exist between the trout aquaculture industry and tourism industry are very strong as is the connection with the research centre at Snobs Creek Hatchery. However, on Saturday7 February 2009 the industry was devastated by the huge bushfire that swept across the region. This came on top of a prolonged drought of many years and then a record heatwave. To give you an example, Paul Cox at Wilhelmina Trout Farm lost about 100 tonnes of trout as they were overcome by contaminated water filled with ash and fire debris. The Murrindindi River stopped flowing into the farm as burnt trees and trash formed beaver dams. Paul tells of the great anguish he felt trying to save his house and processing plant while trying to keep his trout alive. All through the night he worked, but was eventually overwhelmed by the filthy water. He said, ‘I knew it was over when the fish in the river started to die.’ At Buxton Trout Farm, Mitch McCrae had a number of people sheltering in his house with towels over their heads as the flames licked his hatchery. The house next door was burnt as was the garage over the road. Mitch lost about 30 tonnes of trout as the water turned the colour of Coke. In his words Mitch said, ‘It was a bloody scary night and although we have lost all the fish, we are just lucky to be alive.’ These are amazing stories of human spirit. The effort to rebuild is going to be very difficult because the catchments have all been burnt out and the first rains are going to bring more ash into the river system, and of course the trout industry needs the cold, clear waters of the Goulburn. This is an indication of the difficulty of rebuilding these industries and the importance of maintaining employment in these regions to allow these families to become self-supporting and to maintain critical mass within these communities. Mr David Balfour Ms ANNETTE ELLIS (Canberra) (4.15 pm)-It is fitting that I make these comments following the member for McEwen. I had the absolute honour of attending this morning the funeral service for ACT fireman David Balfour. David was a member of my community and lived in my constituency. The service this morning was held at the Holy Family Church in Gowrie. David was given full fire service honours, and hundreds of people from the community gathered to pay their respects to David and his family. David leaves behind his wife, Celia, and his three children, Alison, 14, Daniel, 13, and Frances, 10. In her comments at the MAIN COMMITTEE service, Celia said-fittingly, bravely and courageously, I think-‘David always wanted to be the first at everything.’ Sadly, he is the first fireperson from the ACT to die in service, and that was an added piece of sadness for us today. David joined the fire brigade in October 1997. Throughout his career he attained the specialist qualifications of stage 3 urban search and rescue and level 2 rescue. He qualified for the rank of senior firefighter in October 2002. The main reason that he put his hand up to go to Victoria was that he felt very strongly about repaying Canberra’s debt from 2003 of the enormous support that came from Victoria and elsewhere when we saw terrible fire destruction in my electorate. David felt very strongly that he had an opportunity to repay that debt and that is why his hand went up so quickly to go to the Victorian region. Sadly and tragically, David died when a tree fell on him as he was attempting to connect a hose to the back of a fire truck. This was devastating, obviously, for his family but also for the fire service personnel here in Canberra and the people who were serving with him at the time in Victoria. The ACT Fire Brigade, the ACT Rural Fire Service, the ACT Ambulance Service and the ACT State Emergency Service all paid very high regard to David Balfour for the contribution he made in his short life of 46 years to our community and recognised the contribution that he made and that other colleagues and peers of his from Canberra continue to make in Victoria as we speak today. The service at the Holy Family Church was followed by a flyover from our emergency helicopter service as the cortege left for Woden Cemetery. I am sure the House joins me in sending our sincere sympathies, condolences and best wishes to David Balfour’s family. Fadden Electorate: Student Leaders the schools of Fadden. Australia’s young leaders play an important role in setting a good example by acting responsibly and making positive choices. What is encouraging is that these leaders have been selected by their schools and, in many instances, by their own peers for their potential to make a positive and lasting contribution to their school communities. We all know Australia needs great leaders, and much more will be demanded of these leaders in their schools today and in their communities tomorrow.

Charlton Electorate: Age PensionI want to take the opportunity, today, to provide an update on the government’s policy concerning the age pension and its importance for the residents of Charlton. On behalf of the nearly 7,000 single pensioners and 10,000 partnered pensioners within my electorate, I have been working hard within the government to represent their interests. The electorate of Charlton, in fact, has a higher than average number of people dependent on the pension and that flows into a low mean average income across the electorate, and people who rely upon the pension are doing it hard. The government is committed to a review of pensions to be conducted by Dr Jeff Harmer, who will report to the Treasurer and Minister Macklin by the end of this month. The review process revealed clearly that pensioners and carers are doing it tough, and the government has been listening to their stories. Dr Harmer’s report will provide a basis for government to respond to these pressures and to get our pension system right for the long term. Many of my constituents are keenly awaiting the findings of this review. In fact, late last year the Treasurer and the minister attended a pensioner forum in my electorate where they were confronted by many questions about this issue. It is fair to say that in my electorate, as in many others MAIN COMMITTEE",114,Constituency Statements
209,Mr Combet (Charlton,"Parliamentary Secretary for Defence Procurement) (4.21 pm)throughout the country, I imagine, these findings are keenly anticipated and there is hope that some much-needed relief for pensioners may flow from them. I can assure the residents of Charlton that the position of the government is very clear on this issue-that is, the government has undertaken to deliver long-term pension reform in the 2009-10 budget. However, in the meantime, the government has recognised that some pensioners have been struggling to make ends meet. That is why the Rudd government has undertaken a variety of measures to assist pensioners who are struggling. In total, excluding normal indexation, the government has been able to provide an additional $2,337 of assistance to single pensioners and $3,537 to pensioner couples since coming to office. Of course, those measures include: $1,400 for singles and $2,100 per eligible pensioner couple as part of the government Economic Security Strategy in December last year; a higher rate of utilities allowance, $500 a year for singles or couples combined; an increase in the seniors concession allowance from $218 to $500 a year; and an increase in the telephone allowance from $88 to $132 a year for eligible recipients. Although these measures have provided much-needed assistance in Charlton while the government conducts the review through Dr Harmer, it is clear that long-term pension reform is needed and we look forward to the findings of the Harmer review. I will certainly continue to work hard on behalf of the pensioners in my electorate to achieve long-term reform. (Time expired) Swan Electorate: Horseracing Industry ducted on the pages of the local Southern Gazette, a newspaper in my electorate of Swan. At times the debate has been highly personalised. However, the subject matter is important and that is why I raise it in the House today. The debate has been between the competing interests of the racing industry and the environmental protection of the Swan River. I have previously spoken to the House about the horseracing industry in my electorate. The industry is a large employer of local people and provides entertainment to thousands of people in Perth. The two major racecourse venues in my electorate are Ascot and Belmont. Ascot Racecourse is the headquarters for Perth Racing and hosts the prestigious Perth Cup. Ascot has a nearby racing precinct, or residential and stables zone, with streets designed to allow horses and residents to coexist. The 1,700 metre Belmont Park Racecourse is a winter track on the riverbank. Thanks to its excellent drainage, Belmont is renowned as arguably one of the best wet-weather tracks in Australia, if not the world. This drainage represents a double-edged sword. Julie Rolling of Rivervale, wrote to the Southern Gazette. She said: Unbeknown to many residents, close to the Belmont Racecourse there is a large drain hidden away. When the tide is in you can’t see what the drain is expelling. When the tide is out, you can see a large, yellowish, oily, dirty stream coming from the drain, just waiting for the tide to come back in and take it out into the Swanthat is, the Swan River. Another local, Mr Kevin Bettridge, wrote in a letter of 10 February about how the horse waste from the Ascot stables zone is fed, via a pipe, into the Swan, causing algal blooms. Mr Bettridge criticised the Belmont council for allowing this practice to continue. MAIN COMMITTEE",115,Constituency Statements
210,Mr Irons (Swan) (4.24 Pm),"Over the past month a passionate debate has been conKevin Watkins of Belmont even suggested that the horses be moved out of the town. In response, Ray Mayne of Belmont defended the horseracing industry by saying, ‘It is iconic and a good spin-off for local business.’ Last week the mayor of the city of Belmont took out an advertisement in a local newspaper. She defended the residential and stable zone as ‘a unique feature of our city’ and said, ‘Environmental issues are addressed as part of every council decision.’ These exchanges in the Southern Gazette have highlighted two points. Firstly, as I am sure members would agree, this has been a magnificent exercise in local democracy. Local government has had to respond to concerns of local citizens. Secondly, we must acknowledge that this issue is significant enough to warrant a forum or, in other words, a summit. Most people recognise that an agreement of coexistence is required between the fantastic racing industry and the priceless natural asset, the Swan River. I have spoken in the past about the racecourse industry. I also spoke just yesterday about the importance of protecting wetlands in my electorate of Swan. A local community forum, involving all stakeholders, would allow us to move forward as a community to protect our environment and our valuable racing industry. We must realise that the debate is not about competing interests of the racing industry and the Swan River system and that they can both prosper with a good management system. I will endeavour to arrange this forum involving the parties concerned and achieve this goal for the local people in the cities of Belmont and Ascot. Mr Aubrey McGill passing of a great Australian, Aubrey McGill. In my book, great Australians are often not the people who grace the halls of this place or other high offices. There are many extraordinary ordinary Australians; Aub was one of those. Aub embodied the great Australian characteristics: he was kind, quiet, gentle, friendly, but with a mischievous twinkle in his eye. Everyone liked Aub. I would like to put on record in parliament a bit about Aub’s life, and I am indebted to Aub’s youngest child, Laurel, for providing my office with some details of his early life. Aub was a great Geelong West man through and through. Born in 1920 in West Geelong, Aub was raised in West Geelong, married in West Geelong and lived in West Geelong. His family referred to him as ‘Captain Stayput’. How Australian is that phrase? Aub was typical of his generation. The evidence of class and social injustice was all around him in the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s. At Aub’s funeral service, a story was told how, at the age of eight, a social conscience was awakened in him. When Aub visited his grandmother, a man was cutting her hedge for one shilling an hour, but Aub’s father, a barber, was cutting hair for a shilling a cut and doing four an hour. At the age of eight Aub was already considering what was fair. After a grave illness Aub was unable to serve in the war and went to work at Ford, where he also became involved in the union. He married Joan Sharp-Aub’s English rose-in 1944 during the war. Aub had a great passion, a lifelong passion for social justice. The Russian Revolution and the Spanish Civil War have been noted as important events in shaping how he thought about things. Aub was also a life member of the Australian Labor Party and was a Belmont branch member until he passed away. Not so long ago, I had the great privilege of sitting with Aub at MAIN COMMITTEE",116,Constituency Statements
211,Mr Cheeseman (Corangamite) (4.27 Pm),"I rise on a sad note to acknowledge themy office party for the end-of-year wind-up. We had a beer together. Aub was quite sick with a serious illness. Because of this illness, I think it was the first beer he had had for many months. I think he really enjoyed it, and I certainly enjoyed his company. WhilstI was having a beer with Aub, there was something that struck me-something that I have remembered. Aub seemed to be content. More importantly, it struck me that Aub always seemed to be content. It was one of his great qualities. This parliament is a place of ambition. We know that there are traps in that. We know ambition can become a poison. Aub was free of that poison. Whilst always striving for the rights of others, he seemed free of ambition for himself. He was happy with life, I think. I also think, in the end, we might find that contentment is more important than ambition, and that is something of importance as Aub’s legacy. It is with great regret that I note his passing. der 193, the time for constituency statements has concluded. Consideration resumed from 12 February. sland floods. Of course, it would not be fitting to fail to mention the other adversities that our communities around the country are experiencing at the moment. SoI would like to pass on my sympathies to the people of Victoria, in this time of great sorrow and mourning. We know Australia to be a country of extremes. In the words of Dorothea Mackellar, who wrote that wonderful poem, My Country, we talk about ‘her beauty and her terror’-the beauty and terror of nature in this country. The recent tragedy in Victoria and the floods in Queensland just show the complex fabric of our society-not only the people, but also the natural conditions under which we live. While no-one can predict these extreme circumstances, we do live in a land of extremes. The contrasts in this country are tragically obvious as we deal with the conditions of fire and flood and consider how we, as a community, deal with the issues that confront us right now. Through these disasters, however, communities tend to band together and governments will also band together. This was quite obvious in the chamber in our previous sitting week where both sides of the House came together to offer condolences and to speak about those tragedies in Victoria and also the tragedies that confront us in Queensland. These are more extreme when there is a large loss of human life. We must commemorate the loss of life and understand the tragedies of those communities. But the people who are affected by flood have to go on living in their communities, and the rebuilding is no less of an effort for that. In North Queensland, those communities are confronted with this difficulty. I was honoured to attend, last Friday evening in Logan City, a fund-raising event, called ‘Logan Cares’. The newly-formed Logan City Council-formed after the amalgamations of last March-brought together a larger community and one which was very diverse. It was a wonderful opportunity for this community to come together on an initiative of the President of the Logan Chamber of Commerce, Mr Bill Richards, and the new mayor of Logan City, Mayor Pam Parker. That event was supported by many businesses and many other community organisations. So some good can come out of adversity. And when you looked at the community coming together, you could see the multicultural nature of the city of Logan, with 160 MAIN COMMITTEE",117,Constituency Statements

213,Mr Raguse (Forde) (4.31 Pm),"On indulgence: I rise today to speak about the Queencountries and cultures represented. The dance acts and the performances that were put on to raise money were an amazing coming together, and people who were part of that event saw what wonderfully diverse cultures we have in the city of Logan. On that evening it was announced that the city would make a $100,000 contribution to the donations to support people in Victoria and those in the Queensland floods, with 70 per cent going to Victoria and 30 per cent to Queensland, providing much-needed money at this time. On the evening, while that $100,000 had been committed by the council, there was also the offer to match, dollar for dollar, any money raised at that event. The community of Logan is very diverse. They are not necessarily a wealthy community by any standard but they were able to raise $36,000 on that evening. Matching that dollar for dollar would obviously double that amount. I was very proud on that evening not only to be a resident of Logan City but also to be the federal member. I promised the people who were involved in that fundraiser that night that I would certainly pass on to this House my appreciation of what they were able to do as a community. I want to give special commendation to Mr Bill Richards, the President of the Logan City Chamber of Commerce, who, through the Chamber of Commerce, organised all of the businesses to contribute in so many ways. I also commend Mayor Pam Parker for the initiative and what she was able to bring to that particular night. In fact, as the mayor of that city, she was very touched by the fact that people gave so much on that evening. One organisation in particular was the Bendigo Bank, which for a whole range of reasons is associated with Victoria and the fires in that state. The Bendigo Bank has spread its tentacles all over this country in community banking and is very large and proud in the city of Logan. Mr Col Nelson, who is the chair of the Queensland arm of that banking group, contributed $5,000 on that evening. It was wonderful to see the involvement of the Bendigo Bank, which was affected in both communities by the events of the last few weeks. Over 62 per cent of Queensland has been disaster declared as part of this cyclonic eventover one million square kilometres has been affected, in about 48 shires within the region. To give you an idea, it is an area almost the size of South Australia. Of course, the member for Kennedy made representations in the House during our last sitting week about the way that it was affecting his electorate, with a vast area of his electorate under water. The Queensland government estimates that there is about $234 million worth of damage to roads and local and state government infrastructure. Towns in Far North Queensland, like Ingham, have been affected as well as the residents of the Gulf of Carpentaria, Karumba and Normanton. As I mentioned, the member for Kennedy made representations about that the other week. It is important to note that these large weather events are not foreign to these communities. In fact, if we go back in the history of Queensland, I certainly remember from growing up in Queensland-and I am sure the member for Blair remembers also-the cyclone warnings coming over the radio or the TV and putting us almost in a state of panic. We were certainly on alert but almost in a state of panic. I remember well that in the sixties this was quite a common event. Queensland has been significantly affected by cyclones for more than a century. While we are making comparisons with Victoria now in terms of where events rate on the tragedy scale, it is interesting to note that probably one of the largest natural disasters involved Cyclone Mahina in Far North Queensland back in 1899, which claimed nearly 400 MAIN COMMITTEE lives. It was probably not well recorded simply because of the vast and sparse settlement of the time. Tropical and cyclonic events can do major damage, we know, with the potential for loss of life. On that occasion, a storm surge created a wave nearly 10 metres high that swept inland and took so many lives. There have been others: Cyclone Ada; Cyclone Tracy, which of course hit Darwin; and Cyclone Wanda, when a depression settled over Brisbane back in 1974. The member for Blair would remember that very well. That experience certainly made me understand what floods and flood damage could do. I remember the city being under water for nearly seven days and, as a 14-year-old, venturing into my aunt’s home to try and help salvage her belongings. I remember, as the water was going down, wandering through water chest high, watching refrigerators float and seeing all those personal possessions that were just ruined by floodwater. I will never forget the stench of opening the fridge after it had been under water for nearly seven days. Of course, the people in North Queensland are experiencing that right now. It is tragic, it is awful, and it is not dissimilar to the effects that people in these fire ravaged areas of Victoria are also experiencing now. It is all loss and it is something that people will take a long time to overcome. In 2006, Cyclone Larry devastated many people, and the damage to banana plantations in North Queensland caused the so-called banana drought. The reality is that it significantly damaged a community. At that point in time, as a ministerial adviser in Queensland, I had a first hand view of the effects. You understood the dedication of the emergency services workers there on the ground and the generosity of the community-generosity we see currently in Victoria and with the floods in Queensland. You understood the resilience and the tenacity of the people who were affected. Our best wishes go to those people who are affected in Victoria and certainly, too, to those people who are currently suffering the ravages of flood in North Queensland. those of us who come from Queensland know all about floods. He mentioned Cyclone Wanda. In 1974, my community of Ipswich was devastated by flood. My parents’ home was about eight feet under water, and we lived elsewhere for six weeks thereafter. We had to move a couple of times. I will always think fondly of the Australian military, which came and rescued furniture at the last minute. My parents would have lost everything but for the wonderful men and women of the Australian Defence Force who came and did so much great work. Those of us in South-East Queensland, like the member for Forde, and me in the seat of Blair, feel tremendous empathy for the people of Far North Queensland. North Queensland is in chaos. It has been raining heavily almost every day for weeks, if not months. Emergency services in North Queensland have logged more than a thousand phone calls from people in distress, and we are only in the middle of the wet season. Fortunately, the weather forecasts are that the rain may abate, but the floodwaters have inundated towns in Far North Queensland for many days and some are still cut off. Between Cairns and Townsville, a beautiful part of Queensland, people have been hit very hard. The people of Ingham have been hit extremely hard. Food drops have been commonplace for many, and water has also been needed. Sanitation has been an issue, and disease has also been a challenge for those experiencing a way of life which for Queenslanders is quite common but to those from other states is quite foreign. Many of these people live in what we call queenslanders-high, raised houses. It is very sad to see what they have had to endure. They have MAIN COMMITTEE",118,Queensland Floods
214,Mr Neumann (Blair) (4.40 Pm),"On indulgence: as the member for Forde was saying,floodwaters underneath them and, as the member for Forde said, have been sitting up in their houses on stilts with floodwaters raging through their streets like rivers. They are also faced with the perils of crocodiles. Disease, pestilence and those other sorts of problems caused by fauna are also very serious. They have had tremendous challenges-highways cut off, railway lines destroyed, bridges made impassable and thousands of homes affected by flood. Hundreds of people have had to stay in emergency accommodation, and more than 60 per cent of Queensland is flood affected. As the member for Forde said, an area roughly the size of South Australia has been flooded. Like many Queenslanders, I have travelled to Far North Queensland on many occasions. We feel affinity for the people of the north. We love North Queensland; it is where we holiday. We have stayed there. Many of us have worked there. We love the Great Barrier Reef, the sugar cane farms, the banana plantations, the Daintree Rainforest, Port Douglas, the Kuranda markets, the Atherton Tableland and the mines of Mount Isa. We love the beauty of North Queensland. Queenslanders really feel this very hard and deeply. We Queenslanders are different. We love our provincial towns. We love our places like Toowoomba, the Gold Coast and Ipswich. Our patterns of settlement are very different. We have the Sunshine Coast, Hervey Bay, Maryborough, Bundaberg, Mackay, Townsville and Cairns-major provincial centres. Brisbane does not dominate Queensland like Sydney dominates New South Wales or Melbourne dominates Victoria. These country towns are the lifeblood of Queensland, and we must support them and their people in all that we do. I am very pleased that the Prime Minister sent up Dr Craig Emerson, the Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy, and the member for Rankin-a Queenslander who understands Queensland-to assist his fellow Queenslanders. They need help, not hindrance. We must give everything we can. I am pleased he took with him Mr James Bidgood, the member for Dawson and Mr Peter Lindsay, the member for Herbert. Those members represent Townsville and those rural areas that have been so affected. These North Queensland members share Townsville and the surrounds, so travelling to Townsville and Far North Queensland to view the tragedy that is unfolding was a very appropriate thing for the Prime Minister to do as regards those members. Sadly, there has been loss of life, and our hearts go out to those who have lost loved ones and friends and who have suffered so much property damage. Livelihoods have been lost. The cost is incalculable to industry, particularly rural industries like the banana industry and the sugar cane industry. Members of the emergency services from South-East Queensland have gone north to help their fellow Queenslanders. Queensland Emergency Services and the Queensland Department of Communities had a flood line. That has been available to many people, who have made use of those services, as well as the Commonwealth government services. Centrelink has had recovery centres up north and has received many applications for emergency assistance, particularly from places like Ingham. We have provided substantial assistance through the federal government. The Australian government disaster recovery payment has been made available to those people who have been adversely affected-$1,000 per eligible adult and $400 per child. The statistics that I have, again, indicate that the Far North Queensland floods have resulted in applications for that assistance being made for 14,804 adults and for 8,981 dependants-a total of 23,785 people. That is a fair sized town. That is a lot of people. In addition to that, the North QueenMAIN COMMITTEE sland floods Income Recovery Subsidy payment has been given to 953 people. That is, of course, in the month of February. We are talking about a huge cost to people, and the federal government has come to the party along with the wonderful contribution made by the Queensland government and local councils. But it has been local people who have shown courage and commitment. They have shown bravery beyond their call. They have made a huge contribution in terms of caring for their fellow Queenslanders. As the Deputy Prime Minister was speaking so eloquently about the flood victims and particularly the bushfire victims, I thought of the passage in the Bible where St Paul refers to the church in Corinth. They were quite a dysfunctional church and they were fighting amongst themselves and he told them they were the body of Christ. It reminded me of the unity of Australia-we are one body whether we are from Tasmania or from the Torres Strait. From Fremantle or Byron Bay, we are one but we are many. We are one people, and we need to care for those in the body of Australia. We need to care for our fellow Australians. That shows our humanity; that shows our affection; that shows our community spirit. That is what it means for us to be truly Australian, to care for those in need. I have to say that I thought that the Treasurer, the member for Lilley, spoke brilliantly on this topic on 9 February 2009. He said that the events in North-Western Queensland are a catastrophe. I think that aptly describes it. He said these words, and I think they are worth repeating: We in the Australian government stand ready to do everything we possibly can to assist the people in the north, as we will in Victoria. Whether it is fire in the south or flood in the north, we have to summon all our national strength and all our compassion to assist people to deal with these terrible challenges. My community has shown tremendous heart in helping those down south as well as those up north. I pay tribute to the efforts of the Ipswich City Council and the businesses in my community, all of whom rallied together with the emergency services at a church service conducted at St Paul’s Anglican Church in Ipswich under the auspices of Reverend Matthew Jones. He spoke about the heart of the community and what we needed to do to care for our fellow Queenslanders. Pastor Mark Edwards, who is the senior pastor of the biggest Pentecostal church in my electorate, spoke brilliantly and compassionately about the challenges and what we need to do. I want to pay tribute to the Mayor of Ipswich, Paul Pisasale, for the fine words he spoke and, for her very moving speech, to the state Labor member, my very good friend Rachel Nolan, who spoke with real heart and real sincerity about the challenges. Like me, she is someone from Ipswich who has endured flood and tempest. I want to say to our fellow Queenslanders: we are with you, we are praying for you, we are helping you and we will not forget you. Thank you to governments at all levels for the help you have given the people of North Queensland. I want to say to them: our thoughts are with you; we remember you every day. Ms LIVERMORE (Capricornia) (4.51 pm)-On indulgence: I am very pleased to have the opportunity to join with my Queensland colleagues, and of course chief among them the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, in speaking to this matter. It is nice to have such a big group of Queenslanders in this term of the parliament to join with. In speaking to the matter, I want to echo their words of comfort and support for our fellow Queenslanders in places like Ayr, Ingham, Karumba, Tully and everywhere in between who have endured so much in recent MAIN COMMITTEE weeks and who will live with the slow, frustrating and expensive job of clean-up and recovery for many weeks and months to come. It was two weeks ago that I was first scheduled to stand here and speak of the floods affecting my home state of Queensland. Since then, thankfully, the floodwaters have receded in some of the worse affected areas, particularly Ingham, but other parts of the state such as Longreach and the central west have had to deal with flooding rains in the interim and the floodwaters continue to cause enormous hardship and economic damage to those communities that have been cut off for a month now in the Gulf of Carpentaria. The extent of flooding and the scale of damage is something we have not seen in Queensland for many, many years. Even as a lifelong Queenslander, it is hard to comprehend the scale of the flood zone. It is one thing to quote the figure of 60 per cent of the state being under water but quite another thing to grasp the on-ground reality of what that means in a state as vast as Queensland. In Ingham alone the floodwaters reached a height of 12 metres, leaving 3,000 houses inundated. That is just one town across a flood affected area the same size as South Australia. Of course, we cannot forget our friends in New South Wales because that state has not been spared either in the last two weeks. Northern New South Wales coastal towns and the western town of Burke were declared natural disaster zones as well, with a mounting damage bill and dozens of people evacuated. In North Queensland, the devastation has reached catastrophic heights, with people missing in floodwaters. I think three people have lost their lives in this flood event, and there is a damage bill that was last estimated at $210 million and growing. And we know that it will grow. It is too soon yet to assess the full extent of damage to large outback properties-the damage to fences and infrastructure and the loss of stock that will be revealed when the waters recede. As we have heard from previous speakers, there is also an enormous infrastructure repair job that needs to be undertaken across so much of the state. Even places like Central Queensland that have not experienced the kind of floods that they have had further north are seeing massive potholes and damage to roads, bridges and culverts, so it will be a big job repairing the damage right across the state. Central Queensland is very fortunate, I have to say, to have escaped the worse of the damage, but we know how tough floods can be. In fact, it was one year ago that I rose in the House to speak of the floodwaters that swept through Emerald and Mackay and made their way down the mighty Fitzroy River to my home town of Rockhampton. As I said then, flood gripped all corners of the Capricornia electorate, but the community rose together through the turmoil. Countless volunteers and emergency relief workers toiled on the massive preparation for the floods in Rockhampton and the clean-up in those Central Queensland towns. This same process is now taking place in the north of Queensland and in New South Wales, and that will continue. Volunteers and emergency service workers are putting a huge effort in up there and I congratulate them. I do not think anyone here in the parliament could praise the emergency and volunteer workers in our country enough right at the present time, if indeed ever. There is a big job ahead, not just cleaning homes but also fixing roads and infrastructure, as I mentioned, and getting our freight and transport services moving again. The full clean-up MAIN COMMITTEE could take six months or more, and the risks of disease and problems with mosquitos will linger even as the waters recede. Sixteen emergency services personnel from Central Queensland flew north during the worse of the flooding to assist with the recovery effort. The specialist team went equipped with flood boats, trailers and equipment. They worked on emergency management, doorknocking, a general clean-up and the loading and unloading of helicopters. I am told by the acting area manager for emergency services in Rockhampton that at that time a further 75 workers were on standby to assist. I am pleased and proud to know that those people in Central Queensland were putting their experience of flood recovery to work and putting their hands up to assist their fellow Queenslanders in the north. In the last couple of weeks we have received some minor flooding in parts of Capricornia-some big falls of over 100 millimetres near places such as Nebo-but nothing like what has fallen further north. Fortunately, farmers in my electorate will be welcoming this summer rain and what it will mean for their crops and pastures. I certainly hope that they do not have to face the same challenges that are being felt in the north. Those challenges include destroyed crops, drowned and malnourished livestock, fences swept away and sheds destroyed. In the Gulf, where the floods have been occurring for a month, the threat of stock dying from malnutrition is real, with no sunlight to grow adequate grass for feed. It is estimated that upwards of 100,000 stock could die from the floods, and graziers need help to keep that toll as low as possible. I was pleased to hear the announcement that the federal and state governments are working together to pledge $3 million on fodder drops. We are doing our best to save all the cattle that we can in areas-like the lower reaches of the Norman, Flinders and Cloncurry river systems-that have been hardest hit. The government is also providing financial assistance to residents of North and Far North Queensland affected by the floods. There is a one-off lump sum payment of $1,000 for adults and $400 for each child to help support their recovery. Cane growers have been particularly affected by this flood. Cane growers in the north are looking now for sunshine, to let them get on with the recovery process. The growers in my electorate near Sarina and in the Pioneer Valley will have watched the events in the north with heartfelt commiserations. According to the Canegrowers organisation, the worse affected areas are around Ingham, Tully, Innisfail and Babinda. The Burdekin has also suffered flooding, while to the south, near Mackay, they have so far escaped the damage. Ian Ballantyne, who is the Chief Executive Officer of the Canegrowers organisation, says that the full extent of losses in the sugar industry will not be known until the crop is harvested later in the year, but there is no doubt there will be an impact. When a sugar cane crop is lost, the financial impact is not limited to the individual farmer. Whole communities are built around the sugar industry. It sustains many jobs and small businesses, and the links between farm, industry and community are very strong. When something like this hits, it hits hard. Farm workers, harvesting contractors, mill workers, train drivers and small business suppliers to the industry will be facing an uncertain time as they watch the skies for more rain and watch for signs of recovery in the cane fields. I sincerely hope they find what they are looking for. Thankfully, we know now that the floodwaters are dropping quickly. We can only hope that those affected have some extended relief from the rain so that they can begin the clean-up in earnest and get their lives back on track. Let us remember that, in the first 10 days of FebruMAIN COMMITTEE ary, Ingham received 999 millimetres of rain-more than most places receive in a year. AndI am sure that the people in North Queensland would be very well aware that the wet season may have more in it yet. I keep remembering that Cyclone Larry, which caused so much devastation to Far North Queensland in 2006, hit on 20 March-and that is still some weeks away. I hope for the sake of North Queenslanders that there is no repeat of that kind of cyclone activity or further monsoonal rain. They have had enough. In concluding, I extend my heartfelt condolences to all the families whose homes and lives have been thrown into chaos by these floods. Our thoughts especially extend to the families of those whose lives have been lost in the floodwaters. It made me very proud in the last few weeks to hear the stories about people in North Queensland who had been so badly affected by the floods whose first thoughts were for those people who had suffered in the bushfires in Victoria. The stories that we heard, about people sloshing through floodwaters in places like Ingham to actually hold fundraisers to raise money and to donate goods to people recovering from the bushfires in Victoria, were a real testament to the spirit and the enormous heart of the people of North Queensland. I am very proud of my fellow Queenslanders when I hear those things. But now it is time that we, here, must share their hurt and loss, and pledge ourselves to assist in all ways that we can to help them with the work of recovery and rebuilding what has been left by the floodwaters. We will be there for the long haul, and we hope that we can just get some sunshine so that we can get on with that job. Mrs D’ATH (Petrie) (5.01 pm)-On indulgence: I rise in support of the comments that are being made by my Queensland colleagues. This is one occasion that I rise to speak but I do not say that it is a pleasure to do so. It would be much better if we did not have to give condolences about the loss of life and the damage that has occurred in North Queensland. We in Queensland know that we have a wet season and that it comes every year; we expect it. But that does not make the cyclones and the devastating floods any easier for the people of Queensland, the people of Australia and those who are directly affected by these devastating floods. In fact, the floods that have occurred recently in North Queensland have resulted in as much as 62 per cent of Queensland being declared a natural disaster flood area. To put that into perspective, I heard recently that that is an area about the size of South Australia. It is hard to fathom that sort of area being under water. Of course, much of the major flooding has occurred around Ingham and around Herbert River. There has been loss of life since the flooding season began in November 2008-too much loss of life. We need to do more to educate people about the risks associated with flooding, whether they are from playing in swollen creeks, in river beds or just in stormwater drains. There are too many lives lost as a consequence of the sorts of activities that, at the time, people young and old think are fun but which certainly lead to dire consequences for them and their families. Just as we have heard in the last day or two that the threats of fire continue to exist in Victoria, the threats of flooding continue to exist in North Queensland. It is true to say that, in the areas of Ingham and those worse hit, the water is starting to recede but, as recently as this morning, there were flood warnings being issued for areas such as the Georgina River and Eyre Creek, the lower Flinders and the Norman river systems, the lower Diamantina River, the lower Thomson River and Cooper Creek. So the risks continue to exist, and we need to MAIN COMMITTEE assist those people on the ground as much as possible so that, if they need to evacuate their homes prior to those rivers bursting their banks, they have help to do so. We also need to assist in the clean-up process, which is going to be long and difficult. Although these homes may still be standing, they are severely damaged. The belongings inside people’s homes cannot merely be cleaned; they need to be destroyed and replaced. Many people in the Ingham area have reported that they have scrubbed and scrubbed their homes but they are still reeking, and there is a real, legitimate concern that there may be health consequences arising from the floodwaters having gone into these homes. It is not just people’s homes that are being damaged. People’s jobs are being affected and people’s businesses have been lost as a consequence of these floodwaters. And, of course, the wet season is not over yet-there is more to come. It is pleasing to know that the state Premier has set up a disaster relief appeal fund and that the Prime Minister has already announced funds to go to the relief of both the Victorian fire victims and the Queensland flood victims. In addition to that, we know that people across Australia are digging deep to support people who have been affected by these devastating floods. In Queensland especially we are acutely aware of the fact that we need to be providing financial relief and food, clothing and other necessities to people in the north, just as we are doing in the south. I have certainly had many people come to me asking how they can assist in relation to Victoria and North Queensland. One thing that we should look at for those people who still want to give those goods-when we know that the Red Cross are asking for people to stop sending certain goods down south because they cannot store them anymore and, right now, they are after financial assistance-is whether they could be used up north in Queensland. So far, in north and north-west Queensland, the early damage estimate for flooding exceeds $190 million. At its peak in Ingham, the number of homes with external inundation numbered 2,900, and more than 50 of those had floodwaters through their living areas. Sixty people were evacuated to emergency accommodation at Ingham State High School at the peak, and in Karumba and Normanton 17 homes suffered from inundation and nine of those homes are flooded throughout. However, the number of claims and the full financial impact of this disaster will, of course, only be known once waters recede and repairs begin. I would like to pass on my personal thanks to the Queensland police, Emergency Management Queensland, the SES and the Department of Communities, along with community volunteers and local councils. Emergency service workers, Ergon and government and nongovernment agencies such as the Salvation Army, Lifeline and the Red Cross have been invaluable and are doing amazing work in relation to the Queensland floods. This year the SES has taken 2,388 callouts already and, as I said, I do not think we have seen the end of that as yet. I would also like to, on behalf of myself and my family, pass on my condolences to all of those who have lost loved ones and who have lost livelihoods and their homes to these floods. It would certainly be remiss of me to not also pass on at this time my condolences to all those who have been affected in the Victorian fires and those who are still facing dangers as a consequence of ongoing fires. MAIN COMMITTEE with my Queensland colleagues in this discussion concerning the widespread flooding that has beset much of our state. Before doing so, I want to take a moment, on behalf of all the people in my electorate of Longman, to place on record our sorrow and sympathy for the predicament that our fellow Australians in Victoria face as a result of the recent catastrophic fires. In the preceding condolence motion, many members of this parliament spoke at length with great eloquence, compassion and, in a number of instances, personal experience and knowledge of those fires and of the people so severely affected by them. Like them, I offer our condolences to those who have lost family members, who have lost friends, who have lost much loved pets and livestock, who have lost precious family historical items and documents and who have lost their homes and all of their possessions. Like the speakers before me, I offer our admiration and respect for the women and men who fought to protect the lives and properties of the people in the communities first endangered and then, in many cases, devastated by the awesome ferocity of the fires. Our feelings are magnified by the knowledge that not only were many of these men and women volunteers but they remained at their posts, helping others as their own properties were threatened and then destroyed. We marvel at the courage and determination of survivors who insist that they will rebuild their communities. I, as part of this parliament and also as part of the government, am committed to ensuring that we do all that we can to provide whatever is needed to help these communities in their recovery, and not to forget them. I should note that such is the extent of the sympathy for the Victorians whose lives have been changed forever by the fires that the flood victims in North Queensland are donating their disaster relief funds to the Victorian Bushfire Appeal. In their estimation, these people are worse off than they are. Natural disasters are a frequent feature of the Australian landscape. In Queensland, they are regularly the result of destructive winds and flooding rains, of cyclonic activity and/or monsoonal troughs. But, in this case as well as that of the monsoonal trough, cyclones Charlotte and Ellie have also brought heavy rains. Paluma Dam, which is halfway between Ingham and Townsville, and Hawkins Creek, which is west of Ingham, have each received more than 2,600 millimetres of rain since the beginning of the year. In the old system, that is more than 102 inches. The extensive flooding that we have seen in Queensland in recent weeks is unusual only in its extent. More than 60 per cent of the state, over one million square kilometres, has been inundated by floodwaters at one time. Each flood-affected community has experienced flooding before and knows it will do so again. To say that floods are a regular feature of the lives of many Queenslanders I think in no way diminishes the impact that floods have on our citizens, communities and economies. As of this morning, flood warnings remain current for the Diamantina, Thomson, Georgina, Flinders and Norman rivers, as well as for Eyre Creek. And it is still raining. In the 24 hours to 9 am this morning, Halifax and Lucinda in the Mackay area received just under 250 millimetres, or 10 inches, of rain. Ingham has experienced what may be its worse ever floodcertainly its worse flood in the last 30 years. The Burdekin Dam was at one stage releasing enough water every five hours to fill Sydney Harbour, which will no doubt revitalise advocacy for the Bradfield scheme. Gulf communities have been cut off since mid-January and can expect to remain isolated for at least another four weeks. Throughout Far North, north and MAIN COMMITTEE",120,Queensland Floods
215,Mr Sullivan (Longman) (5.09 Pm),"On indulgence: my purpose here today is to joincentral-west Queensland, dozens of vital roads have been closed or are opened only with load restrictions. Many remain closed still. Estimates of the cost of damage to infrastructure caused by the floods have exceeded $200 million. But, as Queensland’s Emergency Services Minister, Neil Roberts, has conceded, we will not know the true cost of the damage until all the water has receded. So the cost could be many hundreds of millions of dollars more. Stock losses and private property damage will total many millions of dollars. Many speakers in this place in recent days have called to mind the imagery of Dorothea Mackellar’s famous poem My Country, which I note was originally entitled Core of my Heart. This poem contains not only the oft-quoted lines of ‘I love a sunburnt country’ and ‘Of droughts and flooding rains’ but also the lines ‘For flood and fire and famine, she pays us back threefold’. It is difficult to imagine how the community affected by the Victorian bushfires will reap a threefold benefit. It is also difficult to imagine how the cane farmers on Queensland’s north coast will benefit threefold. But history does show that Australians are a resilient lot. It shows that in Queensland rains that fall on our peninsula in the Gulf region, in the west and in the channel country do bring with them rewards for those who make their living in those unforgiving landscapes. I join with the member for Petrie in acknowledging the good work that has been done in the flood affected areas by people from the Queensland Department of Emergency Services, the Queensland State Emergency Service, the police and other civilian and government agencies, in particular those who do so on a voluntary basis. This is what this country has been built on: mates helping mates. While they acknowledge that their problems are insignificant in comparison with those of bushfire victims in the south, the people of flooded Queensland do face difficulties in their recovery, and I know that I and other Queensland based members of this place will ensure that their plight is not forgotten. parliament is taking time to record its concern and empathy for those affected by the floods in North Queensland. I should note at the outset that the parliament has quite properly acknowledged the terrible devastation throughout many parts of Victoria from the bushfires. The fact that our country can experience such extremes at the same time has been a cause for poetry, but for those directly affected it can be a cause of great tragedy. If you live in Queensland long enough, chances are you will go through a drought and you will also go through a flood. Those of us who were born and bred in Queensland tend to get a bit used to both of those things, whether it is in South-East Queensland, in Brisbane, or anywhere up the coast and a good deal of the rest of the state. It is a peculiar set of circumstances that Queensland can have somewhere in the order of 60 per cent of its landmass flooded and more than 40 per cent of its landmass officially declared drought stricken. It is a harsh land, and it has been a difficult time, especially for many on the land who rely upon the elements to make their living, whether that is with cattle, with sheep or with agricultural produce. As I said, if you live in Queensland long enough, you will go through both droughts and floods. I have had the experience of going through a couple of floods in South-East Queensland and in travelling through the North in the seventies. As I was watching the terrible scenes in Victoria unfold with regard to the fires, I have to say that my mind switched to the only comparison I could make from my own life experience, which was during those times of MAIN COMMITTEE",127,Queensland Floods
216,Mr Bevis (Brisbane) (5.16 Pm),"On indulgence: I think it is very appropriate that theflood. I have to confess that I do not think there is a comparison. I think that the horrors we have witnessed in Victoria take on a totally different dimension from the sorts of things we see in flooded areas. But floods do bring a level of devastation upon houses and upon lives, although thankfully there has not been the loss of life in this flood as there has been on other occasions. But, for the people who are isolated and have been for some weeks, and may yet be for some weeks, it is a major life-changing event. It makes it very hard for them in their daily lives, whether they are young and involved in school and education or are adults trying to get on with their business. Throughout all of this, as we have seen in other natural disasters this year and in the past, the response of the Australian community and of local citizens is something we can be genuinely proud of. The first responders-the ambulance services, the fire brigade and the police-do an outstanding job, and the State Emergency Service do a wonderful job. You have to remember that in some of these communities many of these services may well be volunteers. Certainly the SES are volunteers and, in some cases, there are ambulance volunteers, as well as volunteer fire brigades. These are people whose own homes and families can be under threat but who readily give their time to safeguard the community. I also want to acknowledge the wonderful work of the Australian Defence Force personnel. Towards the end of last year, a mini cyclone ripped through parts of Brisbane, including the suburb where I live. On the scale of things that have occurred since it does not really rate, but for a period of some days people were without power and without drinkable water and the like, and it was an enormous comfort to people in that situation to see the various emergency services out doing their work to restore normal service. I have to say, and I know it is the view of the people in the streets around where I live, that when we saw the Army trucks turn up and the soldiers clearing the debris and actually getting tarpaulins on roofs and doing that sort of work that we know needs to be done, at Keperra and at The Gap, in the suburbs that were hit by that storm, it really did lift our spirits. I can only imagine that the spirits of those in North Queensland, who have suffered the ravages of this storm would have been lifted by seeing the level of support coming from those emergency services organisations, the volunteers and our defence personnel. I am reminded of the cyclone a couple of years ago that ripped through North Queensland, through Innisfail, and the reaction of the community there. At the time. I commented on the Australian community spirit that was on display then and that we have seen in these recent natural disasters here in Australia compared to the response that, sadly, we had seen in Florida not that long before, after Cyclone Katrina. There was no looting in Australia. There was no violence. There was a well-organised support mechanism for the people who were most in need. I can remember seeing pictures of a shop owner in North Queensland who had decided that the goods in the shop were going to be ruined because there was no electricity, so he decided he would just put on a barbecue for everyone in town. ‘Come along and have a free sausage and a free steak; in a couple of days the meat’ll be no good so we might as well have a party!’ He effectively gave the food to the community. I thought there was something wonderfully Australian about that response, and I do not know that you would see it in too many countries around the world. It clearly was just the natural thing for that fellow to do and, from the newsreels that I saw, there was no shortage of people in the community who thought it was a pretty good idea as well! That sort of support, MAIN COMMITTEE that sort of community spirit, is something that I think, as Australians, we should hold dear. It is something that we should protect and cherish, because I am not sure that everybody around the world would react in the same way; indeed, when we see what goes on in some other parts of the world, we know that they do not. I think there is just a wonderful sense of having a common bond. I say to my fellow Queenslanders in the north: you have the understanding, support and best wishes of your colleagues in South-East Queensland. Indeed, we could do with a bit of that water down our way! It would be nice if the clouds moved away from you and came down to our corner of Queensland. We have all been through it in Queensland and we know that there is resilience amongst the people of Australia-that people do get out; that they will re-establish themselves, their families, their businesses and their activities; and that they will do that within a short time of the waters receding. I say to those who are affected: you are in our thoughts. Even as we have spent time in this parliament acknowledging, appropriately, the terrible disaster in Victoria, the people in North Queensland have been in our thoughts. I know that they will bounce back. The Rugby League season is about to start, and I have no doubt that there will be plenty of those North Queenslanders out there supporting the Cowboys. And when they are at those football matches they will exchange stories about what happened in the course of these floods. But, in all seriousness, our thoughts are with them. I want to commend again the volunteer services, the first responders as well, the Defence Force, and the state and Commonwealth governments, who have both acted properly, as all governments should, in dealing with these tragedies. I wish those in North Queensland a quick return to a normal life. the floods in Queensland by referring to Victoria first. As this is my first opportunity to speak about the fires in Victoria, I want to put on the record just how devastating, tragic and deeply felt that disaster must be for Victorians. We know it has been devastating for all Australians so it must be doubly so for all Victorians. I know that the communities in Victoria will rebuild. They will pick themselves up and band together. The government and the parliament, everybody in this place and the community will do everything in its power to commit to rebuilding those fire-ravaged villages, small towns and little hamlets dotted throughout Victoria that have been destroyed. We also need to spare a thought for just how long the rebuilding might take in Victoria. In some cases this is not a natural disaster because arson was involved. It may take years for some of those communities to rebuild. But I know they will rebuild, though they may never quite be the same again. My thoughts are certainly with them. The massive loss of life is something that is difficult to comprehend and understand-how many whole families and whole communities have been affected-and in some way all Victorians are touched by what took place. In fact all of us right across Australia may know someone, or have a relative or a friend, that lives in the state of Victoria. My deepest sympathy, empathy and thoughts are with all the victims’ families, the victims, the volunteers and all the people in Victoria who are trying to deal with what is the very worse of circumstances. I have heard with great pleasure-if that is the right word to use-the comments made by particular members whose own electorates have been devastated by the fires, particularly Fran Bailey, the member for McEwen. Her electorate has been deeply affected and it must be a MAIN COMMITTEE",128,Queensland Floods
217,Mr Ripoll (Oxley) (5.25 Pm),"On indulgence: I start my comments on the tragedy ofvery, very difficult thing for her as the local representative to have to deal with the situation and try to do everything that she can. I want to pass on my thanks to the Prime Minister for the way he has taken it upon himself not just to visit-I think that would be too light a way to put it-but to feel, be with and share as much of the pain as he could with our Victorian colleagues and to try to better understand, be supportive and be there for those people who have lost so much. AlsoI want to place on the record my thanks to the Leader of the Opposition and all the other members of the House. This has been a harrowing experience. Sadly it is not over as there are yet more fires in Victoria and it is probably going to be some time before those fires are completely extinguished and communities rebuilt. I suppose that is the great irony and uniqueness of Australia in that at one end of Australia we can have flooding rain and at the other end scorching fires and drought. It is a fair distance from the north of Queensland to the south of Australia in Victoria. That is the great irony, tragedy and uniqueness that is Australia, the tyranny of distance. My thoughts are certainly with all the people of Victoria. In terms of what has happened in my own state, as we have heard from other members, it may be hard for other people to comprehend, but Queensland is quite a large state and covers a lot of surface area. To have 60 per cent of that state flooded with water is an enormous coverage of land. It is an enormous amount of water. In some parts of Queensland, the high-water mark has hit more than 12 metres. It is hard to imagine what communities do when where they live is completely underwater-covered by an ocean. I have seen photos, as I am sure many other members have, of just how bad it is up north. There are huge inland lakes, huge oceans, covering massive parts of Queensland. It needs to be noted that in that part of Queensland they have received a full year’s worth of rain in just one month. And, as has been said by others, we are only halfway through the wet season, so there is still more to come. We do not yet know how bad it will get in Queensland. I want to take some time to congratulate Queenslanders on a variety of fronts. One thing which really touched me, and which I have talked to many people about, is the generosity of Queenslanders in putting other people before themselves. I have spoken to the many Queenslanders who have contacted my office or approached me while I have been out in the community. The flood victims themselves have actually said: ‘Sure, it’s bad up here, but it’s nothing on the scale of what has happened to Victorians. If you are going to do anything, we are okay. We certainly need some help, but please divert your energies, donations and other efforts to the fire victims in Victoria.’ To actually put somebody else in front of yourself at a time when you need help and your community needs assistance is a pretty special quality. To me, that is something unique and special about Australians-our way of life, our culture and the way that we deal with natural disasters. For Australians, it seems to be almost like a rallying call-a call to arms, in a way-where we step up to the mark and help other people before we help ourselves. This is not always demonstrated in other places. It is just really touching to see that Queenslanders-and, in fact, all Australians-can be so generous, particularly in their own time of need, and think of others. I also want to make special mention of our emergency services people: the SES, our police, our ambulance officers, the Australian Defence Force and a whole range of volunteersordinary people-who just step up and volunteer inordinate amounts of their time to help others in their community. These volunteers are not just relying on the government, not just relyMAIN COMMITTEE ing on somebody else. They say, ‘We are going to get in there and organise ourselves to do things to help others.’ There are incredible stories around of some of the things people did, and they will be the stuff of legend for many years to come. I heard of one lady who just wanted to do something small. She just wanted to contribute something, so she organised to donate some blankets. She donated them to a local group. Word got around, and that led to other people giving things to her to further donate. What started out as just a small pile of blankets turned into a room full of essentials. This turned into several rooms full of gifts, food, blankets and essential items, which then turned into truckloads of goods and finally ballooned into a whole warehouse. It is a lovely thing to hear. It is a great story. We heard a story just before from the member for Brisbane. He recounted the shopkeeper who had realised that, given what was happening and that there was no power, he was going to lose all his stock of sausages, meat and other things. In a true Australian, egalitarian way, he decided the best thing to do was have a barbecue and put the beers on-and to do it for free. It is really touching to hear those stories. It is the human side, the nice side, of tragedy and disaster. These are the stories of a whole heap of ordinary people doing everything they can. I also want to spare a thought for the real impact that these events-the fires in Victoria and the floods in Queensland-have on people’s lives. It is really serious, whether it is a fire or a flood that destroys your life. Even if you survive, you often lose your home. In fires, it is absolutely certain that your home is gone and it will never be the same again. For people in Queensland, their homes may still be there and the waters may recede, but their homes will never be the same. I remember as a child being in the great 1974 floods. My family lived in Inala in the western suburbs. For people who do not know, it is the equivalent of Broadmeadows in Melbourne or Greenway in Sydney-a working-class, western-suburb electorate. I remember living in that part of the world as a child. We were lucky because we were pretty high up. We were a fair way out of Brisbane but were fairly high up on the hill, and we were one of the few houses that were spared. The water lapped pretty close to the family home. Luckily, we had a dinghy, so we could get around the suburb. I am not sure if this is a good thing or a bad thing, given the floods that have taken place in Queensland, but I only have good childhood memories. I hope that is the case for other children in the floods; I know that will not be the case with the fires. At least with the floods, perhaps children will not have bad, hurtful memories that carry on for many years. Sadly, I know that will be the case for fire victims, because the trauma of that is much more severe than the trauma of floods. I remember looking out to Brisbane and seeing, literally, an ocean stretching as far as the eye could see. I know that is the case up in North Queensland. People have lost their homes. They have lost their schools. Their businesses would have been completely ruined. Even if there is insurance, rebuilding is a difficult, emotional task; for some, it is a task they cannot cope with. There will be not only the physical rebuilding but also the emotional rebuilding. There is the need for everybody-for community, for government and for bureaucracies-to understand what it will take. These widespread disasters impact on jobs and infrastructure. Roads and bridges get washed away. I saw this horrible picture of a pothole-and, believe you me, there are quite a few potholes in certain places in Queensland from time to time-that was the size of a station wagon. The water had come in under the road and created this masMAIN COMMITTEE sive sinkhole. All of this is going to cost a lot of money to fix. It will take a lot of effort on the part of governments, both state and federal. Of course, it will take the efforts of local government, as well. The fires and the floods create health issues, the fires with smoke inhalation and dust in the air and the floods with fungus and algae, not to mention the problems of there being no clean drinking water and sewerage waste floating around in water sitting dead in parts of towns and cities. It is not just the simple things like loss of power, not having access to fresh food and all those issues; there are also the clean water and hygiene issues. Australians have this wonderful quality that I have talked about, a quality that we see in a variety of ways. We see it on the sporting field and at other times, but we never see it as strong and as profound as when there is a disaster. The ability of Australians to band together and support each other in a way that cannot be manufactured or confected or artificial is something that happens naturally. It happens out of people’s consciousness and their real belief in other human beings and what can be done to help. That is something that makes me very proud. I know it will make all members of parliament very proud. Nature delivers a lot of cruelty and, in my view, it delivers it indiscriminately. It delivers it in any country, on any people, often without warning. We have seen it in countries such as Indonesia, with tsunami; in Japan, with tsunami and earthquakes; in America, with massive flooding; and in Bangladesh. We have seen the massive loss of life from earthquakes in China and in countries right across the world. We see it now here in Australia. It is normally a custom for us, as Australians, to be on the giving end. We help others. That is what we do; we love to do it. I think it gives us a sense of pride. Perhaps our isolation from the rest of the world provides us with that internal-maybe even emotional-need to give to others so that we feel more connected. Maybe it is because we like to be good neighbours; maybe it is because we actually like our neighbours in the Asia-Pacific and all the other people who live around us. It is always the case that, when there is a natural disaster overseas, we are one of the first countries to step up and volunteer not just money but also people, help and expertise. We try to be there for others. We have seen that on countless occasions, and I am very proud of that as an Australian. This time, when it has been our turn to be on the receiving end of two disasters, I have been really touched by our neighbours, who very quickly, and without being asked, volunteered. They volunteered cash donations, they volunteered to assist and they volunteered people. This was from countries like Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and other countries who are not wealthy, certainly not by our standards. We are a very wealthy country. Regardless of the circumstances we find ourselves in today economically, we are still a wealthy country compared to countries like Indonesia and others. But these countries probably felt not just a sense of duty but also a sense of neighbourly support for us-we have always helped them, yet we have never asked for anything in return, so they thought they would just offer their assistance. I am really proud of them for that, and I think it will draw us closer and closer as neighbours that share the Asia-Pacific region. It is something I will talk about at other opportunities. I think it is something really significant that we should note in terms of the relationship we have with our neighbours. CanI conclude by saying that I feel a lot of empathy for those involved in the tragedy that has gone on in North Queensland. It is certainly not on the scale of the loss of life and tragedy MAIN COMMITTEE that has happened with the fires in Victoria, but I am very proud of everybody in the way they have reacted and responded in these circumstances. It certainly does make you very cognisant, as a member of parliament, of how good people can be, and that is something that we need from time to time. We often talk in this place about the bad things that happen, only the darker side of human nature, but witnessing the beautiful side of human nature is something we all ought to stop and acknowledge. AgainI put on the record my thanks to and appreciation of all the volunteers-everybody who has donated even just a dollar, who has given of their time, who has been there to support others, who has lent a shoulder to cry on or who has been involved in some way in assisting all the victims in Queensland and all the people in Victoria affected by the fire. Cognate bill: Second Reading Debate resumed from 4 February, on motion by Mr Tanner: That this bill be now read a second time. Ms LEY (Farrer) (5.42 pm)-I appreciate the opportunity to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2008-2009 and the related bill. Appropriation bills, as the parliament knows, are about appropriating dollars for government to go about the very important business of funding activities and services within Australia. I want to focus today on a particular concern in my electorate of Farrer, and that is the future of a company called Drivetrain Systems International, or DSI. DSI presently finds itself in a very difficult trading position-not, I have to say, of its own making and certainly hugely influenced by the global financial crisis. I asked a question in the parliament today on behalf of the constituents of my electorate, in particular those in Albury. I asked Mr Rudd for support for Drivetrain Systems International under the Green Car Innovation Fund and, most importantly, for support for the 400 workers and their families who are facing redundancies and job losses. You can imagine that 400 workers lost in a town like Sydney or Melbourne would be quite a shock. Let me tell you that in a town the size of Albury it is savage, is unexpected and will have long-lasting ramifications if in fact those jobs are permanently lost. So my purpose today is to raise this issue in the Parliament of Australia to make sure that we draw a line in the sand if we possibly can for the future of this company and manufacturing in Australia, especially innovative manufacturing, and for job losses that I do not think need to go ahead. Let me clarify that. The company DSI is currently facing liquidation and that, I think, is fairly inevitable. But, following this, the receivers and managers are looking to sell it as a viable proposition, possibly to a global car company. Local reports have identified Mahindra, from India, and Geely, from China, as possible purchasers for the company. We are focusing on two things. The first is the welfare of the workers who, as I said, are facing redundancy. Because the money is not there to pay entitlements-in some cases, accumulated over 20 or 30 years-they are enormously worried and angry about the situation they find themselves in, and that is understandable. SoI am focusing on the welfare of those workers, to make sure that we provide whatever government services are available should they-as MAIN COMMITTEE it seems inevitable they will-face redundancy and be unemployed for a period of time As we know, that time in a person’s life is the most stressful. The second thing we are focusing on is this. On the other side of the equation, I want to be positive and to focus on the future, because while Drivetrain Systems International, I am certain, will be no more-it has had receivers and managers appointed, and is in voluntary administration-I very much want to see a company, if possible a local consortium, take on this company, under a different name obviously, and continue trading and manufacturing transmissions in Australia. That is the most important thing. Let me make it very clear: this is a viable, profitable business. The company DSI has had several incarnations. It is often called by the locals ‘BorgWarner’, because that was what it was for many years, and then it was BTR and then ION, and then it became DSI. So it has travelled a difficult road at times. But it is important to note that it is basically viable. There is no doubt that BTR and BorgWarner took sizeable profits from the company and it provided a lot of returns for the people of Albury and their families. It is actually doing now exactly what we want an Australian export focused company to do. In fact, I think we need another 15 DSIs. Remember that our future lies in integrating ourselves with global trade, and nobody here is talking about protecting Australia from overseas trade influences. The important thing is that Drivetrain Systems International is manufacturing the most elaborately transformed manufactures-and that is a technical term-in Australia today. It is world class. It is competitive on the world stage. It is all-Australian. And 35-plus years of technology have gone into this company. I want to stress the key role that this company plays in manufacturing technology and consequent spin-off employment in Australia. Over all of the last 40 years, DSI and its predecessors have developed a great deal of technology. And that technology has been highly soughtafter by overseas companies. Interacting with DSI has helped other companies hone their skills which, in turn, have been transferred to other high-tech manufacturers throughout Australia. So it has played a critical role across Australian manufacturing industry, and allowing it to disappear would actually undo a great deal of this work, much of it done in the 1920s and 1930s-part of industrialising Australia and making it a world-class economy. So, as I said, this company is doing exactly what we want it to do. With all our AusIndustry and export focused programs, we have the perfect example here. The receivers, I presume, are looking for overseas purchasers and domestic purchasers, too. I would like to make a plea to our industry minister and to our government to turn their attention to this problem and to engage with what is happening in Albury. I would like to see a local capital-raising, a new management team, perhaps a stock market float. But to have a successful local company, I think we need a local customer-if we are serious about manufacturing in Australia and an automotive industry. That local customer has for many years been Ford. Ford has played a critical role in the development of DSI. I thank them for what they as a company, Ford Australia, have given to my local regional economy and industries over so many years. The company at the moment is finalising the manufacture of a four-speed gearbox for Ford, and also has in its production capability a six-speed, rear-wheel drive gearbox, also for a later Ford model. DSI has invested-I read in the press today-about $40 million on developing a gearbox for its major current customer, which is SsangYong from Korea. This is a front-wheel drive, MAIN COMMITTEE six-speed electric gearbox. As many know, SsangYong is currently in receivership and discussions are being had between it and its Chinese parent about whether it will in fact cease manufacturing in Korea altogether. This is the point: the main customer of Drivetrain Systems International has folded, as a result of the global financial crisis, and that has put this company, and Australian transmission manufacturing, in a very difficult position. It is also the case that DSI has manufactured, or has gone a large way towards manufacturing, a hybrid petrol-electric gearbox. That might have been for SsangYong, its main customer; I am not sure. There is no doubt that I am not an expert on types of gearboxes or whether there are gearboxes looking for cars or cars looking for gearboxes in different parts of our manufacturing industry, but what I do know is that it would be a tragedy to lose this manufacturing industry from Australia. There is no doubt that the worldwide auto industry is in a very difficult position. I understand that Volvo in Sweden is close to closing, and there are huge bailouts happening across Europe and America. General Motors Opel in Germany is receiving, or has asked for, a $7 billion bailout. The amount of dollars that we are talking about here-the support that we are asking for from government-is not large, but it would not be in the form of a bailout either. We are talking about basically a viable production process going through a difficult period. Some have said that to continue manufacturing for the next few months for Ford would be like a bridge to the future, when hybrid transmissions are going to be far more in demand. That is something that the government and its green car package should be supporting. As local members, we know that, when we are looking for assistance for industries in our electorates, we need to find a government program, and, once we have found one, we sometimes have won half the battle. There is a government program in this instance, and it is called the Green Car Innovation Fund. The Prime Minister and the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, Senator Carr, in December last year promised that $6 billion would flow under this fund to support the Australian automotive industry and to keep manufacturing here in Australia. Applications for the fund open in July this year, so it is not possible for them to be made at this stage, but I really hope that our government will sit down at the table with the people who have the future interests of this company or this type of manufacturing at heart, and with Ford Australia, and demonstrate what they, as the government, could provide in support under the green car fund. As I told these workers that I represent-400 families in the district-at a meeting last Friday, I do not want to fight for their Centrelink benefits; I want to fight for their jobs. I know that the company they work for is folding, but it is so very important that another company takes its place. For us to lose the intellectual property, the research and development-as I said, a hybrid gearbox, a new generation six-speed electric front-wheel drive gearbox, which is the way of the future-and for that all to be packed up and sent overseas, perhaps to China and India, would be a tragedy for Australian manufacturing. I asked Mr Rudd about this in question time. I hope that he will turn his attention to the question that I asked. The Prime Minister did not appear to be in tune with what was actually happening with DSI. That does not surprise me, because he has got a lot on his plate at the moment, but, having asked the question, I hope that he and his office now turn their attention to what is going on here and take sensible steps to rescue an Australian manufacturing industry that is a world leader in innovation, research and development. MAIN COMMITTEE because I think it gives members of parliament some licence. got the look! But it does provide members of parliament with the opportunity to have some wide-ranging debate and to express views on many issues that are related to the appropriation of funds. In particular, I think the area of finance and deregulation is an appropriate area to speak about. Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2008-2009 together with Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2008-2009 amounts to $3.1 billion, or about 4.1 per cent of total annual appropriations. It touches on all the key areas of the economy and matters that are so critical at a time of global financial crisis. These are things that everyone in this parliament should be supporting, encouraging and communicating back to their electorates, as I know members of the government are. But, sadly, we see members of the opposition pretending in here that they do not support our measures. They certainly voted against our stimulus package but I am sure that at the same time that they voted against the package they secretly wanted it to get up because they want the money for their schools and for jobs in their electorates, and they want to make sure that the economy-at least I hope they do-does not collapse in the end. Perhaps it is just a bit of bravado, a bit of licence, a bit of political opportunism and political opposition for opposition’s sake that that opposition votes against such a critical and important measure to stave off the worse impacts of the global financial crisis. I hope that that is all it is. I hope that they do not actually believe that voting against the stimulus package was the right thing to do, because it was absolutely not the right thing to do. package. What do they mean by that? Is it a bad package because they do not like the size of it or is it a bad package because there are parts of it that they do not particularly support? I will touch on both of those areas. But even if it were a bad package-and I do not believe it is the opposition voted against it. They voted against schools, they voted against jobs, they voted against families and they voted against pensioners at the very same time that they were out there saying: ‘More, more, more; we need more money for schools, more money for roads and more money for jobs. Why isn’t the government doing something?’ Well, the government is doing something, and what it is doing it has done in two tranches-two very significant phases. In fact everything we have done has an underpinning theme. That underpinning theme has been jobs, jobs, jobs: job security, job maintenance and job creation. We have heard all sorts of rhetoric in the House about job loss numbers, job creation numbers, how many jobs were created before and after and all the rest of it. The reality is that we need to invest if we are going to create jobs and sustain and maintain jobs or at least wash away the worse impacts of the global financial crisis. Let me start by first dealing with the global financial crisis and what took us to the place that we are at today, which is of critical importance and should be of critical importance to everybody in this House and to all Australians.

222,Mr Ripoll,"I just heard a comment from a member of the opposition that it is a badFinancial and a whole range of others-particularly in America saw a collapse. That led to other countries falling into similar circumstances, which created, for want of a full explanation, a global financial crisis. Australia is not immune. Australia has not been left out of things of a global nature that have happened. While our economy is resisting-I think we will all agree-the worse impacts and effects, it is still being dragged down like other economies. We are not as badly off as the United States of America and the position they find themselves in, either in terms of debt, or in terms of trying to manage the global financial crisis in their own country or trying to manage job losses. So we are not as bad as the United States. We are not as bad as Great Britain. In London we are seeing massive job losses-we are seeing a collapse of financial services sector jobs. We are nowhere near as bad as that. We are nowhere near as bad as Europe. In Europe we are seeing some of the worse effects of the global financial crisis. And we are nowhere near as bad as Japan, where, very unfortunately they have slipped from a recession to a depression. I would say very clearly and confidently that the reason that Australia is managing to stave off the absolute worse impacts and effects of the global financial crisis is the strong, decisive, quick and considered action that the Rudd government is taking in terms of ameliorating those impacts. We not do that to make ourselves feel good. We do not do that because we are going to get a pat on the back. We are doing that in the national interest because it is our responsibility. It is our job; it is something we must do. It is something we need to do to protect families, to protect jobs, to make sure that we still have an economy in six months time, in nine months time or in 12 months time. So we come into this place and we hear the hollow, shallow rhetoric that we get from members who are not quite sure how they should deal with this. They are caught, they are trapped. They are trapped deep down, knowing they ought to be supporting what we are doing. Even if they do not agree with all of it, that does not really matter. They know the package is needed. As I said earlier, if it is a disagreement about the size of the package, then tell us the size of your package. Is it $42 billion or $40 billion or $25 billion? What should it be? We are not getting that, but we can do the sums pretty quickyou this: if we started adding up all of the individual commitments that members of the opposition have been making, it ain’t a $42 billion package; it is about an $80 billion package. That is the reality of what is coming from the opposition. And why is that the case? Why are we getting that from individual opposition members? Because they do not have a clear strategy. They do not have a plan. They are just looking at this global financial crisis and the situation in Australia as a political opportunity. For them it is an opportunity to attack the government, blame the government, blame the states-blame anybody, but take no responsibility. I will not make too big a point of it because, in the end, it is only coming from an LNP member-the Liberal National Party-particularly a Queensland LNP member who has no authority, no mandate, no credibility at all. sure.

226,Mr Ripoll,"I will take the interjection: are they a real party? Ask them. They are notwere just a political game, as if there were no losers in this game. The sad reality is the losers in this game are ordinary Australians. They are ordinary people relying on their government, their elected officials, to assist in a time when every other economy and every other country in the world is doing something right now. If we do not do something right now, we will follow the same circumstances that are happening in those other economies-in America, in Great Britain, in Europe and in parts of Asia, in Japan and so on. What is our strategy? What are we doing? As a government, what have we decided is the right course of action? The question would have to be: have we just decided this on a whim on our own, or have we consulted? These are serious questions. What are the circumstances? I will deal with those. We do have a plan, we do have a strategy, and it is quite clear. We are in the second phase of that strategy. The first one was the pre-Christmas $10 billion stimulus package. It came hot on the heels of probably the most direct need at that very critical time, that Christmas retail period, to protect jobs. How do you protect jobs? You make sure you put a stimulus right into people’s back pockets and that you do it through families and you do it through pensioners, and that is exactly what we did. Funnily enough, the opposition opposed this, but at the same time were calling for a massive increase in pensions. So which one was it? This is the hard thing for them to sell. On the one hand they oppose it, and on the other hand they support it. It is pretty hard to get a sense of what direction the opposition are heading in. It does make it really clear that there isn’t one, that the Leader of the Opposition is looking for an opportunity. In the end, that is all it is: it is self-interest, and opportunism. It is, ‘Where is my next opportunity?’ It is not, ‘What is the national interest?’ It is not, ‘Is this package in the best interests of Australians, even if it’s not a perfect package?’ No government ever creates a perfect set of packages when trying to deliver something, but at least this one met to a T and met absolutely what the IMF was saying was critically necessary in Australia. The IMF said that. Who else supported us in this? We have heard some people say that it must be those leftist communists in ACCI or in the Business Council of Australia, those old Labor Party hacks that are working there. They ticked it off and they thought it was absolutely spot-on. Perhaps it was just the unions, all of them, that said, ‘We need to do this to protect jobs.’ Of course, what would unions know about jobs and workers and protecting jobs! Or perhaps it was just Treasury that supported this package and said, ‘This needs to be done now; you can’t wait and see,’ because, if there was a strategy that you could articulate about the opposition, it would be the wait-and-see strategy. They are the exact words of the former shadow Treasurer. I understand the Treasury portfolio is a technical and very complex portfolioThe former shadow Treasurer obviously could not deliver in that portfolio because her only strategy-it is pretty simple; you could probably write it on a very small piece of paper-was, ‘We’re just going to wait and see.’ My question was: wait to see what? Wait to see people lose their homes, wait to see unemployment rise, wait to see small businesses collapse, go under, fail-wait to see what? The rest of the world is already going down that path at an alarming rate. It is one of the greatest crises the world has ever faced. But the reaction from the opposition and from the former shadow Treasurer was: ‘Let’s just sit on our hands. Let’s just wait and see.’ MAIN COMMITTEE",138,Appropriation Bill No 4 2008 2009

228,Mr Ripoll,"I will take the interjection; I will come to small business in just a moment.jected, ‘What about small business?’ That is good question. We have actually got a huge stimulus package aimed at small business. It is about reducing red tape, bureaucracy. It is about accessing the tax system, about the way that they pay tax, about arrangements in terms of depreciation. It is about putting money into people’s pockets so they put it back into the retail sector, which supports small business, which keeps jobs in small business. You cannot separate them. This is what the opposition fail to understand. They try to separate the injection of cash into the economy as a stimulus, and jobs. We have all the evidence of it now. It is irrefutable. Retail sales in Australia went up. In contrast to every other economy in the world, ours were the only ones that went up-and they went up directly on the back of our stimulus package in that period. Now, that is not something that happens in isolation. What that did was keep people in jobs. It kept people in retail employmentrefrain from interjecting. There is ample opportunity in this place to have your say. started, this package is about three things. It is about jobs, jobs and jobs. It is about, for the first time in probably three decades, making a massive investment in our schools and school communities. You need to think about what that really means. If the reactions that I have got from my electorate, from my school principals, from my P&F presidents and from the school communities are anything like the reactions that opposition members are getting from theirs, then I fear for them. My school principals and school communities are overjoyed by the package that we have presented to them-the investment in schools. We think it is a good package. We think it is actually worth spending money on schools to better educate our children. We do not think it is a cost; we think it is an investment: an investment in people’s future. This mob voted against it. They voted against schools. They voted against their own kids’ futures and education. This is the first time in over 30 years that we have had some serious money spent on schools, schools that have been trying to inject some pride and some standards and to build facilities-replace the demountable classrooms and provide real 21stcentury facilities-to give our kids a better shot. And what did those guys opposite do? They voted against it. They voted against money for their own schools. Did they do that because they thought that was the best strategy? No. They did it out of pride, self-interest, opportunism. There is no way that anyone could go out to a school and stand before a school community and say, ‘I don’t want you to get $3 million for a brand new library, because your kids don’t deserve a library.’ Opposition members are standing up and saying, ‘Your kids don’t deserve a school hall; they can sit out in the elements in winter and summer.’ How can I prove that the opposition members are doing that? Because they voted against funding for schools. ThatI could not comprehend. Even if you did not like the whole package, on that alone you would have to say: what were the opposition members thinking? I have got an answer as to what they were thinking. They were thinking about themselves-not about the economy, not about the national interest, not about anybody else: opposition for opposition’s sake.

As I said when IWe have invested in infrastructure-and it makes me really proud, as a government member-in a way I did not even contemplate was possible. I wanted to deliver a lot to my community and to the broader community out of us winning government. I wanted to build roads because roads had not been built for over a decade-in some cases, for nearly 15 years, spanning two governments. But there was no will and no commitment from the former government after 12 years in office in the best economic times globally, in the best economic times this country has seen for a long time-the resources boom, rivers of gold that used to flow into Canberra, when money used to rain from the sky, when unexpected windfall gains of $50 billion to the bottom line in the economy meant you could do anything you wanted in government. Everything you spent-tax cuts and everything else-was completely offset by windfalls of $50 billion at a time. Something like $400 billion of unexpected windfall was delivered to government through tax revenues, the rivers of gold which flowed in because of a booming economy. What did they do with the unbelievable opportunity? For the most part they squandered it. They just threw it away. They had a great party. I can remember them smiling from ear to ear. They were never going to lose government. Nobody was clever enough to figure out that there was no money going back into communities, that schools had not seen a red dollar for more than a decade. ‘Let’s just blame the states for everything and let’s forget that the states rely on federal funding to deliver programs and education in schools. So let’s disregard all of that and concentrate on blaming other people. We’ll have a great big party.’ When the party was over, they woke up with that huge headache and a big mess to clean up, looked around and said, ‘Who made the mess?’ I ask opposition members: who made the mess? I am not saying that the opposition and then Howard government created the financial crisis. That would be ridiculous, even though that is what they are trying to imply in terms of this government’s performance since coming to office. Nobody is being fooled by that. Nobody believes that for a minute. Even they do not believe it. They are completely disingenuous. In the last few days, we have really seen what the opposition is all about. We have seen the former shadow Treasurer being discounted away and ejected out of the position. It is too complex, too difficult. It is a very difficult job. You would think that the member for North Sydney, Joe Hockey, would have been the second choice, but he was not; he was third choice, so two scalps have been claimed. The second choice was Peter Costello, but he is too proud, too self-interested to do a job for the country. Maybe the country does deserve to have him there. If he is as good as he says he is, why is he not there serving his country, serving the people? If he is the best person on the opposition benches, why is he not there? I have already answered that: self-interest. He is not going to lower himself to the role of shadow Treasurer when he believes he ought to be the leader. I do not have to give him any advice because his own party has already done that. The reality is that Australia and the world faces one of the greatest crises we have probably ever faced, certainly in many generations. We have a couple of choices to make as members of parliament about how we deal with the situation. Either you can completely oppose for the sake of opposing all the measures-the stimulus packages, the funding we are providing to stimulate job creation and keep people spending, the banking guarantee to ensure that our banking system does not collapse and that there is not a run on banks, all of those integral MAIN COMMITTEE parts in making sure our economy survives-or you can just oppose about leadership, about who gets which spoils of defeat, about rank opportunism. That to me is not right and is not what an opposition should be about. (Time expired) normally opportunities for laps around the electorate with particular significance because of the release of money, and while I recognise the significance of the many good aspects of Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2008-2009 and cognate bill, I certainly raise some concerns about aspects of this legislation, so much so that, on balance, I will be asking for the bills to be returned to the House for a division when all the speakers are done. I will do that for the following reasons. One is an issue of process in a key area, and it concerns the $14 million being allocated through this legislation for climate change advertising and promotion for the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. For me, it is a case of that cliche in politics, the cart before the horse. You only need to read any of the media in the past week to see that there is plenty of politics to be played out with regard to both the introduction of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme following the white paper process and the process of steering it through the parliament. I think the government have to do a fair bit of work to get it through in the form that I am sure they want. Therefore, for me, it is odd and also inappropriate for the question to be put for $14 million to be released by Finance for a national advertising campaign to raise public awareness of climate change. That in itself is questionable because there is certainly a heightened awareness within the community about climate change, but in particular I question the use of taxpayers’ dollars to ask the community to participate in a scheme that we as members of parliament have not even seen and are yet to debate. We are certainly looking forward to that, but at this stage the ‘for sale’ sign simply cannot go up. Maybe we could consider it in four months time if the CPRS gets through in the clean form in which the government wants it to get through. But I think it is a classic example of the cart before the horse to ask us to agree to a significant advertising and promotion campaign. Fourteen million dollars might not sound much around these hallways, but in the community’s mind I think that is substantial dollars and deserves a revisit once the CPRS goes through, if it does, in the form we are expecting. On a similar topic, there is an issue about the inconsistencies in the narrative on climate change contained within this bill. Whilst in general there are some fantastic aspects in this bill, I want to highlight some that are of concern. The first one is the AusAID commitment. I have family who work for AusAID and I am certainly not one to bash international aid dollars, because I think we have global responsibilities. But there is an allocation here of $150 million to the World Bank, with $50 million for the trust fund established to respond to the global food price crisis. That is one of the first acknowledgements I have seen in my short time here that government does recognise it has a role to play in addressing an increasingly difficult and challenging area for government policy and global consideration-that is, the global food price crisis we are facing. Yet at the same time, in the same bill, we see an allocation of $37 million for the ethanol production grants program, with the development of the concept of food for fuel within Australia. As that concept has developed over recent years, I have to say that from my point of view it looks to be largely driven by vested interests within the various agricultural sectors. This allocation is entirely inconsistent with the $50 million allocation being made to the World Bank. For West Wing fans, you only need to see the epiMAIN COMMITTEE",140,Appropriation Bill No 4 2008 2009
234,Mr Oakeshott (Lyne) (6.14 Pm),"While I acknowledge that appropriation bills aresode called ‘The Pledge’ to know exactly where my cynicism is coming from about grain ethanol production and the $37 million allocation. Sitting alongside that in the legislation is the allocation to the World Bank to recognise Australia’s responsibilities and role with regard to the global food price crisis. As I said, that is an inconsistency within this legislation. I hope the coalition and the non-executive members of caucus will give further consideration to that inconsistency in the narrative we are currently working through on climate change. The second inconsistency in narrative, to me, is this allocation of $100 million to the Clean Technology Fund-again through the World Bank-which ‘will offer development finance at highly concessional rates for transformative investments in low-carbon technologies by developing countries in the transportation and power sectors and in energy efficient buildings, industry and agriculture’. Again, the rights and wrongs of international aid can be debated by others, but this does show that government recognises the need for transformative policy and investment in transformative policies overseas. Yet, within Australia, the allocation in this bill is $99 million-no small bickies-for the carbon capture and storage institute. I certainly hope that is a success. I fully recognise that my vote against this legislation is not going to stop this legislation going through, so I certainly hope that institute succeeds in proving the concept of carbon capture and storage. However, it is an unproven science. I would hope that most of us recognise that. more reason to have the centre. I am throwing the opportunity now to the coalition to read the front page of the Sydney Morning Herald today where biochar was put up as an option by the coalition and the comment in response from the minister for agriculture was that it is an unproven science that has potential and deserves further consideration. If this is unproven and recognised as unproven, a $99 million allocation of taxpayers’ dollars as a response, sitting alongside a fund overseas that is getting $100 million for transformative investment in lowcarbon technologies, again has inherent inconsistencies in its narrative for Australia. That is my view in regard to the Clean Technology Fund. I think that is a direction that the world needs to be heading in, not just developing countries, and I would love to see more clean technology being funded within Australia. I do note at the same time with regard to the carbon capture and storage institute some lovely semantic name changes also happening. We saw it with the concept of ‘global warming’, where that took a name change because it was seen as too harsh. It was, I guess, softened to take on the new name of ‘climate change’. We are now seeing the ‘National Clean Coal Fund’ softened to the ‘National Low Emissions Coal Initiative’. Again, that is hopefully a recognition by government that some of what I consider to be vested interest claims on the climate change debate are not successful in capturing community expectations and community wants in regard to solving real problems at a community level. The concept of clean coal, in my view, is also one that should be questioned and that we should all be sceptics about. Hopefully, the debate is moving from one on sceptics about climate change to one on who is and is not sceptical about certain responses to climate change. In my view we deserve, as a community and as a country, to have high levels of scepticism about what is driving particular responses by government to issues such as clean coal, and carbon capture and storage. We should be sceptical because, unless there is a part of this story MAIN COMMITTEE",142,Appropriation Bill No 4 2008 2009
235,Mr Champion,All the more reason to have a centre.,143,Appropriation Bill No 4 2008 2009
236,Mr Oakeshott,"The interjection is that, because it is unproven science, that is all thethat is not being told, the response looks to be driven by vested interests rather than governments genuinely dealing with real problems on the ground within communities like the midNorth Coast of New South Wales. There are huge opportunities, whether they are in clean technologies, solar technology or solar thermal technology. There is a whole raft of engaging opportunities at a community level, yet the big bickies look to be going elsewhere. The third reason to go against this, with regard to the overall appropriation bill, is not climate change but related issues. I hope, again, that everyone in this place might think of reviewing the $28 million allocation to the Australian pavilion at the Shanghai Expo in 2010, bearing in mind what is clearly a tsunami going through world economies. If we try and look forward to 2010, I am not sure whether that $28 million spend is necessarily the best message or the right message for Australia to be sending. I think of David Jones putting on tea and scones this year at their fashion expo rather than the champagne and all the bells and whistles. Maybe a statement from Australia that we are conscious of the importance and value of money in the current climate would be a strong domestic message and might even be a better international message for consideration. As well, an issue for concern-it is not a reason to oppose the legislation-is the further $21 million allocation for Australia’s financial regulators to ‘maintain the strength’ of Australia’s financial system during the global financial crisis. I recognise that we have a strong economy; however, I think there is some work to be done with regard to some accountability trails and some strengthening of the regulators that we have in this country today-not necessarily the regulators of the private sector but those that regulate the public sector. This has been well positioned as a private sector crisis; however I think the untold story of the last 18 months is the public sector crisis. There is an amount of taxpayers’ money at the three tiers of government, and in all the various roles that those three tiers play, that has been lost or at the very least exposed. I think it would be-and this is being conservative-in the hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayers’ money. I have a council in my region that has $25 million exposed due to their taking on questionable CDOs. Importantly, the council argues that they were within the state Treasury Corporation guidelines. And there have been reports from councils in other locations. I understand there is a council in WA that has an exposure in the $80 million class. This is the untold story where we need to start to see some good work done in going down the accountability trail to find out who is exposed and to what extent, who is accountable and to what extent, and who is in breach of investment guidelines and to what extent. And probably of more concern is that, if no-one is in breach, how on earth did we end up with so much exposure? Were people with taxpayers’ money in the public sector taking due care in protecting capital or were people chasing risky investments with taxpayers’ money in order to try and make a buck for services, such as those run by local councils, which are already stretched? You can include in all of this semistatutory and non-statutory bodies. You can think of the non-government education sector. There is exposure all down the trail of the public sector, yet the story has yet to be told or explored. I think it is the role of the federal parliament to take a lead on that, to start to call to account those who were in breach of regulatory investment strategies in particular and, if there were no breaches, to start to clean up those guidelines throughout the country to make sure that taxpayers’ dollars are treated with the premium that they deserve to be treated with. MAIN COMMITTEE Having said all that, in the remaining time. I am very conscious to welcome many aspects of this legislation. The Organ and Tissue Donation and Transplantation Authority, I think, is excellent. I went along to the ‘gift of life’ ceremony this morning with the Prime Minister, and I congratulate the government on the work they are doing in regard to organ and tissue donation and transplantation. In my particular area, it will be something that is promoted to try and get as many organ donors as possible involved in the national campaign. That is good work being done by government. The Prevocational GP Placements Program is one that is really important to the mid-North Coast of New South Wales. The breast cancer drug initiative is good. The Job Capacity Assessment program is good. These are all incredibly relevant to various aspects of life within my region and, I suspect, around the 149 other electorates in Australia. The Sustainable Rural Water Use and Infrastructure program is good. I think the local government study program and the centre of excellence at a university are also timelyin fact, in many cases well overdue considering what I was just talking about, the exposures at a local level in regard to financial planning. I also put on the record, in that regard, a separate council that I represent, Greater Taree City Council, which has just had Percy Allan, who would be known to many people in this room, go through the backlog of maintenance just on local roads and bridges within its area. The figure that it now has to deal with is $140 million of backlog. For those who are going to be critical of me being antsy about various moneys going here, there and everywhere, I hope you understand that I have a maintenance backlog of $140 million for local roads and bridges; that is the standout problem for the southern part of the electorate of Lyne. It is not, at the moment, part of the responsibility of the federal government, but the reality is that it is the problem that my communities face and therefore it is the problem that I and, I hope, government at all levels are willing and, hopefully, able to assist in addressing over time. I know there are a lot of speakers who have emerged on the list. When the time comesprobably in a few weeks-I will certainly be calling for this to be returned to the House of Representatives and will be voting against this legislation unless those changes are considered by all and relevant changes are made. 2008-2009 and the cognate bill. I think their passage is essential to the stability of the Australian economy and to the good works that the government is doing for the well-being of the Australian people. I want to concentrate on, perhaps in less detail than the former speaker, the member for Lyne, and talk a little bit about the car industry and vehicle manufacturing-in particular, the early signs of success of the government’s $6.2 billion car plan. This car plan was designed to drive investment to make the Australian car industry both economically and environmentally efficient. I think that is a very important goal, and it is coming at precisely the right time. While I did notice other speakers talking about manufacturing plants being in trouble in Albury, there are some positive signs. In the electorate of Corio, I know that Ford has reversed its decision to close an engine plant. I think that is the first time in living memory that a corporate player, a company, has changed its mind about the closure of a plant. It is an extraordinary decision and a real vote of confidence in not only Geelong but also the government’s support for this industry. It is really welcome. MAIN COMMITTEE",143,Appropriation Bill No 4 2008 2009
237,Mr Champion (Wakefield) (6.33 Pm),"I rise to support Appropriation Bill (No. 3)The second indication of the car plan’s success-and I think this is a very big indication of the early signs of success-is the announcement by General Motors Holden last December of its intention to build a new front-wheel drive, four-cylinder car at its factory in Elizabeth. This was a big day for Elizabeth in late December. The Prime Minister visited the factory. It was closed down at the time for its maintenance period, and most of the workers were on holidays, but we still had around 1,500 workers show up to the plant in their uniforms for this announcement. There was a tremendously positive feel. Lots of workers were holding signs up about the new car and about the vote of confidence in the Elizabeth plant that this is. A lot of families and a lot of kids were really enjoying not just the Prime Minister’s presence but also the commitment of the company and the government to this vital manufacturing plant in my electorate. The new car is going to be part of the global Delta small-car platform. It is a vehicle which will be integrated into the global operations of GM. That is incredibly important. In the Bracks review, one of the issues-particularly around components but also around vehicle manufacturing-was that automotive products need to be integrated into the global platforms of these companies. That is increasingly where the car industry will go in the future. I think this immediate crisis will drive that process and accelerate it in some instances. It is really an important feature of this car. It will support up to 1,200 jobs in the factory in my electorate and it is critically important for not just those manufacturing jobs but also all the component suppliers that exist in the northern and southern suburbs of Adelaide. In the city of Playford, one in four workers is employed in manufacturing, so it is of vital importance to the local area. These jobs are going to be green-collar just as much as blue-collar jobs. They are secured by cooperation between the company, the workers, the union and both levels of government. The Rann government in South Australia is to be congratulated for its commitment. Premier Rann was there on the day, which was a welcome sign of state and federal cooperation. But it is also worth noting that Holden’s workers, led by their local delegate, Mr Paul Brown, and the vehicle division of the AMWU, were very disciplined and moderate in their claims during the enterprise bargaining agreement negotiations which happened just prior to this announcement. That was really critical, because it showed real commitment to the new project. The two were linked. That future investment was, I think, linked to the successful conclusion of the EBA negotiations. Importantly, the new vehicle is going to be about 20 per cent more fuel efficient than current vehicles. It is going to emit about 20 per cent less carbon. It is a green car. Its production lays the foundation for the introduction of hybrid engines, the use of ethanol, the use of LPG and the use of CNG. All of those things are very important in the evolution of not just this small car but also other Australian made cars to more fuel efficient and more environmentally friendly vehicle design. The federal government is contributing $149 million over three years to this projectmoney that will be very well spent to support a new car, local jobs and investment in the future. Despite the critics-and there are many critics inside this parliament and outside of itthe government is absolutely committed to backing this industry and to making sure that we have future investment in this industry so that General Motors Holden will still be around and there will still be workers employed in that factory long after I have retired from parliament. MAIN COMMITTEE There are many naysayers in the press who want to constantly run a negative story about these things. It is disappointing that there are critics in the opposition. Only last year the member for North Sydney, the new shadow Treasurer, told the Sunday program: ‘I don’t know that it is necessarily the right thing to do to hand money immediately to the motor vehicle industry.’ That is what was said, at that time, by the new shadow Treasurer. Basically it is the wait-andsee approach, the ‘we’re not going to help’ approach. I think that the new car announcement has proved critics like the member for North Sydney wrong. The government rejects that sort of armchair-general approach to economic management, where you sort of sit back and wait and see. We want to take action. We want to be ahead of the curve. We know that it is important not just for triggering new investment in this industry but for the economy as a whole. It is incredibly good news for the car industry in my electorate; but we know that there are problems facing global automotive manufacturing, and there is no hiding from that. There is also no hiding from the fact that there are ramifications for our car industry in South Australia. In the local paper, the News Review Messenger, on 4 February this year, there was an article with the headline ‘On an enforced holiday’. It talked about the program of planned shutdowns of the Elizabeth plant. There are some 25 days of scheduled shutdowns. Workers in that plant are either taking holidays or they are on 50 per cent of their pay, thanks to their enterprise bargaining agreement negotiated by their union. But even then we find workers are looking in other areas for work. Paul Brown, a senior shop steward, was quoted in this article as saying that workers are ‘looking in landscaping and gardening, helping friends out in small businesses, stuff like that’. I think that shows that those workers need the government on their side. They need the government to do what it is currently doing in terms of the Nation Building and Jobs Plan. They could not afford delay in that program. They could not afford the wait-and-see approach of the Liberal Party. By the time we wait and see, it will be too late. And if you wait and see, there is an opportunity cost. If we had taken that approach to the car industry, we would have missed out on this new investment. Communities like Elizabeth, Salisbury and Gawler understand from practical experience what the Liberal Party do not understand, and that is: action is required immediately. We cannot afford indecision and we cannot afford division at this time, either in this parliament or within the Liberal Party. It is so disappointing, at a time when workers in my electorate have got 25 days of planned shutdowns and are looking at other areas to work in, like doing work in small business, that we have got two senior members of respective factions of the Liberal Party in my state-a senator and the new Manager of Opposition Business in the Housearguing about what was said at a golf game 14 years ago. It is absolutely extraordinary. It is a bit like the Great Gatsbyv Little Lord Fauntleroy-just incredibly childish. I think that the Liberal Party have got to get their act together. They have got to start supporting the car industry rather than knocking it and they have got to come to grips with the nature of the new economic challenge. There is this attitude in the Liberal Party in which they think that we exist in a bubble in 2007, when mining royalties and the commodities boom were driving government revenue, and that nothing has changed, but the reality is that we have had the most serious collapse in the world economy since the 1930s. We have seen a retraction of credit. We have seen the collapse of international banks, the collapse of international consumer confidence and the loss of jobs from indebted companies. There was recently an article in Time magazine that had an MAIN COMMITTEE example of some of the banks in America. Citibank, for instance, received $45 billion in assistance from the TARP, the Troubled Assets Relief Program from the US government, and the value of the bank at the time of this article was $22.9 billion. It gives you an idea that, even though government is acting in the United States, we face an extraordinary situation with international banks, and that is having massive effects on economies around the world. Likewise, there was an article in Foreign Policy which was headlined ‘The List: the Next Iceland’. It goes through five economies-I will not go through all of them-and calls Great Britain ‘Reykjavik-on-Thames’. It says: The question in Britain is no longer when the economy will enter a recession, but when it will enter a depression, with many bracing for a slump that could rival the 1930s in severity. There is no doubt that, internationally, we face extraordinary challenges, and that will have an effect on the Australian economy. We know that the Governor of the Bank of England, Mervyn King, has warned that the UK is in deep recession in 2009. There was a bit of talk about sales in the United Kingdom in the House today. It seems to me that things in the United Kingdom are very serious indeed. We know that the government has to act ahead of the curve. That was best highlighted by Rupert Murdoch, head of News Corporation, who was quoted in The Age on Saturday, 7 February: “The downturn in Australia is very late,” he told an investor briefing. “It is beginning to hit now, but we are not yet feeling it the way we have felt it in Britain.” We can see the signs, overseas, of a very serious economic situation and that is why it has been important for the government to act and to take strong, decisive and extraordinary action in order to support our economy. That is why it is important that we guaranteed deposits, something that has helped our banks raise the funds they need from overseas. It is why it was important for us to have the Economic Security Strategy, which supported pensioners, pumped money into the economy before Christmas and helped to support the retail sector. There is plenty of positive evidence, both in retail sales and anecdotally from retailers. I was talking today to a furniture manufacturer in my electorate who employs 20 or so people making furniture, which is a really great thing to do, and he says he has not seen the effect of the economic downturn in main street sales. But if you go a couple of steps behind and talk to engineering firms, they are certainly seeing it. There is no doubt in my mind that the government’s strategy in December is working, and there is no doubt in my mind that the Nation Building and Jobs Plan will also work. Workers in my electorate will certainly welcome the $900 bonus for lowand middleincome families and singles and to students, to drought affected farmers and to single-income families. They will also welcome the support for tradespeople in the building industry; the largest ever single investment in housing to build 20,000 new defence homes, many of which are in my electorate-there is a $26 million commitment in Wakefield; 500 new science labs or language centres in secondary schools; funding for maintenance and school building upgrades; and tax breaks for small business. These are all really important measures and, as I said before, we know that a great many of our measures are already working. On 12 February a headline in the Sydney Morning Herald read ‘Housing shines amid more economic gloom’. Basically it talks about new home buyers charging into the market and taking advantage of the government’s grant program to get an asset that they will hold, hopefully, for the rest of their lives. MAIN COMMITTEE So we think these projects are incredibly important. We know that the communities we represent have welcomed the action we have taken to support the banks, the action we took in December to support pensioners and the action we have taken to support new home buyers and that they will also support the Nation Building and Jobs Plan and the measures we are taking to build public schools and to improve the nation’s homes through insulation. They know that this government is ahead of the curve and is taking action to ensure that we have a good and strong economy in a time of international peril. I commend the bills to the House. (No. 3) 2008-2009 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2008-2009 I want to range fairly wide and talk about commentary we currently have from the Prime Minister and his now famous, or infamous, essay entitled ‘The global financial crisis’, in which he said: …barely 30 years since the triumph of neo-liberalism-that particular brand of free-market fundamentalism, extreme capitalism and excessive greed which became the economic orthodoxy of our time. That could not be a statement which is further from the truth. There has been a great deal of theorising and fantasy making by our Prime Minister in trying to explain why his left-wing ideology is about to become the orthodoxy. He likes to say that the market failed, that capitalism failed and that there was too little regulation and therefore it collapsed. Nothing could be further from the truth. The case is in fact the direct opposite. There was too much regulation and there was bad centralised government policy, and the combination of all those things meant that the market did not fail; it was excluded. I would like to talk now about an act that had its origins in the United States in 1977 under Jimmy Carter called the Community Reinvestment Act 1977. This was an act that was passed which was designed to force banks to lend into areas which were known as red-lined areas, where the banks had decided that there were certain pieces of geography in their territory where repayments would be difficult to get and therefore they would not lend into those areas. This act was designed to make the banks lend into those areas. It was reasonably benign in the early years. You could put an ad in the paper to say that loans were available and you could satisfy the CRA requirements and go about your banking business. In those days, of course, the American banking system was different from ours. There was no real interstate banking; they were very much chartered banks and they were limited to geographic areas. But this geographic concept has become quite significant in the problem which has resulted in the United States and which has now spread throughout the world. In 1994 there was the beginning of the liberalisation of banking in the United States whereby they could have interstate banking and whereby they could open further branches and so on. But in 1995 Clinton introduced new regulations under the Community Reinvestment Act which required not some benign advertisement or involvement with the community but in fact an enforcement and a requirement for a counting of the number of loans given to low-income families and minority groups. What this meant was that the reserve bank was charged with the function of auditing banks, and if they did not get a high CRA rating then mergers were not permitted and interstate banking, which had just been able to come about from the 1994 reforms, was not permitted. In addition to this, the Clinton policy was to fund left-wing political activist groups to be the enforcers, making banks lend in accordance with this policy and these regulations. The net result was that it was estimated that by about the year 2005 $9.5 billion had been paid to these left-wing activist groups to force banks to comMAIN COMMITTEE",145,Appropriation Bill No 4 2008 2009
238,Mrs Bronwyn Bishop (Mackellar) (6.51 Pm),"In speaking on Appropriation Billply with the CRA requirements. But they did more than that. They would make a pre-emptive strike. They would say to a bank: ‘If you want to get an approval or if you want to get a good CRA rating, then perhaps you’d better give the money to us. Give us the right to underwrite these loans and then you’ll get a CRA approval rating and you will be able to open new branches and have interstate banking or indeed be able to merge.’ A lot of this material was put into the public arena in the year 2000 by a man called Howard Husock from the Manhattan Institute. His background is that he is vice-president, policy research, and director of the Manhattan Institute’s Social Entrepreneurship Initiative. He was formerly the director of case studies in public policy and management at Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government. He is a prolific writer on housing and urban policy issues. He has become well known for the articles that he has written and for drawing attention to the impact that bad policy has had in bringing about this crisis. He wrote in 2008 that the CRA bad mortgages on their own could not have created it. He said that through them together with other bad policies of government ‘we found ourselves in this mess’. Not only did you have these left-wing groups like ACORN saying to a bank, ‘Well, you’d better give us the money or we won’t recommend your CRA rating; some of these organisations were also particularly skilled at disrupting meetings. Indeed one of these organisations required that anyone who got a loan through them had to perform five functions for that organisation a year. One of those included being prepared to make telephone calls or to disrupt meetings and, in particular, to register for a political party. Usually that would be the Democratic Party. An example of this type of extortion, if you want to call it that, is that by the year 2000 ACORN had a $760 million agreement with the Bank of New York, the Boston based Neighbourhood Assistance Corporation of America had a $3 billion agreement with the Bank of America and a coalition of groups headed by New Jersey Citizens Action had a five-year agreement for $13 billion with the First Union Corporation. Similar deals operated in almost every major US city and, as Tom Callahan, the executive director of the Massachusetts Affordable Housing Alliance, which had $220 million in bank mortgage money to parcel out, observed, ‘CRA is the backbone of everything we do.’ The really alarming thing is that these organisations had the power, once they had the money, to have total underwriting authority and to place those loans with people who they chose to place them with-and this had nothing to do with their ability to repay. Then it got worse. I again quote Mr Husock: … in 1992, the Department of Housing and Urban Development pushed Fannie and Freddie to buy loans based on criteria other than creditworthiness. These “affordable housing goals and subgoals”authorized, ironically, by the Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Actbecame more demanding over time and, by 2005, required that Fannie and Freddie strive to buy 45 percent of all loans from those of low and moderate income, including 32 percent from people in central cities and other underserved areas and 22 percent from “very low income families or families living in low-income neighborhoods.” As one former Fannie Mae official puts it: “Both HUD and many advocates in the early 2000s were anxious for the GSEs to extend credit to borrowers with blemished credit in ways that were responsible.” These loans were then parcelled up in what was known as securitisation. Alan Greenspan, in his evidence to the US Senate Committee of Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs in February 2004, said: MAIN COMMITTEE Although the risk that a home mortgage borrower may default is small for any individual mortgage, risks can be substantial for a financial institution holding a large volume of mortgages for homes concentrated in one area or a few areas of the country. This of course was exactly what the CRA legislation was designed to do. Mr Greenspan went on to say: The possible consequences of such concentration of risk were vividly illustrated by the events of the 1980s, when oil prices fell and the subsequent economic distress led to numerous mortgage defaults in Texas and surrounding states. The secondary markets pioneered by Fannie and Freddie permit mortgage lenders to diversify these risks geographically and thus to extend more safely a greater amount of residential mortgage credit than might otherwise be prudent. What that meant was that, simply, debt was taken from all over the country, bundled up into mortgage backed securities and then sold. They were sold to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. But there was no account taken of the creditworthiness of these bundles, merely that they came from all sorts of geographic areas which, because of the nature of banking in the United States originally, was based on banks being chartered to an area or serving a very specific geographic area. Greenspan then, of course, in 2008, said that he was bewildered; he did not understand why it all went wrong. Then he admitted that it did go wrong. Kevin Rudd, in his now infamous essay, said that those people who believe that the market acts and acts well talk about something called ‘moral hazard’, which he pooh-poohs and says should not be discussed. But, in reality, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae were evidence of that sort of moral hazard because, although it was specifically said that there was no government guarantee for these institutions, the public believed that because they were government instrumentalities they would never be allowed to fail and therefore they would take a higher risk for a lower return. It was because they thought there was that implicit understanding. Of course, we now know that there is not and that both of those institutions have failed. When other pressures were put on them because of liquidity difficulties with those two institutions, what happened was that the banks then started to sell those mortgage backed securities which had been bundled up with that toxic component to each other. And ultimately they ended up in some of our local councils here in Australia, through Lehman Brothers. So the long and the short of it is: in all this discussion that we are having, we have to get real. Kevin Rudd is wrong. The market did not fail. Capitalism did not fail. The market was excluded; it was not allowed to act. In fact, Greenspan, in part of his testimony, virtually admitted that. He said that these policies really did not allow the market to act in the way it normally would. So what we have to be careful about in this situation that we find ourselves in is that we do not go down the path of the state knowing best, that we do not go down the path this government has chosen-racking up additional debt and throwing money at the problem without even really understanding what the problem is. There is no doubt about it. We are caught up in the whole global financial crisis, as it is now known. We certainly are. But let us understand what failed. It was bad government policy and too much regulation to enforce that bad government policy. And that is what we are getting now: bad government policy. Forty-two billion dollars is going to be expended-on what? On building school halls and libraries, which is the job of state governments and which they should have been doing already. MAIN COMMITTEE Where is the grand vision of some form of infrastructure which the people understandlike bringing water from Northern Queensland, where the floods are, down to the parched south where our food bowl needs to be. And there are people who have worked it out. There are people who can in fact deliver a project like that for somewhere between $6 billion and $11 billion, as opposed to the Penny Wong fantasy of buying back water from farmers, who are asking, when their land and their living is destroyed, that they get payments that will amount to between $6 billion and $12 billion. Where is the vision of the government? If the answer to the problem is pink batts, it must have been a hell of a question! If we are not to simply ignore wisdom and are to learn from what has happened in the past, we must understand that if we are to invest public money there has got to be some infrastructure and some policies put in place which will allow productivity in the future, so that we see gains in the growth of our economy. And we need to hear a few other words-we need to have words like ‘work’, ‘save’, and ‘invest’ come back into proper usage, as popular concepts of the way we need to go. We have heard people on our side of politics say very wisely that what this government is doing is going to plunge us right back into debt. When we came into office in 1996 they had left a debt of $96 billion. And we had to repay that. Doing so saved us an enormous amount of money in interest repayments. It also freed up capital which the government was otherwise absorbing so that the private sector could have access to it. This government has been asked in question time and at other times: where does this government intend to borrow the money from that it is going to need to borrow in order to finance the money it has given away? We have just passed legislation that will enable this government to borrow up to $200 billion. When they start borrowing that money, where are they going to borrow it from? Are they going to borrow it domestically? In that case, they will be in competition for those funds with the private sector-including banks, who then on-lend to small business and to homebuyers. Are they going to try and go overseas to borrow it? Who are they going to borrow it from? The Chinese. The five biggest banks in the world today are all Chinese. Yet, before this crisis, the biggest bank in the world was Citibank. The capitalisation value of Citibank today is the same as that of St George Bank prior to the Westpac takeover. From where are we going to borrow the money internationally? From the Chinese. Does that put us in a vulnerable position with regard to any Chinese offer to buy our corporations, which are part of our national assets? How is that conflict of interest going to be dealt with by the incumbent government? Have we been given any indication of where the money is going to be borrowed from? No. Will the government answer the question of where they are going to borrow the money from? No. The answer has been no every time a package has come forward, whether it was the $10.4 billion before Christmas, the $42 billion being promised now, the $22 billion for the infrastructure fund or, indeed, the money that is to be handed out to the state governmentsrewarding them for doing I am not quite sure what. What are the criteria for that? Is that to bail out the state governments? Is the federal government going to borrow to bail out state governments who have failed miserably? We are entitled to know the answers to these questions. I simply repeat: the market has not failed; the market was excluded. The answer is not more bad public policy and regulation. The answer is enabling the principles of free enterprise to really work so that jobs can be created for people who, in turn, can save. This will then alMAIN COMMITTEE low them to invest. That is the way forward, not the centralised socialist method of collectivism. 2008-2009 and cognate bill. This legislation seeks a total appropriation of $2.4 billion and includes a number of election commitments and changes in the estimates of existing program expenditures. We are a government that delivers on our election commitments. I am proud to be part of a government that is delivering for Dawson such things as the $150 million upgrade that was promised for the Bruce Highway between Mackay and Townsville. There is also $95 million for the port access road in southern Townsville-something which has not happened for 30 years. This government does have vision, it does have commitment and it does deliver on its promises. There is also a $110 million commitment for the junction in my electorate which is just south of Townsville, between the Van Tassel Highway and the Flinders Highway. All together, we have $300 million worth of projects. That is substantial in itself. And there is not only that: these projects also create work and jobs. When people are employed, they can contribute back to the community in a number of ways-by the goods and the services they buy, the accommodation that they require while on these sites building this key infrastructure which will last for 50 or more years. These are major pieces of infrastructure which we need to help productivity in our region. When people work on these projects, they contribute to the local community through the goods and services that they buy and also through the taxes that they pay to the governmentand so the money goes around. When workers are busy working at their jobs and spending money on local goods and services, the money also goes around there, as well as being reinvested in the tourist economy between Townsville and Mackay, because people can save money to take their families on holidays. In my seat of Dawson, that is a key economy. So we welcome the government’s commitment to invest in and deliver on these major infrastructure projects. We have major commitments for roads. We also have an $8 million commitment to the junior rugby league and a rugby league stadium in Mackay. At the two elections prior to the last one, the previous member for Dawson promised that she would deliver $8 million, but she failed. As a matter of fact, just prior to the last election she could not even promise $8 million. The best she could get was a promise for $6 million. We are delivering in full. Nothing has been cut out of the program. We are delivering what the sports people need to run that stadium properly. Sport also means sporting tourism-again, a major asset to the region of Mackay, the Whitsundays, Bowen, Ayr and, obviously, Townsville. Having good sporting infrastructure is key for tournaments-tournaments where hundreds of people can come for long weekends. When they pay for the accommodation, goods and services they need, the money flows into the economy. This is what stimulating the economy is really about. This is vision. This is imagination. It is not just a flash in the pan thing; it is something that will last many decades. Then there is the investment in industry. I am pleased to say that the Rudd Labor government made an election promise to establish the Mackay Mining Technology Innovation Centre. There will be a number of these centres around Australia, but a key one will be in Mackay. It is a $14 million commitment. I am pleased to say that the offices have just been refurbished and established, and I am looking forward to opening them in the coming months-again, a promise made, a promise delivered. MAIN COMMITTEE",149,Appropriation Bill No 4 2008 2009
239,Mr Bidgood (Dawson) (7.11 Pm),"I rise to speak on the Appropriation Bill (No. 3)One thing you can say about the Rudd Labor government: if we say we are going to do it, we will do it. That is what we are doing. We are delivering the key infrastructure which the previous government failed to deliver in 11 years. Whether you like it or not, that is the truth. The infrastructure just is not there. They had the benefit of the mining boom, of billions and billions of dollars coming in from overseas buyers. Where did the money go? What did it build? There certainly were not millions of dollars spent on the Bruce Highway. There were not millions of dollars spent on the Port Access Road or the Vantassel Street to Flinders Highway stretch of highway. The money certainly was not spent on the stadium and it was not spent on a Mining Technology Innovation Centre which will help network and connect key innovations to help productivity in our mining industry-and Mackay is a key strategic service city for the mining fields of the Bowen Basin, Moranbah and Collinsville. This bill also appropriates $242.1 million to the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations to tackle Australia’s skills deficit, including $100 million to establish the National Secondary School Computer Fund. I have been to many schools in my electorate. Just recently I went to the Milton Street Mackay State High School, a school with over 800 pupils. The principal of that school is over the moon that he is going to get a trade training centre, because until now he did not have the facility to build a training centre for the everyday working-class kids there. We are going to give those kids a trade. We have a great scheme that is going to operate there and also at Whitsunday Anglican school, which is coming together with Carlisle Christian College and Mackay Christian College to build a trade training centre for their pupils. Again, this could not have happened before. We are going to skill up the next generation. This is good news for industry. This is good news for business. Our students are going to be highly educated, highly trained and given the correct facilities to do the job. They will be well educated in trades and skills. What parent would not want that for their child? What parent would not want a good education, a good trade, for their child? That is the only thing you can give a child: the opportunity to develop their mind to its full potential. The other side of politics did not get behind this; they voted against it. What they were saying was, ‘We are denying your children the right to develop their full potential.’ What does that mean? It means that they do not want everyday working-class kids to have a good education, to have good skills and to have good training-because without this money they will not get it. They will be poorer for it, this country will be poorer for it and businesses will be poorer for it, all because you voted against it. And we will not let you forget that-not once. We will take you all the way to the next election and we will remind you-and the people of Dawson and the people of Australia-every step of the way that you voted against developing the full potential of the education of the kids of this nation. through the chair. poorer for not having this investment. This is like a seed that you plant, and 10, 15 or 20 years later the whole nation will reap the benefit from the investment in the education of every child to develop them to their full potential. I can tell you that every principal and every teacher I have spoken to has said that this is the best thing that has ever happened. And history will record that, so far, this is the biggest inMAIN COMMITTEE",153,Appropriation Bill No 4 2008 2009
240,The Deputy Speaker (Dr Mj Washer),The member will address his remarks,154,Appropriation Bill No 4 2008 2009
241,Mr Bidgood,"Through the chair, I say to the other side of politics: our children will bevestment there has ever been in education. We in the Rudd Labor government are proud of that because we believe in our kids and we believe in giving the kids of this nation, regardless of who they are or where they come from or what their backgrounds are, an equal opportunity to maximise their abilities. That is the least we can do for the future generations, and every teacher and every principal is right behind that. Also, there is $33.3 million for the government’s Skilling Australia for the Future programs. This funding will deliver 20,000 vocational education and training places that are aimed at people currently outside the workforce. Retraining is a key component. I am a baby boomer and I started life in the print trade. I did 20 years in the print trade as a darkroom technician, final film planner and platemaker. Those skills are completely obsolete now, and I am 50 this year. to you that there are many in my generation who have come up through the trades who are having to reskill. This legislation helps that happen. We have a resource of over-40s who want to get into new trades or perhaps new businesses and they need skilling up. But they need a helping hand. We on this side of politics believe the role of government is to give people that helping hand up-not to push them down. That is what we intend to do, and that is what is behind this investment in reskilling people. And it is for giving people, particularly businesses, the opportunity to save apprenticeships where the bottom line is perhaps tight in these extreme global economic conditions in which we live. They are conditions that ultimately are global and because they are global they are beyond our control. But we stand in a good position. We stand with the knowledge of the storm that is coming. We can be wise and we can prepare, and that is what we are doing through this legislationwe are preparing for the future. There will be some hard months ahead; there is no question about that, and everybody is real enough to acknowledge that. But I can tell you that this is the right way forward. This is the way to stimulate the economy and the way to create and save jobs. And if jobs do perhaps become redundant we will reskill and retrain. We do not believe that we should allow unemployment to rise beyond control because when unemployment rises beyond control families hurt and suffer and children hurt and suffer. We have to look after families in this nation and we have to look after individuals in this nation. If there is one thing that gives a human being purpose, it is to contribute to society through work. Some people, when they cannot find paid work, are only too glad to move into volunteer work, because it is in human nature to work and to contribute to community and society in order to make the world-and their own lives in the process-a much better place. The Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government has been provided with $2.5 million to establish Infrastructure Australia to ensure that there is genuine rigour and accountability in infrastructure spending. This is so that this government will be transparent and not be accused of regional rorts or anything like that. We are open to accountability, and this money helps provide that accountability, because accountability is important and infrastructure is for the long term-not the short term. That infrastructure will be here long after most of us have moved on from this place. MAIN COMMITTEE",154,Appropriation Bill No 4 2008 2009
242,Mr Combet,You don’t look it.,155,Appropriation Bill No 4 2008 2009
243,Mr Bidgood,"I know I don’t look it. Thank you, I appreciate it. But I can honestly sayThe Department of Innovation, Industry, Science and Research will be provided with $15.2 million to introduce the Enterprise Connect program, which will replace the previous government’s Australian Industry Productivity Centres. I referred earlier to the Mackay Mining Innovation Skills Centre, which will be a key touchstone for industry to bring together various businesses in the mining sector to look at ways of increasing productivity through innovation. The government are totally focused on stimulating the economy. For example, we are building 20,000 units of homes in the next two years. We made a commitment to build 40,000 homes by 2020. Stimulation for the building industry is fantastic, and I can honestly report that my phone at my electoral office has not stopped ringing from builders in the construction industry saying, ‘How do we get on board with this? We want a part of this. How can we do that?’ Even yesterday, on my mobile phone, I received a call from a developer saying, ‘We want to be part of this. This is fantastic.’ It is fair to say that there is broad consensus among the business community and amongst tradespeople that this is the right way to go; this is going to save businesses in the construction industry. The insulation of 2.2 million homes is going to create jobs, and a vast majority of that insulation will be Australian made. Seventy per cent of the solar hot water systems will be made here in Australia. This will create work; it will create greener homes which will have less carbon footprint. It has been worked out that between now and 2020 the amount of carbon saved from going into the atmosphere will be in the region of 49 million tonnes. That is equivalent to taking one million cars off the road. That is good, and through that we fulfil our Kyoto agreement. This is smart, because this is going to happen in two years. This is very smart indeed. Here we are, insulating homes, making them energy efficient, creating work through that, reducing the carbon footprint, fulfilling the Kyoto agreement, building 20,000 homes in two years-those will be for low-income people and the homeless. That is a core Labor commitment, a fundamental belief. Give children an education. Give children good health. Give children a good basic home. That is what the Labor Party has always been about. That is a core fundamental belief, and we, the Rudd Labor government, are delivering on our true beliefs. The previous speaker, the member for Mackellar, gave a sort of critique and said that capitalism has not failed and the market did not fail; rather, it was the responsibility of the American administrations of Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton. She seems to have forgotten that for the last eight years President Bush was running the country. He, obviously, from her assessment, had no influence whatsoever. She talks as if someone waved a magic wand and things just suddenly went wrong-because of state intervention, supposedly. This is absolute Disneyland politics, because the reality is she did not address the CEOs who were paying themselves massive bonuses. I refer to the Lehman Brothers CEO. After eight years of running the bank, he busted the bank and walked away with over US$450 million. I think there needs to be some accountability for that. I personally find it ethically unacceptable to receive $450 million for sending a bank broke. That is not good stewardship of anybody’s money. There needs to be some serious accountability right now across the world of all the CEOs of all the banks. In conclusion, I truly do believe this is the right way forward, the right stimulus and the right package to save our nation from huge unemployment queues. The opposition voted against this package, but without it that would have been the result. I commend these bills to the House. MAIN COMMITTEE I also wish to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2008-2009 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2008-2009. It is appropriate-and I think earlier speakers have done so-to address these bills in the context of the current economic circumstances. In fact, certain provisions in these bills go towards the government’s response to what is the greatest economic crisis since the Great Depression without any doubt. In particular, a significant amount of money has been allocated within the bills to councils for much needed infrastructure investment. Last year during the debate on the 2007-08 appropriation bills, one of the things that I spoke about when I spoke on the legislation was one of the central challenges for government, which is to manage the economy in order to achieve social progress. Of course, that is a fundamental tenet for Labor. When speaking, I also highlighted the need for strong, sustainable and responsible economic growth in the face of a very uncertain international economic environment. At that time we did not know as much about what we were going to confront as we do now. The third theme of the speech that I made at the time was the determination of the government to address the chronic investment deficits on the capacity side of the economy, particularly in skills and infrastructure. These were gaping holes in public policy and in investment left by the previous government, and that had been evident for some time. Of course, many of the measures that the Rudd government has taken and continues to take are to address those investment deficits on the capacity side of the economy. These are all themes that are also a feature of the government’s most resent response-the $42 billion Nation Building and Jobs Plan. To return briefly to the wider economic circumstances, I made the comment earlier, and I think it is clearly the case for any amateur economic historians-and I proffer to include myself in that category-that this is without any doubt the greatest financial crisis since the Great Depression. It is a financial crisis that over the last six to nine months has migrated from the financial system through to the wider economy, and the real economy is starting to demonstrate the impact of it. I was watching the ABC news just before I came to speak on these bills, and today’s results in the US stock market are now the worse in 12 years. The market has depressed to a level not seen since the mid-nineties. The Australian All Ordinaries Index is down to a five-year low. I think some of the market results are not receiving as much media attention now as they did several months back, but we are in a very difficult position in the equities markets internationally, including in our own market. The impact has been that as the financial crisis worsened it, in the words of the International Monetary Fund, weakened consumer and business confidence, raised uncertainty and destroyed wealth. That is demonstrably the case. Values on balance sheets and in portfolios have been written down very significantly. All of this has contributed to much lower demand at the consumption level in the economy and much lower investment. Some of the anecdotal stories that I am hearing about plans for investment that are being shelved in the private sector are extremely disturbing. One of the other results, which I just noticed on the news, flowing from the market in the US is reflected in the destruction of value on the balance sheet of one of the largest financial institutions in the world, Citigroup. This has now led its share price to collapse from US$54 to just over US$2. I think that is evidence of just how serious this crisis really is. MAIN COMMITTEE",155,Appropriation Bill No 4 2008 2009
244,Mr Combet (Charlton,"Parliamentary Secretary for Defence Procurement) (7.31 pm)Beyond its impact on confidence, the financial crisis makes it very hard for companies and consumers to borrow. There is a serious credit crisis. This obviously reduces economic activity in terms of both consumption and, very importantly, capital investment. While the impact on access to debt was the worse aspect of the financial crisis early on, the negative impact of collapsing confidence is the main driver of the current problems. The result of this is demonstrated best by recent IMF forecasts that the global economy will not even be stagnant; it will be in recession this year. The advanced economies will experience the sharpest contraction in the post-war period. These are the predictions of the IMF. Six of our top 10 trading partners are in recession now. The United States is predicted to contract by a significant amount, but the most recent news from Japan is that the economy there appears to have contracted by as much as 12 per cent over the last 12 months. That is extremely serious, and Japan remains our key trading partner. The current economic conditions are not good, and they call for serious and considered responses in order to try to insulate to the best of our capacity the Australian economy from the effects of a global recession. We are seeing, however, rapidly falling commodity prices and a decline, as a result, in the terms of trade. We are seeing a fall in confidence; a fall in investment, as I have spoken about; and a fall in expected exports. I was with a number of exporters in the port of Newcastle late last week. Obviously the coal industry and coal exports are extremely important there. Fortunately for the Hunter region, most coal exports are in thermal coal for power generation. Demand is holding up reasonably well for that, but coke and coal exports are falling quite dramatically, which is affecting the Queensland economy in particular. With all of this, of course, the most recent predictions for the Australian economy are to see unemployment rise to the order of seven per cent by next year, which is a worry for every member in this place. The impact on government revenues has also been dramatic. The projected revenue estimates over the forward estimates has fallen by $115 billion. There was a $40 billion revenue reduction projected in the 2008 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook. This was followed by a revised projection of a reduction of $50 billion in company tax, $13 billion in income tax, $10 billion in GST receipts and $2 billion in other taxes. This is a serious crisis by any measure. The government has been determined to respond to this crisis and will continue to do so in order to support, to the extent that the government can, both economic growth and jobs. Jobs are critical for people in this environment. The Prime Minister has stated, and he is determined to see it through, that the government will move heaven and earth to support growth and employment in these circumstances. No Australian government, I think it is fair to say, has ever devoted so many resources to trying to stimulate the economy and insulate it from the effects of global recession. In the last year alone, particularly in the latter part of the year, the government announced packages worth almost $70 billion. To that we can add the recent announcement of the $42 billion Nation Building and Jobs Plan. These are big numbers, big amounts of money, but they are justified in the context of the economic environment that I have briefly sketched. The most recent announcement is an extremely important one because it concentrates on nation-building projects that will translate into job creation in the near and medium term. It is worth noting that for every dollar spent providing immediate stimulus to the economy the government has invested more than $2 in long-term investments-so $1 on immediate stimuMAIN COMMITTEE lus; $2 on long-term investments that will generate future economic growth. Many of these initiatives are well known. However, I will briefly advert to the key initiatives. The range of nation-building initiatives include: the building or upgrading of large-scale school infrastructure; the building of 500 new science laboratories and language-learning centres in schools that can demonstrate need; and the devotion of up to $200,000 to every Australian school for maintenance and renewal of school buildings. This is nearly a $15 billion program to massively upgrade school infrastructure, with multiplier effects through local economies. The government has also announced the installing of ceiling insulation in 2.7 million Australian homes, which will cut ultimately around $200 per year off the energy bills of those households and, of course, reduce greenhouse gas emissions. There has been a commitment to finance the construction of 20,000 new social housing dwellings. Given my portfolio in Defence, I am pleased that that package includes the construction of 800 new houses for members of the Australian Defence Force. About 30 of those will go in the region which I am in part representing in the Hunter, in New South Wales. There will be funding for urgent maintenance to upgrade around 2,500 vacant social houses, a 30 per cent investment tax break for small and general businesses investing in eligible assets before 30 June this year-a very significant incentive for small businesses to invest in capital equipment with a value of greater than $1,000. There is the resourcing of 350 additional projects in the Black Spot Program. The package also includes a $650 million funding boost for local community infrastructure and maintenance on Australia’s national highways. Complementing all of these important nationbuilding programs is a range of initiatives to provide immediate stimulus to support jobs and economic growth. These measures include a range of one-off cash payments: a $900 tax bonus for working Australians, a $900 single-income family bonus, a $950 farmers hardship payment, a $950 per child back-to-school bonus and a $950 training and learning bonus paid to students and people outside the workforce returning to study. All of these are extremely important from a social standpoint and an economic standpoint. They complement the programs announced last year, which were also targeted at supporting growth and jobs. All of those programs were worth $27.6 billion in total and I have adverted to a number of those initiatives. The central organising principle of the government’s approach is to do whatever is necessary to avoid the impact of recession in this country, to stimulate growth and to support people’s employment and therefore their living standards and capacity to support their families. Australia is in, I think it is fair to say, a somewhat better position than a number of other countries to weather this storm but it does require the determination of government to take significant steps such as these. In my own electorate of Charlton, the impact of these stimulus packages has had and will continue to have a significant positive effect. The Economic Security Strategy package resulted in 25,000 pensioners receiving one-off payments of $1,400 for singles and $2,100 for couples. Payment of $1,000 was also made for each child who attracts family tax benefit part A. In my electorate, almost 12,000 families were eligible for that payment. These payments were designed, as I described a while ago, to stimulate the economy and also to recognise the financial strain that many working families face. The $42 billion Nation Building and Jobs Plan is also a great package for the Newcastle and Lake Macquarie communities and is aimed at helping the region deal with the impacts of the global financial crisis. It will provide a much needed fiscal boost to the regional economy. MAIN COMMITTEE According to Centrelink figures, nearly 10,000 families in my electorate of Charlton will be eligible for the $900 single income family bonus, for example. That is a significant cash injection into the local economy and will arrive during April. At least 130,000 people in Newcastle and Lake Macquarie will also be eligible, as estimated by my office, for the $900 tax bonus. Both the Newcastle and Lake Macquarie city councils are expected to receive funding for important infrastructure and road projects. Every school in the region, of course, will be receiving significant investment, including much needed maintenance for schools. One of the primary schools in my electorate did not have functioning toilets about 18 months or so ago. I am hopeful that we will never have to see that sort of degradation in the infrastructure of local schools anywhere in the country again as a consequence of government decisions. There will also be, as I mentioned a moment ago, investment in new Defence housing in the Hunter, which will also be extremely important. There are larger infrastructure projects in the region and I will be, as I have been for quite some months, actively agitating to source the funding from state and federal governments to make sure that those investments are made, for example, in the Lake Macquarie transport interchange, about which I have spoken previously in the House. I hope that I have painted, at least in brief terms, not only the significance of the economic challenge that the country faces but also the importance of the government’s policy responses to deal with this from a social and economic point of view. Therefore, it is important also to note for the record that the opposition voted against these measures-most recently, the $42 billion Nation Building and Jobs Plan. This was a curious decision, in my judgment, given the circumstances that we face; nonetheless, it was a decision that was taken. I, like my colleagues in the government, will certainly be bringing that to the attention of people in my local community. On all of the indications that I have had in my time in the electorate since the announcements were made, the packages that have been developed by the government have been very warmly welcomed. All of these things are extremely important policy responses to the global economic crisis. The government has taken a number of steps to stabilise and repair the financial system. We have taken these steps to introduce strong fiscal stimulus to the economy. Also, I think it is fair to say that monetary policy and fiscal policy are working well together to deal with this issue. The cash rate is now 3.25 per cent, and the most recent decision by the Reserve Bank to reduce it by 100 basis points was welcome. Overall, people with a mortgage are paying lower interest rates and have received and will be receiving some of the assistance that has been provided by the government through the last two packages for economic stimulus. Other changes have also been made, in particular the investment in nation building and infrastructure. These are very positive things not only for my electorate but for all electorates around the country. Strong and decisive action is needed in these circumstances. The government is committed to continue to take such action. I welcome the bills and commend them to the House. Secretary for Defence Procurement. I thank him for outlining very succinctly and fairly the economic situation that exists both globally and in this country. I monitor what my colleagues are speaking about in this place-not necessarily sitting in this chamber or in the main chamber of the House but certainly in my office-and I found it a little disturbing to listen to the MAIN COMMITTEE",157,Appropriation Bill No 4 2008 2009
245,Mr Sidebottom (Braddon) (7.49 Pm),"It is a pleasure to follow the Parliamentarymember for Mackellar’s diatribe against, particularly, the Prime Minister. Mind you, that has been a long-term thing, rather than a short-term thing. She claimed that our attempts to stimulate the economy, both in the short term, the more immediate term, and the longer term are wrong, wrong, wrong, without offering any clear alternative to that. I note that the member for Mackellar and others on the other side have belittled some of the more specific projects that the government is encouraging, particularly the economic stimulus package in relation to education, particularly for high schools and primary schools. Indeed, I would just like to remind you, Mr Deputy Speaker and, through you, my colleagues of what the then shadow minister for finance and now the shadow Treasurer said on Seven’s Sunrise program on 13 February in relation to the package on education: Well let me tell youof course, he would have been 10 times louderwe wouldn’t be spending $14 billion on school halls. I mean that is a phenomenal amount of money. $14 billion … That is just ridiculous. I can tell the member for North Sydney and anyone else who questions that part of the stimulus package that there are many primary schools and secondary schools in my electorate which are highly excited by the prospects of that section of the stimulus package. They are indeed pleased to be able to have a maintenance budget that will help them out in many ways. Many speakers before me, and no doubt after me, will be able to tell you how they want to spend that money. But in terms of this ‘wasted money,’ according to the member for North Sydney, on school halls, libraries, language labs and science labs, not only are they a welcome addition to those schools, particularly in providing better learning and teaching opportunities for those in those communities, but they are massive local economic stimulators. I am sure many on this side of the House, and no doubt those on the other side, are receiving very positive responses to that initiative. The opposition must find it very difficult to explain to those schools and those communities why they voted against that very important education and economic stimulus package that was announced. The Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2008-2009 and cognate bill before us are about spending to provide the government’s programs. Only on Friday did I have the privilege of attending one of our Better Regions launches, or turning of the sod, as it is called, at the Ulverstone Showgrounds Redevelopment. This saw a commitment of $2 million from the federal government, in conjunction with the state government’s $2 million and the over $2 million commitment of the local council for this very exciting redevelopment, which happens to be at the home of my basketball club, the Mighty Hoppers, of which I am still president. Hopefully, they are winning at this very moment at home! That was an example of Better Regions working in partnership with my local community. It is pleasing to see eight other Better Regions projects currently underway in my electorate, to the value of over $8½ million. Those are the types of appropriations that we are talking about and those are the types of programs in partnership between the federal government and local government, and the state government in a number of instances, all stimulating our local economies, all stimulating economic activity in the short term and which will provide important future infrastructure, both physical and social, for our communities. MAIN COMMITTEE I would also like to raise a number of projects outside of those I have mentioned in the Better Regions program. I note that my good friend the member for Hasluck has arrived in the chamber, and she reminds me of my Better Regions projects, but I would like to talk about some other initiatives brought about by community demand, input and partnership. The first is in the area of the Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy. I note that work to bring digital television to beautiful King Island will soon be underway thanks to $300,000 from the Rudd government. This project is like just about all the projects that are being discussed on this side of the House, which are the result of election commitments and/or honour commitments made by the former government through their area consultative committees. Last month, Minister Stephen Conroy signed off on the funding of this project, which I know the people of King Island have been waiting patiently for. This should be great news. The extension of digital television, which many take for granted-although I know my colleagues in rural and regional Australia do not-is an important part of keeping people on King Island in touch with the rest of Tasmania and the nation. They, like anyone else, deserve access to good television services. The funding commitment was made during the 2007 election, and working with the King Island Council, the department is soon to make it a reality. Because of the innovative approach of the council and its partners, it has taken some time to see this project reach the funding stage, but the aim was to see that the King Island people receive the best service possible. SoI do apologise for the time taken. I think all of us in this House are aware of some of the frustrations that go with due process, but we are accountable for taxpayers’ funds and we have to do the right thing by them. Those who can receive the signal can look forward to an excellent picture once the service is up and running. Unfortunately, due to the nature of digital transmissions and the challenging topography of this beautiful island, not everyone will be able to receive the new signal. The new service is not expected to impact on the analog service currently provided to the island-so that is a benefit-until the switch-over has to take place. The project will also see an improvement in the ABC radio reception on the island, for all those lovers of the ABC. I am sure this room is full of those supporters. The King Island Council will take responsibility for the Currie TV towers project and will operate the facility on a self-help basis and be responsible for any ongoing operation and maintenance costs. I would now like to move on to another very significant area of expenditure-computers in education. It is somewhat derided by those on the other side but I bet none of them has been into the schools to tell them that they cannot have their computers. I am not a betting person but if I were I would be fairly confident of my loot. I am very pleased that north-west schools will share in the $1,212,000 worth of computers as part of the second round of the Rudd government’s National Secondary Schools computer fund. The successful secondary schools include School of Special Education North-West, NorthWest Christian School, Geneva Christian College, King Island District High School, Seabrook Christian School, Circular Head Christian School, Yolla District High School, Smithton High School, Parklands High School, Latrobe High School, Wynyard High School, Penguin High School, Devonport High School, Burnie High School, Reece High School, St Brendan Shaw College, Marist Regional College and, I am very pleased to note, both Hellyer College and The Don College. The Don College in particular is receiving 273 computers. I am very MAIN COMMITTEE pleased because it is my old teaching stomping ground. WhilstI may, I congratulate The Don College and Hellyer College because they are now, with the introduction of the polytechnic campus and the academy campus, part of the post-compulsory education reforms in Tasmania. I wish them well with that, and I hope the computers that are readily available to them now will enhance their great teaching and learning programs. These computers come on the back of the 194 computers announced for north-west schools last year as part of round 1 of the National Secondary Schools Computer Fund. A further, supplementary round, 2.1, opened on 10 December, as we are aware, allowing eligible schools who have not applied under rounds 1 or 2 to apply if they do not have the ratio of one to two. I encourage any of my north-west schools who have not already applied to do it quickly in order to ensure their school reaches the national ratio level. I now move into the area of health, where nobody can argue that spending is not very worthy or warranted. The people of Braddon and across Tasmania are set to benefit from a $10 million injection to support patient transport in the state. The whole area of patient transport was constantly put to me before and during the election as a vital area of concern. This was not just about accessing appropriate forms of transport, assisting with the costs and having equipment to assist disabled and challenged patients using aircraft; it was also about having access to accommodation when required to travel to receive medical assistance and treatment. Many of the operators of various travel assistance community groups and regular emergency agencies also spoke of the urgent need to coordinate patient travel arrangements across the region and the state to achieve better and more efficient use of vehicles and drivers. Like many of my colleagues here, I was keen to lobby for these concerns, and I was very pleased that Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and the current Minister for Health and Ageing, Nicola Roxon, listened to our case and were prepared to provide funding for these issues while working closely with the state government and other service providers. While people on the north-west coast would prefer to access all their medical and health services without leaving our immediate region, the reality is that sometimes we have to travel, and I hope that this package will assist them and their families in this. The mix of funding and services, in cooperation with major reforms from the Tasmanian government, should improve the support for patients and their families. Under the initiative, our government will provide up to $3 million to acquire additional patient transport vehicles in the north-west, the north and the south of the state; up to $3.1 million to establish low-cost patient accommodation at Burnie in my electorate; up to $90,000 for upgrades to the Spurr Wing accommodation complex in Launceston, where a number of our people have to go for specialist services; up to $2.72 million to purchase new IT infrastructure and software to improve communication, coordination of patient transport and accommodation across the state; and up to $300,000 to upgrade Queenstown airport, which will come into my electorate as we are having a redistribution. Ms Jackson-How unfortunate! lationship. That upgrade is to ensure safe patient transfers. Up to $20,000 will be used to purchase appropriate patient transport and lifting equipment at Wynyard airport and up to $770,000 to implement new telehealth initiatives to reduce the necessity for patients to travel MAIN COMMITTEE",160,Appropriation Bill No 4 2008 2009
246,Mr Sidebottom,"They are very happy now! We are already working on this new reto receive health care. That is a terrific package; $10 million was promised in the election period, went through consultation, was committed and is now underway. Another related area is that of aged care. Something that we must all be aware of is the growing need for this in our community. It should be at the forefront of our thinking and planning. In this respect, only a couple of weeks ago I was happy to announce the start of a project set to become a national aged-care leader, which has been recognised by the Minister for Ageing, Justine Elliot. The minister has offered funding for an innovative project being developed by north-west coast aged-care providers, in particular, for not-for-profit community aged care. A few weeks ago, a group of aged-care providers from the region met to further discuss a study into ways to strengthen aged-care services and cooperation between providers in the region. The group had grown since the meeting with the minister last year and the series of gatherings that followed. I have been keen to support the group and assist them wherever I can and was only too happy to seek funding for a study of potential models. The challenges we have in the Cradle Coast region are no doubt shared by others throughout Australia, particularly regional Australia. The Rudd government is committed to ensuring high-quality, sustainable aged-care services. I would like to acknowledge the work of Malcolm Johnstone from Eliza Purton in Ulverstone and Wendy Tadman from Yaraandoo at Somerset. As representatives of the group, they have been crucial to getting funding for the project. I was very pleased to announce that the minister was giving them funding to scope this project. Hopefully, I can share the results later on with members in this place and hopefully it will be applicable to other regional areas throughout Australia-particularly in the area of not-for-profit, community aged care. We cannot deny that this is a very difficult challenge and it is something that all members here are going to have to deal with. Some significant funds associated with these appropriations will also flow to local government in my region as part of the federal government’s injection of millions of dollars into regional and local infrastructure across Australia. Indeed, the earlier $300 million Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program jointly announced by the Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, and the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, Anthony Albanese, has already seen a flow-on into my electorate. The Burnie City Council has received funding of $235,000 to go towards the Les Clark bowls complex. The Circular Head Council has had $277,000 committed to shared walkways in that part of the electorate. The Devonport City Council has received $183,000, which is allocated to a skate park. The Waratah-Wynyard Council has had $339,000 committed to walkways. I note that King Island has been given $100,000, Latrobe has been given $196,000 and the Central Coast Council has been given $391,000 for projects under this scheme. The money comes on top of the recent announcement of $3.65 million going to the north-west councils in my electorate as part of the second instalment of the federal government’s $1.9 billion financial assistance grants, which we share with other members in this House. Time does not allow but there are many other projects that I could comment on in relation to the government’s investment in infrastructure in my electorate. These are great stimulants and we look forward to sharing their benefits. MAIN COMMITTEE Ms JACKSON (Hasluck) (8.09 pm)-I, like the member for Braddon, am pleased to rise in the Main Committee tonight to support the passage of the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 20082009 and the Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2008-2009. These bills seek appropriation authority from the parliament for additional expenditure of money from the consolidated revenue fund in order to meet requirements that have arisen since the last budget. The total appropriation sought through these bills this year is $3.1 billion or about 4.1 per cent of total annual appropriations. Like other speakers before me, I may take some licence to broadly address spending initiatives by the government because, to borrow an old saying, we are living in interesting times. The global financial crisis, which has significantly worsened since September-October last year, has meant that it is necessary for the government to take decisive and early action. So, in addition to the expenditure covered in these appropriations bills, we have also recently seen the passing of bills to establish the Nation Building and Jobs Plan-a substantial and significant stimulus to the economy. I am pleased to be part of a government that has taken decisive and early action to address and combat the worsening of the global financial crisis. Importantly, we have seen the government take decisive and early action to stabilise our financial system in Australia, especially our banks. We have seen substantial investment in funds to stimulate our economy, supporting growth and jobs as well as investing in infrastructure for the future. So it is not only money that is being made immediately available to support consumption; it is also funding payments for the future benefit of Australians through investment in our infrastructure. Today there were significant announcements about assistance the government will make available to those who lose their jobs through no fault of their own in these difficult economic times. I am confident when I talk about the investment that will occur in my electorate; and how that is well received. I have been visiting many schools in my electorate in recent weeks-when I have been able to get back to my electorate-and they are very pleased about the government’s further investment of some $14.7 billion in Building the Education Revolution. I note that that is the single largest schools building program in Australia’s history. I am very pleased that all of Australia’s 9,540 schools will benefit from the immediate funding for major and minor infrastructure projects. I particularly urge my own state government, the Western Australian government, to look at an effective way to ensure that those funds are available to state government schools at the earliest possible opportunity. There were substantial difficulties in the previous government’s Investing in Our Schools Program, because of how procurement policies operated in Western Australia. I am hoping there will not be unnecessary restrictions or red tape imposed upon our state government schools in the electorate of Hasluck and that we will be able to see those funds flowing at the earliest possible opportunity. We all agree-irrespective of which side of the House we are on-that it is our responsibility, indeed our obligation, to ensure that Australian children have the best possible education. It is the way to give them the best start in life. We will also see the benefits of this funding boost to our construction and building industries. I am most pleased about that. Equally, I congratulate the government for its investment in housing and the commitment to build some 20,000 new public homes-not only because this will support local tradespeople and the building industry but because it will have a direct effect on beginning to address the problem of homeless people in our community. Already we MAIN COMMITTEE have heard in the House today from the Hon. Tanya Plibersek, the Minister for Housing, about the benefit that is already being seen in our local construction industry, particularly in the new homes area, from the government’s stimulus package. More specifically, I will address some of the issues in the appropriations bill. In particular, I want to comment on the additional funding directed to AusAID. As I have previously advised the House, each year some 34,000 mothers and over 400,000 children under the age of five years will die in our immediate region. These figures will increase to 200,000 mothers and 3.2 million children if we include all of South-East Asia. The mothers generally die from causes related to pregnancy and childbirth, the children from largely preventable causes. Australia’s aid in the region has made a significant contribution to the health outcomes in many countries, and this will increase with the improved AusAID health policies and initiatives of the Rudd government. The government has pledged to increase overseas development assistance from 0.3 to 0.5 per cent of the gross national income by 2015. This funding will in part support our neighbours through the Pacific Partnerships to meet the Millennium Development Goals. The 2008-09 budget allocated an increase of eight per cent expenditure on health issues affecting the Millennium Development Goals outcomes. As a member of ASEAN in 2008-09 Australia is committed to nearly $1 billion in bilateral and regional development for the East Asia region. That is a substantial investment by Australia, one I hope to see increased, and I am proud to be part of a government that has made that commitment and that investment in our region. I note that the appropriations bill also addresses additional appropriation for the Department of Climate Change. Some $13.95 million is provided for a national advertising campaign to raise public awareness of climate change and of the government’s proposed Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. It seems to me, particularly with the recent extraordinary climatic events, as well as the terrible fires we have just witnessed in Victoria and the floods in Queensland, that very few people now would argue that there is no such thing as global warming or climate change. In the lead-up to the November 2007 election, the Labor Party made a substantial commitment to tackle climate change after nearly 11-odd years of inaction by the previous government on that issue. I am glad to say that we are also taking steps to prepare Australia for the challenges of the future by tackling climate change. Australians know that acting now on climate change is the responsible thing to do. We cannot afford to waste any more time on this issue. I note that the Leader of the Opposition and the opposition parties appear to remain hopelessly divided when it comes to taking action on climate change. Indeed, I think there are still some of his colleagues who cannot agree with the Leader of the Opposition that climate change even exists. But we are moving on from that and taking strong action to tackle climate change by introducing a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. We are also making sure that we are putting in place targets that are appropriate and responsible, given the need to protect our economy and our jobs during this global recession. I think it is money wisely spent by the government in lifting the nation’s awareness of how the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, intended to start in 2010, will indeed operate. Among the significant benefits of the scheme, we will see for the first time in Australia a cost and a charge on carbon pollution, which will encourage major polluting businesses to lower their emissions. We will see the funds raised help industries that pollute lower their MAIN COMMITTEE emissions. We will also use the funds raised to assist households to adjust to the scheme, making sure Australian families do not carry the cost burden of climate change and, importantly, build on our investment in renewable energy to create the low pollution jobs of the future in solar energy, on wind farms and in jobs using new technologies like clean coal and geothermal energy. Taking action on climate change will see the renewable energy sector in Australia grow to 30 times its current size by 2050, creating thousands of new jobs. I also note the additional expenditure for the Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts-some $100 million to meet the increased demand for household rebates under the Solar Homes and Communities Plan. I well recall the criticism from the opposition that changes to that subsidy would ruin the operation of the Solar Homes and Communities Plan, but what we have seen is a significant increase in demand by households for the rebates that are available under the Solar Homes and Communities Plan. These bills will provide rebates of up to $8,000 for eligible households to install solar PV systems, transitioning to the new Solar Credits in mid-2009. This complements a part of the Nation Building and Jobs Plan that the Rudd government has recently introduced, the Energy Efficient Homes package, which is about supporting clean, green jobs and rolling out energy efficiency to Australia’s suburbs on an unprecedented scale. Free ceiling insulation, worth up to $1,600, will be available to around 2.2 million homeowners. This is a particularly popular scheme in my electorate of Hasluck, and especially in the suburbs of Gosnells and Maddington, where, when many homes were completed, people were unable to afford insulation in their ceilings, and they wait with great anticipation for that insulation program to be available. Equally, I have many suburbs in my electorate that have a high level of rental accommodation. I am pleased to see that landlords will be eligible for a rebate of up to $1,000 to insulate, it is estimated, some 500,000 rental properties around Australia. It is estimated that this initiative will reduce heating and cooling bills by up to 40 per cent-saving the average household some $200 a year on their energy bills. Rebates for eligible homeowners and renters to install solar or heat-pump hot water systems have been increased to $1,600 and the means test has been removed. Households in Australia can save over $300 on energy bills by replacing electric hot water systems with solar hot water systems. The $300 million Green Loans program will start rolling out energy assessments backed with low-interest loans for solar, water and energy efficient products from mid2009. In addition, there is the National Rainwater and Greywater Initiative to help people use water wisely in their everyday lives. There are rebates of up to $500 for households to install rainwater tanks or greywater systems. There is occurring in Australia a substantial and comprehensive response to the issues associated with climate change and converting or transforming our economy from a high-carbon producing economy to a low-carbon producing economy. The Western Australian government previously committed to match funding and cooperate with the federal government in the $13.9 million investment in Perth’s Solar Cities project, which will involve five local councils in the north-eastern suburbs of Perth, including the City of Swan and the Shire of Kalamunda in my electorate of Hasluck, in the rollout of a substantial program to implement for the first time in the east metropolitan region an initiative directed towards Perth’s Solar Cities. There has been some delay in that, and I would urge the Western Australian state government and, in MAIN COMMITTEE particular, the Department of Housing and Works, to come on board with this crucially important project. There was $4 million allocated in the budget for the upgrade of drainage systems in Perth’s Canning and Southern River areas. I heard the member for Swan last night in the grievance debate raising his concerns about investment in this important area of Perth’s river system. I indicate to him that I share his concerns. The state government previously agreed to match funding for upgrades of drainage systems around the Canning and Swan River area but have recently indicated that they would like to change the nature of their funding from cash funding to ‘in kind’ funding. We have yet to get to the bottom of what that actually means. These are important projects as part of conserving and protecting not only these important environmental areas but also our water in Western Australia, and I urge the state government to come on board. There is money in the appropriations bill for the Department of Health and Ageing-and I have heard other members congratulate the government on this-for a national community education and awareness campaign for organ donations and transplants across Australia. I also compliment the government-in particular, the Hon. Nicola Roxon-for the comprehensive set of initiatives concerned. I also note additional funding to increase the number of places available under the Prevocational General Practice Placement Program and I congratulate the government for that initiative. I am very fortunate to have in my electorate an election commitment to a new GP superclinic in the suburb of Midland. Initially this project was agreed between the state government and the federal government prior to the 2007 election. As we speak, the Barnett state government are currently reviewing their decision to match funds and have indicated their opposition to the clinic being collocated on the site of the proposed new Midland health campus. Such a change of location will add further costs. It also has great cost implications for the commitment for superclinics. I know that all of the stakeholders involved at a local level-the Swan Kalamunda Health Service, the Midland Redevelopment Authority and the City of Swan-and the federal government and the current tender proponents recognise the importance and value of having the GP superclinic colocated with the hospital. I urge the Western Australian government to reconsider this decision. I will address one last area. This concerns Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2008-2009. It has additional funds for the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government. There is $300 million for the Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program. This program sees some $250 million being distributed to local councils. I was incredibly pleased to discover that my local councils will share a considerable amount of that money: some $544,000 for the Shire of Kalamunda, some $677,000 for the City of Swan and some $668,000 for the City of Gosnells. They are all vibrant local councils with increasing populations and pressures on their budgets and expenditure. I am delighted that that funding has been confirmed. In the case of the Shire of Kalamunda, it will go towards the refurbishment of the Kalamunda Aquatic Centre, which will see a major upgrade with the installation of a pool filtration system, resurfacing of the toddlers’ pools and change rooms and the installation of additional shade shelters, amongst other things. In the case of the City of Swan, there is a raft of projects throughout its very large area in not only my electorate but also the electorates of Pearce, Cowan and Perth, which will all see substantial upgrades to local community infrastructure. I MAIN COMMITTEE am delighted that we will see that funding both support jobs and boost local economies. I look forward to seeing the City of Gosnells plans. Of course these funds for local government have now been substantially increased by some $500 million. I know my local councils look forward to working with the federal government on building and establishing new, important infrastructure for our communities to use. I commend the bills before us to the House. Main Committee adjourned at 8.30 pm MAIN COMMITTEE National Rental Affordability Scheme (Question No. 407) Mr Morrison asked the Minister for Housing, in writing, on 24 November 2008: How many applications received under the National Rental Affordability Scheme are fully compliant with the assessment criteria. Ms Plibersek-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: The Round One Call for Applications under the National Rental Affordability Scheme attracted 70 applications, 41 of which were assessed as being compliant with each of the assessment criteria. Australian Apprenticeships (Question No. 497) Dr Southcott asked the Minister for Education, in writing, on 2 December 2008: In respect of Australian Apprenticeships, what are the Government’s expected numbers for: (a) commencement of trades apprenticeships; (b) completions of trades apprenticeships; and (c) trades apprentices in training, for the (i) 2008-09, (ii) 2009-10, (iii) 2010-11, and (iv) 2011-12 financial years. Ms Gillard-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: The estimated figures for Australian Apprenticeships in trade qualifications are: (a) commencement of trade apprenticeships (i) 78,140 (ii) 81,260 (iii) 84,510 (iv) 87,050 (b) completions of trade apprenticeships (i) 35,880 (ii) 37,310 (iii) 38,060 (iv) 38,440 (c) trades apprentices in training (i) 183,590 (ii) 184,550 (iii) 185,030 (iv) 185,510 As for Question on Notice number 496, the figures provided are based on historic trend data. They are designed to inform modelling of projected expenditure on payments for apprentices and employers for a demand-driven program. The model and resultant figures will be subject to revision over the next year and the revision will take into account the impact of the global financial crisis on the Australian economy. Australian Apprenticeships (Question No. 498) Dr Southcott asked the Minister for Education, in writing, on 2 December 2008: In respect of Australian Apprenticeships, has the Government received advice from Skills Australia on the expected numbers for: (a) commencement of apprenticeships; (b) completions of apprenticeships; and (c) apprentices in training, for the (i) 2008-09, (ii) 2009-10, (iii) 2010-11, and (iv) 2011-12 financial years; if so, what is the advice. Ms Gillard-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: Skills Australia is an independent statutory body, providing advice to the Minister for Education, Employment and Workplace Relations on Australia’s current, emerging and future workforce skills needs and workforce development needs. Skills Australia assesses and advises on the basis of the available data and advises on data collection improvements. Skills Australia does not have its own data collection function.",163,Appropriation Bill No 4 2008 2009
