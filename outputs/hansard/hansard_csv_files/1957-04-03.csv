The arrangement was voluntarily entered into by the Government and Sultan of the Maldive Islands, as was their full right, and the proposal is going ahead. The history of the Maldive Islands, so far as it is relevant to the honourable gentleman's question, is that the Maldives is a very large group of islands roughly 400 miles south-west of Ceylon. It has been under the protection, so far as its external affairs are concerned, of the United Kingdom since some time in the 1880's. The means of communication between the United Kingdom Government and the Maldives was, before Ceylon became independent under the Crown, through the Governor of Ceylon. That gave it a degree of link, but it was only a personal link through the Governor and has not been challenged even by the present Prime Minister of Ceylon. The Maldives have full right to enter into an arrangement with the United Kingdom Government. There were interpolations, I believe, in the Ceylon Parliament to another effect, but I do not think they were taken seriously.

The honourable gentleman will be interested to know that some synthesis of chemico-therapeutic substances for use in cancer is being done at the University of Technology in Sydney. The present position is that the only effect produced in the living subject in leukemia in which these substances have been used, has been one of pecans some palliation of the disease. As far as I know, no rea! effect has been produced clinically on other forms of cancer. It would be quite wrong for me to give the impression that we are on the verge of acquiring some wonderful new weapon in the treatment of this disease. Although this is a very interesting field of research, and may perhaps become a very valuable one, so far it has contributed a great deal of knowledge but very little to the actual cure of the disease. directed to the Treasurer, has relation to the Commonwealth Aid Roads Act, which provides, amongst other things, that 40 per cent, of the money allocated to the States under that act must be spent on rural roads other than main roads, and that the States must submit an audited report for each financial year showing how the money has been spent. I ask the Treasurer whether the States have complied with this latter requirement for the last financial year, and, if so, whether the money has been spent in the way intended by the legislation. really comes under the jurisdiction of my colleague, the Minister for Shipping and Transport. However, in my capacity as Treasurer I have inquired whether the financial provisions of the act have been faithfully complied with by the States, and whether the Auditors-General of the States have given the necessary confirmation that 40 per cent, of the allocations have been spent on rural roads. I am informed that all States have complied with the requirements of the act. tion, which is directed to the Treasurer, by stating that officers of the Australian Government and the Queensland Government, together with representatives of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, have investigated the request of the Queensland Government for financial assistance to recondition or standardize the railway from Muunl isa to Townsville, because of the tremendous mineral development taking place in the Mount Isa-Cloncurry area. Will the Treasurer arrange for honourable members from both sides of this House to visit the area in question during the winter recess, so thai the Parliament rnay become better informed on the potentialities of this vulnerable area, and the desirability of the proposed standardization for defence and developmental reasons? As one Queenslander to another, I hope the Treasurer will not let Queensland down. the concluding remark of my fellow Queenslander, the Queenslanders know that I have never let them down. As to the request contained in the earlier remarks of the honourable member, 1 may say that when we get the monev that we are seeking for this work we will not merely visit the area concerned, we will have a party there. decision of the Australian Labour party conference in Brisbane to call for a repeal of the secret ballot legislation initiated by this Government, will the Minister for Labour and National Service make a statement to the House showing the results of the legislation since it was passed in 1951? be very useful for the House to have an up-to-date statement along the lines proposed by the honourable member. I suggest that he put a question in suitable form on the notice-paper, so that I may give him a detailed reply. I can, however, indicate to him and to the House at this stage not only that the legislation has operated very successfully for several years since it was introduced, but also that it has been encouraging to find that some 130 applications have been made, from a wide variety of unions, to use the provisions of the legislation, which we felt would enable democratic control by rank and file unionists of the affairs inside their own unions. The Australian Communist party has conducted a consistent and bitter campaign against the legislation ever since it was introduced.

It is clear, from the reaction of certain unions to the decision of the Brisbane conference, that they resent this attempt to cast aside legislation that they have found so beneficial in ridding their ranks of the Communists who were in control before. I say, sir, that it is understandable why the Communist party should do this. It is not so readily understandable why a party which claims as it did in its Brisbane conference discussions to be fighting communism, should line up, as it did, on the unity ticket basis with the Communist party in order to destroy legislation which has limited the influence of the Communist party in the industrial field. directed to the Minister for Territories, and with your permission, Mr Speaker, I shall remind the House that, recently, I brought to the notice of the Parliament an unfortunate incident concerning an ex-serviceman named Bowden who was imprisoned in Samarai as a prohibited immigrant. I have received from the gentleman concerned a message which states that, late in February, he booked and paid for certain equipment of the ship "" A l f a "" , which is his own property and which is almost unique in the trochus fishing industry. Consequently, he considers it to be very valuable. That property was to have left Samarai in the "" Bulolo "", the Burns Philp agency ship, but has not been received by him. Will the Minister ascertain whether the delivery of those goods has been delayed as the result of activities of officers of the Department of Territories, and will he try to find out what has occurred to them? make inquiries, as requested by the honourable member, but T should like to point out to him that, as a result of the way in which the gentleman on whose behalf he speaks conducted his own afTairs, the ship, and T assume all that is in it. was being detained, and I think is still being detained, because it is the subject of a number of claims against it. ship. to Samarai, and on arrival there he was liable to prosecution on three separate charges. He was not prosecuted but was allowed to leave the port, having given an explicit assurance and having been issued with ship's papers for a direct return to TownsviUe. He left behind a debt of £120 owing to a local shipyard, which had put his ship into a seaworthy condition. So far as I know, that claim has not yet been satisfied, and tbe local shipwright has put it in the hands of his solicitors to make a claim against the vessel. Then, over three weeks later, it was found that he was still fishing around the islands, having broken his explicit promise to the officers of the Administration and having acted contrary to the papers which had been issued to him for his voyage. He was then liable-and I am fully satisfied on this point from examination of all the papers-to prosecution for having unlawfully employed natives, in contravention of the native employment ordinance. He was also liable for prosecution for having infringed the immigration ordinance of the Territory by having made landings at various places where he was not authorized to land; and he was also liable to prosecution, as he had been previously liable, for fishing in those waters without a licence. He was not prosecuted on those three counts; he was prosecuted on only one, and I think that if any blame is attachable to any officers of the Administration it is only on the grounds of their excessive leniency towards this gentleman. Then, I understand that the owner of this vessel approached the Administration and asked it to take some action to protect the interests of the owner, for this man Bowden did not own lhe vessel; he was operating it under some sort of agreement with the owner. SoI imagine that any things relating to the vessel itself and the contents of the vessel are subject to legal claims which have been made by people in the Territory, by the Administration and by the owner of the vessel. I assure the honourable member that, just as I have made very detailed and very careful inquiries, at his request, into the whole history of the incident and have now had an opportunity to place those details before the House, so I shall make, at his request, further inquiries.

As the work of the existing repatriation tribunals appears lo be so considerable as to result in some delay in the hearing of appeals, will the Minister consult with his colleague, the Minister for Repatriation, whom he represents in this House, to see whether the time is opportune to appoint a further tribunal to assist in this work? consult with my colleague and supply the honourable gentleman with an answer to his question. the Prime Minister. The Commonwealth and State Hospitals Agreement expires in June of this year. Have representations been received from all States for an increase of the Commonwealth grant of 8s. a day? Has the Prime Minister given consideration to that request? If so, is he now in a position to advise the Parliament of the Government's decision? I understand that the right honourable gentieman stated that the Commonwealth was examining other proposals in connection with this matter. Is he now in a position to make the details of those proposals available to honourable members? will answer the question. tion is that formal notification will be of the roads throughout Australia? required before the Commonwealth and State Hospitals Agreement actually terminates, which will not be until August of expended on defence roads is allocated this year. If formal notification were not according to the recommendations of the given, there would be a hiatus between Defence Committee, and that procedure will the termination of the present agreement apply, and will be complied with. and the negotiation of a new one. Steps have been taken to ensure that there will be no hiatus. The details of any proposals by this Government will be announced in tion to the Minister for Primary Industry. the House at the appropriate time. BEEF. Minister for Primary Industry inform me of the action that has been taken on the recommendations by the Australian Meat Board that certain changes be made in the regulations applicable to the grading of export beef? Board recently submitted recommendations to me that certain changes in the grading of export meat be undertaken. The purpose was to ensure that over-fat meat and heavy quarters would be cut out and that, as far as was practicable, the size and weight of beef shipped overseas would be reduced. The reason for the recommendations was twofold. First, it is difficult to sell fatty beef overseas, and secondly, it is desired to introduce effective and efficient methods of animal husbandry in Australia. The Government has agreed to the proposals of the board, which have the wholehearted approval of the majority of meat producers, particularly those in the vital areas of Queensland, lt is the hope of the Governnient that such a measure will lead, not only to an increase of prices for the producers, but also to long-term help for the industry. recently, the Treasurer stated that £2,100,000 had been collected by the Commonwealth in the past three years, under the Commonwealth aid roads legislation, for expenditure on strategic roads and roads of access to Commonwealth property, but that only £1,400,000 had been expended, leaving a balance of £700,000. with that £700,000?

There has been considerable cooperation among the three organizations, particularly through the agency of the Australian Dairy Produce Board.

Nonetheless, I shall keep my eye on the matter, and if I think there is any contribution that the Government can make, I will see that the department takes the necessary action. Mr J. R. FRASER -I s the Postmaster General able to announce a firm date for the opening of the new Australian Broadcasting Commission studios in Canberra, referred to in the annual report of the commission as coming into service early in 1957? Can the Minister say whether the technical facilities being provided are considered adequate to the needs of the national capital from which are originated many programmes, talks and interviews broadcast by the national networks? Will the Minister discuss this question with senior engineers of his department in order to ensure that the facilities yet to be provided will be adequate in every respect? new facilities to be provided for the Australian Broadcasting Commission in Canberra are considered adequate to the requirements of service to this area.

Bill presented by Mr Menzies. and read a first time. Second Reading. ter) [3.24] 1 moveThai the bill be now read a second lime. The bill is in a form which is now, 1 think, familiar to all honourable members. They will recall that since 1950 the Commonwealth has made grants to the States for university purposes under legislation similar lo that now before the House. The present bill seeks to make provision for continued Commonwealth assistance in this field, not for one year, but for the years 1957 and 1958. Prior to 1950, the Commonwealth made grants to universities for research and paid substantial subsidies to meet the cost of training ex-servicemen under the Commonwealth Reconstruction Training Scheme. In 1950 a committee of inquiry into various aspects of university training and finance recommended certain principles for Commonwealth assistance to universities, and those principles have been the basis of the annual grants and annual legislation ever since. This bill introduces no new principle. It follows the same form and model followed by the 1951 act and the other acts up to and including that of 1956. But, as I have said, it does provide for grants for two years. The reason for this is that, as honourable members know, we recently announced the appointment of a committee of inquiry to investigate the future structure, organization, and functions of the universities in Australia. It is a very strong committee, under the chairmanship of Sir Keith Murray, who is chairman of the University Grants Committee in the United Kingdom. Immigration) [3.30] I moveWhatever investigations the committee connmittee (Consideration of undertakes will be conducted with great skill and knowledge, and whatever recommendations it makes will deserve the serious consideration of the Government and of the Parliament. The investigations made to Sia.es in connection with over a period of about three months, will iindoiib'.cdly touch upon many aspects of university problems. In the meantime, it seems to the Government that, over the next two years, the universities should be able to count upon definite piovision by the CoTimonwealth at least, in addition io their other revenues. That is why we have adopted a measure to cover a period of two years. 1 may say, Mr Deputy Speaker, that, although the mechanism obviously is the same-the basic grant principle and the secondary grant principle are the same-a n important change will be made in the amounts of the grants. The total grant paid under the 1951 measure, which I introduced in this House, was £1,103,000. Under the 1956 act, the total grant for the financial year nearly ended will be a little more than £2,000.000. Under this bill, the calculation of the amounts, so far as one can judge them at this stage, would have led to the conclusion that they would be £2,250,000 in the first year and £2,285,000 in the second year. We have provided for an appropriation of £2,300,000 in each year; so that the total over the next two years will be £4,600,000. Without wishing to encourage any undue hopes, I say that that will in fact be a minimum. The universities will be guaranteed that amount. If other rules have to be applied and other amounts worked out as a result of investigations and recommendations that seem to the Government and the Parliament to be good, that can be done. But under this bill, the universities, including the residential colleges, which will receive about £50,000 a year under this measure, will know at any rate what they can safely expect to receive from the Commonwealth over the next two years.

66,Mr Townley (Denison,"Minister forThe bill, which was initiated in the Senate, makes provision for some minor amendments to the Lighthouses Act 1911-1955. There have been few amendments to this :ict since it was proclaimed to come into operation in 1915, but small amending dcts were passed in 1919, 1942, and 1949. The 1949 measure provided for the extension of the Lighthouses Act to the Territories of Papua and New Guinea, and the main purpose of the present bill is to extend the act to the new Territory of Cocos (Keeling) Islands. This extension will transfer to the Department of Shipping and Transport the responsibility for the maintenance and improvement of existing aids to marine navigation, and the provision of any additional aids that may become necessary in the new territory. The opportunity is being taken also to amend certain provisions of the act so that they will express more clearly the original intentions. There are in certain sections of the act references to lighthouses and marine marks, but it is not clearly indicated that the references are to lighthouses or marine marks which are the property of the Commonwealth, although this was obviously the original intention. Sections 7, 19 and 19A of the act contain such references, and the respective provisions are being amended where necessary to indicate that they apply only to Commonwealth lighthouses and marine marks. The act at present provides that notice must be given of damage to a lighthouse or marine mark in a State or in the Territories of Papua and New Guinea. With the extension of the act to the Territory of Cocos (Keeling) Islands, a similar requirement in respect of that territory is necessary, and provision is made in the bill accordingly. At present, there is no provision for notice to be given of damage to a lighthouse or marine mark in the Northern Territory or the Jervis Bay area of thc Australian Capital Territory.

The main purposes of this bill are to effect several administrative changes in the control exercised by the Department of Customs and Excise in relation to the protection of the revenue on beer. One of the clauses of the bill will eliminate what is considered to be an unnecessary form of control over beer transferred from one brewery to another prior to the final payment of duty. Present legislation obliges brewers to affix printed "" permit"" forms to each vessel so transferred. It is proposed to dispense with "" permits"" and rely on cart-notes, which are prescribed as basic documents so far as all deliveries of beer are concerned. Effective control will in no way be diminished, and the department and brewers wiil be relieved of unnecessary paper work. This bill provides also for an amendment of the principal act which will make it mandatory for a licensed publican to cut the beer duty stamp affixed to any vessel which he sells to a person not licensed to sell beer by retail. Practical and legal difficulties have been experienced under the present law which gives the publican an option to cut the stamp at the time of sale or when the vessel is opened. The bill also introduces provision similar to that incorporated in the Excise Act and the Distillation Act, in 1952, whereby collectors of customs were given the legal means of claiming the duty due on excisable goods and spirits not satisfactorily brought to account by the person responsible for their control or custody. The amendment proposed extends the same principle to beer, and is necessary, as this commodity is dealt with by an act of Parliament separate from those dealing with spirits and other excisable goods.

The main purposes of this bill are firstly to adjourned. amend the Excise Act 1901-1952 to give the Department of Customs and Excise certain powers to deal with excisable goods remaining at factories after cancellation or expiry of a licence, and secondly, to exempt from excise duties stores used within Australia on certain aircraft operating overseas. With regard to the first amendment which I have mentioned the House may recall that a similar amendment relating to spirits was contained in the Distillation Bill of 1956, which was considered and passed by honourable members during the last sitting. It is general practice for manufacturers who cease production to dispose of remaining stocks of excisable goods prior to their licences expiring. On at least one occasion, however, goods liable to excise duty remained at premises after cancellation of a manufacturer's licence by the Minister consequent upon departmental action against the licensee. The law as it now stands does not provide any authority to deal with such goods in these circumstances. It is undesirraise them. able therefore that a situation can arise where the department has no direct control over goods on which an excise is imposed, and the amendment proposed by this bill wiU give collectors of customs the necessary powers in this regard. In regard to the amendment relating to aircraft stores, it is proposed by this bill to exempt from duty excisable stores used within Australia by aircraft passengers and crew, or for the services of Australian airgood as those of any other country, if only craft engaged on an international air service for reasons of competition. Moreover, the stores used by Australian aircraft in those The opportunity has been taken also by this bill to remove from the act scales of which have since been prescribed in regulations.

Debate (on motion by Mr Pollard) LOAN (QANTAS EMPIRE AIRWAYS Second Reading. Debate resumed from 20th March (vide page 46), on motion by Sir Arthur FaddenThat the bill be now read a second time. Mr Deputy Speaker, this bill is in keeping with this Government's policy of chasing around the world trying to get a few pounds here and there to help this country to keep going, although Australia is being advertised everywhere as being remarkably prosperous. We have been told by the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) on numerous occasions that this nation never knew such prosperity as it is enjoying to-day. If that be true, strangely enough, at the same time, the Government is seeking to raise whatever loans it can wherever it can possibly The Opposition is in a difficulty witb regard to this legislation. It does not know how justified is the expenditure involved in the purchase of seven Boeing jet aircraft. The Opposition wants to see the Australian air fleets, whether they be Qantas or other airlines operating inside Australia, equipped with the latest and most efficient aircraft. True it is that the responsibility of a government is to see that our aircraft are as",21,Lighthouses Bill 1957

69,Mr Calwell (Melbourne) [3.41],"primary reasoa of safety demands that we should equip our airlines with the best aircraft available. The Opposition does not oppose the second reading of this legislation, although it is not happy with the principle of overseas borrowing, or with the terms upon which the Government has borrowed under this legislation. The bill has two purposes: It authorizes the raising of money, and it validates an agreement long since made, under which some of the money has already been expended. Parliament is being asked in a nonchalant sort of way to give its approval to what the Government has done. We were provided with no effective opportunity of protesting, if we so desired, against the raising of the money. Our signatures are on the agreements and to throw out or repudiate this legislation, particularly as it affects an important instrumentality like flying machines, would lead the country into very great difficulties. This is a peculiar piece of legislation in save a good deal of dollar expenditure by that it proposes to authorize the borrowing travellers, would ease the strain on the Ausof money from two sources for one purtralian economy and, if the carriage of paspose.

We are borrowing 17,000,000 dollars from this small group of institutional American machines. lenders and we are borrowing 9,230.000 dollars from the bank. The Government bought British machines. America bought saysI think rightly, and that is another a number of Viscount airliners, which are reason why the Opposition does not desire turbo-prop machines. America may be to test the measure by a vote-that an agreement has been effected between the Commonwealth and Qantas whereby Qantas will assume full responsibihty for meeting payments of principal, interest and all other costs of the borrowing. The Treasurer rightly says that, in these circumstances, there will be no call on Commonwealth cash resources in the long run because of this borrowing. At the moment, the Commonwealth has raised the money and, as the Treasurer's speech indicates, some of it has been spent. But when Qantas begins to earn money from the operation of the aircraft, it will be in a position to pay back its indebtedness. I hope-and 1 think every honourable member hopes-that the Director-General of Civil Aviation and the chief executive officers of Qantas on their trip to America will be able to make agreements with the United States for a trans-America crossing of Qantas planes.

Townley -The Comet is not comparable. me that the Comet is not comparable, and 1 accept his judgment because I know he has a knowledge of aircraft which we do not pretend to have. It seems to us, on the face of it anyhow, that there must be some British machines that would be as nearly comparable or would not be far away ie. standards from those of the American machines. I notice the Treasurer said that, after a most intensive study of all types of machines available. Qantas has chosen the Boeing 707/138 as being most suited to its needs. Presumably it was because Qantas itself asked for these machines, rather than that the Government was convinced that they were the best machines, that of that money was used for overseas airOantas has been provided with the money to purchase them and, as a consequence, this agreement has been made. The other argument advanced by the Government ia support of the purchase of the Boeing jets and the Super Constellations covered by this agreement is that the scheduled delivery date in 1959 fits in parthis particular bank. The bank treats us not ticularly well with the inevitable replacement of the present fleet of Super Constellations. Lf other machines could have been obtained from Britain by the same date, I supposeI do not know-that the Governnient would have considered the purchase of the British machines. However, the Government does not say that British machines would not be available at tiiat time, but seems to indicate by implication that the British machines could not bc obtained until a later date. The Government says that the proposed terms and conditions of the borrowing were submitted to members of the Australian Loan Council and that they concurred fully in this purchase. I should like to know, and I am sure that other honourable members are equally inquisitive, whether the Government told the members of the Australian Loan Council any more than it is telling the Parliament about this particular purchase, or whether the members of the Australian Loan Council-that were so uninterested in all these matters that they gave a prompt approval without knowing anything more about this proposal than the message contained in the Treasurer's correspondence with them. Perhaps the Government would table that correspondence before the measure passes through committee, so that we may know whether we are being told any more or any less than the State Treasurers were told. The Treasurer has said that this is the first loan received by Australia from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development for purposes other than general development. When the fourth loan raised from the International Bank in 1955 was considered by the Parliament, the Treasurer said that 27,000,000 dollars of the moneys raised by previous loans had been used for both overseas and domestic air routes. We have borrowed money on previous occasions and lent it to airline companies, and. as the Treasurer said, somv lines. The Parliament, therefore, has been misled to that extent by the Treasurer in his speech. We are continuing to borrow from America, as f have said, because this bill is ancillary to a later bill dealing with the fifth loan that has been negotiated with generously but just as harshly as it treats any other country that might default or has defaulted. We are required to pay the usual commission charge of 1 per cent, under the articles of agreement of the bank, and that 1 per cent., I understand, goes to a fund which covers losses that may be incurred because some other borrower countries may default. We are good borrowers from this bank-to o good from the Opposition's point of view. Indeed, I think we have borrowed more money than any other country from this bank. When the next measure comes before us, I shall have more to say about the matter. Included in the interest rate of 4 i per cent, is the usual commission charge of 1 per cent, that I have mentioned. The loan is repayable over nine years, and another provision has been introduced.",23,Limited Bill 1957
74,Mr Calwell,"The Minister informsWe are to pay back the group of institutional lenders first. They are to get their money back before the bank is repaid. Messrs. J. P. Morgan and Company and their associates will begin to receive their repayments in December, 1960. A final payment will be made to these private lenders about June. 1964, after which repayments to the International Bank itself will commence, and the repayments to the bank will be payable over the period between June. 1964, and December, 1966. There is a commitment charge with the bank. I am not able to read the figure correctly from the roneoed copy of the Treasurer's speech that has been given to me, but it appears to be something like three-quarters of I per cent, of the principal amount of the loan remaining to be withdrawn. When I compare that figure with the commitment charge for the accommodation received from the private bankers. I find that the latter charge is only one-half of 1 per cent. There could be a reason for the difference, [f so, the Minister for Immigration ( Mr Townley), who is sitting at the table and who has knowledge of aircraft and aircraft operations, may explain why there is a difference. I have explained, as briefly as I can, just If, however, one looks at the trade balances what our position is with regard to this measure. Let me summarize it. We do not like borrowing overseas. We are opposed to it. We want to get our country out of the hands of the money lenders of New York and London as quickly as we can, because we remember past history, and we remember when the Australian people suffered heavily in bad times because financial accommodation was withdrawn. With those qualifications, we do not oppose this measure, because we believe thai Qantas must be equipped as well as any other airline company with the best aircraft that are available. We do not like these repayment terms, because we have reached the stage in this country when we have to borrow as many dollars a year as we can to pay to the United States of America the interest on money that we borrowed previously. If we continue on those lines, it will not be long before we are properly broke, despite the fact that we are living in what is allegedly the most prosperous period of the nation's existence. bill befo-e t^e House asks the Parliament to sanction the borrowing of 27,000,000 dollars. This amount is, of course, less than the amount that wiil be required, because the seven Boeing aircraft alone will cost just over 30,000,000 dollars, and we have also to finance the purchase of four Super-Constellations. Although1 ant guessing at the figure, I suppose that they will cost about 10,000,000 or 12,000,000 dollars. Admittedly a re-purchase a^r^ement has been negotiated, so that those aircraft that become obsolescent, by i.n\ modern standards, will be re-purchaseJ later. This amount of approximately 40,000,000 dollars is by no means inconsiderable, and we in this House must ask ourselves whether the loan is justified. We must ask. first, whether dollars are readily available and, secondly, whether comparable aircraft were available from the sterling area. Let me take the first question: Are dollars readily available? I know that if 1 occasionally ask for a few hundred dollars for a constituent of mine who wishes to go to the United States of America on a business trip, a howl of rage goes up from the Treasury officials, lt may be much easier to get a million dollars from them. between Auslralia aDd the United States of America for last year and the year before, one sees that v/e have been constantly in debt. In other words, we have been buying far more from the United States than that country has bought from us. In the last financial year we had a deficit of £A.50,000,000 on our trading with the United States. One of the facts of life that I have learned is that it is very much easier to raise a loan than to pay it back afterwards. We must think about the repayment of these loans. In the current financial year, although we seem to be doing a little better, we will probably finish up down the drain to the tune of about £A.20,000,000. 1 fail to see how we are going to repay 40,000.000 dollars, in addition to all our other commitments, while America continues its policy of trading with us to only a limited extent, and of dumping subsidized products in various markets of the world in which, in the past, we have been abh to sell many of our own products.

75,Mr Fai1bairn (Farrer) [3.58],"The( Mr Calwell) has said, we are getting ourselves into a position in which we must borrow money to pay the interest on money that we have previously borrowed. That is not a happy situation, particularly in prosperous times. I shall say no more about that aspect of the matter. The second question that I think the House must consider is whether comparable aircraft were available in the sterling area. The Minister for Immigration ( Mr fastest transport aircraft in the world, and Townley) has said that they were not. I beg to differ. I do not know who will be thought to be right. I know that this is a question on which the most expert authorities differ. After all, we have only to consider the two airline companies that are running the Kangaroo route, the British Overseas Airways Corporation and Qantas. The experts of the former organization are, 1 suppose, reasonably well-informed, and they selected British aircraft, the Britannia and the Comet, for that route. The expels of Qantas have selected the Boeing 707 for the same route. Admittedly Qantas intends to use these aircraft on the Pacific route also, on which there is nothing like the same volume of traffic. Let mc reply to an interjection that the Minister for Immigration made during the speech of the honourable member for Melbourne. The Minister said that the British Overseas Airways Corporation has ordered these Boeing aircraft. craft. the first to admit that these American aircraft that have been ordered for the British Overseas Airways Corporation are fitted with British engines, the Rolls-Royce Conway bypass enginea very specific type of jet for use entirely on one route, the long range trans-Atlantic route. These aircraft are, at the present moment, the only jet aircraft which will be available in the reasonably near future that will be able to fly non-stop across the north Atlantic from, say, Paris to New York. They will never be used in this country, at least in the foreseeable future. To begin with, they require an extraordinary length of runway to take off. In a recent survey of 58 major aerodromes in the world, only one was discovered that would be able to cope with this American-designed jet aircraft. speed of approximately 550 miles an hour, We cannot, therefore, expect to see them operating in Australia or on the Kangaroo route for a long time to come. I believe that two types of British aircraft that are operating to-day would be suitable for the purposes of Qantas, either singly or in combination. One of these aircraft is the Bristol Britannia, which is in service to-day with the British Overseas Airways Corporation. It is the largest and it has the longest range. The one that is in service at present is, of course, not modern when compared with the later designs, with larger engines, which are on the drawing boards and which will be available later. The second type of aircraft that would be suitable for Qantas is the De Haviland Comet, which is now in service with the Royal Air Force Transport Command, and which will be in production and in service with the British Overseas Airways Corporation before any of the American jets are available. Let us compare the three types of aircraft, the Boeing, the Britannia and the Comet, because I believe the House should consider this question carefully. As the honourable member for Melbourne has said, we have not been given any information as to why Qantas made the decision that Boeings should be obtained. We just had a bill brought down which said, in effect, ""We want 27,000,000 dollars"", with no reason being given why British aircraft were not available. As I have said, some experts have decided they want the Boeing, and others have decided that we should manage with the British aircraft. Let us compare these aircraft. It is. of course, most difficult to compare them. For one thing, the two British aircraft are already flying, whilst the American aircraft, which we have on order for 1959 delivery, is not flying. Only the prototype is flying. The figures I am about to give, therefore, amount to what is commonly known in the aircraft trade as "" guesstimation"". They are reasonably accurate without being really accurate. For instance, the weight figure usually tends to go up as the time approaches when an aircraft will be in service. This is because many items are added. Therefore, all the figures I am about to give are subject to error one way or the other. The American Boeing jet will have a",25,Limited Bill 1957
76,Mr Townley,"No, I said American air",26,Limited Bill 1957
77,Mr Fairbairn,"The Minister will be the Comet approximately 500 miles an hour, and the Bristol Britannia, which will be in service at the same time as the Boeing, approximately 445 miles an hour. So, there is a slight speed advantage in favour of the American aircraft, but when that is considered in relation to flying time, it is really infinitesimal. I do not think that even Qantas would say that it was necessary to have the fastest machine. For example, on a hop of 1,700 miles, such as from Fiji to Sydney, the Comet would be approximately 18 minutes slower, and the Britannia 24 minutes slower, than the American aircraft. As an hour or two can be lost in circling before landing, obtaining baggage from the aircraft, and certainly in getting baggage through the customs, I cannot see the sense in speeding up the service at great expense. I do not think that any one would quibble about a difference of sixteen or seventeen minutes in the time taken on a long flight. Now we come to range. The Qantas people have said that the range of the Comet is unsatisfactory. It is an interesting point that the original CometI . was ordered by Canadian Pacific Airlines to be flown on the Canadian Pacific route, but unfortunately it crashed at Karachi while being flown out here. The Comet IV. has a range considerably greater than that of the Comet I., and if the CometI . was to be used by Canadian Pacific Airlines, the Comet IV. should be suitable for us. The Comet IV. has a range of just over 3,000 miles, into a head wind of 50 miles an hour, still allowing time for circling. There is no route anywhere on the Pacific run, and certainly not on the Kangaroo run, which would require a range as great as that. The Britannia, of course, has an incredibly long range. The 312, about which I am speaking, and which will be in service at about the same time as the American jet, will have a range of approximately 6,900 miles, which means that it will be able to fly direct from Sydney to San Francisco, still allowing sufficient reserve for circling. Its range is far greater than that of the American jet, which has a range of approximately 3,500 miles. So that in respect of range, there is nothing in favour of the American jet. Now we come to ability to use existing aerodromes. The aircraft on order for the British Overseas Airways Corporation will need 10,000 feet of runway. Mascot has a runway of less than 8,000 feet. Even though the aircraft ordered by Qantas are smaller, they still will not be able to take off from Mascot fully laden. They will, no doubt, be able to use the existing runway, but not with a full load. At Fiji, which has a runway 1,500 feet less than that of Mascot, they will have to take off with considerably less load, which means that they will either have to reduce their fuel or reduce the number of passengers. On the other hand, both the British aircraft are designed especially to operate from all existing aerodromes and will have no difficulty in taking off from any reasonably sized aerodrome on both the Kangaroo route and the Pacific route. While I am speaking about the use of existing aerodromes, I might mention that we do not have to look only at the length of runway or the weight of the aircraft. In some cases, aerodromes will have to be strengthened to enable them to take these large American jets. Certainly, the Fiji aerodrome will have to be strengthened, and I understand that the San Francisco aerodrome also will have to be strengthened, ln addition, we must consider the noise aspect. At present, as honourable members know, jet aircraft are not allowed to use any of the New York aerodromes, and it is reasonably certain that once jet aircraft commence operating here, unless there is a considerable degree of success in reducing the noise, they will not be allowed to operate at the main aerodromes. I know that a great deal of work is being done in this respect, and we are all hopeful that, by the time jet aircraft come into operation, the noise level will bave been reduced considerably. At the present time, measured by decibels, the noise level of jet aircraft is about half as much again as is that of the ordinary piston engine aircraft. I suggest, therefore, that it is of no use to speed up the hop from, say, Fiji to Sydney, if the aircraft have to be sent to Newcastle to land, and the passengers transported from there to Sydney by train. problem of diversion of aircraft. problem of diversion. The cost of the American jet aircraft is, of course, far",26,Limited Bill 1957
78,Mr Falkinder,There is always the,27,Limited Bill 1957
79,Mr Fairbairn,"Yes, there is thegreater than that of any of the British aircraft. The carrying capacity of the American jet is 120, whilst that of the Bristol Britannia is 110, so that there is not really have to worry so much about orders very much between the two in that respect. The Comet, however, is considerably smaller and, depending on the seating arrangement, takes between 60 and 75 passengers. The cost of the American aircraft isapproximately £2,100,000, whereas both the English aircraft can be bought for a mere CA. 1,250,000. Once again, therefore, the advantage is in favour of the British aircraft. American and Canadian airlines, which So, too, is the advantage in respect of delivery date. I understand that, even now, and certainly at the time Qantas made its inquiries and placed its order, delivery from England could be had far earlier than from America. Cost of operation would, of course, be similar for the two jets, but it would be considerably less for the Bristol Britannia, because a turbo-prop aircraft is much more economical and bas a very much greater range. Fuel consumption is not so great, with corresponding lower operating cost. Summarizing the advantages of the British aircraft, there is the lower purchase cost; there is lower operating cost; they could use the available aerodromes; they are of British manufacture; they could be delivered earlier than could the American aircraft; spares and servicing could be shared with the British Overseas Airways Corporation, because the corporation would be using the same type of aircraft on some of the routes, including the Kangaroo route; and the British aircraft are flying now. There is absolutely nothing in favour of the Super Constellation, which is being purchased now. It is an obsolescent aircraft, and it beats me why any modern airline would purchase more of this type. To do so is analogous to a railway operator purchasing a steam train when he could get a diesel. There is a slight advantage in favour of the Boeing 707, over the Comet, in respect of range, and also some slight advantage in respect of speed. The Boeing is just on 100 miles an hour faster than the Britannia, but against that, it has only half the range of the Britannia. Taking all in all, it seems to me that the British aircraft would be the best bet. Surelv. however, there is something intangible to support all these tangibles in favour of purchasing British aircraft. Surely we should assist theBritish aircraft industry! The American aircraft industry has a tremendous home market and does not from abroad, but the British industry is fighting hard. It is doing well. Last year it exported £100,000,000 worth of aircraft. If Australia, as a British country, does not support the British aircraft industry, can we expect any other country to do so? The British aircraft must be good. Otherwise, they would not have been ordered by could have ordered any other types of aircraft available. I believe that American and Canadian airlines have placed orders for 67 Britannias and 45 Comets. We want to see more such orders placed. My view is that we in this Parliament should insist that, if the balance were reasonably even, we should purchase British aircraft rather than American aircraft, f consider that, if anything, the balance is slightly in favour of the British aircraft. against the bill? comes to a vote. Is it necessary for Qantas always to have the fastest aircraft? I do not think it is. There is a Viscount service now between Melbourne and Sydney. If every one wanted to travel by Viscounts, the smaller airlines, such as the Ansett organization, would not get any customers, but we know that the Ansett Convairs are always packed. If an airline provides a good, comfortable and reliable service, it does not matter whether its aircraft take a few minutes longer for the journey than the aircraft of other companies, because people will use that service just as much as the other, faster services. Similar remarks aoply to shipping services across the North Atlantic. It is well known that "" Queen Mary"" is not the fastest ship on that route, but it is always full. I do not think that we are bound to buy the fastest jet aircraft available, merely because some company suddenly produces a new machine. Unfortunately, the world is suffering from jet hysteria and airline operators are rushing in madlv to buy bigger and faster jet aircraft. I think that I have put the case, as 1 see it, clearly. I believe that Qantas has looked at this matter only from the selfish viewpoint of the operation of its services. Its advisers have said, "" Possibly we should do",27,Limited Bill 1957
80,Mr Whitlam,Are you going to vote,28,Limited Bill 1957
81,Mr Fairbairn,"I shall do so if itbelter with the Boeings"", but that is a debatable point. I do not agree with them. Qantas has looked at this matter only from the viewpoint of the operation of its services, but we in the National Parliament ought to look at it from the national viewpoint. My first point is that we must ask ourselves, Are dollars available for this purpose ""? I have tried to show that, although we may be able to borrow the dollars, we may not be able to repay them. The second point that I have tried to make is that we have a duty to support the British aircraft industry, and I think we should direct Qantas what to do. My third point is that if we bought British aircraft the problem of spare parts would not be so acute, because, on some routes, Qantas operates in conjunction with the British Overseas Airways Corporation. For all of those reasons, I oppose this purchase by Qantas and I oppose the bill. -The honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) indicated that the Opposition did not intend to oppose the bill, for two kinds of reason-on e of which might be called a technical reason and the other of which might be called a financial reason. I do not pretend to have the expert knowledge of aircraft that is possessed by the honourable member for Farrer( Mr cause it provides, as it were, for its own Fairbairn). I know the difference between a Viscount and a DC3 when I get in one of them, but, other than that, I know very little about the technicalities of aircraft. The Opposition has relied upon the word of the Government on this occasion, although it does not always do so. In this case, we have been assured that, for technical reasons and after a thorough examination of the facts, the advisers of Qantas came to the conclusion that the Boeing aircraft was the most suitable aircraft for the company's purposes. They claim, I understand, that this type of aircraft has been used in the United States of America for military transport purposes for a number of years and, therefore, that it has undergone thorough tests, the results of which indicate that it would be suitable for the purpose envisaged by Qantas. In the absence of an opposing view, the Opposition accepted that decision, but I hope that the Minister for Immigration ( Mr Townley), who is at the table now, will urge the Government to consider the arguments presented by the honourable member for Farrer. I do not know whether he has produced any facts of which the Government and its advisers were not aware previously, but if there is anything new in his approach to the matter, I suggest that the Government, in all fairness, ought to consider it. There seemed to me to be great merit in his analysis of the situation. If the British aircraft were superior, there would be a technical reason and a financial reason in favour of choosing it. It would be a better aircraft and, as it would come from a sterling area, no dollar payments would be involved. Basically, this is afinancialproblem. We of the Opposition have decided not to oppose this loan, although, traditionally, we are opposed to loans from the International Bank, because we say that the Government has made but little effort to deal with the serious dollar problem with which the country is faced. We are not earning enougn dollars with our exports to pay for the things that we are required to import from America. In this case, however, we have an undertaking that Qantas will earn dollars with these American aircraft and that the profits that it makes will be used to repay the loan. Therefore, this loan is different from the other dollar loans that have been raised by the Government, beliquidation in a comparatively short time from dollar earnings. There is a matter on which I should like some information from the Government. We know that 17,700,000 dollars of the total sum will be borrowed, not from the International Bank, but from private investors in the United States. Appended to the bill are extensive schedules, in which there is set out, amongst other things, tbe agreement that has been concluded between the Commonwealth of Australia and the American company, Morgan Stanley and Company, which has been engaged to float the loan of 17,700,000 dollars. ArticleI I of the agreement reads as follows:Morgan Stanley and Co. is acting as tbe Commonwealth's agent in this transaction and will be compensated by the Commonwealth. Morgan Stanley and Co. out of such compensation will pay expenses and fees and disbursements of Davis Polk Wardwell Sunderland & Kiendl and Blake& Riggall for their services to you with reference to the subject matter of this Agreemeni. The Government ought to give the House some indication of the costs that will be involved in the services that will be rendered.",28,Limited Bill 1957
82,Mr Crean (Melbourne Ports) [4.18].,"directly, by Morgan Stanley and Company, in underwriting and generally looking after the loan, and indirectly, by the two other firms in legal matters. Recently, the Government floated a loan in Canada, which, we were told, was filled almost as soon as it was opened, but for, apparently, a very small amount of work, the underwriters received a fee which amounted to 500,000 dollars. I merely ask the Government to indicate, on this occasion, the amount of the compensation to be paid to Morgan Stanley and Company for its services, which, of course, will be paid in dollars, and deducted from the total amount of the bonds. I suggest that it is incumbent on the Government to divulge, as soon as it can, what the services have cost, because I think the bonds have been floated and that all we are asked to do now is to give legislative approval to a transaction that has already taken place. If the Minister for Immigration, who is at the table, has not the information now, I suggest that he obtain it and let us have it, so that this side of the House will at least know what these services have cost or are to cost. think I , and the House, are very lucky that the responsibility of guarantor of the loan I speak after, instead of before, the honorto this firm for its business operations. 1 able member for Farrer( Mr Fairbairn), should imagine that the people in charge because I had intended to speak along the of Qantas, being businessmen, would have lines on which that honourable member has an appreciation of their ability to repay spoken, but without touching on the technithe loan before they discussed with the cal detail that he gave in his speech. So, Commonwealth Government the borrowing rather than weary the House by going over of the money. In those circumstances, 1 the ground covered by the honourable memwould say that, as Qantas has made a conber for FarrerI shall content myself with tribution to Australia we, as the Commonsaying that I agree with all that the honorwealth Parliament, should assist in making able member has said regarding the purit possible for the company to make an chase of American aircraft rather than even greater contribution.

No only has Qantas established our name throughout the world as a result of the splendid services it gives but, as has already been pointed out on both sides of the House, it has been earning dollars for Australia. So, actually, the borrowing of the dollars on this occasion is merely a business proposition to enable Qantas to earn more dollars for Australia. If Qantas gains permission to conduct an air service across the United States it will be enabled to earn even more dollars, and so will be able to repay this loan which has been borrowed for the purchase of aircraft. A question that has been asked in the House is how the loan will be repaid. The responsibility of the Commonwealth GoI feel that, because of the services thai",29,Limited Bill 1957

I think the business of the Parliament to-day is to decide whether or not it is wise and prudent for it to approve the borrowing of the money needed to enable Qantas Empire Airways Limited to proceed along the lines it believes are the best lines for the development of an airline that has served this nation faithfully and well. One might say that the suggestion that this House might interfere with the attitude of Qantas in this matter would be bordering on what we often hear anti-Labour parliamentarians throughout Australia term "" political interference "". Usually we give a charter to an organization to do a job, and if the organization successfully discharges its duties, if it is capable of rendering the services expected of it and of balancing its accounts, then we leave control generally to the organization favourable as it might be. and that is a itself, and express either our pleasure or point that we might consider.

That is not the case with other borrowings, in connection with which there is no promise that the money borrowed wil! be repaid. It may well be that sometimes we are borrowing money from abroad merely to repatriate loans made by other American companies. I think that if we failed to approve this legislation we would be unjust, unreasonable and unfair. In any event, I believe that Qantas is entitled to be in a position to give the service it gave in the past and to improve that service, and to continue to earn for Australia not only dollars but also a good reputation for air transport overseas.

The honourable member for Yarra( Mr Cairns) said that no doubt Qantas has gone into this matter and, of course, it has. As the honourable member for Farrer( Mr Fairbairn) knows, wherever aviation people get together there is always a great argument about the relative merits of the turbo-prop and the pure jet. Whereever aircraft managements get togetherfor instance, at International Civil Aviation Qantas got in touch with every aviation Organization meetings-it is just the same. The simple truth is that, until the pure jet has been flying on actual operations for some time, no one will know. By the same token, of course, nobody will know for sure how the very big turbo-prop aircraft will go as time goes on. We have seen them come into operation in the last couple of months. We know that B.O.A.C. introduced them on the Kangaroo route last August. We know what happened on the first flight. They were withdrawn for some months. Recently, they came out here again. They were grounded in Darwin, in Singapore and in Johannesburg. So nothing is quite conclusive yet. transport section uses this Boeing aircraft. point. The Boeing 707/138 has been flying in military use and as a prototype for some years. The engine of the type with which the Qantas aircraft will be fitted has done some 4,000,000 hours of flying, and has proved pretty satisfactory. J suggest that it is known how this engine will perform, that is, as well as it can be known how any engine will perform. 1 point out to the House that the Qantas people themselves did not make up their own minds without first having consulted almost every aircraft expert in the world. Qantas, 1 believe, is one of the best, if not the best, international airline. Its safety record is unsurpassed. Its punctuality and service compare more than favourably with those of any international airline I have seen. It is due to a variety of causes. First. I believe, it is due to the people in the company. Air crew, engineers, ground staff and maintenance people are beyond all praise. They are superlative, professionally. The management, under the inspired guidance of one of the great pioneers. Sir Hudson Fysh, is also a contributing feature. But one of the main reasons why Qantas has been so good is that in the past it has invariably picked the right aircraft. Airlines. lines that can point to their success for the same reason.

91,Mr Townley,"There are other airThe representatives of the company have said that in the years from 1959 to 1965 they will be faced with competition from every airline in the world with jet aircraft and that unless they have jets they will have to fold up. The honourable member for Farrer rightly pointed out the performance of the Britannia, a turbo-prop aircraft, but the Britannia is a 1953 model, which was built for the 1953-59 period, and no matter how good that aircraft may be, it will be virtually out of date in the years 1959 to 1965, when Qantas will be faced with intense competition from PanAmerican Airways, K.L.M., Canadian Pacific Airlines and a variety of other major international operators. I have the greatest confidence in the people in Qantas. Having gone into this thing, they are risking their whole future on their choice of this aircraft. I was with them for months, and I know that they thought of nothing else. They worked morning, noon and night, seven days a week, sifting every little bit of evidence they could 490 miles an hour. But the payload of the get. But they did not work by themselves. They had officers from the Department of Civil Aviation such as Dr. Shaw and dozens of others who are in world class. These officers have been overseas toall sorts of conferences and they have far more than held their own with the technical experts of every country on earth. They were called into the discussions, out of which came this proposition. I know that the honourable member for Farrer knows a tremendousamount about all the details of aircraft and their operation. He has been a professional flier in his time. He was good enough to say that I knew a lot about it. I have picked up a little knowledge from time to time. But I suggest that as all this expert opinion has been working over this matter for months, it is hardly likely that we shall develop anything in this House which will contradict the findings. We may disagree, but in doing so we would express an opinion which I say, with great respect, would not be a very valid opinion in the company in which we find ourselves. We would be up against the weight of world opinion on the choice of an aircraft which has been accepted by one of the greatest airlines in the world. It is an airline which is staffed by people whose reputations are world-wide and who have been backed up by the opinion of the Department of Civil Aviation, which is just an honest broker in this instance. It has nothing to gain or lose; the safety of the passengers and crew is its concern. I suggest that this debate is not exactly a waste of time, l t is very valuable. But1 do not think that a debate of this sort, when it gets on to technical arguments to which the honourable member referred, will solve any of our problems. They have been thrashed out again and again by the most eminent people in the aviation industry in Australia and they bave chosen this aircraft. Some of the figures which the honourable member for Farrer gave were surprisingly accurate. His statistics were all rightexcept for a little bit-and sometimes a little bit makes a difference. For instance, he mentioned that the Comet IV. had a range of 3,000 miles. On the stage routes of the Pacific, it is 2,600 against 3,500 for the Boeing 707. His information about the relative speeds was right-the Boeing at 550 miles an hour and the Comet IV. at Comet IV. is 17,000 lb. as against 28,000 lb. for the Boeing 707; and when all is said and done, it is the payload that pays all the wages. In summarizing all this, I say to the honourable member that intense study has gone into this matter. I assure him and I assure the House regarding the intensity of the work of the men who were engaged in finding the aircraft that would meet the competition which will come to this country's international air carrier in 1959. Everybody who was occupied on the work with the company or who was drawn into the discussions favoured the Boeing 707. But that is not the whole story. There had to be a Treasury consideration of the matter, and there are plenty of people here who know that the Treasury regards every bit of expenditure with modified rapture. The Treasury really examines this sort of expenditure in minute detail. The Treasury, too. was convinced. After that, there would have been, I should think, at least three meetings at Cabinet level when the Qantas people and the Treasury people were brought here. Additional technical advice was also sought and again the decision was given for the purchase of this aircraft. SoI think that, at this stage, while it may be quite an interesting academic study, we will not produce in this House, despite all the technical knowledge that we may have, any weight of opinion sufficient to upset the advice that was given to the Government by Qantas and the Department of Civil Aviation. use this aircraft at Mascot, even if Qantas did not? point that the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) raised.

We are paying, among other things, a 1 per cent, commission charge, which is intended to cover default by borrowing governments that, in Australian parlance, take the knock on the bank. The Opposition opposes this bill, as it opposed the Loan (Q°:itas Empire Airways Limited) Bill 1957, and for precisely the same reasons. oppose the programme for which the money is being borrowed? programme afterwards. I think 1 shall be able to convince the honourable member that much of the material and equipment listed in the schedules to this measure need not be imported from the dollar area, because it could be manufactured in Australia. ber tell us where in Australia it could be manufactured? For a beginning, I could refer the honourable member to the tractor factory of Chamberlain Industries Limited, in Western Australia, which could produce a lot of the equipment on which the Government intends to spend dollars. Limited makes good tractors, but could it produce all the other equipment required? tories that make good tractors also. Honourable members who suggest that the necessary equipment cannot be made in Australia must accept the onus of proving that it cannot be made here when we come to consider the schedules to the bill. A lot of excellent equipment used in Australia to-day is Australian made. I feel that the listing in the schedules of tractors, trucks, and other machinery does not tell the full story. With the exception of a loan of 20,000,000 dollars obtained from the International Monetary Fund by the Chifley Government after the conclusion of World War II„ the Australian Labour party has neither condoned nor supported measures such as this one. Labour members object to international money lenders. During theconsideration of the Loan (Qantas Empire Airways Limited) Bill 1957, 1 said something about J. P. Morgan and Company Incorporated financing part of the loan, and. much more could be said about that firm and others like it. Because Labour does not like this form of borrowing, and because Australia has suffered a good deal in the past at the hands of international money lenders and other social drones, the Opposition is not prepared to give its blessing to this measure any more than to the one that authorized the borrowing by Qantas Empire Airways Limited. The Government has repaid 8,020,000 dollars of the 317,730,000 dollars that it has borrowed from the International Bank. The Menzies Government, which might very well be described as the overseas borrowing government, has mismanaged Australia's affairs so gravely that every year the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) or his agents have to take the hat round the world in an attempt to cadge funds from this country or that country in order that Australia may fulfil its loan obligations to the States in the terms of agreements made at meetings of the Australian Loan Council. T use the word "" agreements "", but the State Premiers would dispute that claim. They must accept what the Treasurer of the day gives them, and he gives them what he thinks the loan market will yield. The difference between what the loan market yields and the cost of the programme upon which he decides isfinancedby the imposition of additional taxes, by the raising of loans overseas, or by a combination of both methods. We now borrow Swiss francs, Canadian dollars, and United States dollars. The only countries that seem to be fairly prosperous at the moment and which we have not yet tapped are Germany, Russia and China. I have not the slightest doubt that one of these days the Prime Minister, if he remains in office long enough, will make another trip to Egypt; but he will not be going there to settle the Middle East crisis. He will be going to borrow dollars from President Nasser. They will be Canadian dollars and American dollars and all the other moneys that Nasser will have collected from tolls levied on ships passing through the Suez Canal.

114,Mr Calwell,"The Labour GovernThe Opposition's second point is that if ihis country was properly governed, the stability of its economy maintained, and its overseas funds built up, there vvould not be any necessity to go begging for loans anyfrom Great Britain in the form of decenwhere overseas. The people would have enough confidence in their government and ic their country to invest in Commonwealth loans. Thirdly, the Opposition believes that if overseas money is invested in this country it should come in the form of investment in new industries established here by companies or individuals from the United States, both Houses of the Parliament to judge Great Britain, or anywhere else, rather than through the negotiation of loans from the International Bank or any other similar body. When money comes to this country by way of investment and not by way of loan there flows vvith it that indefinable quality which is so valuable-the quality of know how. When overseas people bring into this country their money, their equipment and their technicians, they help to teach Australians the latest methods, and that is an invaluable contribution to the well-being of the nation. But the moneylender does not do anything except finance the importation of goods made overseas. No good flows in the train of borrowing from overseas lenders. We have had too many sad experiences in this country of how overseas lenders behave when a drought or an economic blast strikes the nation. In 1889 and again in 1929 Australians had their wages and living standards reduced. People were forced into unemployment and an existence on the dole because the holders of our loans in other countries demanded payment as the loans fell due and refused to agree to a moratorium until things got better. boat themselves. any lender country was in exactly the same position as a debtor country. The honourable member might say so, but those who took their money out of this country in those two great periods of depression certainly harmed our economy and set us back for a long, long time. Of course, it may be that people who lend their money, as money was lent in previous days, might do some harm to their own country as well. Jt would be very much better for us as a nation if a good deal of investment came tralization of industries and population. Probably both countries vvould be better able to meet any economic troubles that might arise later on. My fourth submission is that the Government has not provided in this legislation, or on any previous similar occasion, sufficient information to enable members of whether the money being borrowed is really needed or will be spent efficiently. The schedules to past bills have told us about as much as the schedule to the present bill tells us about the expenditure which is to be incurred and which may even have been incurred since the agreement was signed, on hay balers and tractors and machinery of all kinds, much of which, as I have said previously, could have been manufactured in this country. While honourable members are told how the money will be spent, we are never given a report after a period of time following the passage of the bill on how the money has been spent. I doubt whether the Public Accounts Committee has ever been able to discover the facts. I do not know whether it has ever tried to discover the facts. I do not know whether it has been allowed to examine the Department of the Treasury yet. But I do know that the Public Accounts Committee has never made a report to the Parliament on the manner in which these international loans have been spent. When I look at the schedule to the bill, which indicates the alleged purposes for which the loan is being raised, I find that we have four programmes. They are an agriculture and forestry programme, a road transport programme, a railway programme and an industrial development programme. TJnder the first programme, the imported equipment to be financed out of the proceeds of the loan includes tractors and spare parts, components for the manufacture of tractors, agricultural machinery and implements and spare parts there for, components for manufacture of agricultural machinery in Australia and forestry equipment and spare parts. I think that the Australian manufacturers of all these pieces of equipment and spare parts would readily",37,Reconstruction And Development Bill 1957

That is the only portion of this programme which, on the face of it, can be regarded as a justifiable item to be covered by loan expenditure. Under the road transport programme, we are told that the imported equipment to be financed out of the proceeds of the loan includes tractors and spare parts. Any number of firms around the more settled districts of Australia are making tractors and spare parts. Quite a number of firms are making trucks and components and quite a number are making road trains and transporters, earth-moving equipment and spare parts there for and the equipment for the construction and maintenance of roads. earth-moving tractors? moving equipment, but some earth-moving equipment. power? would know if the Government gave us the information. We are asked to vote for something about which we are told nothing.

I may fail sometimes, but I am not in perpetual ignorance of everything. I should like the honourable gentleman to join me in asking die Government to shed a little light on the question. 1 know many places around Melbourne, of the items covered in this legislation are Under the railway programme, I nnd that the imported equipment to be financed nut of the poceeds of the loan include? comr ponents for diesel-electric locomotives, components for rail car assembly, control equipment and equipment for track maintenance. I know that the Clyde Engineering Company Proprietary Limited in New South Wales is manufacturing diesel-electric locomotives, but may need to bring in certain parts. But the extent to which these importations are necessary should be stated by the Government, and the House should not be treated in the contemptuous way in which it is always treated by the Government on measures of this kind. I have not a general knowledge of the matters covered by the industrial development programme, but, prima facie, the matters included in the other three programmes could, in my view, be manufactured largely in this country, if not entirely so. In any event, the Government should give the House all the information it has in its possession, because I do not like this country to be put into pawn any more than is necessary. We should be trying to reduce our loan indebtedness. When the Labour party was in power, as I have pointed out. we certainly reduced our debt abroad and interest rates on the money still owing abroad was also reduced. The conversion loans we negotiated were always floated at a lower rate of interest than was then heing paid. Our overseas debt has increased in total to-day, compared with the time when we were the government. It is possible for honourable members opposite to say that our loans in London have fallen by £14.000.000 sterling since the present Government came into office. They have been reduced from £48.300.000 to £34.000,000. Loans in New York have fallen from 24.600.000 dollars to 16,500.000. But our indebtedness fo the International Bank for loans of this kind has increased by 27.500.000 dollars, our indebtedness to Canada is 1.700.000 dollars and we owe Switzerland 12,600,000 francs.",38,Reconstruction And Development Bill 1957

It is lower in the dollar area in New York, where it has dropped from 3.9 per cent, to 3.7 per cent.

136,Mr Haylen,That is what the Govern,40,Reconstruction And Development Bill 1957
137,Mr Calwell,"Yes, that is what Goto support this bill. There is one justification, and one only, for the Government's borrowing abroad. It is that the capital which is injected into the Australian economy in the process expands the economy to that extent, and enables it to carry a larger load of debt. The debt that has been incurred by the total borrowings from the International Bank is, in fact, well within the capacity of the Australian economy to carry, because that capacity has increased more than proportionately since those borrowings were commenced. The honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr goods in the hands of the private importers, Calwell) gave as his first reason why the Opposition opposes this bill the fact that such opposition is an article of faith. In so far as anything is an article of faith beyond reason and not to be subjected to reason, it is, of course, unanswerable in the opinion of its proponents. I suggest, however, that there is a vast difference between Australia in 1957 and the Australia of the early 1930's. It would be impossible to borrow from the International Bank for any prodigal purpose. One could sympathize with the reaction of those who said, in the early 1930's, that in the immediately preceding years debt had been incurred too lightly, and insufficient attention had been devoted to making sure that the investment which resulted from it was well placed. But these things change, and we have to be careful that articles of faith do not become just parts of archaic folk lore. I shall deal now with the cost of this money, which is i per cent, less than the rate at which the Government could borrow in the Australian market, even after allowing for the special commission to which the honourable member referred. This commission is, in fact, the kind of arrangement that any prudent bank would make. It provides for bad debts, and bad debts arise not just because countries misuse funds, but also because they may be overtaken by world economic conditions in which they are no longer able so easily to service their debts. The honourable member for Melbourne spoke of our credit standing overseas, and I can say that in the New York market, which I know well, it is second only lo that of Canada, without excepting any European country. The honourable member said that the goods that would be imported with money obtained by this loan could be made in Australia. Even if this were true, it would not touch the real significance of the loan. In fact the proceeds of the loan, as has been the case with the other loans, will be sold to individual importers in Australia in order that they may buy American goods. The proceeds collected thereby in Australian currency are invested in the loan programmes of the Australian Loan Council. I shall now turn my attention to the which bave to be imported for the purposes set out in the programmes attached to the loan agreement. The conditions precedent to an import licence being granted for this or any other import from the dollar area are, first, that such goods are not available in Australia, or are not available in sufficient quantity, and, secondly, that they cannot be purchased at a comparable price in countries outside the dollar area. All of the goods imported as the result of this loan have to run the gauntlet of that test. Those who oppose this loan must face what must immediately be the consequences of discontinuing our borrowing programme in the United States of America. First, that programme supports between oneeighth and one-ninth of the Australian Loan Council's borrowing programme. If this source of capital disappeared it would be essential either to raise the money by other means-presumabl y by taxation, because as much as possible is already being raised by way of borrowing-o r to cut down the Australian Loan Council's programme accordingly. The other side of the picture would reveal that Australia's imports, which have already been cut back to a far greater degree than is healthy for the economy, even when one considers the recent import licensing relaxation, would have to be further cut back, and we should in fact be able to import about £22,000,000 worth of goods per annum less than we are importing to-day. The honourable member for Melbourne dealt with other ways of filling the loan. Any honourable member surely would agree that if we possibly could raise within Australia all the capital which could profitably be applied to investment in this country, we should not look outside it. But this is",40,Reconstruction And Development Bill 1957
138,Mr Bury (Wentworth) [5.28],"I risecertainly not the case at present, nor was it in the recent past when a number of Commonwealth loans were filled by very undesirable methods. One has been the direct and indirect underwriting of loans by the Commonwealth Bank to a very large dc ree to make up for lack of support in b the bond market, the most inflationary action of which both this Government and the previous Labour government have been guilty and for which the rest of the community has had to pay. Another argument of the honourable member for Melbourne was that we are now borrowing just to repay interest on previous ioans. These things are, in fact, distinctly severable. Our previous loans are now represented by capital investment wiihin Australia. Our economy is larger and stronger to that extent. We are better able to pay interest, and if we now did not continue to borrow we should have to invest less. It is true that the fact that we are borrowing and continuing to borrow means that, in a sense, these funds are being off-set ticularly the stronger countries of Western against interest payments, but those interest payments already represent past investments which we should be able to carry. New loans, if well placed, represent future investofficial rate, but at rates differing only ment; and when they, in their turn, begin to mature, we shall be able to repay them. In fact, the load of overseas debt which AusandI suggest that when we are thinking of tralia carries to-day is negligible compared with that of the early 1930's. If we are to progress as fast as we might, we need all the capital we can possibly muster, both from here and from overseas. It is the natural counterpart of our immigration programme. In fact, if we could borrow £100,000,000 a year from overseas now, we might be able-in fact, we probably would be able-to manage our current level of immigration without inflation. But if this Government scraped the markets of the world and did everything possible, it would have no chance to raise more than a small proportion of the funds which could be applied in Australia to profitable investment outlets at the present time. The cost of the loans, particularly from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, is certainly lower than is the cost of successful private investment in Australia. encourage both; but, in fact, the 4 i per cent, else. Let us remember that the Interwhich we shall pay on this loan is very much less than are the annual charges in respect of a successful American concern operating in Australia. The rate of profit, for instance, of General Motors-Holden's Limited, whatever may be done with the proceeds ultimately, is certainly very much more expensive than is this form of borrowing. During this debate a suggestion has crept in-it has not been said specifically-that there is some vast difTerence between borrowing dollars and borrowing any other currency. In this respect, our thinking needs to be brought up to date. If we take the three years immediately before the Suez crisis burst on the world, we shall see that the rest of the world, far from having a dollar deficit, had a dollar surplus. It is thc countries which have not been able to restrain inflation which find themselves short of foreign currencies, dollars as well as other currencies; but those countries which have been strong enough and determined enough to arrest the process of inflation have, in fact, gained very large dollar reserves, parEurope, lt is well to remember, too, that outside the sterling area the dollar is almost convertible currency, not always at the slightly from it. Countries outside the sterling area can buy dollars with sterling, borrowing dollars we should bring our thinking up to date and match it with borrowing elsewhere. In any case, Australia normally, year by year, has a surplus of foreign exchange earnings with the countries of the non-sterling area, and our surplus with these other countries, but for our support of the sterling area, would otherwise have to be cleared by the United Kingdom in gold or dollars. Our surplus in this other direction normally greatly exceeds our deficit with the dollar area, which we incur bilaterally. Therefore, sir, we should not be deterred from supporting this loan merely because it involves borrowing dollars. The final effect would be very much the same if we borrowed any other foreign currency. There was another phrase used by the honourable member for Melbourne which struck me somewhat queerly. He said that Not that we should not we were treated as harshly as is any one national Bank for Reconstruction and Development is an international, not an American, institution. Indeed, I have been at the board when the United Stales has been outvoted, lt is an international institution, and an international institution necessarily must treat every one alike, so far as thc terms and conditions of its loans are concerned. But, in fact, we are by far the largest borrower. We have been more generously treated than has any one else, and that is a reflection also of our almost uniquely good credit record. There is one matter which has not been raised and to which 1 should like to refer. It is the question of these general loans as distinct from project loans, l l is probable that the board of thc International Bank, which is looking increasingly askance at loans for general purposes, rather than specific loans for definite, set purposes, will limit our capacity in the future to borrow along general lines. This brings me to the point that, in future, we shall have to face the fact that if we want to borrow from the Internationa] Bank, we may well have to produce projects in detail, carefully surveyed, for the bank to finance. Mr Jeff Bate -Such as the standardization of railway gauges, and works of that kind? example of the kind of thing which could be financed in this way. That would lead, of course, to serious State and Commonwealth problems. Any one who has had experience of the Loan Council and has had the job of trying to reconcile the jealousies of the States and their claims for projects to be carried out in one State rather than another realizes that that would be no easy task to face. We should prepare ourselves mentally to give some leadership in this respect, because if we want to produce projects on a scale big enough to warrant the raising of worthwhile amounts of capital from the International Bank in the future, there is no time to lose. We need the close co-operation of the State governments. There is one field to which our thoughts and efforts should be turned immediatelythat is transport. Most of the loans made to us so far by the International Bank have been for power or transport. Power is reasonably well provided for relative to transport, but we need large numbers of suitable projects, well engineered and capable of standing up to critical examination, in order to borrow money in the future. R -[18 ] I have no doubt that this loan will increase the capacity of Australia to bear overseas debt to a greater extent than the sum involved. Therefore, I support the bill. Sitting suspended from 5.47 to 8 p.m. In addressing myself to this measure, which is to provide for a loan of 50,000,000 dollars from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, 1 remind the House that, as the Deputy Leader of the Labour party, the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) has indicated, the Labour party opposes the bill. Before the suspension of the sitting the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Bury), who has had some practical experience in this field, indicated that in his view Australia should borrow all the money it can, and whether it be from sterling sources or dollar sources seems, to him, immaterial. As I see it, this problem of borrowing from the International Bank cannot be severed from the whole question of Australia's dollar problem-and there is a dollar problem, as this bill evidences. We should ask ourselves why we should borrow these dollars from the International Bank. Why is the loan necessary? Ostensibly the loan is necessary because it is to be used to purchase certain goods, the identity of which is set out in the schedule, and which, it is stated, are to further the economic development of Australia. Nobody cavils at the statement that we need as much economic development as possible in this country. However, I suggest that we must, at least, be prudent in the way in which we go about these things. As I see it, we cannot sever the borrowing of this loan from the whole dollar position as it faces the Australian economy. I should like to cite a few figures to indicate the kind of perspective in which, I suggest, this proposal has to be evaluated. The real crux of the matter is that Australia does not earn sufficient dollars on current account-that is. by the sale of goods to the dollar area-to pay for the goods that we are purchasing from the dollar area. Initially there is considerable imbalance between Australia's exports to the dollar area and its imports from the dollar area. That position can be seen in detail in a published statement emanating from the Commonwealth Statistician which gives the figures for trade for the year ended June,",41,Reconstruction And Development Bill 1957

140,Mr Cream (Melbourne Ports) [8.0],"1956. This statement shows that in that year, in round ngures, we imported from America goods to the value of £A. 127,000,000, but exported to the dol.ar area goods worth,only £A.73,000,0JO. So there was a difference, in round figures, of £A.54,000,000. Now, that deficit has been bridged in balanced by the £A.17,000,000 that I mentwo ways.

They are items that absorb additional dollars and bring the overall deficit at this stage to rojnd about £A.100,000,000. Now, that deficit of £A. 100,000,000 has been It is entitled ""Growth of United States private investments abroad conio 256,000.000 dollars; by 1952 io 310,000,000 dollars; by 1953 to 326,000.000 dollars; by 1954 to 393,000,000 dollars, and by 1955, the latest year for which ngures are available, to 494,000,000 dollars. The most significant movement has occurred in the last two years. Between 1953 and 1954 there was an increase of 67,000,000 dollars, and between 1954 and 1955 an increase of 101.000.000 dollars. These increases were made up of new investment, on the one part, and undistributed profits on the other. Of the increase of 67.000.000 dollars which occurred between 1953 and 1954, new capital accounted for 32,000,000 dollars and undistributed profits for 35,000.000 dollars. 24.000.000 dollars was found in the Australian manufacturing field. Of the increase of 101.000.000 dollars which occurred between 1954 and 1955. new capital accounted for 62,000,000 dollars and undistributed profits for 39.000.000 dollars, of which 29.000.000 dollars reached the manufacturing field. Details are also given, by categories, of where this American investment has gone in the Australian economy. It seems to me that these figures also are very significant. Total investment had, by the end of 1955, reached 494.000,000 dollars. Of this, 237.000.000 dollars-o r slightly less than half-wa s found in the manufacturing industries. Trade accounted for 26.000.000 dollars, other industries for 21.000.000 dollars, and mining and smelting for 25.000.000 dollars. 185.000.000 dollars was very largely devoted to lhe petroleum industry. A table of the earnings from this American investment is also given. These figures also seem to be significant. For 1955, the earnings on the American investment of 494 000.000 dollars totalled 64.000.000 dollars. That is a fairly goo'l rate of return and of it, 48,000,000 dollars-eve n though the manufacturing investment was less lhan half of the total-cam e from the manufacturing field. 1 repeal, the earninis from ;i total investment in 237 00> 000 dollars were 48.000 000 dol'as. r Thai wcvild seem to indicate that the prices thn --' '-'fin"" charged fo! --n'i''ctsand I do not refer merely to those of General-Motors Holden's Limited-ar e a little higher than one would think necessary for a fair return upon capital investment. Moreover, it is setting up a very critical dollar-shortage problem. A large part of these earnings is remitted to America in the form of dividends. It is quite true that a part is retained, or "" ploughed back "" into the Australian undertaking, but even this can at some time or other, subject to Treasury regulation, be remitted abroad. The total is building up year after year. The figures continue to be significant, and can perhaps be matched one against the other. The earnings of American investment from 1950 to 1955 have run as follows:-In 1950, they were 27,000,000 dollars; in 1951, 36,000,000 dollars; in Of the undistributed profits 1952, 33,000,000 dollars; in 1953, 51,000,000 dollars; in 1954, 60,000,000 dollars; and in 1955, 64,000,000 dollars. 1 repeat, 48.000.000 dollars of the 1955 figure came from the manufacturing field. We have reached a stage where undistributed, and remitted, profits are the two most significant items among the invisible-£28,000.00 0 last year of the total of £50,000,000. These sums, which are going out of the Australian economy, nullify a very high proportion of Australia's export earnings. Honourable members should keep in mind that Australia's exports to America are worth about £70,000,000 a year. The invisible items totalled £50,000,000 last year, and, as 1 have said, of this undistributed and remitted profits accounted fot £28.000.000. I suggest that this is the kind of problem The remaining that is being ignored by this Government. It should face the matter squarely and ask, "" Need we borrow these dollars in order to provide certain necessary things?"" We challenge the Government's claim that a large part of these goods which at the moment are imported with the assistance of dollar loans-tractor s have been given as an example-canno t be obtained from sterling or Australian sources. I know of Australian-made tractor equipment which cannot be sold. In my own electorate the firm of Malcolm Moore makes large earth-movine equipment.

AgainI am inclined to agree with my colleague, the honourable member for Wentworth, who said that in the future we may not be able to borrow on a general basis as envisaged in this measure and that we shall have to present to the bank a more specialized programme of expenditure, which the honourable member termed a project programme. So far as it goes, the list of programmes on which the proceeds of the loan may be expended, as set out in the first schedule to the bill, covers a number of activities that are very important to Australia. Each is of tremendous significance to Australia's development, although no specific amount is stated in respect of any of them. An agriculture and forestry programme is the first of the programmes listed in the schedule. Any one who travels through Australia's countryside to-day would have to be blind not to realize the extraordinary importance to agriculture and forestry of the machinery and equipment that this dollar loan will enable us to obtain. I have some personal knowledge of the land and of subjects such as fodder conservation. The honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell), who is Deputy Leader of the Opposition, made a passing reference to the possibility of manufacturing in Australia the kind of machinery that we propose to import from the dollar area. Although, in the long term, his view may be correct, it is completely without foundation at the present time. A road transport programme also is listed in the first schedule to the bill. Of all the subjects debated in this House from time to time, the subject of roads probably receives more attention than any other, because we all realize that an efficient and reliable roads system is absolutely essential to Australia's economy. When one sees at work the plant and machinery used by the various roads authorities, such as main roads boards and the Victorian Country Roads Board, and realizes its origin, one cannot help but understand how greatly the work of constructing and maintaining Australia's roads is promoted by fhe dollar funds provided by loans such as this. The first schedule to the bill lists a railway programme also. The railways are a very important part of our transport system. I think that every honourable member will agree that one of the greatest uplifts that the Australian rail system has had recentlj was the introduction of diesel-electric locomotives. They have reduced costs and resulted in far more emcient and speed) rail services. The programme for the greater use of diesel-electric traction could not proceed without considerable dollar expenditure. In this field alone, loans such as this make a vast contribution to Australia's development and to the stability of our economy, as I know my colleague, the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth), would be the first to agree. I suggest that those Opposition critics who reject the idea of overseas borrowing would realize, if they moved about the countryside a little more than they do. and used their powers of perception adequately, the extraordinary value to Australia's economy of these dollar loans and the great benefit derived from the dollar imports made possible by them. I recognize that Labour is traditionally opposed to overseas borrowing. Opposition members have built up in their own minds » fiction that overseas lenders, like Shakespeare's Shylock, are bent on obtaining their last pound of flesh. Perhaps the memories of Opposition members are still a little coloured by recollections of the unfortunate incidents that occurred in 1931 when a State Premier of Labour persuasion subjected Australia to the indignity of the first repudiation that had ever occurred in the field of public finance. I should like to remind Opposition members, and also the people of Australia, that the Lyons Government, which was not a Labour administration, was responsible for restoring overseas confidence in Australia's credit. Possibly the nasty thought that it had fallen down on the job is one of the basic reasons why the Opposition opposes borrowing overseas. However, that is in passing. The honourable member for Melbourne, in the course of his speech on this bill, drew attention to the extraordinar* capacity of Labour for raising money durin? t^e war period and the immedi""t"" r>ost-war period. On the facts of the case, ignoring every other consideration. Labour did fairly well. Labour restrain"""" in'erest rates and «ot the money 1 it wan""e-i. but the Australian people will always remember that certain other concomitants of raising money made it almost impossible for the general puouc to invest in anything but government loans, in oiner words, the government of the day had a strangle-hold on the money market, wnich it carried on after the war. it had control of mortgage rates; it had control of interest rates; and it had control over capital issue. Prices of stocks and shares were pegged on the stock exchange. The price of land was pegged, and the average ordinary investor had only one channel in which to put his money-governmen t loans. I agree that, during war-time, that was good. It had to he done, and any government of the future would probably do the same; but it is idle for the Opposition, in the face of the restrictions that it imposed on the investing public, to try to tell the people of Australia that it was due to its policies that it could fill its loans in time of peace. While the people of Australia, with their natural patriotism, will subscribe to a policy which means lending to the utmost for war purposes, when the war is over they have another thought about it. That is where I believe the arguments of the honourable member for Melbourne were completely away from the real considerations of the money market to-day. During the course of the debate to-night, and in previous debates on this similar subject, various references have been made to the rather hard terms which, it is claimed, the International Bank imposes on Australia. I think my colleague, the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Bury) dealt with that effectively, but I would like to refer, particularly in relation to interest rates, to the last report issued by the bank, ft is the eleventh annual report, covering activities for 1955-56. On page 12, in reference to interest rates-the matter in respect of which it is alleged that Australia has been dealt with harshly-the report statesBecause of a general rise in monev rates in the worM's maior capital markets, the Bank's interest charges, which are based upon the estimated cost of borrowing by the Bank at the time a Inan is ma'le. were raised toward the end of the year. Including the I ner cent, commission, the rat? on loans of more than fifteen years was r-i^e ' mm 4i to 5 ner cent. The new rate for shorter perin-'s was set at 4} ner cent., c""""""nre with the two previous rates of 4 i per cei' M te'i years and 4\ per cent, from eleven tn fi «vi years. As we understand it. under this MI we are borrowina at 4J per cent., incl idin"" the commission rate, and I say that far from dealing narshly wuh Australia the International Bank is giving us fair average treatment as a borrowing country. The next question 1 wish to discuss concerns the attitude of the Opposition towards the servicing of this loan overseas, and also, in general, its attitude towards the servicing of dividends from American investments within Australia. This is a very large subject and while Mr Dawson, who was quoted by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Crean), is quite entitle. to 1 his own opinion about this matter, I believe that the whole background of that opinion is based on a theory that Australia must always be a borrower country and there must always be a dollar difficulty. May I remind honourable members opposite that the total dollar debt-no t merely the one we are now debating, but the total debt of some 317,000,000 dollars-is only the equivalent of approximately one-third of the present Australian wool clip. To say that it is beyond our capacity and our capability to repay that sum seems to me to deny any hope of success in this country in the future. I say that the arguments of Mr Dawson, quoted by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, pointing out the grave danger of the servicing difficulties that might arise in relation to these overseas loans, are based on a complete fear of, or distrust in, the future of Australia. IfI believed that Australia was, in racing parlance, a "" nohoper"" country, I would agree with the honourable member, but I believe that this country is going on to greater fulfilment than we have seen in other parts of the world, particularly in the southern hemisphere. That is why I say that people such as Mr Dawson and the honourable member for Melbourne Ports are renouncing their faith in Australia's future. Their attitude is consistent with saying that Australia must always be a borrower and that this money cannot produce the type of equipment that we require to carry out the development of this great country. Ii also suggests a belief that the United States of f America will always be a creditor and that there will always be a dollar shortage. 1 The honourable member for Melbourne f Ports gave some very detailed ngures about Australia's dollar imbalance. There is one point which I feel should be brought to the notice of the House: To a great extent that imbalance, as it appears on the ngures, is brougm about by the fact that America has not been an immediate or direct buyer in the Australian wool market. Over a number of years America's direct wool purchases have been supplemented by purchases of Australian wool, delivered to European ports, and carried on to Boston and other American wool-selling centres, ln fact, a .great proportion of the Australian wool clip which one might expect to be bought directly by the United States, has been purchased indirectly through continental countries which have, through that means, been able to avail themselves of dollar currency. While it would be impossible to estimate the exact amount of wool that is being sold through indirect methods into the American market, I can assure the House of my own knowledge that the American wool buyers have always said that it is cheaper for them to buy Australian wool in Boston than to buy it in Australia. As1 said earlier, continental buyers have been buying Australian wool, re-shipping it from continental ports to the United States, and getting dollar currency for the general benefit of their own country. So this imbalance, particularly in relation to wool, might be more apparent than real. Another remark made by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports concerned undistributed profits, and he particularly referred to manufacturing profits. Taking the strategic angle on the general question of Australia's economic future, I hold the view that the more investment interests we can get in Australia the stronger our general defence position will be. I believe that the fact that America is prepared to invest money in Australia is an expression of its confidence in us as an investment risk. The honourable member for Wentworth has referred to the standing of Australia as a borrower in the view of the International Bank. But I feel that any basis of confidence that may exist under those conditions must also exist on the standards of defence capability and the stability of government in Australia. That, I think, is an expression that we can take to heart in this debate, and particularly in the future when deciding these questions of international loans. If we can encourage and develop American investment within Australia, I feel we can look with some sense of confidence to the immediate and spontaneous support of Australia should we ever get into some difficulty on the international level. The Labour party has presented what they call its faith doctrine, because Labour traditionally rejects the idea of overseas loans. IfI believed that this idea was really genuine and not rubbish, as it really is, and if we could not service these loans. I should be inclined to agree with members of that party. But their present attitude is reminiscent of the remarks of a distinguished American businessman who came to Australia some years ago. In his parting shot to the press, he said, "" While Australia is a great country, it seems to me » country that may be suffering from hardened arteries"". ln other words, it had a condition of premature old age. I believe that is a possibility that should not be ignored in any discussion on Australia's policy on foreign loans. Apparently, the Labour party has no confidence in our future. Perhaps with its intimate knowledge of the harm it is doing in the industrial movement, it may be quite justified in suggesting that there is a tendency politically for it to slow down general activity and the general development of Australia. If, as I say, the background of Opposition members' views is based on the fact that they think politically they can control the industrial movement in Australia, that they can slow down development, and that they can impose their will on the unions to try to evolve some political advantage to them through industrial action, they may be right. I am quite satisfied that, despite the political aspirations of honourable gentlemen opposite and despite the fact that they have, perhaps, a rather jaundiced view of the future of this country, the average workman does not believe them. He believes that, given a chance and given every opportunity with good machinery, good management and good encouragement, Australian industry, both primary and secondary, can carry this country to a great future. honourable member for Corangamite ( Mr Mackinnon) has.

Of course it willi And it goes to lhe defence of its investments elsewhere, too. member want it to do so? ground completely; be logical, if you can, and examine the argument, just for once. I suggest that we might examine this bill at some length, and look a little more closely at the matter raised by the Opposition, to see whether it is a matter of faith, or whether there are any facts in support of our case. The argument raised is that overseas currency is scarce, and that dollar currency in particular is scarce, and that we should seek to obtain overseas currency wherever and whenever we can. We must turn, first of all, to exports and services, but overseas indebtedness by £143,000,000 we find that we cannot get enough in this direction. We must turn, therefore, to loans. We must do this because we want tbe most rapid kind of economic development possible. This is a perfectly logical argument, and to it the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Bury) added the statement that the one justification for borrowing overseas is that the capital that we obtain relatively increases our capacity to carry a greater burden of debt. I think that this was merely an assertion by the honourable member. One would have expected that a person of his experience and background would have taken a look at t^e statistics that are available in Australia to see whether his assertion was COTSC*. Rather did he do the opposite. He si^rr-lv made an assertion and made no attempt to test it. It can be tested, and I propose to do so. 1 suggest that we have experienced in Australia in recent years an increasing dependence upon borrowing. Before1 go into the figures in this regard, let me say that I am perfectly prepared to concedeand I think it could be called a concession -that to-day we are not nearly as dependent on borrowing as we were oeiorc iht war. The impact of borrowing upon our balance of payments, in audition to ounational income and capacity to protiuce, i» probably not so great, as it was beioie tht war. But, I want to direct attention io cfu nature of the problem and the trends ii> that problem that tiiefiguresreveal. 1 shah not pjt mis necessarily upon a politica. level, but one has to start the comparison somewhere. Between 1941-42 and 194849 oar overseas indebtedness showed a nei decrease of £143,000,000. This is a complex figure, taken from the White Paper on National Income and Expenditure, bui it is a figure that can be used for purposes of comparison, because 1 shall use similar figures in a few moments. As1 say, our overseas indebtedness decreased by £143,000,000 in that period. During this, time wefinanceda war effort, in the period between 1941 and 1945, which was very significant, upon any test. We received a considerable amount of investment, both directly in the war sector of the economy and in the other sector of it. About SO0.0O0 people were taken from productive activities and placed in the services. We financed a considerable amount of activity at the same time as we reduced our net But since 1949-50 the trend has been quite the reverse. Since then our overseas indebtedness has increased by £821,000,000. I concede that this still does not put us relatively, in as difficult a position as that which obtained before the war, but that trend and that comparison cannot, I suggest, be overlooked. This increase in our indebtedness is not completely the result of borrowing. It i* also the result of some other factors, and when we turn to the amount of oversea* bonowing to try to find out the significance of borrowing, again we have a rather complex figure which is given in the White Paper on National Income and Expenditure, which not only includes borrowing, but such items .is ndistributed company profits..",51,Reconstruction And Development Bill 1957
147,Mr Aston,Would not the honourable,52,Reconstruction And Development Bill 1957
148,Mr Cairns,"Yes. Do not shiftchanges in foreign bank balances in Australia, deferred import payments and a few other matters of that kind. But the amount borrowed is still the most signincant part of this figure. During the first period, from 1941-42 until 1948-49, a considerable amount of borrowing took place, at, on the whole, much more favorable rates of interest and terms of repayment than in the second period, with which I will deal in a moment. The increase in borrowing amounted to £259,000,000. In the second period, from 1949-50 to 1955-56, the increase amounted to £716,000,000. This increase in our indebtedness and our borrowing is a very significant trend that has developed during the term of office of this Government, which has turned increasingly towards overseas investment of this kind. 1 suggest that the reason for it is indicated by the remark of the honourable member for Wentworth, that inflation makes an internal condition which is not favorable to domestic investment in many fields, is not favorable to domestic savings because of the effect of inflation on the value of savings, and is not favorable to the direction of investment into essential places. Not only has this occurred, but there has been a very erratic behaviour in the inflow of loans. If we are dependent significantly upon loans, that dependence is not so critical if we can see a fairly uniform and steady pattern of available loan funds, a rising pattern or at least a steady one. But that has not been so. Overseas investment in Australia since World War II . has followed a most erratic course, and I suggest that this is one of the dangers that Australia is facing. I should like to run through the figures from 1941-42 to show the erratic nature of this investment. These figures include both public and private investment, and they are as follows:1941-42 1942-43 12.000.000 36.000 000 1943-44 1944-45 1945-46 1946-47 1947-48 72.000 000 t948-49 1949-50 1950-51 1951-52 .. 148.000 000 1952-53 .. _ j 5 001 000 1953-54 19M-55 1955-56 The figures follow a most erratic course. Mr Ian Allan -There was a war on in 1951. situation must be related to the general condition of the economy. Normally we might have relied a little more upon export earnings and services to finance the amount of overseas payments that we were required to make. We were not able to do that, so the gap has been filled from the proceeds oi overseas loans. The really significant thing about this is that in almost every year since the war the gap has had to be filled by the proceeds of overseas loans. This is just where the overseas loans impact relatively more on the economy now, I. should think, than before the war. We were never, as far as one can see, in a similar position before the war, although the figures necessary to test the accuracy of this statement are not available readily or perhaps at all. Despite this situation, we have had a condition which is not really new, of controlled imports. By controlling imports, we have been able to create something of an economic playground in this country. By means of import controls, the present Government has been able to permit inflationary pressures to continue, and it has been able to see, as the Treasurer was able to see in 1950, the distortions of the economy that these inflationary pressures have produced. The effects of this, generally speaking, are fairly well known, but I suggest that the main effect in relation to borrowing and lending has been to make domestic investment a less significant factor in the long-run development of our own economy, and we have not been able, therefore, to earn sufficient funds to pay even for controlled imports, and for freights, services and other invisibles. We have become dependent, for our balance in most years, upon borrowing of the type I have already discussed. Where inflation has been dealt with, funds are more £ readily available from domestic sources. The alternative to going overseas for increas1.000 000 ing amounts of funds is to deal with infla. -41.00 0 000 tion and the distortions of inflation in our 13.000 000 own economy. The Government is forced, 32 000 000 to some extent, to go overseas and to do the 134.000 000 things it it doing because it will not come .. 205.000.000 to grips with the inflationary situation at 79 ooo noo home. .. 24.000 000 The next matter that T should like to deal .. 127.000 000 with concerns a sionificant point raised by .. 148.000.000 the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Bury). I suggested earlier that he raised",52,Reconstruction And Development Bill 1957
149,Mr Cairns,"S o I believe. 1 think thethis point in terms of a pure assertion which one would hardly have expected from a man of his knowledge and access to sources. One would hardly have expected the simple assertion that Australia is able to carry the burden of loans more easily. There are some figures by which we can test this. The test, necessarily, is somewhat arbitrary, but we can take the cost of servicing overseas loans in various ways, and we can compare that cost with our export earnings, or with our gross national product. If we had a measure of our total capital investment we also could compare it with that. If we had a measure of our productive capacity we could compare it with that, too, but as we have no measures of our gross capital structure, and our productive capacity that make sense, we cannot test it in that way. But we have a measure of exports and we have a measure of gross national product. If we look at the cost of servicing our loans, the net dividends and interest paid overseas, and if we include undistributed profits, although that may not be completely accurate, we shall see that there has been an improvement in the post-war period compared with the pre-war period. I made that concession earlier, and it is also borne out by these ngures. In 1941-42, the total cost of net interest, dividends paid overseas and undistributed profits-w e have to take them in these years together because the White Paper on National Income does not separate them until, I think, 1948-49-wa s £28.000,000, or 18 per cent, or 19 per cent, of the value of our exports at that time. Between 1941 and 1949. there was a decline from that 18 per cent, or 19 per cent, to 3.5 per cent, or 4 per cent, of the value of our exports. There was some fluctuation, mainly in respect of exports, but in the post-1949 period, I suggest there has been no increased capacity of the Australian economy to carry the cost of servicing overseas loans, because in 1949-50 the amount of net interest, dividends paid and undistributed profits£31,000,000-represente d 5.1 per cent, of the value of exports. In the last year, at £60.000.000, the figure for net interest, divior the other, on the statements that have dends paid and undistributed profits represented 7.7 per cent, of our exports. If one takes net interest, as it can be taken now from 1949. it will be found that the net interest of £15.000.000 in 1949-50 has more than doubled, to £31.000.000 in 1955-56. If we take the cost of servicing loans-ne t interest, dividends paid and undistributed profits-w e find that the increase from £31.000,000 in 1949-50 to £60,000,000 in 1955-56 is just a little more than 90 per cent. It so happens that our gross national product also has increased by approximately 90 per cent., so that there is not much difference there. In both these cases, there is no allowance for price increases, but if we allow for price increases we find that the comparison is a little less favorable to the argument that the economy is now more capable of carrying the cost of servicing overseas loans than it was before. SoI suggest that, had the honourable member for Wentworth taken the time to check the figures, he would have found that his proposition that the economy is now more capable of carrying overseas loans was not borne out. I am not going to say that, even on that comparison, the economy is less capable of doing so, but I say that the statistics which are available are inclined to that view. They certainly do not support the view put forward by the honourable member. Departing for a moment from these general considerations, before I conclude 1 should like to look at a few particular considerations in relation to this bill. On several occasions I have endeavoured, by way of questions on notice and other forms of question, to discover from the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) whether there is any tie between money obtained from loans from the International Bank and the spending ot that money in dollar areas. From my own point of view, I think that a loan of this kind from the International Bank is, in many ways, preferable to a loan on the market in the ordinary way. In this case, we can certainly see the kind of goods that will be imported, and we can make some test of whether or not they are essential in relation to other things. In respect of most of our loans from overseas, we can make no such test. In regard to the questions that I have directed to the Treasurer, I have been unable to find evidence one way been made, that there is no such tie or that these funds may be spent in any part of the world. Theoretically, perhaps, they may be spent anywhere, but evidence accumulates from a good many importers who are concerned, for example, with the importation of tractors, that it is relatively much easier to obtain tractors from American sources than it is from European sources. When one turns to the agreement there is a suggestion, I think, that this might be the case. In Article III . of the second schedule to the bill we find a section which deals with currencies in which the proceeds of loans are to be withdrawn. The section statesThe Borrower shall use reasonable efforts to assure that payment for goods financed out of -he proceeds of the Loan is made in the currencies loans have been £86.000,000. That is of the countries from which such goods are tcquired. The proceeds of the Loan shall, to che extent that the Bank shall so elect, be withdrawn from the Loan Account in the several currencies in which goods are paid for. Ibis is the sentence I want to stressThe Bank shall be under no obligation to permit the proceeds of the Loan to be withdrawn in any currency except the currency in which the Loan is lenominated. \nd, of course, the loan is denominated in dollars. It seems to me that it may be possibleI do not know whether it happens, and I am raising this question in an effort to find out whether it does-in terms of this proposition contained in Article III . of the second schedule of the bill, that the bank may influence the spending of loans in countries in the dollar area. When we look on a little further, we find, in Article VI . , that a bond is to be entered into by the borrower. The relevant section statesThe Borrower shall execute and deliver Bonds representing the principal amount of the Loan, is hereinafter in this Article provided. When we look to see the kind of bond that the borrower shall execute-and this may be simply an accident-w e find that the form of the bond is covered by ScheduleI and is headed, "" Form of Registered Bond without Coupons Payable in Dollars"". The dollar sign and the dollar condition, as it were, appear throughout the bond. I have raised this matter with the object of trying to discover whether, in fact, there will be a tendency-perhap s not as the result of a deliberate decision-for the proceeds of the loan, in practice, to be spent upon dollar goods. I relate this to the proposition put forward by the honourable member for Melbourne, who showed that relatively there was a greater pressure upon the sterling area currency than upon the dollar area currency in the oneration of import controls. There appears to be a suggestion that the proceeds of the loan are tied in some way to dollar goods. I should like to conclude by summarizing my propositions. Although we are now not quite so dependent upon borrowing as we were before the war, we are becoming increasingly dependent upon borrowing, and, what is more, upon a kind of borrowing which is erratic and which fluctuates in a marked way. This increasing dependence can be demonstrated. For the five-year period 1951-52 to 1955-56, our average annual receipts from overseas what we have gained, on the average, in each of those years. But if we examine the cost of servicing our overseas loans, we find that the cost of dividends and remitted profits alone for each of those years has been, on the average, £28.000,000. or 32 per cent, of all that we have obtained in each year by borrowing from overseas, ft is easv to say. as did the honourable member for Wentwor'h f Mr BunO. that the money obtained by those new borrowings takes the shape of a capital structure and increases the capacity of the country to bear the cost of the loans: but I suggest that when one looks at the figures, one sees that our capacity to do so has not been increased. During the last five years we have obtained, on the average. £86.000.000 each year from overseas loans, but the averase annual cost of dividends and remitted profits, plus undistributed profits, has been £53,000.000, or 61 per cent, of the money that we have obtained, on the average, in each of those years. Perhaps undistributed profits are not a current and continuing charge upon the balance of payments, but about £119.000.000 of undistributed profits has accumulated during that period of five years. Much of that money has been reinvested. Unless those assets are sold, the money could not readily become a charge upon our balance of payments, but the fact must not be overlooked that a cons'derable portion of the money represented by those undistributed profits is available to be withdrawn in the event of some sort of crisis. If we take into account the interest charges on public authority loans, wh'ch are at the rate of £26.000.000 a year for this period, we find that the cost of dividends, remitted profits, undistributed profits and interest on public authority loans amounts to 92 per cent, of the money that we have obtained in new loans in the last five years. high, and loans.

153,Mr Drummond,"I am sorry, but 1legislation states specifically what this particular loan is to be expended on. 1 would say to my honourable friend opposite, the honourable member for Yarra, that if he looks back into historya subject on which, no doubt, he is far better informed than I am-h e will find that the United States, right up to the end of World WarI . , and, I think, for some time afterwards, was a debtor nation. America, with its tremendous assets, being a country far more richly endowed than Australia is, liquidated its burden of debt by the speedy development of its assets over a long period of years. How, in the name of goodness, can we develop this asset of Australia if we do not seek from those who have then the wherewithal and the means of development? We have done that. The honourable member for Corangamite or the honourable member for Wannon dealt with the question of the uses to which we could put the finance obtained. I do not want to traverse that matter, but 1 wish to say that if we. are going to develop this country we have to use the same means as America used. If we have a friendly lender we must use the services of that lender to help us with our development. I think it was the honourable member for Melbourne Ports who referred to the Canadian position. I am not as well informed on the subject as he is, but I know that the conclusion that was arrived at by the various sections of the Canadian people who went into this matter was that, on balance, Canada had benefited from the tremendous inflow of capital from the United States, and that they shrank away from any proposal to put a clamp on that which was developing Canada's assets. I remind the House, in all seriousness, that in Europe even countries which have been hereditary enemies, hitherto bent on destroying one another, have come together to pool their assets and strengthen their economies. I mention that because I think that in this age one must have a wide vision. We have shown it ourselves in the Colombo plan. One must look beyond the mere boundaries between, say. the United States and Canada and, certainly, between the United States and Australia. The resources of the world should be marshalled, not as a means by which the United States can squeeze, say, Australia or Canada; but for the common use and benent of humanity. Any contrary idea is as out-dated and outrageous as the robber baron approach of simply killing a neighbour and taking away his gold ducats -thoug h such a course of action might bave had more validity then than now. The honourable member for Corangamite ( Mr Mackinnon) referred to the way in which our war-time economy was conducted. The government of the daj', quite rightly, clamped down on the investment of money and thereby not only prevented inflation but also made it extremely easy to get, without excessive interest commitments, the money that it needed for its war loans. I think that such action serves no very good purpose in peace-time, and an economist such as the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Cairns), although he may not agree with my philosophy, will know that what I am saying is plain fact. We are living through a period in which we are trying to ensure a reasonable amount of personal freedom of action. One of the prices of that freedom is that we cannot close down on the money market without creating distortions that may outweigh by far the benefit obtained. Even conservative governments in Great Britain have used the weapon of closing the money market to outside investment in order to fill government loans on suitable terms. Indeed, all governments use this device in time of crisis, but I do not think we would be justified in using it at present. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell), enumerated several points which he described as vital. He said that external borrowing could be avoided if overseas firms came into the country, bringing their assets with them, and developed factories. A great deal has been done in that regard, but we cannot expect private capital to come in unless we can offer constitutional security, which is available only in the Commonwealth sphere at the present time. The Commonwealth Constitution lays down that if a property is acquired for the purposes of the Commonwealth, such acquisition must take place on just terms. Unfortunately, the States are not so bound. I do not intend to discuss whether the Commonwealth or a State is justified in acquiring, nationalizing or anvthing of that kind. Tn the final analysis that is a matter for the people, through a responsible government. I merely suggest that any one who is invited or encouraged to come here should be assured that if it is necessary in the public interest to take over his property it shall be themselves. In other words, as in many done on what reasonable men understand as "" just terms "". I want to refer briefly to the purposes for which this loan is being raised. We have already discussed the raising of money for the purposes of the aviation industry of this country, and I do not propose to traverse that subject further. A year or two ago a well-known Australian arranged for a certain Canadian firm to come here and develop one of our greatest national assets on certain terms. First, the firm would prepare the plan and accept the recognized fee. Secondly, if desired, it would supervise the work, again for a fee. Thirdly, it could carry out the work, bringing with it the whole of the machinery, equipment, employees and houses required. The only call upon the economy of the country would have been for food, services and clothes. Whilst a project handled in this manner would not be as inflationary as would perhaps action in other directions, there would be a call upon our resources for education, health, food and clothing, and to the extent that these might be in short supply there would be a certain inflationary effect. I leave it to my friends, the economists, to correct me if that is not a fair assessment of the position. 1 thoroughly agree that it would have been the right thing to do, but, unfortunately, because of the different view of the State concerned, it was not carried into effect. I think that it would be one of the important things which could be done materially to assist us in handling our own immigration policy and to enable us to absorb more and more people without affecting, in any serious way, our standard of living. T want to correct one statement that has been made. I am sorry that the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) is not here because I woHd prefer to say this in his presence. He referred to the fact that a certain amount of money was being allocated for the purposes of the railways and for the purchase of diesel-electric locomotives. He said, quite rightly, that they are being constructed in this country. But he overlooked the fact that over £20.000,000 has been allocated for the modernization of railways up to the present time. A large proportion of that money has been used to pay for components for dieselelectric locomotives, not for the locomotives other fields, we have to import a substantial quantity of material, partly raw, partly manufactured, and sometimes wholly manufactured, in order to enable us to operate our secondary industries effectively. ln time to come, we shall more and more overcome that disability; but the fact remains that even when we achieve a higb state of industrial development, we shall still find that it will pay us to get certain specialized components or specialized machines from outside Australia. That is a very good thing from the world point of view. It makes for multi-lateral trade between countries. We need to trade with other countries and as long as we have substantially the basis for the development of our own economy, we shall be able to meet a crisis of the kind which we could not meet in the 1930's because our secondary industries had not developed to the point at which we could cope with many of the troubles which arose. Our position is much better to-day. Subject to what 1 have said, I think that we would not be well advised uneconomically to develop the production of things which are not used in great quantities in Australia. I want to congratulate the Government in general, and the Treasurer in particular, on the fact that a certain amount of imports, including goods purchased with the sum of 75,000,000 dollars, comprises those things which can develop the industries of the land. We have learned anew, in a dramatic fashion, just what the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization has done for the wool industry. The rise in the price of wool has assisted Australia out of what could have been an extremely dangerous position. 1 think the Government is to be commended on its statesmanlike approach to the matter of primary industry, and on its taxing policy and borrowing policy which enables the Government to provide the means to increase production and to get it back by way of increased.receipts from taxation. Therefore. I have much pleasure in supporting the bill and commending it to the House. Mr O'CONNOR (Dalley) [9.54] I am struck by the almost limitless enthusiasm of the Government members who have spoken to-night in support of this measure. I cannot help but contrast their attitude with that which they adopted a few weeks ago when this House was considering the provision of more money for housing. On that occasion, every conceivable argument was brought forward by Government members in an attempt to show that any money that was made available for housing, other than that which had been allocated, wouid tend to aggravate a condition of inflation. If Government members consider that the injection of additional money into the economy for the purpose of building homes will aggravate inflation, how do they justify increasing our overseas indebtedness by 50,000,000 dollars? One cannot help but contrast the speech delivered by the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) when he introduced this bill with his attitude when he attends a meeting of the Australian Loan Council. When the representatives of the States are attempting to get from the Treasurer additional money to enable them to carry out capita) works, they are told that their works must be financed from Consolidated Revenue and that, as a consequence, the Treasurer will not make any loans available to them for their capital works. Yet he has attempted to justify this additional loan of 50.000,000 dollars. If it was the first dollar loan that this Government had secured, the attempt that has been made to justify the Treasurer's policy might have been convincing. But this represents the fifth approach that has been made to the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Including 9,000,000 dollars that has been secured for Qantas, our overseas debt has been increased by no less than 317,000,000 dollars during this Government's regime. No Government supporter has yet put before the House a positive statement as to how we are going to earn dollars to repay or reduce our overseas indebtedness. The only way in which we are paying our way in the dollar area is, as has been proved by the honourable member for Yarra( Mr comparable to the acts of the Cnifley Cairns), by borrowing additional dollars to pay back debts that we have already incurred. Corangamite ( Mr Mackinnon) was very optimistic when he said that if the United States of America would only purchase more of our wool our dollar problem would be solved. The problem is not so easy of solution as that prospect would indicate. America itself is in no need of our wool. It was only a few years ago that the Congress itself raised the tariff against the entry of Australian wool into America, and if the increase had become operative our wool would have been excluded from the American market. The tariff imposed by Congress was only reduced as a result of a veto by President Truman. Knowing the pressure that is exercised in politics in America in relation to wool and knowing that the tariff imposed by Congress on one occasion was reduced only by presidential action, I fail to see how we can increase our dollar earnings from wooL When it is recognized that 70 per cent, of our earnings are derived from the sale of wool and wheat, it will be seen that we have a very limited and narrow field in which to earn dollars. But this Government has gone extensively into the dollar area and committed us to a debt wbich, 1 believe, we wiU not be able to pay. It has adopted the principle of borrowing further dollars te repay those that it borrowed previously. If that is sound finance, we have no worthwhile prospects. I should like to contrast the present Government's approach to our sterling indebtedness with that of the Labour Government. It is perfectly true that, during World War II., we were able to reduce our overseas indebtedness. We should have reduced it even further if Australia's labour leaders at the time had not heeded the pleas of the United Kingdom authorises. I think the Chifley Governmeni made available to the United Kingdom in grants no less than £50,000,000. It was suggested, during the term of the Chifley Government, that, since our overseas balances were so favorable, we might reduce our sterling indebtedness, but the United Kingdom Governmenr asked Australia instead to make straight-out grants to it, and the Chifley Government agreed. That is in sharp contrast to the present Government's attitude. I cannot recall that, in its seven years in office, it has once done anything Government between 1946 and 1949 in response to the requests made by the United The honourable member for Kingdom Government. I do no: think that the Uniied Kingdom's financial problems have eased greatly since 1949. Indeed, the Mother Country now faces a number of problems with which it was no confronted then. It is faced with the oroblem of disappearing markets and the loss of overseas investments, lf the Chil1e\ uovemment could assist the United Kinom just after we had emerged from a war, why has this Government not been able to afford help in the favorable years that it has experienced? The introduction of overseas capital into A ustralia has brought considerable problems, notwithstanding the enthusiastic support of this Government and its adherents. It appears to me that the Government's policy is "" Boom or bust"". The capital being obtained from overseas is not being employed selectively, but is being allowed to gravitate where it will. In fact, one-third of the capital that has entered this country from Canada, the United States of America, and the United Kingdom has found its way into the manufacturing field. This Government, like any other, could easily face a recession. If one occurs, the policy of the present Government will accentuate its severity. We shall most certainly not escape it, but shall have to face it as best we can. Our troubes in 1930 were aggravated by our overseas indebtedness. We could not escape the impact of the depression, because it was world-wide, and our internal difficulties were intensified by the necessity to meet interest and other payments on our overseas capital indebtedness. The policy of the present Government is developing for Australia a problem that must be faced sooner or later. It is not sufficient merely to introduce fresh overseas capital into the country. Indeed, one of the greatest difficulties that we have at present is the result of the uncontrolled influx of capital in the early days of development. A case in point is the capital indebtedness of the New South Wales railways, which pay interest charges alone amounting '-to £6,000,000 a year. The transport system of New South Wales is incurring a total annual loss of approximately that amount. The heavy financial burden represented by the interest paid by the New South Wales railways is a direct result of the influx of overseas capital that took place many years ago. It is frequently argued that the introduction of overseas capital will, of necessity, promote development and secure Australia's future, but the history of the developmental activities of the States does not bear out this assertion. During the period from 1947 to 1954, private overseas investment in commercial enterprises in Australia increased by approximately 156 per cent., from about £244,000,000 to about £627,000,000. An increasing proportion of foreign investment in the private field has come from the United States and Canada. In 1947, investment attributable to these two countries represented 16.2 per cent, of company investment in Australia, ln 1954, it represented 21.4 per cent, of the total, in the same period, United Kingdom investment in Australian companies increased from £178,000,000 to £437,000,000, but the United Kingdom share of the total declined from 73 per cent, to 69 per cent. It is interesting to note that, in the period between 1947 and 1954, £381,000,000 of private investment, as distinct from government loans, came from overseas£259,000,000, or 68 per cent, from the United Kingdom; £94,000,000, or 25 pei cent., from Canada and the United States; and £28,000,000, or 7 per cent., from other countries. Dollar investment in Australia has increased considerably in recent years. This increase is due, in some measure, to the practice of ploughing back into industries the profits that they have earned. It is interesting to note how the profits of American-owned companies in Australia have increased. During the period between 1948 and 1951, the average annual profits of such companies increased from approximately £4,000.000 to approximately £13,000,000. Overseas investment in Australia has created a number of difficulties, particularly by intensifying the problem of repayments. Although, temporarily, we have gained some benefit from dollar investment in this country, we are sometimes reminded that the policy of ploughing back profits into industry means that if ever the American investors wanted to take their profits out of Australia, our entire dollar earnings would be absorbed in paying interest and dividends. This bill will increase our dollar indebtedness and our general overseas indebtedness. Under the administration of this Government, the national debt for each head of the population has increased by one-third. Regardless of what Government supporters say, this injection of additional capital into the economy will have inflationary effects. I referred, earlier, to the statement by the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) that the provision of additional money for housing would increase inflationary pressures, and to his refusal to increase housing funds. It is interesting to note that he announced in the press the very next day that the Government proposed to spend an additional £50.000,000 in purchasing more modern aircraft for the Royal Australian Air Force. Nobody opposes the modernizing of our armed forces, but it is very unconvincing when, having listened to the Prime Minister say in this House one night that no more money could be made available for housing, one picks up the newspapers on the following morning and reads that an additional £50,000,000 has been made available for some other purpose. 1 submit that this bill is of its very characwas intended as a reflection upon myself. ter inflationary. This country is being committed to something which it will never be able to repay. The bill does not secure the future development of this country. The truth is that at the present time we are borrowing to repay past loans. I have Already referred to the loans that were secured at the beginning of this century, including those obtained by the States for their own development. In those days, the railways were just as important as any other form of transport is to-day. As a result of capital indebtedness the State railways are being run at a loss. This Government must not only justify its proposed expenditure of dollars; it must also put forward some convincing argument about how we can earn dollars to repay the loan. I have already pointed out that wool and wheat account for 70 per cent, of our earnings overseas and that the Americans need not buy our wool. The only chance we have of getting dollars at the moment is for the Americans to purchase our wool in quantity. The tendency in America is against purchases of Australian wool because the Americans have a problem of their own and they will not permit Australian wool to enter the American market to the detriment of the local product. Therefore, I submit that something more is required than the limitless enthusiasm that Government members have displayed in supporting this bill. One cannot help but contrast their attitude on this occasion with their attitude a few weeks ago when they supported the Prime Minister's statement that no more money could be made available for housing.

It has never been my practice to do so, but I certainly believe that an honourable member should be more accurate in his information before reflecting upon any other honourable member in this chamber. I have nothing more to say on this matter because I think I have made it perfectly clear that he was completely at fault in the statement he made. It was not in accordance with fact. There is another matter to which I desire which to refer, because I want to relieve the anxiety of this Government, which is always away and I was indeed sorry to receive this news. proclaiming its work on behalf of ex-servicemen. recollect that on a number of occasions 1 have raised in this House the case of a Mr Laurence Atkins, who was an inmate of the Royal Ryde Home. Both his legs were crippled and his hands had become calcified. He was totally blind. Both eyes had been removed as they had been affected by his condition of osteo-arthritis. This Government, which is always talking about the percentage of ex-servicemen amongsl its supporters was paying him a 25 per cent, pension, namely, £1 3s. 9d. a week. 1 raised this matter continually in the House, hoping that the Government would do something to relieve the lot of this unfortunate man. 1 well recollect one honourable I would member saying that 1 had rather exaggerated the position. Well. I am now able to tell the Government that it need not worry any further about this unfortunate ex-serviceman because shortly after I last spoke about him he passed away. I think honourable members opposite will remember my submission that because of this man's condition, he could not possibly live much longer and that the Government should display some generosity towards him and give him a decent pension so that at least he could return home and end his days with his aged parents. Following his death I received a lettei from his mother forwarding a letter left by her son. I replied to Mrs. Atkins, as 1 felt very keenly about this matter which 1 had raised in the House on a number of occasions. I shall not read the whole of the letter that 1 received from the deceased ex-serviceman, but shall outline how he felt about the way in which the Government had handled his case. He said, in the letter I received after his death. . . this report is incomplete, unjust, biased and nothing more than a propaganda leaflet. He went on to say. referring to one occasion when he was before the tribunal. . . unofficially my advocate was informed that the Tribunal had accepted my case and only needed to be sent to the Commission for approval. I replied to the mother as follows:Dear Mrs. Atkins, Many thanks for forwarding to me a letter found among the papers of your late son, Laurence, and as you state he obviously intended sending to me had death not intervened. I was not aware that his Dad had also passed It had not heen my privilege to know your son Honourable members will for such a long time, but from the opinion I formed of his sterling qualities, I was not surprised to receive your description of him as 'wing a good son. I know it will be some consolation to you 'o know that he was greatly respected by all -vho knew him for his great courage in maintaining his fight for justice particularly when he was <o seriously handicapped. As you say, it is now too late to do anythting <o assist Laurie on this earth for his sufferings nave mercifully ended, but his example and great struggle for what he knew to be right, I feel iure will materially assist others who may be confronted with a somewhat similar problem. That correctly sums up the situation because it is true that this unfortunate ex-serviceman cannot benent as the result of -tny action that this Government may now take, unless it feels disposed to give some financial assistance to his aged and ailing mother. But judging by past experience of its handling of these cases, we could dot expect that to happen. Therefore, I say that Labour members should continue to apply pressure to this Government to get it to administer the Repatriation Act in the spirit in which the Labour government intended it to be administered when we inserted in the act a few years ago a provision that the onus of proof must be upon the department and the Government before an application is dismissed. What were the actual facts in this matter? Honourable members will recall that it was argued that some osteoarthritis had been in existence prior to the man's enlistment. But he was accepted. Although some military doctors had recommended his discharge, the authorities at the time would not discharge him from the Army. They permitted him to continue to serve and he Was in hospital after hospital. As a result of his service in the Pacific area under very adverse conditions, it is quite obvious that his condition of osteoarthritis, if it existed in any form prior to his enlistment, had been seriously aggravated by his service. able member's time has expired. not propose to canvass the subjects covered another, and the Government will be put by the honourable member for East Sydney. in a position where it will vi tually say ( Mr Ward) this evening, save to express who will be appointed to various positions my astonishment at this rather engaging and who will receive promotion. The procharacteristic that he has now revealedsensitivity. I should have thought that he would make his charges against the honororganization and such an odd mechanism able member for Lyne( Mr Lucock) in within its control. that honourable member's presence. It is a great pity that he did not at least have the courtesy to inform the honourable member for Lyne that he proposed to imply and, indeed, make the charge this evening that the honourable member for Lyne had reflected upon him. The matter that I want to refer to this evening is something which, happily, has commanded the generous support of all members in this House-the Commonwealth scholarship scheme. Since the introduction of the scheme some years ago, many thousands of young people throughout Australia have benefited considerably from it, and many thousands of families have been grateful for its existence. But this evening I want to bare the fact that the continuation of the scheme in Queensland is in serious jeopardy. Last year, some 436 students were awarded a Commonwealth scholarship in Queensland, making a total of some 1.252 current at the moment. Honourable gentlemen may ask why the scheme in Queensland faces jeopardy. Recently, the Queensland Government introduced legislation radically altering the structure of administration within the Queensland University. In a recent bill, it has provided for the establishment of an appeals board covering promotions and applications for employment on the staff of the university. The appeals board works in a curious fashion, but a fashion that is by no means curious to people familiar witb the legislation of Queensland. Assuming that an individual applies for a job with the Queensland University, either on a professorial level or on a lecturer level, and he is unsuccessful, as the disgruntled appellant he has the right to nominate an individual to an appeals board. The Senate of the university also nominates a person to that board, and the Government nominates a representative of the appellant and the posal is unique.

The Queensland proposal, I believe, must be a challenge to every right-thinking person in this House. It is reducing the university Senate to a degree of complete servility. It is taking -out of the hands of the university the control of its own domestic affairs. As a further example of the mischievousness of the legislation, I point out to the House that the Senate appoints a vice-chancellor but the appointment is subject to ratification by die Minister. That is further evidence thai the Queensland Government apparently is -quite determined to control all the afTairs within the Queensland University. I submit that the continuation of the Commonwealth scholarship scheme under honourable member for East Sydney, and such conditions is virtually impossible. I any of his colleagues, through you, Mr believe that the scheme was designed to Speaker, that to my knowledge the honorgive to students scholarships tenable at a able member for Lyne offered his services university, not scholarships tenable at what in 1940. but because of the demands on is virtually a government department.

Why did he not come in and of us who had the opportunity to serve our country are never critical of any one who did not serve, because we are always a little doubtful as to the cause of such a man not entering or being accepted into the services. But, in view of the well-known record of the honourable member for East Sydney, I believe it is disgraceful that he should attack the honourable member for Lyne in the way that he has done to-night. wish to refer to the remarks of the honourable member for Canning( Mr Hamilton). The facts are these: The honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) believed, rightly or wrongly, that the honourable memdays ago. The clause is known as the ber for Lyne( Mr Lucock) last night was seeking to create the impression, if not directly saying so, that he was a hero who had served his country overseas, and that the honourable member for East Sydney was not of the same courageous calibre. It is quite true that the honourable member for East Sydney did not serve as a soldier in the war. Unfortunately, through no fault of his own, the honourable member for Lyne did not serve in the war either. Nor was it the fault of the honourable member for East Sydney that he did not serve in the war. IfI liked to stir this matter up sufficiently I could point some bones at a lot of people on both sides of this chamif this bill receives the Royal assent and ber who were as eligible for active service as was the honourable member for East Sydney. The honourable member for East Sydney has never, to my knowledge, cast aspersions on, or made disparaging remarks about, any man who served his country in World War II -and I have been in this House as long as most honourable members. The honourable member for East Sydney rendered very distinguished service to this country during the war as a member of the Cabinet that administered the war-time afTairs of Australia. If it is considered that the honourable member for East Sydney has cast aspersions on the honourable member for Lyne, why does not the honourable member for Lyne come in here and defend himself? It is well known that almost immediately after the honourable member for East Sydney had resumed his seat the honourable member for Lyne was hiding behind the curtain at tbe door of this himself attack the honourable member for East Sydney, or, alternatively, if he had wronged the honourable member for East Sydney by implying that he was much more courageous than the honourable member for East Sydney, why did he not come in and either confirm or deny that he intended to create such an impression? That is where we see the indicator of courage. join with my friend, the honourable member for Moreton( Mr Killen) in expressing alarm and concern at the nature of the clause that he referred to in a bill that was passed by the Queensland Parliament a few appeals board clause of the Universities Act Management Bill. I share my colleague's alarm at the threat in this clause to the Commonwealth scholarship scheme. As he pointed out, there are some 1,250 students affected by this legislation under the Commonwealth scholarship scheme. This is a matter that far transcends State boundaries, and one which must give us cause for concern on a national basis. I believe that we as a government, and, I trust, as a parliament, hope that the Commonwealth scholarship scheme will flourish and expand. We do not want to see it wither away and die, but that is what I say is likely to happen becomes law. The present arrangement is working perfectly satisfactorily from the point of view of those most concerned with the Conmonwealth scholarship scheme. We are completely satisfied with the present system under which appointments to the university staff are made by a body of 27 university senators, after very careful investigation ol each of the applicants. As my colleague, the honourable member for Moreton, has pointed out, the appeals board which it is proposed will deal with questions of appointments, punishments and dismissals, will consist of three persons, one representing the university senate, one representing the appellant and the third being a government nominee. As the honourable member rightly",65,Adjournment

176,Mr Drury (Ryan) [10.37],"I wish topointed out, the votes of the first two representatives will almost certainly cancel one another, leaving the final decision in the hands of the government nominee. There may or may not be a danger in this. 1 believe that there is. I believe that the new arrangement contains possible political implications, and that it will possibly result in Government interference in university matters, necessarily affecting adversely those students under the Commonwealth scholarship scheme about whom we are concerned. I see in this clause a threat not only to the maintenance of the standards of the university and of our students and the work that they are going to do when they pass through the university, but also to the standards of the professions that these students will embrace. I see also a threat even to freedom of expression by these students while they are at the university. I see also a threat to freedom of expression by members of the staff of the university-and this must necessarily affect the students too. If the junior members of the university staff are afraid to express their views because of possible political implications, then undoubtedly they are not going to be the type of lecturers or professors which the complete removal from government control would help them to be. I believe, sir, that we in this National Parliament must concern ourselves with maintaining the highest possible standards in our universities, because we are directly concerned under this Commonwealth scholarship scheme. 1 believe that it is right that we should have something to say about this matter in the National Parliament. It has been pointed out by one of the professors concerned, and I think that the point was mentioned by my colleague, that the proposed board of appeal has no counterpart in any other part of the freethinking world. In no other free-thinking university is there such an appeal board, and I feel, as the honourable member for Moreton does, that this constitutes a grave threat not only to the standards of our university, but, as I say, to the development of this great democratic institution, and through that, it may possibly harmfully affect the Commonwealth scholarship scheme and the students who are being trained under it. thing I want to say, at the moment, Mr but I do not think it is right that those who Speaker, is that some little while ago I come from far and near and who do not was informed that the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) was addressing the House. 1 was not in the chamber to hear what the honourable member said, and therefore, as I do not know what he said. I feel that it would be unwise for me to make any remarks at this stage. I shall read the "" Hansard"" report of his remarks and, at the appropriate lime to-morrow, I shall make my reply. The remarks that I propose to make, Mr Speaker, directly concern you as chairman of a committee of the Parliament, over which you preside, and in your capacity as controller of the operations of the House, and 1 think they also concern every honourable member. This matter is not in any sense of a party political nature. I understand, sir, that you, as chairman of the committee to which I have referred, with your colleagues in another place, intend to expend certain sums of money to remedy a leak in this building. of the building. Naturally, I do not refer to leaks from Labour caucus meetings, because it seems to be "" open house "" so far as they are concerned now, and it is possible for outsiders to know everything that happens there. I admit that it is necessary to repair the defects in the roof of this building which result in leaks every time that rain falls, but I understand that a large sum is to be expended, although I do not know the exact figure. I have found from experience when temporarily occupying your position, sir. that every time there is an important debate in this House, scores of visitors are unable to be accommodated. My point is that 1 think you should take into consideration the urgent necessity to extend the galleries ot this chamber so that visitors from other States, and even from the National Capital, who come here to hear the debates may find accommodation. 1 have found that those who are acquainted with the procedures of the Parliament, such as secretaries and others who do their work in this building, get priority of place because they know the run of things.

I think that the galleries should be extended io make more accommodation for folk who visit the National Capital and the Parliament and who have a perfect right, as citizens of Australia, to hear the debates. [10.46] I do not speak to-night in any contentious sense, because 1 feel that the matter that has been raised by the honourable members for Moreton( Mr Killen) and Ryan( Mr Drury) is of such importance to education and to the future of Australia that we should say something about it here. 1 should attack any government which brought down a proposal to interfere with the old-established freedoms of universities, and I should counsel the exercise of much greater wisdom and reflection before that as done. IfI understand the position aright, what is proposed, sir, is very closely akin to what I found in Germany in 1936 under the Nazi regime, where the professors had to bow to the dictates of the ruling junta or lose their jobs, where the students who were loyal to the traditions of the universities were hounded out, and where the free and liberal sections of the universities were crushed, just as I understand they are trampled and crushed behind the ->o-called iron curtain to-day. We are Australians and we have a tradition, in respect of universities and their freedoms, which reaches far back into the past. I know that governments, sometimes from my own side of the House, have been rather annoyed with stands taken by university men. In some instances, perhaps, such a stand may not have been wise, and sometimes it may not have been within the professional limits of objectivity of approach to a particular subject, but that is one of the things inherent in a self governing institution. Universities have a peculiar function to discharge in every community. That function is for their professors and students, as far as it is humanly possible, to approach every question from an objective point of view and to try, without bias, to arrive at the truth. If we have made any progress in this Western world, it has been because men have had courage to apply that principle. I hope that, so far as it is possible, every member of this Parliament will counsel those who appear to breach this tradition, and to breach the foundations of it, to think once again before they move finally. support the remarks that have been made by the honourable members for Moreton( Mr Killen) and Ryan( Mr Drury) in relation to this recent amendment of Queensland legislation to provide for the appointment of an appeals board in respect of appointments to the University of Queensland. I think the House should be told why that has been done. It appears that a person who had the ear of some members of the Labour party and who had some influence with the Queensland Labour Government applied unsuccessfully for a position in the Queensland University. Then, because the man had influence, the State Goverament brought down this legislation. It is very similar to the legislation that was brought down by that government to regulate the licensing of club premises in Queensland. It so happened that one person was nominated by the Premier of Queensland for membership of one club and that another person, very prominent in the Queensland Labour party, was nominated for membership of another club, but each was rejected by the members of the club concerned as a person whom the members generally, or a percentage of them, regarded as being unsuitable for membership. As a result, the Queensland Labour Government brought down legislation which contained almost prohibitive provisions concerning the number of members necessary for a club to obtain a liquor licence. Those are two illustrations of the kind of influence that some individuals have with a government that has been in power for so long and that has abused its power so much. I believe that the establishment of an appeals board for the Queensland University is nothing but an act of extreme vindictiveness on the part of the Queensland Government. The Commonwealth has an interest in the universities of this country in that it provides them with financial assistance. Assistance is given under the Commonwealth scholarships scheme and through tax reimbursements. We must also have reaard to the fact that only a short time n<*o the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) stated that",67,Adjournment
181,Mr Drummond (New England),,68,Adjournment
182,Mr Hulme (Petrie) [10.50],"I wish tohe had appointed a commission to investigate the present and future nnancial circumstances of the universities. SoI think it is open to this Parliament to consider the kind of legislation that was passed so recently by the Queensland Parliament. The House has been told already of the composition of the appeals board, but T think it justifies repetition. There are to be three members, one to represent the Senate of the University and another to represent the appellant-that is, an applicant who has not been successful in obtaining an appointment. It can be assumed that in many cases the votes of those two members will cancel out. The third member, the chairman, will be a senior public servant appointed by the Queensland Government. What an invidious position for a public servant! He may be called upon to arbitrate on the appointment of a person to a professorship, a lectureship or another position in the university. He will have no idea of the requirements of the position, or qualifications of the person who has lodged the appeal to fill it, yet he will be called upon to adjudicate on the decision of the Senate of the university, on the one hand, and on the person who is aggrieved, on the other hand. In those circumstances, what attitude will be adopted by people overseas and by people in this country who are qualined for appointment to positions in the Queensland University? I say quite definitely that no such person will resign from the position which he now occupies to take up a position in the Queensland University when an unsuccessful applicant can lodge an objection and. if the objection succeeds, the person originally appointed will be removed from his post and, having resigned the post which he occupied previously at another university or institution, he will be compelled to look for another. WhatI am saying is not something drawn fro n mv imagination. Let me quote the r worr's used by Dr. John Tyrer. the Profe.«o of Medicine at the Queensland Unir versifv. in a letter which he wro'e to the Br^hnne "" Courier-Mail"" and which was p t v ; wi U so n 2nd April-onl y vesterday.

You apy e 'v I think that is the attitude of many people in the university. I believe that many people who might otherwise have applied for positions in the university will not. in fact, apply. As the Minister for Health (Dr. Donald Cameron) points out to me, persons with high qualifications certainly would not willingly place themselves in the position that could arise under this kind of legislation. The Queensland Minister for Public Instruction, endeavouring to justify the action of the State Government, said in a broadcast made last week-end that there should always be provision for appeals. No statement by a member of the Queensland Government could have been more ludicrous than that. At this moment, probably the Queensland Parliament is debating a bill which will do away with one-brand petrol stations in that State. Opposition Members -Hear, hear! members of the Opposition. I point out that that bill makes no provision for a right of appeal. I point out also that there is no right of appeal from the decisions of the authority set up by the Queensland Government which gave rise to the petrol dispute of recent times. I refer, of course, to the price-fixing authority in that State. One man has the power to determine prices, and there is no right of appeal from his decisions. Yet we had that nonsense last weekend from the Queensland Minister for Public Instruction about a right of appeal for a person whose application for appointment to a university post is rejected. The Premier of Queensland has said that his government is entitled to do this because it provides 54 per cent, of the finance of the Queensland University. Does he realize that the Commonwealth Government provides 55 per cent, or 60 per cent, of thefinancesof the Queensland Government? If we applied that process of reasoning, we should have control of what is done administratively or legislatively by the Queensland Government. I believe that this legislation is nothing more than democratic socialism at work. However, from one point of view, it is a good thing. been that : the are well aware, Mr Speaker, first, that the",68,Adjournment

I base my point of order on those two grounds. able member for Petrie must confine his remarks to the question of scholarships. He was off the beam when he dealt with petrol stations, but he dropped that subject before I could call him to order. He will be in order provided he confines his remarks to (scholarships and does not anticipate the debate on any other item on the notice paper. my remarks.

In conclusion, I say that I believe that the Commonwealth Government will be entitled to take this kind of action into consideration when it is determining its own actions for the future. member's time has expired. was. of course, a time in the history of this country when there were no such things as rights of appeal in our public services and in our departments of education. Rights of appeal were brought into being in the various public services, and in the education sphere outside the universities, in relation to appointments to positions, and everybody agreed that it was quite right that such rights of appeal should exist. I do not know much about the Queensland legislation. about it. enough of the general principle to point out that the view being enunciated by honourable members opposite is contrary to every ethic of democracy, and contrary to the best interests of education in this country. able member says. Why should there he a university senate whose decisions are not subject to appeal? university at all? for Social Services, asks why there should be a university. 1 agree that there should be a university, but I believe that the prejudices that are inherent in honourable gentlemen opposite also exist in members oi a university senate. I believe that the possession by members of a university senate of certain academic degrees does not render their verdicts unchallengable. I believe that education in universities, because of the I am nearly at the end of power of some particular individual to invite this or that person to occupy a posiducive to democratic education in this country.

Who is there to-day who says that there are some people whose edict shall not be subject to appeal? 1 say that, after all. the Queensland Government has had reason for the introduction of the legislation referred to. and it is ali eyewash for anybody to propound, as a general principle, as has been propounded here, that a practice which is applicable in the departments of education of every State,",69,Adjournment

In reality, of course, the arguments advanced to-night against appeals from the decision of the Senate of the University of Queensland are the arguments that were advanced in every department of education throughout Australia against appeals from the decisions of directors of education tn relation to appointments. One argument was, "" It is impossible to have the best educational system in this country if our verdicts as to who is to occupy A, B, C, D and E positions in the educational establishments of this State are to be challenged "". They have been challenged, ln many cases they have been upset, often to the advantage of education throughout this country. Because of that, the application of the same principle to a university, despite the fact that universities and those who control them wish to segregate themselves behind some kind of iron curtain, is sound. Mr Cleaver interjecting, able member for Swan will remain silent. completely destroyed the arguments advanced by the honourable member for Petrie( Mr Hulme) on this subject. Minister for Health) [11.5] I feel, after hstening to the speech of the honourable member for Scullin( Mr Peters) that there are a few things I ought to say in this debate, because a great many people must be appalled at the legislation recently passed by the Queensland Parliament with regard to the University of Queensland. Appointments to the staff of a university are not, I think, in the same category as many other appointments. After all, the dominant factor in the selection of persons for appointuniversity. ment to a university staff is the need to secure people of the highest qualifications, and in most universities a very careful process of selection is carried out, chiefly, 1 think, by the professorial board of the university, and the appointments are finally made by the Senate. It is not merely a question of casually calling for applications. Quite often, if the position to be filled is an important one, efforts will be made to secure the appointment of some very prominent person from another institution, either overseas or within this country. Highly confidential reports on the applicants, or those sought for the position, are secured irom all sorts of people in prominent positions, and the net result of this is tu secure fur a university a staff of high quality. If this whole process, which has been built up as a tradition and a highly effective method of appointing skilled and qualined people to university staffs all over the British world, is disturbed, thc only result on an Australian university which has given every promise of being one of the foremost universities in the Commonwealth must inevitably be to destroy the level of efficiency of the stafl and to destroy the confidence of the Australian people in the qualifications and standing of that university. It is a most melancholy thing to think that, for the sake of some doctrinaire principle, this normal process, whereby highly qualified people can be attracted to the stuff of the University of Queensland for the benefit of learning and education in that State, is to be overthrown. I say, quite plainly, that if this kind of thing is to persist, there will not be applications from men of quality and standing for appointments to the staff of the University of Queensland. This is borne out by the violent reaction which this legislation has caused in Queensland. The Senate of the University of Queensland is largely, I may say, a governmentappointed senate, but 1 understand that not only the senate, but also the staff and the student body are virtually unanimous in their opposition to the legislation. More than that, may I say in conclusion that it is quite apparent that the Labour party ic Queensland is itself bitterly divided over thii matter, and that there have been quite violent attacks on the State Labour Government by prominent members of the Lahour movement in Queensland for pursuing this course of action, which can only result in the destruction of the standards of a fine tion of the Minister for Health (Dr. Donald Cameron) in respect of this controversy is understandable because, after all, he belongs to a profession which, not so many years ago, denied the people of Australia any right of appeal. His own profession has, after all, gone as far as to defy to the last ditch the will of the people of Australia, as expressed in the referendum on social services. I think that what the people of Queensland and Liberal members who sit behind this Government ought to turn their",70,Adjournment

202,Mr Bryant (Wills) [11.8],"The posiminds to is the defiance of the Queensland Government by monopoly capitalists. Too many people in Queensland and the Liberal members of this Parliament failed in their duty to stand off these people. It is not so long ago that the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr the provisions of section 51 (xxvi.) of the ConHarold Holt) came into this House and introduced legislation to force workers to stay on work that was in the public interest; but when the capitalist oil monopolies use the power of their resources against the people of Queensland, when they refuse to distribute standard petrol in Queensland at the price fixed by the Queensland Government, apparently that is a different story. It is all very well for the Minister for Health (Dr. Donald Cameron) to try to be subtle, and to come here talking of principles. His Government is falling down on its job when it fails to offer the people justice. companies ence to that matter is out of order. adjournment about the petrol position in Queensland? We have seen the mobilization of the great capitalist combines against the government. We have seen them meet in Sydney to examine what they can do. We see before us a government composed of members, allegedly Liberal in persuasion, who are doing nothing about the matter. The people of Australia are being held to ransom by these combines, from whose decision there is no appeal. They are not in the public eye. No one knows who makes their decisions, and while honourable members opposite stand idly by, it is folly and hypocrisy for them to talk about the actions of any other government. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 11.11 p.m. The following answers to questions were not affect whatever entitlement he has as a person circulated:Citizenship Rights of Aborigines. Mr Bryant asked the Minister representing the Attorney-General, upon notice1. What restrictions are placed on aborigines with regard to cittzenshin p""""^ in each of the States and mainland territories? 2. Will he state whether section 51 (xxxi.) of the Commonweallh Constitution dealing with tht acquisition of properly on just terms could be applied to the claims of aborigines to Commonweallh assistance where reservations are taken over for Commonwealth purposes? 3. Is the exclusion of the aboriginal race from stitution taken to remove them absolutely from Commonwealth responsibility or to place them on the same footing as other Australians? 4. Have any rulings been given by the couns on this matter; if so, what rulings and when were they given? supplied the following answer to the honourable member's questions:No part of the question asked by the honourable member can be answered without going into questions of law. It is not the practice to deal with matters of law in reply to questions. War Service Honies Contracts. On this occasion the petrol Mr Bryant asked the Minister representing the Attorney-General, upon noticeWhat facilities are available to assist a person of limited means to take legal action against War Service Homes Division where the person considers that a breach of contract has occurred? supplied the following answer to the honourable member's question:There is no specific provision in any Commonwealth law for legal aid for a person merely because that person wishes to sue the Director of War Service Homes in respect of a matter arising out of a contract between him and the Director. If a person contemplating litigation is an ex-serviceman or dependant of an ex-serviceman he may obtain advice from the Commonwealth Legal Service Bureau and the bureau will, if he so wishes, present his case to the Director. However, the bureau will not ordinarily, in such a case, conduct litigation as his solicitor. Under the High Court Rules a person suing in the original jurisdiction of the High Court may applv under Order 16, Part III. of the Rules for leave to sue as a poor person if he can otherwise satisfy the requirements of that part. Where the inten-iing litigant elects to sue the Director in the Supreme Court of a State he will be entitled to the legal assistance provided by that State on the same condition as any other litigant in that court. The circumstance that he is suing the Commonwealtb or an instrumentality of the Commonweal h win of a particular class under the State law. Deputation on Housmg.

If so, has he accepted the offer, and when does he propose to meet the representatives of the congress? able member's questions are as follows:1. Yes. 2. I promised the congress to study any new each State separately? material facts on the situation which it can send along to me. Material has now been forwarded of mental illness prior to the patient's arrival in to me, and is being studied Australia? Overseas Financial Reserves. Mr Ward asked the Treasurer, upon notice1. Does the great proportion of Australia's overseas financial reserves consist of sterling holdings? 2. Are the United Kingdom financial reserves held almost exclusively in the form of gold and dollars? 3. If so, and in the event of the devaluation of sterling would Australia's financial reserves decline in value whilst those of the United Kingdom would increase in value? 4. Is it dangerous, from the Australian viewpoint, to hold such a high proportion of our overseas reserves in the form of sterling; and would it be far preferable to have a greater dispersal of our reserves? SirA r t h u r Fadden -The answers to the honourable member's follows:1. Yes. 2. Yes. 3. The sterling value of Australia's reserves held in London would remain unchanged, while the value of Australia's and the United Kingdom's reserves of gold and dollars, expressed in sterling, would increase in value. 4. Our international reserves are held mainly in -terling because the greater part of our trade and other transactions overseas arc financed in -terling as an international currency. During the term of office of the present Government, however, -ubstantial additions have been made to Australia's holdings of gold. When, moreover, gold from Australia's production has been sold for dollars on premium markets the proceeds of such sales have either been added to Australia's dollar holdings or else used for the repayment of dollar debt -as , for example, the repayment to the International Monetary Fund of the 20.000.000 dollars drawn from the fund by the previous Government and the 30,000.000 dollars drawn by the present Government. It may be recalled thai f n m July, 1947, until March, 1951, the full amount of Australian gold production, other than --| i used domestically, was sold to the United Kinclom for sterling. This was done under an :ir'-n""ement between the United Kingdom and Au* -> in Go»ernments of the day in August, 191"" Mental Illness in Immigrants. Mr Ward asked the Ministerf o r I m m i gration, upon notice1. How many people borne outside Australia have been committed to mental hospitals or asylums in each of the last ten years, showing the for each State separately? 2. How many are still inmates of these institutions receiving treatment, showing the figures for 3. In how many cases was there any evidence able member's questions is as follows:The State authorities concerned are primarily responsible for maintaining records of the incidence of mental illness in the Australian community, whether native-born or of migrant origin. The Commonwealth authorities have an interest in the question however, not only from the viewpoint of national health but also, in the case of migrants, from the aspect of the requirements of the Immigration Act. There is, therefore, a working arrangement whereby the Commonwealth Department of Health receives certain statistics from the States relating to admission of migrants to mental hospitals. These returns, however, are not properly comparable since there are significant variations in the method of recording in the various States. For example, some Stales-(a ) do not distinguish between persons ""admitted"" and persons "" committed""; (b) provide figures only for persons admitted within five years of their arrival in Australia; (c) do not take transfers into account, and therefore the figures returned questions are as often include double counting. Because of the lack of uniformity between the States, in the method of recording these statistics, they would not provide a suitable basis for use in answer to the questions posed by the honourable member. My department, however, is at present co-operating with the Commonwealth Department of Health with a view to obtaining a more reliable basis for recording the incidence of mental illness in the migrant population. Late last year Sir Harry Wunderly, the distinguished Australian authority on tuberculosis, visited Europe to survey the procedures and methods used for the medical screening of British and foreign assisted migrants before their departure for Australia. He paid particular attention to the screening to detect tuberculosis and mental disabilities. In his report, which was recently presented to the Commonwealth Immigration Advisory Council, Sir Harry Wunderlv statedThe conclusion to be drawn from this overseas survey is that the selection of prospective migrants by Australian medical officers is satisfactory and, as the result of increased experience, is of an appreciably higher standard than in 1950. The present methods and prnce lures provide an adequate degree of protection against the embarkation for Ausiral a of medically undesirable migrants : from ih -se countries where they are examined r by \iis;rallan medical officers. This medical screening' compares very favourably with that",72,Answers To Questions

208,Mr Townley,"The answer to the honorof the United States, Canada, New Zealand and Sweden, which have the same problems as we have. The more reliable figures available from State sources indicate that migrants compare favourably with the Australian-born population in regard to the incidence of mental illness. In particular, the New bouih Wales Slate authorities on the 30th July, 1954, stated, inter alia, in furnishing information io my departmentThese figures (for admissions) would indicate that the existence of niental diseases amongst immigrants is appreciably lower than iis existence amongst the natural-born population. Pastoral Mr Bryant asked the Ministerf o r P r i mary Industry, upon notice1. Has he noted the recommendations made by a Western Australian Parliamentary Select Commiitee on Native Welfare which suggest the establishment of a pastoral industry? 2. Will he have an investigation carried out into the practicability of the suggestion? honourable member's questions is as follows:I am informed by my department, which has examined the report of the Western Australian Parliamentary Select Committee on Native Welfare, Ihat the suggestion referred to by the honourable member relates to the establishment originally of a small herd of caltle to provide fresh meat for the natives in the Warburton area. The matter is a State responsibility and the Western Australian authorities are well informed on the prospects of running cattle in the area concerned. Primary Production. Mr Ward asked the Minister for Primary Production, upon notice1. How do prices charged to Australian consumers of (a) eggs, (b) butler, (c) cheese, (d) meal and (e) dried fruits compare with those paid by consumers of these Australian commodities on the Uniied Kingdom markei? 2. What is the present consumption of these products per head of population in Australia, and whai was it in the year preceding the commencement of the 1939-45 world war? 3. Have the prices received overseas for these commndities shown a tendency to decline over the past year: if so, to whai extent? 4. Has the volume of exports of these products declined in the past year: if so. what is tbe percent ace reduction in each instance? 5. Is it a fact that slocks of some export commodities are accumulating overseas and that these surpluses are now causing concern to the Australian authorities? 6. If so, what are the details? 7. Has the Commonwealth Government evolved any plan to deal with this problem? 8. If so, when does it propose to announce the details? honourable member's questions are as follows:1.

In the case of buiter the heavy stock position has had a depressing elfect on the market and has been causing concern for some time. A delegation from the Australian Dairy Produce Board will shortly be visiting the United Kingdom to conduct an on-the-spot investigation of the markei and to discuss mailers of common policy with representatives from the olher principal suppliers, namely, New Zealand and Denmark. Wilh regard to meat, lhe Fifteen Year Meal Agreemeni, which was negotiated by the present Government wilh the United Kingdom Government, in 1951, continues as a valuable asset to the export sector of the Australian meat industry. The amount received from the United Kingdom Government by way of deficiency payments on beef sold below the minimum prices fixed under the agreement amounted to £3,250,000 in respect of 1956 sales. Receipt of these moneys made it possible for substantial bounties to be paid to meat exporters during the major part of 1956 and for even higher payments to be programmed for 1957. These payments add considerable strength to the market and are reflected in prices received by producers for their stock. Last season, the shell egg market in the United Kingdom was very unsatisfactory, and on present indications the Australian trade in shell eggs with the United Kingdom seems prejudiced. This is the result of the enormous increase in United Kingdom domestic production of eggs under her price guarantee Scheme. The egg industry is investigating the possibility of marketing increased quantities of egg pulp to the United Kingdom and the Continent. Large-scale trade publicity campaigns are now being conducted in the United Kingdom by the Australian Overseas Trade Publicity Committee, in which the Commonwealth Government participates with the Commonwealth marketing boards. Medical Services for Aborigines. Mr Bryant asked the Ministerf o r Health, upon notice1.

Whai is the estimated cost of the services supplied in those years? 3. Are any special research projects in hand to determine suitable methods of combating diseases to which aborigines are more prone than are whiles? 4.

Special research projects into the treatment of leprosy, hookworm, tuberculosis and trachoma are at present being undertaken. The Department of Heallh has four medical survey teams undertaking inquiry inio the special problems of native heallh, improvement in camp sanitation, and treatment of diseases detected. 4. In recent years no native suffering from pure malnutrition has come under the department's care but cases of secondary malnutrition complicating gastro-intestinal infections and infestations are occasionally detected. Social Services Benefits for Aborigines. Mr Ward asked,the Minister for Social Services, upon noticeUnder what conditions are Australian aborigines deemed eligible for social services, anil for which services are they eligible? able member's question is as follows:The Commonwealth Governmeni has no constitutional power to make laws with respect to aboriginal natives, except those in its own terri-1 tories. Notwithstanding Ihis, the Commonwealth has provided social service benefits for Australian aboriginals who are able to comply with certain conditions. The various benefits and the condi' tions applicable to each are set out hereunder:Child Endowment -Child endowment may be granted to an aboriginal mother in all cases except where she is nomadic or where the children are wholly or mainly maintained by the Commonweallh or a State. Maternity Allowances A maternity allowance may be granted to an aboriginal mother who has been granted exemption from the provisions of the law of the State or Territory in which she resides relating to the control of aboriginal natives.

Unemployment Benefits -An aboriginal native may be paid an unemployment benefit if by reason of his character, standard of intelligence and social development, he is considered a suitable person to receive payment. Compliance with the normal conditions of entitlement is, in itself, to a large extent indicative of the fact that the native is a suitable person to receive an unemployment benefit; e.g., he must be capable of, and willing to undertake, suitable employment. Sickness Benefits -The position is the same as for unemployment benefits. Where an aboriginal native has suffered a loss of wages or olher income by reason of his incapacity and complies with the other conditions of entitlement, he is generally regarded as a suitable person to receive sickness benefit.
