AND NUCLEAR WEAPON from certain members and friends of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union of South Australia praying that, as an expression of Christian principle, further testing of nuclear weapons in Australia be prohibited, and that Australia, as a member of tlie United Nations, use its influence to ban the use of nuclear weapons for war purposes, seek agreement on disarmament and support the elimination of war. Petition received and read. the Minister for Labour and National Service. The committee of inquiry into the stevedoring industry has referred, in its report, to a letter from the Minister to the chairman of the committee in February last, concerning the expedition of portion of the inquiry. Will the Minister make the letter, or a copy of it, available ? try to secure the letter and make its contents known to the right honourable gentleman, and to others who may be interested. to the Leader of the Opposition. In view of the statement of the federal president of the Australian Labour party that ""the time was not far off when Australian Labour party leaders would have to go out and say that tlie Labour party was a socialist party"", does the right .honourable gentleman propose to change the name of the Opposition party to ""Australian Socialist party""? R -[100 ] Leader of the Opposition is not obliged to answer that question, but he may do I do not often have an opportunity such as this to deal with the matter, and I shall try to deal with it in the way Ministers usually answer questions. The name of Labour's political party, unlike that of the party to which the honourable gentleman belongs, does not change every five or ten years. It has always been the "" Australian Labour party "". The objectives of the Australian Labour party are stated in its platform and if I had to sum it up in a phrase-althoug h one should read it allI would say to all Australians, and especially to the honoi'able gentleman who has sought this information, that Labour's policy is clearly one of democratic socialism, or social democracy, which is exactly the same thing. That is substantially the policy of the British Labour party and of the New Zealand Labour party, and it is gradually becoming the policy of all the new democracies of the world.

The envelope contained publicity for Arthur Drysdale's Tasmanian lottery. Is it the policy of the Postal Department to undertake the mass distribution of any kind of literature? Why was this letter accepted with such a meagre address by the department in Sydney?

Can any one use the Postal Department to have letters such as these, bearing neither name nor address, sent to decent, reasonable people who object to the department being used to distribute such literature? take down a few notes of the honourable gentleman's question so that I might give him an answer now, but it is obviously a question which requires an answer in detail. I shall give such an answer at an early date. However, I would mention that the matter had already been brought to my attention by my colleague, the Minister for Territories, who expressed sentiments similar to those voiced by the honourable gentleman. Consequently, I had some inquiries made about it. This system has been designed to aid large business houses which are anxious to distribute a considerable volume of postal matter, such as catalogues and other advertising material. It is a system which not only materially assists business houses, but also assists the Postal Department to handle great volumes of mail. That is the general purpose of the system. I shall obtain in detail the information for which the honourable member has asked and supply it to him. External Affairs inform the House whether there have been any further developments of the situation in Singapore? of the talks held in London a little while ago, Mr David Marshall, before he left London, made a last-minute series of proposals to the British Colonial Secretary, the most important of which were, first, that the right or power of the United Kingdom Government to intervene in matters relating to the domestic security or the internal security of Singapore should be made dependent on a resolution, or the like, House of Commons; secondly, that there should be an Asian Governor General of Singapore; and thirdly, that the affairs of Singapore should be moved from the Colonial Office to the Commonwealth Relations Office. In reply to the proposal that intervention by the United Kingdom in matters affecting the internal security of Singapore should be dependent on a resolution by the House of Commons, the British Colonial Secretary said that that had possibilities and might resolve the major difficulty on which the London conference on Singapore broke down. With regard to the proposals for the appointment of an Asian Governor General and a move from the Colonial Office to the Commonwealth Relations did not appear to be matters that could be pursued with advantage in the present or immediately prospective constitutional situation in Singapore, but they were relevant to a later phase. That is the position at the moment. The Singapore Assembly will meet to-morrow. Unfortunately, I believe, Mr Marshall said that if he did not get a positive and satisfactory reply to the three proposals that he had put forward he would resign. I believe that the principal party in his government, the Labour Front, has endorsed the proposal that he should resign. There has been a suggestion that one of the Ministers in Mr Marshall's government, the present Minister for Labour, should endeavour to form a new government. I presume that those matters will be resolved in the Singapore Assembly to-morrow. One can only hope that some solution will be found of the rather grievous situation in Singapore. of the Minister for Supply been drawn to a report that radio-active rain fell in South Australia last week, and to a further report that the radio-activity was due to the recent atomic tests at Monte Bello? As some people in South Australia collect rain in tanks and other containers for drinking purposes and other domestic purposes, radio-active rain could be a grave danger to them. Will the Minister cause an inquiry to be made of the into this matter, because the reports must have an effect on the minds of those people in South Australia who collect rain water? It appears that the reports emanated from someone in the University of Adelaide, who clearly detected radio-activity in the rain.",11,Speakeb Mr C F So I F He Wishes

I am pretty sure that the rain was not caused by tests that took place at Monte Bello some weeks ago. that the tests had something to do with it. professors are a bit like lawyers and politicians, in that they have a variety of opinions. The fact of the matter is that the Commonwealth scientific safety committee, which consists of very distinguished Australian scientists who were present at the Monte Bello tests, has made a report to the Governmentindeed, I made a public statement about it-that every safeguard was exercised with respect to the tests, that the tests were completed as expected, that there was no danger to life or property arising from the tests at all. I think, indeed, that the prevailing winds were such that it would not be possible for the alleged radio-activity in the rain which fell over South Australia to have been caused by the tests. I referred fell only late last week. made about the matter, and when I have a reply perhaps the honourable gentleman will let me give it in the House. for Supply inform the House of the progress, if any, that is being made on the construction of the atomic research reactor at Lucas Heights, near Sydney? cation contained in the words "" if any "" in the honourable gentleman's question, tn fact, we have made very great progress at Lucas Heights, notwithstanding an unfortunate labour stoppage which is now over and of which I hope we shall hear no more. The contractors and the Australian Atomic Energy Commission have pushed forward very vigorously with the work aud we are able to say that we have made better progress in Australia during the last six months or so than has been made with a comparable project which was commenced about the same time in England. Part of the core of the reactor is already in Sydney, and the rest of it will be there soon; as soon as the buildings are completed the core will be installed, and we shall be then well on the way to having our reactor in position. I propose to make an official visit to the site on the morning of the 11th June, and I say now, for the benefit of honourable members, particularly those living in Sydney, that if any of them wishes to accompany me on that visit and so advises me, I shall be glad to make appropriate arrangements. question to the Postmaster-General. Have employees of the food services division of the Postmaster-General's Department been employed under the conditions of Determination No. 15 of 1944 of the Federated Iron workers Association as varied ? Did Determination No. 15 of 1944 provide for two increments of 5s. a week each for all personnel covered by this award since 1951? Is it a fact that the Public Service Board and the Postmaster-General's Department have decided to apply these two increments of 5s. a week each only from the 16th February, 1956? Is the Minister aware that the secretary of the Public Service Board, in a letter dated the 10th June, 1955, to the general secretary of the Amalgamated Postal Workers Union, stated that employees in the food services division of the Postal Department have had their rates of pay and conditions related to Determination No. 15 of 1944 as varied? In view of this fact, does he think it fair and reasonable that Postal Department employees should receive increases in the form of incremental advances only from the 16th February. 1956, when employees of other Commonwealth departments performing the same duties have received the same increments since 1951 ?

EVATT -And there will be a debate ? EYRE HIGHWAY. M.r. H . V. JOHNSON"" I ask. the Minister for Defence whether it is. a fact that, the Eyre Highway linking Port Augusta, on the'South Australian side with Norseman, in? Western Australia is designated a strategic defence road:. If it is, will the Minister confer with the, Governments of Western Australia and South Australia with a view to making the necessary finance available from defence funds; so that a bitumenized surface can bo constructed and so provide a reliable trafficable road from. State to. State in all. weather conditions? that the part of the Eyre Highway that has been mentioned by the honourable member is regarded as a strategic road under the Commonwealth Aid Roads Act and funds are contributed by the Commonwealth each year to enable the road to be' maintained' to a standard required by tlie Commonwealth. Strategic roads under the Commonwealth Aid Roads Act are' not regarded as defence roads entirely but are in the same category as other main roads to which the Commonwealth contributes from funds raised by the 1 petrol tax and which' are maintained by the States. Although the maim responsibility for tbe maintenance of this road rests with the Governments of Western Australia and South Australia, the Commonwealth each year makes certaincontributions to its maintenance. Ifit is of. any interest to the honourable member I shall give the amounts contributed by the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth has contributed' to South Australia for the section from Penong to the West Australian border the following amounts:Year. Amount. £ 1950-5 L 6,800 105152 .. .. .. 7,000 105253 .. .. 10,000 1953-54 .. 10,000 In respect of the section from.

33,Mr Cleaver,I direct a question,15,Immigrati On Ofyouths
34,Mr Harold Holt,"The Govern-,sponsorship of various organizations, such as church organizations, are not so great as most people would, I think, imagine. At one stage we thought that there would be scope for the immigration into this country of large numbers of children from Europe, for example, after the last war, when there were many orphan children in Europe who would have welcomed the opportunity to settle in another land. However, we found that the communities in which these children had been brought up were themselves anxious to look after them, with the result that the numbers of such children available for emigration to Australia was not very great. Nevertheless, there has been a useful movement to Australia of child immigrants, particularly from the United Kingdom. The honourable gentleman will be well aware, from the activities in his own State which, I think, has done more in this direction than any other State, of how satisfactorily those schemes have worked out. The Department of Immigration has assisted financially and in various other ways in respect of this matter. I should be very glad to discuss with the honourable member for Swan any ideas that he may have on the matter that he thinks we might usefully consider. He will find us very receptive. to the Acting Prime MinisterI desire to know whether it is a fact that a shortage of potatoes now existing on the mainland of Australia, particularly in Sydney and Melbourne, has caused a rise in price which puts this basic foodstuff beyond the reach of a great number of Australian working-class families. Is it a fact that large supplies of Tasmanian potatoes available for shipment are deteriorating in quality because shipping is not being made available by the shipping combine to bring them to the mainland? Is it further a fact that men prominent in potato marketing activities attribute the present unsatisfactory position to the bungling, inefficiency and indifference of the shipping interests? If these are facts, on those provided in the old designs. of what value are the assurances of the shipping combine to the Government to maintain an efficient sea transport system on the Australian coast in return for the Government's action in limiting competition with them of the Commonwealth owned ships ? In view of the position as outlined, will the Government undertake to cancel its decision to hand the Australian community over for exploitation by the rapacious shipping combine? answer to the question raised by the honourable gentleman is "" No "". the Postmaster-General. In view of complaints by the residents of Pascoe Vale South in respect to the "" barn-like"" structure now being erected to contain the new post office for that district, will the Minister explain the advantages of this contemporary type of building-for example, from the point of view of economy, lighting, ventilation and attractive appearance-as against the orthodox type of government construction which has usually been associated with buildings previously erected to accommodate post offices? member for Maribyrnong drew my attention a week or so ago to the fact that certain adverse comments were being voiced regarding the type of construction being erected for the post office at Pascoe Vale South. I therefore made some inquiries and I think I am correct in saying that if the residents will await the completion of the building they will find there is no cause for any complaint or for any such adverse criticism. It is true that in this instance there has been a departure from conventional design. The designing of this building was carried out by the Department of Works, and the main features of the design being used are intended, first, to provide better facilities for the staff of the post office and, secondly, to ensure greater provision for the public, for whom more room will be available. Such things as lighting and ventilation will also be an improvement Another very important factor in the adoption of this design is the cost. It is well known that the Postal Department has a great volume of work ahead",15,Immigrati On Ofyouths

47,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr C. F.,"Jflir.. J. R. FBASEB (Australian Capital Territory) [3.18] -The Government's decision to transfer the Royal Australian Naval College from Flinders, in Victoria, to Jervis Bay, in the Australian Capital Territory, is, in my view, a bad decision, [t is a decision that should not have been made. It is a decision which cannot be justified. It is a decision which, even now, should be revoked, or, at the very least, deferred so that it can be properly investigated. I should like to say at the outset that rfie people of Jervis Bay, and committees which have acted on their behalf from time to time, have always maintained that if it could be proved that it was essential Walters, recommended that the college for the successful working of the Royal Australian Navy that the Naval College should be transferred from Flinders to Jervis Bay, no objection could be made. But nosuch proof has been forthcoming. No valid reasons have been given for the proposal to transfer the college. In fact, the weight of evidence available is completely against the proposal to transfer. Recently, the Prime Minister( Mr very strong recommendation to the then Menzies) honoured an undertaking given -some years ago by receiving a deputation of residents of Jervis Bay, who wished no put their views to the Prime Minister and, through him, to the Cabinet. That deputation put before the Prime Minister, and subsequently before the Cabinet, very substantial reasons why the college should not be transferred from Flinders to Jervis Bay. Those reasons were based on economic and other grounds. The arguments of that deputation have not been answered. All that we have had from the Cabinet, and from the Acting Prime Minister( Sir Arthur Fadden), is a blunt announcement that the college will be transferred. The very valid arguments put forward by that deputation demand, E suggest, an answer, and they should be given an answer. If there are reasons to support the proposal for the transfer, they should be made known. If the arguments put forward by. the people of Jervis Bay in deputation are not valid, they should be rebutted. In plain fact, they have not been so rebutted, nor has any evidence to support the proposal been forthcoming. proposal too, is it not ? Mr J. R, FRASER -It is a very costly proposal indeed, and it was the argument as to cost that caused the transfer of the college from Jervis Bay to Flinders 2'6 years ago. Honourable members will recall that the college was established at Jervis Bay in 1915, and was maintained there until 1930, but, during the whole of that time, as the Naval Board reported, there was continuous criticism of the per capita cost of training cadets at Jervis Bay. In fact, only seven years after the college had been established at Jervis Bay, when economies were being considered, the then Commandant of the College, Captain should be transferred south, either to its former home at Geelong or to Hobart. That recommendation was not adopted, but throughout the 'twenties further economies were considered, and, indeed, at one stage it was suggested that the naval college and the Royal Military College should be combined in one institution. Tn .1929 and 1930 economies were again considered, and the Naval Board made a government that the college should be. transferred from Jervis Bay to Flinders, on the grounds that it could be maintained at Flinders for a fraction of the cost of maintaining it at that time at Jervis Bay, and that at Flinders there would be the added advantage of having all naval training concentrated in the one area. The college at that time at Jervis Bay was costing some £65,000 a year, and I think it was training twelve cadets in each year's class. Tho information that I am giving to the House now has been obtained from the publication, History of the Naval College. On the 22nd April, 1930, the Naval Board recommended that the college should be transferred to Flinders, to concentrate all naval training in one centre at a greatly reduced expenditure. It was then estimated that the college could bo maintained at Flinders for £15,000 a year, which is substantially less than a quarter of what it was then costing at Jervis Bay. The Melbourne Argus of the 8th May of that year reported that, because of intense political pressure, that recommendation was not adopted. However, the Naval Board pressed its point",18,Royal Australia Nnava L College
48,Mr Chambers,"It is a very costlythat the college should he transferred from Jervis Bay to Flinders, and on the 29th May, 1930, the First Naval Member, in a memorandum to the then Minister, pointed out that the isolation of Jervis Bay rendered the most economical administration impossible. The Naval Board urged on the Government that approval should be given for the transfer to Flinders, where the college could function effectively for half the cost necessary will be necessary to justify the arguments to maintain it at Jervis Bay. The college moved in mid-July and opened at Flinders in August of that year. It had been at Jervis Bay for fifteen years, and during the whole of that time it had been subjected to criticism on the arround of cost. It has now been at Flinders for 26 years. It has operated effectively at that, economize. location for over a quarter of a century, and during that time the officers «""ho led our naval forces in World War II . were trained at Flinders. no criticism of it. Mr J. R. FRASER --There has been no criticism of its operation at Flinders. In fact, when, from time to time, senior officers of the Navy, who have happy recollections of their days at Jervis Bay, have sought to have the college transferred, government after government has rejected the proposal on the ground that the cost could not be justified. The Minister for Primary Industry( Mr ment. If the Navy is permitted to transMcMahon) stated, in 1953, when this proposal was successfully combated, that the cost of transferring the college from Flinders to Jervis Bay could not be justified at a time when defence expenditure could not be increased. I suggest that those conditions hold good to-day, and that we should not at this time spend vast sums of money on such a proposal. The cost of transferring the college would be immense. It would involve not merely the cost of the physical transferand the temporary occupation of the buildings in existence at, Jervis Bay, but also that of providing at Jervis Bay college, and for the use of the college, at the Flinders Naval Depot. The expenditure would run into millions of pounds of the taxpayers' money. Of that, there is no doubt at all. Sir PHIL IP McBRIDE -That is not so. Mr J. R. FRASER -Let the Minister for Defence( Sir Philip McBride) give us the answers to these questions-if there be answers. These arguments cannot be rebutted merely by the Minister for Primary Industry, the Minister for Defence, or any Government supporter attempting to deride or belittle them. It put forward by the Navy in favour of the transfer. Expenditure of this kind should not be lightly undertaken. Certainly, it should not be undertaken in the absence of strong justification at a time like this, when the Prime Minister and the Government are asking the people to resort! Mr J. R. ERASER -It is a magnificent place. To transfer the college, and establish at Jervis Bay what already exists at Flinders, would cost millions of pounds. any expenditure. Mr J. R. ERASER -That is so. The buildings that the Navy proposes to occupy at Jervis Bay are 40 years old. They are weatherboard and are built on wooden piles. They will require not merely substantial alteration, but replacefer the college to Jervis Bay, it will, within a matter of months, seek, and obtain, a vote to enable it to construct, permanent buildings there. It will not. for any length of time, occupy the buildings that are already there. They could not possibly be made fit for naval occupation. The transfer would involve the expenditure of vast sums of money, and also the complete destruction of the Jervis Bay resort that has existed for the last 26 years. It would mean that the scores of thousands of Australians who have, over the years, enjoyed the right to have their holidays at the most beautiful what already exists in the tourist resort on the east coast of New South Wales will be deprived of that right. It would mean that every one at Jervis Bay-and some 350 or 400 people are directly affected by this decision-woul d lose their businesses and",19,Royal Australia Nnava L College

Those are the curt terms of the Government's announcement. been confirmed by the Minister's statement, and by a letter from the Acting Prime Minister in similarly blunt terms. If there are arguments in support of the desire of some Navy chiefs to effect this transfer, they should be given. Very strong reasons have been given why it should not be carried out, and when a proposal involves the expenditure of millions of pounds of public money and the destruction of something that has existed for a quarter of a century, I suggest that very sound reasons for doing so should be provided. If the Navy's case can be substantiated, then let it be substantiated. I suggest that an inquiry be held into this matter so that the Navy may bring forward evidence in support of its claim, and so that those who object to the transfer may similarly bring forward evidence to support their claims. The inquiring body should present its report to this Parfully analyse the arguments of the honorliament. If it were possible, I would suggest that the inquiry should be made by the Public Accounts Committee, but admittedly that body acts only after expenditure has been incurred. However, the matter could be referred to it by a joint resolution of both Houses of this Parliament. If that course cannot be followed, I suggest most seriously that the matter be referred to a select committee of the Parliament. Let there be no subterfuge about it. If a transfer is justified, let it take place. If it is not, let that this was needed for the success of the the Government not spend that money. Let the Navy substantiate its case. 'Let those who oppose it put their views before the Parliament. I know, with absolute f-ertainty, that this is a bad move. Mr J. R. FRASER -It is being sponsored by people, now in command, who trained at Jervis Bay in the early years. There is ample evidence that there is no more behind this move than a desire to get back to the lovely sylvan setting at Jervis Bay. The argument that expansion cannot take place at Flinders does not hold water. There is ample evidence -and I hold it-to show that expansion can take place, if not within the existing depot, on areas adjoining it. If the Navy has an argument on that ground let it They have put it forward. Not one of these arguments has been announced by the Minister, or given in the releases from Cabinet following its decision. The matter should go before a body which can assess the merits of the Navy's proposal and the weight of the objections to it. No one could cavil at that. It would be only reasonable and fair. The committee of inquiry could report its conclusions to Parliament. I repeat that, on the evidence available, there is nothing to justify the transfer and the complete destruction of Jervis Bay as it exists to-day. There is nothing to justify forcing all these people to vacate their homes, destroying their jobs and taking away their businesses. The honourable member's time has expired. Primary Industry) [3.33] -If we careable member for the Australian Capital Territory ( Mr J. R. Fraser) we find that in most respects he manages to contradict himself. I shall be glad to point out three instances in which he has contradicted the recommendations that have been made by the residents of Jervis Bay. I think that his arguments can be divided into two sections. The first relates to the desirability of returning the Australian Naval College to Jervis Bay. In that respect, he said that if it could be proved college, the residents of Jervis Bay would offer no objection. I shall leave that particular point to my honourable colleague, the honourable member for Calare( Mr Howse), who is an officer of the Royal Australian Naval Reserve and is anxious to maintain the traditions of that service. Opposition members interjecting, permit me to deal with every aspect of the matter, but if honourable members opposite will wait for a little while they will get all the answers they want.

55,Mr Mcmahon,"Tim e does notshall 'content myself with .answering the -arguments that have been put forward against -the return of the college to Jervis Bay. In other words my colleague, the honourable member for 'Calare, will look at the positive part of it , and I shall answer the arguments that have been put forward by the honourable member for the Australian 'Capital Territory. In the first place, let us look at this question historically. The first part of flie bonorable member's argument was based upon the transfer, many years ago, of the Royal Australian Naval College from Jervis Bay to Flinders. Tliat took place, first, because at the time there were only 24 cadets at the naval college, compared with 117 to-day, and secondly, because of the isolation of Jervis Bay from any naval establishment. Today, however, one of the largest naval establishments in Australia, if not the largest, is situated at Nowra, close handy to Jervis Bay, so isolation is no longer a Factor to be considered. Therefore, the historical reasons no longer apply. Because conditions iav.e changed, the cost of maintenance at Jervis Bay will 'be reduced considerably. The second point mentioned by the honourable gentleman is one which, frankly, I just cannot understand. I cannot .understand why he got up in this Honse and made a statement so divorced from rfiact .and reality. He said that the cost rof ""the transfer would nun into millions of pounds. The simple fact is that there will be .a saving on capital -cost -Ian d it was capital cost to which the honourable gentleman referred. Marines. -aMe member for Melbourne ( Mr nave mentioned them to the 'honourable -Calwell) would go -somewhere with the Marines, so that we would not have to put up with him here. If he will not listen to ine when I state the facts, he should get somebody else to take his placePrimarily, .the Flinders depot is a recruit training depot.

'The ""honourable member for Adelaide .( Mr Chambers) does not know the facts. Therefore, prudence would demand that he hold his tongue. I ask honourable members to keep in mind that figure of £515,000. The initial capital cost of a move to Jervi3 Bay would be £172,000. In addition, over a period of five years,.a sum of the order of £150.^000 would have to be spent on construction, together with £18,600 on small craft and motor transport. So the total cost of .the move, osver -that period, -would be £340,000. I ;am trying to make the position clear. If honourable members'Opposite do not -understand me, at least the facts wiffl be on the record. If tbe college were moved to Jervis Bay, fhe total capital cost would -be £34.0, 600, whereas the total cost of l keeping the college and depot at Minders would be £515,000. Where are -the mythical millions about which the honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory spoke?

The people there have been living under very reasonable .conditions. ihe Government's bad management. bad management. In many cases, there were long leases, and we could not get the people out. They have been put under notice. May I deal, now, with the question of the value of Jervis Bay to tourists ? The honourable gentleman used tbe phrasethis is one of the ways in -which his arguments can be turned against him-'Expansion can take place"". He said that there was plenty of room there for expansion. If the honourable gentleman argues that the Commonwealth should move from its own buildings and from its own territory to another area where expansion can take place, surely we are entitled >to argue, and to argue strenuously, that it is private interests which should go to another area to erect the -accommodation that they need. 'There is plenty of land available. It can be nsed, .and there is no intention on the part .of the Commonwealth to exclude otihers from areas such as those around Hnaskisson.

We have to ask ourselves: Has the Commonwealth given reasonable notice to its tenants that right that the Royal Australian Naval it desires to put the Naval College back College should go back to its home on into its traditional (home'?

With that I was Minister for tie NavyI was proud to hold that officeI told him and the residents .of Jervis Bay repeatedly that, as soon as it was practicable to do so, the Royal Australian Naval College would be returned to its home. Mr J. R. FRASER -What persuaded the Minister to change his mind in 19541 my mind. The paper was prepared by me, and it was never changed. It was always my intention to get the Royal Australian Naval College back there, if it was practicable 4© do so and if that were required. I think that it is in the interests of the Royal Australian Naval College, which has a lot of tradition behind it, that it be returned to its original home, but I shall not touch on that problem further because, as I have said, the honourable member for Calare will deal with it. I want to state positively that the Commonwealth has acted with a proper sense of responsibility. The Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) has discussed the matter with me on at least two occasions and has made it clear that he has no intention to permit hardship to be inflicted on any resident of Jervis Bay. We gave ample notice to residents, and we made our intentions perfectly clear. On one occasion when the honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory raised the matter, the Prime Minister made certain that it would be discussed fully by Cabinet, which reaffirmed the previous decision of one of To sum up: Is it appropriate and",22,Royal Australia Nnava L College

61,Mr Mcmahon,"I did not changeregard to the finance involved, I have cited figures, which prove conclusively that a capital saving will be achieved by moving the college to Jervis Bay rather than by keeping it at Flinders. Finally, on the subject of hardship to residents, the honourable member himself has admitted that the residents are prepared to move if a satisfactory case can be made out, which therefore proves that no great hardship will be caused to the resinot know any of the facts. There has dents. I make these two points clear: The residents have been given ample notice and-thi s is a very important point-if business people suffer any undue hardship or loss of business activity, the for the staff and the naval cadets. Our Commonwealth is willing to consider the question of compensation. So for all those reasons, I say that this move is justified and is in the best interests of the Navy itself. I conclude on this point. The return of the Naval College to Jervis Bay does not mean that all business activity there will cease. All it means is that there will be some reducsaying that that honourable member will tion. In fact, the residents of Nowra favour the basing of the Fleet Air Arm on Nowra. They and the Chamber of Commerce have personally told me that they are glad that the naval air station is located at Nowra at the present time because, amongst other things, of the income being earned from it in the district. Therefore, for all these reasons, recommendation of the Naval BoardI say that the Government's decision should be affirmed, and that the Government is not prepared to permit this problem to go to a select committee. The reasons advanced by the Minister are not a reply, nor are they even an attempted reply, to the case put by the honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory ( Mr J. R. Fraser). The reasons given by the Minister simply prove that the Prime Minister( Mr desired that it be somewhere else, where Menzies) was right when he removed him from the post of Minister for the Navy, and they are good reasons for removing the present occupant from that post. If at this time of difficulty, when the Government is slugging the people of Australia with heavy taxes, when it is doing nothing for the growing army of unemployed, it can find nothing to do except shift the Royal Australian Naval College from Flinders to Jervis Bay, it is presenting a pathetic picture to the Australian people. been misinformed. been misinformed, or that he is uninformed. The honourable gentleman does been a move for years past to bring the Naval College back to Jervis Bay, not the recruiting centre, not the training ground for the rank and file, but the establishment, Cabinet rejected that proposal in 1948-49. The position has not suddenly arisen. This argument about effecting improvements and spending this or that sum of money was advanced in our time. It is no wonder that the Minister is struggling to make a case, leaning on the honourable member for Calare( Mr Howse) and put the position. I think that the honourable member for Calare will put a reasoned case, but even the case to be put by him will not get rid of this fact, that the Jervis Bay establishment was a second creation. The first naval college was at Geelong. Then there was the transfer to Jervis Bay, and then, on the itself, in 1930, 26 years ago, it was shifted to Flinders, and it stayed there right throughout the war period, at the time of our greatest emergency. If there was a valid argument for transferring the college, it surely should have applied then. If the college is to be transferred, why not transfer it to some new site, and build from the ground up? If it is desired that it be along the salubrious coastline of eastern New South Wales, why not pick a spot near Nowra, or at Balmoral, in Sydney Harbour? If it is perhaps there will be some advantage from a strategic point of view, St. Vincent Gulf or Spencer's Gulf, in South Australia, would be suitable, and if there is anything in the argument that Cockburn Sound, in Western Australia, is to be the naval base for the British Commonwealth of Nations",23,Royal Australia Nnava L College

The Government is determined that the Naval College shall be restored to Jervis Bay. It will get a toehold, and then, as the honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory has stated, millions and millions of pounds will be spent on building it up. That would be wasteful expenditure. It will be necessary to recondition old buildings and to rehabilitate a centre, the use of which has been changed. If the Flinders area is not satisfactory, the right thing to do, as I said originally, is to build elsewhere. But there is plenty of room at Flinders. Do any Ministers ever visit the Flinders naval depot? Probably they would not even know where it was. I assure them that there is plenty of land in that area if they want more land, and that Westernport Bay has just as good an anchorage as has Jervis Bay. Mr Buchanan interjecting, ber for Macmillan ( Mr Buchanan) represents part of that area. there for too long. for 26 years.

That is exactly the kind of weather in presenting their case. Indeed, land on which the depot is established. they have not a leg to stand on.' It is natural to expect the honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory to why the college could not be at Orange. oppose the transfer. He is acting as a perfectly good member, and is representgood idea, too. In view of what, he has ing, the residents of the Territory. He said to-day,. I think it is fair to say that is doing his best, but is presenting his the honourable member for the Australian case under very difficult circumstances. Capital Territory obviously hap not been We have her rd from the honourable memthrough the college at the Flinders naval ber for Melbourne this nonsense about the depot recently. If he were to visit the anchorage at Westernport being just asgood as the anchorage at Jervis Bay. An anchorage in the Yarra River would probably be better than either! What ships can be used at Flinders? It has been proven time and time again that the Flinders naval base is most unsuitable. Successive governments have spent money on it without being able to make a proper base of it. After listening to the honourable member for Melbourne, one would think that the only seaside place to which the residents of Canberra can go is Jervis Bay. He asked, "" What are you going to do with the poor holidaymakers ? Where are they to go ?"" There are many other places along the coast of New South Wales to which they can go. What are the real needs of a naval college? First, it must be properly equipped in order to train men. Secondly -and the Opposition may scoff at the suggestion-it must be able to maintain the naval tradition. The Minister for was Minister for the Navy for some years, has been able to advance some very strong arguments in favour of the transfer. My criticism is that the Government did not make up its mind years ago to transfer the college. I believe that there was a strong case for moving the college back to Jervis Bay years ago, yet this Government postponed a decision on the matter. Capital Territory has put forward the specious argument that tbe college has been at the Flinders naval depot since 1930, that it trained officers who acquitted themselves well during the war, and that therefore it should remain at its present Mr J.

74,Mr Howse,"That might be quite acollege, he would see quite clearly how unsuitable it is. Admittedly, the Parliament cannot lightly set asido the financial aspect of this matter; indeed, it must expend the defence vote with great care and caution. The Minister for Primary Industry has quoted figures to show what it would cost to rebuild the college at its present site. It has been argued that there is plenty of land at the Flinders naval depot. Of course there is, but to rebuild the Naval College there would cost approximately ten times as much as it will cost to transfer it from Flinders to Jervis Bay. 1 point out that the Royal Military College at Duntroon was also closed during the depression years; but does the honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory suggest that training should not have been restored there? Mr J. R. FBASEB,I agree that it should have been restored. The college plays its part in the community. portant part, and has other great assets too. I think the same argument can bo applied with equal force to the restoration of the Naval College nt Jervis Bay, where the best training facilities and conditions are to be found. Mr J. R. FBASEB -And where there will be no community. at Nowra, Huskisson, and, I think, at other places. Another community will grow up around the naval base. What advantages are to be gained from the transfer? The Flinders naval depot is required for recruit training. It is a training centre. If it is to be cluttered up by the presence of a naval college, its effectiveness will be reduced. If the Naval College were to be retained in that area, it would be necessary to spend a great deal of money in completely restoring or rebuilding it. It has reached such a stage of decay and disgrace that it cannot be used any longer. Mr J. R. FBASEB -It will be necessary completely to rebuild at Jervis Bay. traditional home of the Naval College. Let us not forget that it was built with public subscriptions and Commonwealth funds. The honourable member's time has expired. Public subscriptions were generously made so that the college could be established there. It has a magnificent anchorage, and the fleet is able to exercise on its large waters. It has the further advantage of being adjacent to the fleet air arm base at Nowra. Those two advantages are not available at the Flinders naval depot. No fleet exercises are held near the Flinders naval depot. If the fleet enters Westernport Bay it can only remain for a few hours, because as soon as the tide starts to ebb, it must race out. to avoid becoming grounded on the mud banks. Mr J. R. FBASEB -Ho w often do the cadets go on cruises? more often and for longer periods. When they move to Jervis Bay, they will be in close contact with the ships. Jervis Bay is an ideal place for training cadets. As the Minister for Primary Industry pointed out, the residents and the Chamber of Commerce at Nowra will welcome the transfer of the college to Jervis Bay. So, there will be a community adjacent to the college, just as there is a community adjacent to the Duntroon Military College. This matter of urgency completely falls to the ground for a number of reasons, which I shall state briefly. It has been shown with transparent clarity, that a considerable amount of money would be saved by moving the Naval College back to its traditional home. Any one who has considered this problem seriously has no doubt at all that Flinders Naval Depot is not a suitable place for training. We have been saddled with it, but there is no reason why we should remain there any longer than necessary. The present area can continue to be used to the best advantage, and this is a wonderful opportunity that should have been seized years ago to move the Navnl College. Do not let us forset that the Navy is our first line of defence and that we must have an efficient navy, beeau°p. by having it at a high standard of efficiency we will have a safe Australia.

82,Mackinnon. E. D. Mr Clabey (Bendigo) [4.13],"]bridge their differences. With that object in view it is essential that the provision relating to this matter shall be simple and clear, and shall make it mandatory on the commissioner to take action in a definite direction. The Opposition is of the opinion that the replacement provision which we propose is superior in every way to the present provision, and is more likely to make conciliation work effectively. It will certainly ensure that the principal objective of exploring conciliation before resort is had to arbitration shall be attained. I suggest that the Minister might well accept the amendment that we propose. It is simple, it is clear and it will bring about the result which, I believe, the bill is designed to achieve-that is, the maximum utilization of conciliation before arbitration is resorted to. ter for Labour and National Service and Minister for Immigration) [4.17],-The amendment moved by the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Clarey) on behalf of the Opposition really raises no new point that has not already arisen from the debate during the second-reading stage and at the present stage. He and other members of the Opposition have pressed the Government to make the conciliation process mandatory, in a number of places where the possibility occurs in the form of the bill. Now, we have made it quite clear, both at the second-reading stage of the debate and in the present discussion in committee, that we favour a wider extension of the conciliation process. I have pointed out that although we are setting up conciliators whose function it will be to exercise the process of conciliation, we have not excluded that process on the part of either the presidential members or the lay members of the commission. In other words, conciliation is a process which can be usefully employed where opportunity offers and in the judgment of the person concerned, not only at the first stage where conciliation may be attempted by the conciliator himself, but also at the various other stages of the arbitral process. There is not, I think, a great deal of difference between the Opposition and ourselves as to the objective we seek to attain. Members of the Opposition believe, as we believe, that if parties to an industrial dispute can be brought together, if they can reach conclusions by way of an amicable agreement and these conclusions are such as to make them capable of being extended in the public interest, then that is all to the good. But there will be many occasions on which, with the best will in the world, the process of conciliation will not produce the desired result. Indeed, there may be occasions on which an attempt to impose the process of conciliation compulsorily on one or other of the parties may defeat the possibility of reaching a reasonable and satisfactory settlement of the matter in dispute. That, at least, is the judgment of the Government, and, I believe, of all who have had practical experience in the working of this jurisdiction. So we say that to impose in this rigid way an obligation on the parties to conciliate may, because of the compulsion aspect, defeat its own object, or may at least make that object more difficult to achieve. The Government has no need to go on repeating its own conviction of the desirability of a wider use, in this jurisdiction, of the conciliation process. We have not merely made provision for it in this amending bill; in one or two places we have pointed up the references in the section so as to throw the emphasis even more clearly in that direction. For those reasons, we believe the Opposition's amendment is , undesirable. It is not more likely to get results that we all want to achieve than is the Government's provision already in the bill. The amendment, therefore, is unacceptable. [4.21] I think the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Harold Holt) misunderstands the point regarding conciliation as it will apply under the bill as it stands. Let us look first at the functions of conciliators. It is the Government's intention, if I understand things clearly, to provide conciliators for a certain purpose. That purpose is to try to get parties to an industrial dispute together so that they may resolve their difficulties and come to an amicable settlement and then, at that point, agree to",28,Conciliation An D Arbitratio Nbill 1956
83,Mr Harold Holt (Higgins,Minis,29,Conciliation An D Arbitratio Nbill 1956
84,Mr E. James Harrison (Blaxland),"ilie form of a report to go back to the commissioner to whom the dispute was originally delegated. I think I am clear in my understanding of .the Government's view on that matter. So, if we believe that that is a worthwhile function we must look at the way the Government proposes to niake arrangements for the conciliator to take up his function-and I think that this is the point the Minister is missing. In tire first instance, the conciliator knows lie is going into a matter bound only to report on those things that the parties agree be shall report on. Above him is a commissioner wlio delegates authority to him, I think the Minister completely loses sight of what this bill really provides to cover .this point of the operation of conciliation because fhe bill providesThe commissioner may, if in his opinion it whom he must report back had formed an may assist the parties to an industrial disputeNow let us look at that. First of all, the measure imposes on the conciliation commissioner the responsibility of having an opinion in respect of a dispute. The commissioner has to be of the opinion that :i conciliator may be able to help. How does he reach tliat opinion? Nobody can tell me, after all the years I'have appeared before conciliation commissioners and Arbitration Court judges, that these .gentlemen will form an opinion without first examining the dispute to some degree. If, in point of fact, the responsibility is imposed on a commissioner of forming an opinion about an industrial dispute before he refers it to a conciliator, the first step which is really necessary to achieve couoilration between tbe parties is thereby destroyed*, because tbe commissioner will be saddled with the responsibility of arriving at an opinion in respect of the dispute. 1 want to put it to the Minister that no arbitral .authority that is worthwhile will form an opinion on .a matter such as an industrial dispute without first examining, ro some extent, the gravamen of the dispute. The Minister says that before .a conciliation commissioner, be he ,a presidential member of the commission or a lay member, can refer a dispute, he must have some opinion in relation to it, because tliere may be some way round it if he puts a conciliator on to the job of solving it. What does ""that call for;? It requires, first, a determination whether the dispute is one that, in the opinion of the conciliation commissioner, should be settled by arbitration. If a commissioner is forced t© arrive at such a conclusion, the first ground necessary for conciliation will be completely destroyed. It would not have been so bad if the Minister had left the provision wide enough for a matter to be referred without the commissioner having to gather to himself sufficient information to form an opinion that something might be done by conciliation. Rut, as I have already said, if there is imposed upon the commissioner the responsibility of forming an opinion in relation to a dispute before lie refers it, the first step to conciliation will be destroyed. What would .happen then? A conciliator would approach a dispute in the knowledge that the authority to opinion about the matter. member's argument is quite unrealistic. Things will not work out that way in practice, as me knows. know that, whether or not we like it, they will work out that way in practice as between an authority that has power and one that has not. commissioner system operated before 1947. I i a judge had brought to his notice the likelihood, or the 'existence, of a dispute he would arrange for a conciliation commission to ge to the .spot : and do what could be done. That has happened time and again. with a difference. Under the act as it stood between 1926 and 1934, a conciliation commissioner had delegated to him all the powers of a single judge. Section7 of tike act of l$S6-34 gave conciliation -commissioners the powers >of a judge -under section 1$ and 'section 16A. The commissioners had power also, as prescribed, *o hear and determine disputes, ito make an lorder or award, .and even to fix maximum penalties. That 'has been my point fiver since this measure came before ithe Parliament.

Let as consider >the functions prescribed in the 1926-34 act, which remained until 1947. I am testing my memory now, but I think it was in 1941 that tbe first conciliation commissioner, Mr Mooney, was appointed, and Conciliation ""Commissioner Rowlands was appointed in Adelaide. The late Chief -fudge Drake-Brockman, in addition, had power to appoint, and, in point of fact, did appoint, boards of reference to hear and report, but, in no instance, nnder the provisions of the principal act between 1926 and 1947, was he required to form an opinion in relation to a dispute before he referred it . I put it to the Minister quite strongly that, when he refers to the 1934 consolidated act and the powers of conciliation commissioners, he comes 'back to the argument that I have used against this bill. I support my friend the honourable member for Bendigo. If these conciliators are to work in a compartment designed by the Government, they should go into it as free agents, not under the authority of some one who will judge fhe dispute and who has already formed an opinion in relation to it. The Minister does not base bis argument on sound premises when he talks about the provisions in relation to conciliators in the principal act as it stood before 1947, because we have never before had conciliators whose only power -was to hear the parties and, to tbe extent that they agreed, Teport back to an authority -which, had delegated the hearing of the dispute ( to ""the conciliator.

Unless otherwise ordered, and subject to any direction of the Commission, the memorandum, if certified by the Commission, shall, as between the parties to the agreement or any successor to, or any assignee or transmi ttee of, the business of a party bound by the agreement, including any corporation which hae acquired or taken over the business of such a party, have the same effect as, and be deemed to be, an award for all purposes of this act. The Opposition proposes that the commencing words ""Unless otherwise ordered and subject to any direction of the Commission"" should be deleted. Those words would enable the commission, under the provisions of this proposed section, to refuse to certify a memoranis wrong. One of the purposes of the bill is to enable parties who are in dispute to to them and which represents a complete settlement of their dispute.

91,Mr Clarey (Bendigo) [4.38],"I tion concerned.-organizations of employers or employees have quoted an agreement as a reason why, in their particular industry, a conciliator, a conciliation commissioner, or a judge, should give them certain conditions, the court, right along the line throughout the whole of its history, has refused to accept as evidence or as a reason why it should grant a certain condition or a certain rate of pay the fact that it is contained in an agreement between two parties. So, whatever the terms may be, they are a matter between the parties themselves and have no effect on industrial decisions made by a court, anywhere else. The agreement is satisfactory to the parties and for that reason it is essential that it should be given the force of law. The only reason that I have heard as to why the power contained in this proposed section should be exercised is that it is felt that employers and employees may gang up against the community as a whole. Whilst that statement has been made on many occasions, so far no convincing evidence has ever been given to me or to the committee that such is the case. The Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Harold Holt), in hi3 second-reading speech, did mention an agreement between the building industry and the building industry unions. Tbat agreement was designed to bring about continuity of operations in the building industry. Both sides were prepared to accept it and put it into operation, and the mere fact that the agreement was not certified resulted in industrial trouble in that industry. That is bound to happen when a situation arises in which 95 per cent, of employers agree upon certain terms and conditions of employment, and the other 5 per cent, will not agree to them. If those terms and conditions are made law, they are binding upon all employers. If they are not made law, it means that those employers who do not agree to them, and who are on the fringe, or rim of the industry, are constantly in conflict, with the trade unions and with their fellow employers, and instead of having peace in industry we will have unrest, strife and strikes that hold up industry. From whatever angle one looks at this question, there is no sound and just reason why agreements that are made should not be certified, and why the parties who have reached agreement should not be given the security and protection of a legal document. It is for those reasons that I have moved this amendment. ter for Labour and National Service and Minister for Immigration) [4.47] -The amendment moved by the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Clarey) raises a very important question of industrial policy. In case there is any contrary impression in the minds of persons who have been listening to the honourable member, I hasten to say that there is nothing novel about the provision in question. Although the honourable member may not have intended to convey this impression, his arguments were put forward in such a manner as to suggest that this was a new provision that we were inserting in the legislation. It is true that the provision has been inserted in this bill which we have brought before the Parliament, but it is a provision of very long standing. In fact, my researches indicate that it was first introduced into the arbitration legislation in about 1928, and that it has remained unchanged in substance ever since. Indeed, even when honourable members opposite had the responsibility of government, they did not overlook what I believe to be a very important requirement of the arbitration system, that is, that it should take into account the public interest. That requirement has become traditional in Australia, and it is accepted that in the great issues that arise between representatives of management and the organizations that speak for working men and women, there should be an authority able to take into account the public interest. I think that principle has commended itself to the Australian people as a whole. This requirement is particularly necessary, I believe, in an economy that is not so highly competitive or so highly developed as are the economies of more densely populated and more closely settled countries of longer industrial experience than ours. It may well be that in the United States of America, for example,",32,Pairs
92,Mr Harold Holt (Higgins,"Miniswhere there is a very highly developed competitivesystem, there isless need for am authority to step in and, in effect, determine what should be the public interest in relation to a particular dispute or a; particular agreement that may have been reached. But in Australia we have not the same safeguards,, or if they ;ire present they certainly do not apply to the same extent. So, this Parliament has accepted, as I believe the community has accepted over the years, a situation in which our arbitration tribunals are charged with the duty of protecting the public interest on these issues as fhey arise. That does not mean that, because an agreement provides something more than is provided as an award minimum, tbe tribunal will necessarily discard that agreement ""as being contrary to the public interest. It may well be that the parties to the agreement can show that, taking into consideration all the relevant factors, it is fo the public benefit that the provisions of their agreement should apply. T.n the particular instance that the honourable member for Bendigo has mentioned, which concerned an agreement between building trades employers and employees, the appropriate judge or commissioner may well have taken into account all the pros and cons that could be argued in connection with the agreement, and have considered them in relation to the public interest. It may be chat, although what is presented to a fommissioner is in the form of an agreement, he has some background knowledge Which suggests to him. that it has been arrived at by some process of industrial coercion. He may consider that the pattern thus established, if adopted generally throughout the industry, would have serious repercussions upon the economy as a whole. A wide variety of circumstances will be weighed by the commissioner When he decides whether or not an agreement should be adopted. This provision has stood the test of lime, and it is rather astonishing that honourable members opposite now attack it, as a matter of great policy and concern in their eyes, because when they were in a position of power in this place and able to legislate to eliminate this provision from the act they did not choose to do so. I believe that their judgment was sounder then than it is on this occasion when they present to us this amendment. ""We believe that we must maintain the element of public interest. The High Court of Australia has indicated that that is a proper matter for arbitrators to bring into their calculations when making deteiminations. I believe that the good sense of the Australian people would lead them to agree that such a provision as this should be continued. Ml-. CAIRNS (Yarra) [4.52] -It is undoubtedly the policy of the Labour movement to have agreements that are freely entered into by the parties made completely effective. A pretty clear argument in favour of that policy is that if the parties know that their agreement will be effective,, their attitude towards the discussions which result in an agreement, and towards the eventual agreement, will be vastly different from what it will be if they think that the agreement may not have binding effect. It seems to me that when Government supporters have appealed for the acceptance of greater responsibility by workers in industry, they have failed to realize that one of the ways in which that result can be obtained is to make the participation of workers in the determination of agreements more substantial. I believe that one of the most necessary reforms of our arbitration system is a requirement that the workers should have greater opportunities to participate directly in the determination of the conditions that will bind them, and that will influence not only their living standards but also their working standards. There is a retrograde tendency in Australia's arbitration system to centralize authority, to strengthen the powers of authority, and to give to centralized officials, whether they be of the court, the employers or the trade unions, increasing power to determine workers' conditions. The Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Harold Holt) has said that this provision has been included in the arbitration legislation for many years. T do not care how long it has been there. I think there is a very strong argument that agreemen<ts, once made, should .be -made effective, because if the workers canpublic interest aiot to increase margins in not rightly and properly feel that they 'have a substantial say in determining their conditions, we will not achieve the conditions in industry -that are necessary for the greatest productivity. If this kind of agreement is effective we can see ahead to a time when the workers will participate in the determination not only of agreements, but of profits and prices as as well. From my own point of view, and I think from that of the Labour movement also, this would be very desirable, but I am sure that it would not be desirable from the point of view of the Government or those who support it. If the Opposition's proposal to allow these agreements to have full effect is approved we can look forward to increasing participation by the workers in the determination of conditions in industry. Against this great gain-thi s great advantage-the Minister poses the public interest. He says that it is necessary that these agreements be subject to the test of public interest. What is public interest? I think the Minister recognizes that it is a complex thing. I remind the committee that -public interest is determined on .the ground of an assumed-ver y often, an unassumed-theor y which is, usually, an -economic theory. As I pointed out the other night, 25 years ago the court, in determining the public interest used, and fhe government of the day accepted, a thoroughly outmoded economic theory. The court held that when tbe incomes of a great many members of the community ""fell, the incomes of all other members of the community must also fall; that when unemployment had been increasing, the public interest demanded that it should increase still further. Those who then determined what was in the public interest were so muddle-headed, or biased, in .economic ways that they accepted that kind of test. Let us now look at the situation in more recent years, when such agreements as that reached in the metal -trades in 1952 or 1953 were subjected to the test of public interest. The conciliation commissioners and the court said, "" We are suffering to-day from inflation, and inflation consists of too much spending. If too much spending occurs because incomes .are too high, it is in the the applications before ns "". The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN. Order!

103,Mr E. James Harrison (Blaxland),"building industry other than the increase given as a result of the metal trades case. It is probably correct to say that no more overtime has been worked in the building industry during the last three years than was worked in the previous three years. But the wages of building workers have risen. Day by day and week by week, employers in the industry are entering into agreements with their employees to pay £1, £l 10s. and £2 over the award rates. That is so in other industries. But what happens then? We get a decision such as that given recently, when the authority responsible for the basic wage stated that it could not restore the purchasing power of the basic wage to the previous level because the economy had been worn threadbare, mainly as a result of the wages that were being paid and the co3t level that prevailed in the community. If there could be registered with the court to-morrow, without any regard for the public interest, all the agreements that have been arrived at between throughout Australia, we should have a complete picture of what is happening to industrial wage levels. But, at the moment, our hands are tied. The Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr view. We believe that, in order to comHarold Holt) said that an agreement entered into between an employer and an employee, if registered with the court, might be contrary to the national interest, because once the conditions specified in it became standard conditions as a result of registration by the court, the benefits would flow in all directions. However, under present arrangements, although employers are not entering into, so to speak, official agreements with their employees, they are, for their own purposes, entering into agreements that are not signed. Let us take the matter to the next tralia who are prepared now to engage stage. Is any member of the committee in incentive payment schemes, but we opposed to incentive payments as a know also that on the very first day when means of increasing production? I think there were two men looking for one job. the Minister knows that every day incenwhat was previously the incentive rate tive payment arrangements are being negoof production would become the norm. tiated which, in many respects, depart We know that, under such conditions, the from the hours and wages prescribed in good employer would go to the wall. He the awards, and that not one of those would become the Aunt Sally, so to speak, arrangements is written into an agreeof bad employers and proprietors of ment. Employers are engaging hunbackyard sweat-shops. dredsI say that advisedly-of time and motion study engineers whose only job is to study production times. But the Government refuses to face reality. This nation is developing fast, but the Government says that what was good enough for the horse and buggy days is good enough for 1956. It is not good enough for the Labour party or for the trade unionists of this country. We on this side of the chamber believe in full employment, and the Government says that it, too, believes in full employment. We know that a great deal of racketeering is going on among employers who, in a period of full employment, are gambling to obtain the labour they need to make higher profits. I was surprised to hear the Minister say that the competitive conditions in America might well be the reason for the non-existence of this type of control in that country. We have got to start to compete with the Americans. The only way in which we can do so is to produce on the same lines employers and employees as they do and, if possible, at a lower cost. There is only one way in which we can do that. The Government believes that what was done in the horse and buggy days is good enough now, but we do not share that pete with other nations, we must recognize agreements between Australian employers and employees of the type that are entered into between employers and employees overseas. Eveni f such an agreement, although originally affecting only one industry, would ultimately affect other industries, if registered, it should be registered with the court so that the workers on the job and managements will know where they are going. Let us be honest about this matter. We want that to be done because we know there are thousands of employees in Ausstory. We heard that 50 years ago. course we heard it 50 years ago. happened. members of the committee know what is' happening in industry to-day. Already, an organization, of time and motion study engineers haa been established with a membership of over 200. It is doing nothing, bnt write incentive payments agreements, not one of which is registered.. I finish on the note on which I started. On. this matter,, I should liketo' have the opinion of those who will administer the industrial laws of Australia. They know that, unless they are freed from thas obligation, they will be unable to bring into the field of production, thosereal contracts betweenemployer and employee which will give to the; employee an assurance that he will get something for his increased efficiency. But the authority established by this legislation' will not register any agreement contrary to, let us say, the principles embodied: in standard hours decisions. We say that what was good, enough in 1936 is not good enough in 1956. We believe that the face of our industrial production is changing. We believe that it must change to enable us to compete, with the secondary industries of other countries. Eor those reasons,, we press strongly the amendment that we haveproposed. ter forLabour and National Service and Minister for Immigration)[5.15] -The honourable member forBlaxland' ( Mr were themselves opposing what another E. James Harrison), who has just stated his viewson this particular clause-, was remarkable for one piece of inconsistency when, he advocated that we emulate American methods, at the same time as he attacked the practice of making incentive payments. a ttack it. member said that the first day that two persons werelooking for the same job the employerwould make the incentive rate of output the norm. As^ a matter of is the old, old fact, it is consmon knowledge that there has been, some degree of unemployment, perhaps not a high degree,, virtuafly throughout the whole history of the Dnited States' economy, but incentive schemes operate there, and operate very extensively. However, I do not propose to. be led. off. into> a discussion,, however interesting and useful' it might be at this point of time, on. the. merits of incentive paymentschemes-, in the Australian economy. I do,, however, desire to bring the discussion on the public interest back to two particular points. I should like, since mention has been made of an agreement made by master builders, to give the committee a little more detail, on that matter, because it demonstrates how the situation in Australia, in which we have a federal system of arbitration-, a State system of arbitration,, and a long-standing practice among industrial tribunals of protecting the public interest, differs so remarkably from that in certain other countries. I believe that the facts, if. they can be presented fully, in relation to thfrecent agreement made by master builders, shows how necessary some, such safeguard is. In tliat case, the commissioner was not prepared to certify to an agreement between the building trades unions and metropolitan' members of theMaster Builders Association of Victoria, at a timewhen the Buildersand Allied Trades Association,, and theMaster Builders Associations of Geelong, Bendigo> and Ballarat, and others were opposed to it. So> it was not just an. agreement between) the employers and theunions. Therewere very considerable sections of employers in the same field of industry who< group of. employers proposed to do-. An. interesting feature is that the Industrial Appeals Court upheld the appeal against the State Wages Board's determination in respect of builders'' labourers. Thus', in respect of a most important area of industrial activity-the building trades, not which affect the prices of homes of trade unionists and wage-earners generally-the federal tribunal' and the State tribunal were in line.

Australian practice should be viewed only against the background of our traditional: industrial system, of which we have had long experience. As I said when I spoke earlier on this matter, the requirement that industrial tribunals! should take heed of the public interest is of very long standing, and has become firmly established in the industrial arbitration system o£ this country. contribution which has been made by the Minister for Immigration. ( Mr Harold Holt) is an exceedingly interesting one, but one feel's that it has not helped us, on this side of the House at any rate, in respect of the question which is now length to the agreement made by roaster builders, and he has also suggested thar if the Opposition's proposals are put into effect relations' between the Commonwealth and the States on industrial matters will be adversely affected. The whole history of such relations between the Commomvealth and the States is a record of thetransfer from State juris1 diction tofederal jurisdiction of quitp a large number of industries which originally operated' under awards of wages boards and State courts. The determinationof wages and working conditions in those industries was transferred from State to Federal; control By the choice of the parties. That tendency has1 been evident right throughout the history of the Arbitration Court, and to the extent that our industry andpopulation grow so that tendency will become 1 stronger. I cannot see why, if a body of master Builders in Melbourne' meets employees in conference, comes, to an. agreement and says, ""We want the agreement registered."",, that should in any way upset the relations between the Commonwealth, and the States, particularly when one bears, in mind the fact that onmore than one occasion, the Arbitration. Court has made extensive awards covering the building, industry. I call, to the Minister's mind the award which, was made by the late Chief Judge DrakeThe Brockman during the war period in regard to the. building industry,, when, he' prescribed, considerably improved conditions, much better than those awarded by State courts for persons doing construction work.. The fact that building 1 employers in Ballarat, Geelong and else^ where disapproved of the agreement is nothing new.. There was an agreement between a section of master builders in.

They were doing work of a special character, and because they desired continuity of employment and good industrial relations, they made an agreement. That agreement should have been certified and registered, because it was made between parties who hoped to obtain by it better industrial relations and continuity of employment in Melbourne. The court did not register it and, instead of continuity of employment being achieved, the master builders who were not prepared to put the new rates into operation unless the court certified the agreement, found themselves confronted with all sorts of difficulties. It must be borne in mind that we are living in a rapidly changing era. The Minister has suggested that, because this provision has been part of the arbitration law for many years, it should be retained. [ speak now as one who has had considerable experience in industrial matters, believe that by the adjustment of wages and I can say to the committee sincerely and conscientiously that the pressure from the trade union movement for the court to certify agreements is stronger to-day than I have ever known it to be in the past. It is stronger because in the trade union movement there is a desire to have differences with employers settled by means of conferences-by collective bargaining. If we are to try collective bargaining as a means of overcoming our difficulties, then the machinery must be provided to enable the parties to have their decisions registered and become law. To say that, because we did not worry about it in 1924, we should not worry about it to-day is an indication that we are not keeping pace with the changing thought of the community, which must occur as the economy becomes more complex and expands in every direction. able member take the same view if unemagreement was opposed to the practice of ployment developed and State governthe court it was not in the public interest ments continued to operate the quarterly and would not be registered ? adjustment process, and if by private agreement-no t certified as being in the public interest, but simply a private agreement between employers and em44-hour week? ployees-it was agreed that those adjustments should be abolished and the mined that a 40-hour week shall be reduced wage accepted? ting up a hypothetical case. forward a case that operates the other way. past agreements have been made. As a matter of fact, the adjustment of wages started by agreement between the employers and employees in 1918 and 1919 before the court itself put into operation such a scheme. I know that at the end of 1918 I negotiated with the wool brokers a half-yearly adjustment of wages in accordance with the statistician's figures. The trade union movement-and I point out that agreements are made between unions and employers, because the employers are ' not prepared to negotiate with individuals-woul d never agree to the abolition of the adjustment of wages. The unions may be forced to accept it following a decision by the court, but they we get a static standard of living, as far as it can be made static, when prices are changing either upwards or downwards. I do not wish to cover the ground that is being covered by the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Cairns) and I hope that at a later stage he will continue to advance to the committee his views on these matters. But I ask the Minister for Labour and National Service how the Arbitration Court determines whai is in the public interest. So far as the builders' agreement is concerned, we know that, because the wages agreed to were higher, the agreement was deemed not to be in the public interest. If a trade union official were able to meet a group of employers in conference and they agreed upon the adoption of the 38-hour week instead of a 40-hour week, would the court, although the employer and the employees know the condition thing apply if they agreed to adopt a worked.

135,Mr Freeth,"The court is ana body of people who are completely irresponsible, or who could be completely irresponsible, insisting on having registered an agreement that they know is not in the national interest, but in the interest processes contained in this bill. of only a particular section of the society. I do not agree with the suggestion of honourable members opposite that the public interest should not be regarded when agreements are brought before the court. agree most 'heartily with the comments of the honourable member for Forrest( Mr the paper, certain people who support Freeth) in which he put forward the proposition that the judges should determine just what is the public interest. The whole history of arbitration since it was inaugurated in this country some 50 year3 aAO has demonstrated beyond any reasonable doubt that the learned judges themselves differ very violently on what constitutes public interest. Incontrovertible facts show that the judges themselves have entirely different conceptions of what the phrase "" public interest"" means. Therefore, the Labour party does not accept the proposition that they are 'he alpha and omega on what constitutes public interest. All over the world to-day, there is a trend towards round-table conferences. In passing, I point out that this bill prothe parties are being condoned. I know vides for the appointment of conciliators. Is this Parliament to say, on the one hand, "" We stand for conciliation so far as it is possible "", and then, on the other and employers got together and the emnand, say, "" We will utilize other machinery contained in the bill to stop an agreement which might have been arrived at unanimously between conflicting parties""? After all, are we to be humbugged ? Tf we believe in conciliation and in the partners in industry getting round the conference table and thrashing out their problems, the Opposition's amendment should be accepted. I cannot imagine hard-headed businessmen giving anything away if they think the industry cannot afford it. If they did, they would not be hard-headed business men. They should have the opportunity to come to an agreement with the workers on an amount that the section of industry they represent can afford. They have first hand knowledge of what the industry can afford. I say in all seriousness that it the committee disagrees with the proposition of the Labour party, a blow will definitely be dealt at the conciliation If we wish to advance tbe national interest, we should adopt the proposition of the Opposition. The agreement between the authorities who built the refinery at Altona and the workers engaged in that project shows beyond any doubt that it was in the public interest to agree to that proposition. I recall that when the wage rates were announced in honourable members opposite said to me, "" The rates are too high; industry cannot afford them"". Yet, as a result of the adoption of those rates, that project was finished three months before tbe scheduled time, proving conclusively that it is in the national interest to get the men in the frame of mind where they are prepared to give their best. Their minds were not agitated by feelings of injustice and it was in the national interest to increase the wage rate. What was reasonable in the case of the Eildon Weir and in the case of the Altona refinery could be multiplied a thousand times if l i e machinery for such .agreements were allowed to exiat. At the present time all that is being done is that unofficial agreements between of a hundred cases in the -engineering industry, in which I worked before I came to this chamber, where employees ployers decided to pay f l , or 30s. or even £2 over the award rate. In some cases the parties did not have to get together because the employers came to the employees and said., ""We will give you £2 over the award rate"". These things have created a most friendly state of mind in the workshops concerned. But are we to declare now that because some judge says the .system is not in the public interest, these agreements are not to be allowed? It is important to see that a friendly feeling exists in industry. We want industry run smoothly, with a contented rank and file and a satisfied management. A satisfied management and a contented rank and file should be able to conclude an agreement that is mutually acceptable to them.",41,James Harrison Tha T Is Being Considered He Has Referred At
136,Mr Bird (Batman) [5.35],"I disThis Parliament should not pass legislation that will jeopardize industrial peace in the industries concerned. Wo should advance with the times and take a leaf out of the book of other countries. We should say, "" While the system has worked fairly satisfactorily up to u point, we think that the proposition submitted by the Labour party is a definite improvement in the Australian arbitration system and should be adopted by this chamber "". should like to refer first to a statement -made by the honourable member for Forrest( Mr Freeth). He mentioned normal trade unionists. During the war if an overcoat given to a man in the "" Q "" store fitted him, somebody said, "" You cannot be normal "". That applies to the trade unionist who fits the honourable member's idea of normality. There is a very serious conflict between the views expressed on this occasion by honourable members on the other side and the views they have expressed in previous instances. They are advocates of private enterprise and of freedom of enterprise, yet. they want to apply sanctions and checks to stop private bargaining and to prevent people arriving at agreements which might be . satisfactory to themselves but which apparently are against this much-quoted business of the public interest. What is public interest? The public interest on all these occasions is against the interests of the workers and the people represented by members of the Labour party. The public interest, when it is interpreted by the courts, is always towards a lowering of wage standards or maintaining the status quo. There are very few instances in which that is not so. We oppose putting into the hands of a court the power to interpret on behalf of 9,000,000 Australians just what is the public interest. After all, one of the serious features of the arbitration system is the banding over of an important part of the economics of the country-almos t the ruling of the country -to a body outside the control of the Parliament. That is serious departure from parliamentary responsibility. The Anderson), by interjection, said, ""WhereK -[107 ] should this sort of decision rest ?"" Of course, it should rest here. The constitutional position makes it difficult for us to make that sort of decision at the moment, although there are very few instances in which a concrete attempt has been made by the Parliament to decide this sort of issue. referendums. plural. We oppose the attempt to limit the right of bodies of employers and employees to arrive at a conclusion satisfactory to themselves. We oppose the attempt to apply sanctions to these agreements. If public interest is interpreted to mean that a group of employees shall not have higher wages, then public interest demands that the same sort of sanction be applied against the people who are making profits. There is a clear conflict of principle here between the things that honourable members opposite have been espousing in respect of the freedom of enterprise and private enterprise, and the application of limitations on these agreements. I should like to hear an honourable member opposite explain exactly how he reconciles what are to me apparent contradictions. When this debate started I was inclined to support the view of the Opposition. Pome honourable members opposite laugh at that statement, but they may not be inclined to laugh in a few moments. After hearing the honourable member for Blaxland( Mr E. James Harrison), I could sec the purpose of this amendment, and that view has been confirmed by the honourable member for Wills( Mr Bryant). If I heard him aright, the honourable member for Wills said a few moments ago that the Labour party was opposed to employers and employees making these private arrangements. of the sort. much like it to me, and I checked with my colleagues on my right. heard noises.",42,James Harrison Tha T Is Being Considered He Has Referred At

The honourable member for King3fovd-Smith will remain silent. and labour are to be prevented from making private arrangements which provide that the wage rates to be paid are above the minimum rates in the award, then the people who will be disadvantageously affected will be the workers themselves. The honourable member for Blaxland made some reference to rackets in connection with employers seeking the labour that they require, and then moved very smartly on to the subject of incentive payments. He implied that men who were prepared to work for higher wages were something akin to scabs. If that is the Labour party's attitude to men working for higher wages the workers will be the ones who will finally suffer. for the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Order! The honourable member for Cairns) to talk about the public interest. He will start to tell us something that he learned at Oxford or somewhere else, but it will not cut any ice. The point is that if some workers are prepared to accept arrangements with employers, and there is complete understanding between them, there is nothing wrong with that. Buti f the Labour party, through its representatives in this Parliament, wants such arrangements written into an award, the workers will be at a disadvantage finally, because other workers will ask for these wages, and industry will find that it will not be able to pay them all round. Last week, the honourable member for Batman( Mr Bird) praised the activities of American companies in Australia. To-day, I heard him talk about the Eildon Weir and the refinery at Altona. There is already a big refinery at Ivwinana, in Western Australia. It is a well-known fact that the employers engaged in building these projects were paying far above the basic wage and the normal level of margins. If the employers are prepared to pay extra to have such jobs completed more quickly, who benefits? The worker benefits. The employer certainly gets his share of the benefit, too, but so long as the worker is not penalized, that is a good thing. The Labour party should realize that, as the honourable member for Bendigo has said, we are living in a rapidly changing era with rapidly changing ideas in the industrial field I know that the honourable member for Batman has been associated with the Amalgamated Engineers Union.

A company which is prepared to pay a few pounds over the award rate because it has the ability to do so may have a host of things in mind when it does that. If the higher payment made by one company to its workers is held to be the level of payment which should apply to other workers engaged in the same industry, we will find thai the public interest will be very adversely served, because it is probable that other companies will not be able to pay thai higher wage and still operate profitably.

Having listened to honourable members opposite expounding what they claim to be the views of the trade unions outsidea claim that I emphatically repudiateI think they are talking only for talking's sake, because we have had no complaints generally from workers at the Eildon Weir or anywhere else about the legislation. I defy any honourable member to find a group of trade unionists who will throw their bread and butter away because some men are getting a few shillings a week more than other men. We are in a rapidly changing era. A provision that an agreement to pay higher rates should form part of an award would finally be disadvantageous to the workers, and therefore I oppose the amendment most -""trongly. unusual to hear a member of the Australian Country party speaking so authoritatively on what the members of trade unions think about legislation, it is particularly unusual to hear a member of that party advancing the argument that a trade unionist who gets an extra. £2 a week as a result of an agreement with his employer, is somehow doing himself an injury. I had considerable difficulty in raised by the Minister in an interjection following the honourable member's line of when the honourable member for Bendigo reasoning, and T think that members of ( Mr Clarey) was speaking. The Ministrade unions would also have considerable ter referred to the bargaining power difficulty in following his kind of reasonbeing, as he put it , in the hands of the ing.

The interest in cases when, as the Ministerf o r Government, has never regarded such a Labour and National Service( MrH o l t ) situation as a possibility, but I think it is put it , the bargaining power is in the one that we could well afford to look at, hands of the employee-the situation that because it may well arise.

That is the kind of reasoning that we have had when the court has determined what the public interest is in such cases. The honourable member for Forrest( Mr Freeth), in his contribution to the debate, implied that it was in the public interest to prevent employers fro m granting wage increases to their employees, and then passing the additional cost of production on in the form of increased prices for their products which would yield them increased profits. I remind the honourable membei for Forrest that the element of profit incentive always exists in industry, and if it is possible for any employer to raise his prices arbitrarily he w ill raise them in order to make more profit out of his product. The effect of an agreement to pay the employees higher wages is that, the profit which the employer is already making from the prices fixed by him, which w ill be the maximum prices that the market w ill stand, w ill be shared by tin: employees. Such increases are not general increases but are specific increases, and it is much more likely thai r.he process of passing the increase on in the form of higher prices w ill occur in the case of a general increase than in the case of a particular employer or industry paying increased wages.

Opposition) [8.1] Mr Deputy Speaker, T am obliged to the House for giving me the opportunity of speaking without restriction because, in my opinion, this is an extremely important piece of legislation. In the view of the Oppositionand I think it can be established beyond any doubt-thi s bill represents, not an impartial and just way of dealing with the difficulties of the waterfront in Australia, but a partisan way. Undoubtedly, as w ill be proved by instance after instance that w ill be given, if not by myself, then by my colleagues, the bill discriminates against the trade unionists because of its treatment, on the one hand, of the stevedores who are the shipping companies a3 contrasted with its treatment of trade unionists. The bill 6hows partisanship in favour of the shipowners and against the trade unionists which I can hardly believe that the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr HaroldH o l t ) who is in charge of the bill can excuse, let alone justify. In coming to this great topic of the waterfront and the problem of stevedoring, the Minister pointed out in his speech that the record of the industry was one of turbulence, and that is true. But he must be careful before using phrases like that because that is not a phrase which has been applied only recently to the industry. It is a phrase that was applied by Mr Justice Higgins, who, more than 40 years ago, made the first award in this industry. ing to the House instead of to the Opposition? able gentleman who is going to take a public position overseas try to behave himself? I know that he w ill have to behave himself later, but he should t r y to do so now. I want the opportunity to put my case in my own way and I am going to do it . The right honourable gentleman w ill not stop me. Adermann) -Order! out that the history of the waterfront was such that certain events led to the introduction first of all, by the Curtin Government, of regulations under the national security legislation in relation to the waterfront and in connection with stevedoring in Australia; and later to the legislation that was passed by the Chifley Government. The act of 1949 has remained on the statute-book, through all the years of office of the present Government until the commencement of last year, w i th only one amendment. No other amendments were made. That law has stood unchallenged by the Parliament or the Government during all that period. When I was interrupted a moment ago, I was referring to the fact that the history of tlie waterfront is one of great struggle by the trade union in this industry, as in so many other industries in Australia. Mr Justice Higgins, way back in 1914, in making the first award for the waterfront referred to these features of this difficult industry. I should like to read two or three sentences from his judgment. He saidThe vital facts of the position are that the work is casual, uncertain; that the jobs are short; that the men have to wait often fruitlessly and that tlie necessities of the man and his dependants are certain, continuous, incessant. Under existing circumstances, with the lack of organization among the employers as to the times for arrival and departure of vessels and as to the employment of men, each employer naturally endeavours to have at his wharf as many men as he may require on his busiest days and there is on nearly every day a surplus of men seeking employment at most wharves. That is the background of the problem and, to some extent, the problem is still with us. Mr Justice Higgins there referred to the lack of organization in W ill the right honorthe industry affecting the organization by the shipping companies and the stevedores as to the times of arrival of their vessels. That is one of the great problems of this industry. Mr Justice Higgins pointed to the legal principle to be applied to the",46,Harold Hol T

163,Dr. Evatt,"I was merely pointingwaterside workers. Mr Justice Higgins was probably the greatest industrial arbitration judge in the history of this country, and possibly in the history of the world. That is recognized throughout the world by all scholars in this difficult and important subject. He said of the employeesTheir service to tlie public is not confined to the actuul physical exertion. They serve the public by waiting and in readiness for ships to come. They are entitled at the least to food, clothes and shelter for themselves and their dependants during the whole time of this service. If a man keeps a horse he has to feed the horse on flays when he does not use him as well as when he does. That was rather a graphic way of putting a truth which is so often denied. He went onIf he keeps two or more horses and uses them in rotation they must be fed all the time. Then he gave reasons for making the -fiiov award. But the award, in those days, was made under conditions of turbulence. Right from the lS90's to 1914 there were struggles in the industry and there was the turbulence to which the judge referred. A t that time reference was often made to turbulence in relation to the Waterside Workers Federation when it was led by a gentleman who became famous, not only in this country, but throughout the world. I refer to the late Right Honourable W. M . Hughes, who was then president of the federation. If ever there was a turbulent leader of a unionnot in a bad sense but in a true sensewho was determined to see that the men got justice, it was Hughes. That has been characteristic of the industry ever since. Mr Justice Foster was appointed to inquire into this very industry by the Chifley Government, in 1946. He referred to its long history. Trade unionism in Australia, not merely on the waterfront, owes a great deal to the solidarity and loyalty of the men working on the waterfront, just as they themselves owe a great deal to other unions. They had struggles, just as the Australian Workers Union had struggles, against attempts by employers to form unions for the purpose of dividing and destroying the bona fide trade unions. In the pastoral industry in New South Wales an attempt was made to. for m what was called a machine shearers' union, which was financed by the employers in an attempt to destroy the registered trade union. Similarly, in the waterfront industry in some States, an attempt was made, years later, to form a bogus union. By"" bogus union "", I mean that it did not represent the views of the majority. Its purpose was to destroy the Waterside Workers Federation. In my opinion, this bill is aimed at the trade unions. My friend, the Minister for Labour and National Service, talked about the monopoly of the trade unions. Apparently, according to him, if there is one union covering « calling, that is a monopoly. It is a strange thing to call it a "" monopoly "". It is not a "" monopoly "" in any real sense of the word. It is not the "" monopoly "" of the shipowners or the stevedores who have no competition in their trade and who have eliminated rivalries so that no other person can come into the field! It is a very different type of monopoly from that. I think it is a misuse of the term, although I understand how often it if used. Perhapsi t is convenient to use it . What do we find with regard to tbf problem on the waterfront? A case went to the H i g h Courti n connection with the award. We must consider the history of the trade unions and the employers in relation to each industry with which the Parliament has to deal. I remind honourable members of the formation, in about 1924, of what was called the Shipping Bureau. That bureau was set up as an employer of labour, but Mr Justice Isaacs, of the H i g h Court of Australia, said, in his judgmentThe evidence leads . . . to the conclusion that ""The Shipping Bureau"" Which is the body established by the shipowners and the stevedoring companieswas no independent persona and was never intended to he more than an instrument operated by and at the will of the various real persons who had combined for the purpose. It is a mere labour concentration camp from which supplies can be drawn by the partie* interested as and when they need them . . . All the complications . . . are machinery and part of the method for doing indirectly and in association what each could not do directly and singly. That means, of course, that in order to circumvent the award of the Commonwealth court a body called the Shipping bureau was formed. It was not directly iiound by the award. The stevedoring companies were so bound, and the formarion of tlie bureau was a device .to defeat die purpose of the court's decision. Mr Justice Piddington, another groat arbitration judge, referred to the formation of the rival union in this very industry. He saidThe objecting union was formed at a time, and in a spirit, of sharp antagonism to the applicant branch. It co-operated . . . with the Shipping Labour Bureau, Which is the body that was denounced in the H i g h Court judgment. Mr Justice Piddington described it in these wordsThe recognized citadel of those shipowners who sought the destruction of the Waterside Workers Federation's influence. That was the situation in 1924, according to Mr Justice Piddington, who had heard the relevant evidence. The shipowners and the stevedores, who were the agents and servants of the shipowners, were acting together, with the object of getting rid of a union that was fighting for the interests of its members in the industry. Mr Justice Piddington went on to say This citadel turned out . . . to be a thing of mere cardboard walls and painted battlements. It fell to pieces after the decision if the High Court. That is the decision of Mr Justice Isaacs that I have already mentioned. That was the situation in the 'twenties. The conditions on the waterfront during the depression were so unsatisfactory, and so disgraceful from the point of view of wage justice, that they .i re no doubt well remembered to-day by those connected Later, as I have told the House, Mr -Justice Foster had to consider all that history of the industry, and to decide whether a stevedoring organization that had operated during the war should be re-established in the post-war period. He dealt with the operation of the first stevedoring industry commission, and said that there were certain features about it am wondering whether the right honorwhich he criticized. Then he went on to able gentleman is quite in order in speak«ay that conditions, so far as the Ausing to this bill. The House w ill recall tralian war effort was concerned, would that some time ago he took money as a have been indeed much worse had that paid advocate for the Waterside Workers rirganization not existed, and he recomFederation to defend the Communists mended that a similar body be estabin that federation, and his Communist, lished. The important point is t h is : paymaster is now sitting in the House, He recommended, when speaking of this organization, that there was room for only one union in the various ports. Subject to the exceptions of one or two ports in distant parts of Australia, where either the Australian Workers Union or the North Australian Workers Union does the stevedoring work, he gave it as his opinion that the Waterside Workers Federation should be, not the favoured body but the responsible body to provide the necessary labour to perform the stevedoring operations. Mr Justice Foster had this to sayI t needs no argument to suggest that the practical administration of industrial relations can most conveniently be served by the recognition of one and not several unions. Then he recommended the appointment of the body that subsequently came into existence, and later certain changes were vnado and the 1949 legislation was passed. I have before me copies of many portions of his judgment. Of course the shipowners and stevedoring companies had said that everything that was done during the war period under the administration of the organization then existing had been a failure. The then Opposition parties in this House also put forward that view, but it is interesting to note that Sir Thomas Gordon, who was Director of Shipping and who represented the British Ministry of Shipping in this country, gave praise to that wartime organization, and it was revealed, during the activities of the commission or board, that there was an appalling lack of decent facilities on the Australian waterfront. The governments led by with the industry. Mr Curtin and Mr Chifley spent nearly £200,000 in contributing towards the improvement of that position and the provision of amenities on the waterfront.

"" stevedoring industry"" and honourable members may ask how the Commonwealth can legislate on this matter at all. It can do so because this Parliament has power to make laws in respect of trade and commerce among the States, and with other countries. That was the ground upon which the 1949 legislation was brought in by the Chifley Government. In order to sary to be generally familiar with the 1949 act. That act provided for the prevention or settlement, by conciliation or arbitration, of industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of any one State. That was one head of power. The other was the power to regulate industrial matters in connection with the performance of stevedoring operations in the course of trade and commerce with other countries, or among the States. Ordinarily, the State legislature has power to deal with the subject of stevedoring, for the operation takes place within its limits. However, as stevedoring is related to interstate trade, this Parliament has power to deal with it. That"" is the way in which the Chifley Government approached this problem. We brought down an act which imposed duties upon, and gave rights to, not merely the Waterside Workers Federation and the other unions in the distant ports to which I have referred, but also the stevedores themselves. That is to say, the objective of the act was to assist the effective operation of stevedoring by registering not merely the members of the unions involved, but the duties of the stevedores as well. The act was impartial and set up a system of organization designed at making goods flow more quickly.

That involved Commonwealth matters at all. tlie provision of plant, its control and operation, and like measures. That purpose was emphasized in section 13 and 1949 act. substantially, though not, of course, fully, the objective was achieved.

178,Dr. Evatt,It is not the same thing,51,Suspension Of Standing Ordees
179,Mr Dnrmmoun,"T rise to order. Tby turning his back upon you, and upon us, and addressing a private lecture to honourable members of his own party. tially, the point of order is correct, but 1 am reluctant to interrupt any speaker in respect of a matter such as this. The Xeader of the Opposition knows that he should direct his remarks to the Chair. the definitions of the functions of the authority show that it is not the intention of the Government or of the shipowners to permit any action to be taken by regulation or by statutory order to require the introduction of good practices in stevedoring. All that will be permitted will be investigation and encouragement of good practices. In the case of the employers, there is to be no lixercise of the law-making power, whereas in the case of the employees, the whole of their working lives will be affected by the powers contained elsewhere in the legislation. I submit that, that contrast runs throughout the bill. Paragraph (m) states that another function of the authority shall beTo investigate the causes of delays in the performance of stevedoring operations and, in particular, delays in the arrival of cargo at, and the removal of cargo from, wharves. What is the point of investigating? Suppose that, due to neglect by the stevedores, there is delay in discharging cargo from a ship. There will be no power to deal with that neglect by some disciplinary action of the kind for which provision is made in other clauses of the bill. Investigation will be the limit of the power of the authority. Similarly, with regard to safe working in stevedoring operations, the power of the authority will be confined to encouragement. operations should be a. sine qua non. The authority should be empowered to make regulations for that purpose, but that has not been done. Under this legislation, it will have no power in that, regard, whereas under the earlier legislation power was given in wide terms. Sub-clause (2.) of the clause statesIn regulating the performance of stevedoring operations under this A r t . the Authority slr'V e.y""""t t-> :---,]<-!! extent as, in the opinion of the Authority, is essential for the proper performance of that function, avoid imposing limitations upon employers with respect to their control of waterside workers engaged by them and their manner of performance of stevedoring operations. That is the key to the powers of the authority in relation to stevedoring operations. It means that the authority is to keep its hands off the employers. It means that the performance of steveI am pointing out that, doring operations is a matter whirl!, as a. general rule, must not. be touched at all by the authority. The other provisions in that group prove beyond doubt that that is the purpose of this approach to the matter. But that is only a part of the scheme contained in the bill. There are provisions, which will be referred to in detail, dealing with the powers of the authority in relation to registered waterside workers who are members of the union. The determination of port quotas is dealt with in clause 24, clause 25' and clause 26. Honourable members know that a port quota is the number of workers needed to meet the requirements of the port, looked at over a substantial or fairly long period. Provision is made for the fixing of port quotas, but it is clear that, without altering a quota in the appropriate way, stevedores may employ extra men, who need not be members of the union. That, of course, is a threat to trade unionism. The most striking illustration is clause 40. I regard that clause as so important that I shall read several of its main provisions. Subclause (1.) statesWlhere the Authority is of the opinion(».) that by reason of the sudden occurrence of an unusually heavy demand for the performance of stevedoring operations at a port or by reason of interruptions in stevedoring operations . . . the expeditious . . . performance of stevedorSafe working in stevedoring ing operations . . . is likely to be prejudicially effected for a period of at least five days; and (h) that the circumstances are not such as to warrant an increase in the quota for the port or the registration of waterside workers at the port . . . the Authority may declare . . . that, until the declaration ceases to he in force, the employment of unregistered waterside workers . . . is, in the public interest, permitted in accordance with this section.",51,Suspension Of Standing Ordees
180,Mr Deputy Speaker,Substan,52,Suspension Of Standing Ordees
181,Dr. Evatt,"Then provision is made for the employment of such men during certain hours. The evenings and week-ends are referred to specifically. It is obvious that the purpose of that provision is to enable -stevedores, in such cases, without altering the basic quota, to bring in additional labour, regardless of whether the additional labour required could be provided by the union. No opportunity w ill be given to the union to fill the gap. Certain other provisions are contained in this very lengthy clause. The whole of the plan is in accord with the statements that were made in the evidence given before the committee by one of the leaders of the interstate shipowners. The authority may call for applications from persons who are prepared to accept employment under these provisions. That is not the ordinary method. The authority may specify to whom the application -»hall be made. There is provision that a person shall not, in his application, make a statement which is misleading. The authority will have power to revoke a declaration made under this clause if the emergency or the circumstances which gave rise to the making of the declaration no longer exist. Theni t is provided that when a declaration is made by the authority, notice shall be given to the union. which statesSubject to any order of the Authority or II ward of the Commission, a person who is not a registered waterside worker and is engaged for employment as a waterside worker by virtue of tli is section is, in respect of the work on which he is employed and the period of his engagement as approved by the Authority, entitled to the same remuneration and subject to the same terms and conditions of employment as would be applicable to him if he were a registered waterside worker. Provision is made, directly and openly, .That would be substantially a charge, but for the stevedores to recruit labour for this industry, although the proper and just course, if an emergency arose, would be to give the union itself an opportunity shall provide proper supervision of the perto meet the situation. B ut that is not formance of stevedoring operations by waterwhat is wanted. A register is to be kept. He fulfils that duty by employing a skilPeople who are not members of the union f u l foreman. Then, he will be able to work in the industry at nights or at week-ends, at extra rates of pay, thus disturbing the balance of the industry. The object should be to spread payments for both ordinary time and overtime f a i r l y amongst all members of if he fails to comply with these provithe recognized union. These provisions for the employment of persons who are not members of the union, without altering the quota, are almost provocative. If persisted in , they are likely to cause, if they are not intended to cause, clash after clash, because the livelihood of the waterside workers is involved. We have here something like the shipping bureau that was referred to by Mr Justice Piddington and other judges. That is coming in again. There are clauses which suggest that if the waterside workers w ill not work with' these additional men, action can be taken to deregister them and deprive them of their livelihoods. Under certain clauses of the bill, if that tragic situation were to arise in a port, the ultimate sanction could well be that an association of persons, not a union at all, would be recognized as a union. All those provisions of a like character, are contained in this legislation. But the matter does not end there, because the case I am trying to make is that there is differential treatment, and I think that this is clear from the bill. For instance, certain obligations are cast upon a registered employer by clause 33 of the bill. His registration may in certain circumstances be cancelled, but the conditions imposed upon him are so unlike those There is a further provision which are imposed upon the registered waterside worker that they demand a few minutes' consideration. All that the registered employer is debarred from doing is contained substantially in clause 33. He, in the words of the clauseshall not aet in a manner whereby the expeditious, safe and efficient performance of stevedoring operations is prejudiced or interfered with. it is not the type of thing that is likely to occur. Then, heride workers engaged by him. shall ensure that, as far as is practicable(i) stevedoring operations for which he has engaged waterside workers are expeditiously, safely and efficiently performed. sions he is subjected to the heavy penalty, upon conviction, of a fine of not less than £100 and not more than £1,000. But the obligation is an obligation of which one could never prove the breach. If a stevedore acted in the ordinary course of his business and employed skilful persons he could not possibly be held to be guilty of a breach of these provisions. The punishment of offences by employers is referred to in the next clause. An employer goes before the new court of arbitration, which imposes penalties, but those proceedings must be instituted by the authority. First, the obligation is vague and general. I cannot imagine a case in which its breach could be proved. It is not the kind of matter in which a stevedore would be at fault. If he were at fault at all it would be in not organizing his work and in matters of that character, but not in such matters as are referred to in that clause. Provision is made for the cancellation or suspension of the registration of employers. Before such action can be taken it must be shown that the employer does not have the means of carrying out stevedoring operations in an expeditious manner, and so on, that is to say, that he has not the equipment. In the ordinary course of events, that could never be shown. It would have to be shown that the employer failed to comply with an order or award or had been convicted of an offence under the act under such provisions as I have cited. Those are the provisions in relation to the employer. Although they look imposing, they do not amount to obligations which really affect the organization of the work to the best advantage, and having the work done in an efficient manner, necessarily by co-operation with the other persons engaged on the waterfront. Let us now consider the case of the waterside worker. The authority has to be satisfied that a registered waterside workeris, by reason of misconduct in or about an employment bureau, or a wharf or ship, unfit to be aregistered waterside worker. What does that mean? That provision could apply to some isolated caee of misbehaviour which, if dealt with at all, would normally be dealt with by an ordinary police case. For that misconduct his registration may be suspended. Such a provision should not be left in its present form. If he has failed(i) to ofl'er for or accept employment as a waterside worker; ( i i ) to commence, continue or complete an engagement for employment as a waterside worker; or, ( i i i) to perform any stevedoring operations which he was lawfully required to perform; his registration may be cancelled. Whether he is acting in conjunction with his fellow unionists, or in isolation, this tremendous power over him is given to the authority. Those are events which in the nature of things are not unlikely; they must occur from time to time in certain circumstances. The employer is placed in a very different position. After a waterside worker's registration is cancelled or suspended, he may lodge an appeal, which is heard by the court. I have referred to clause 40, which provides for the introduction of non-union labour. I have indicated the provisions under which labour which is not union labour may be introduced without increasing the port quota. I now desire to refer to clause 44. That is the boycott clause, and it is taken in substance from the Crimes Act. The provision in the Crimes Act in regard to the waterfront was included originally because the power of the Commonwealth in relation to interstate trade was'thought to enable such a law to be validly passed during the period of a declared emergency. During a limited period the Crimes Act is proclaimed, as honourable members know, and provisions like this operate, but the provisions in this bill, which reproduce almost exactly those of the Crimes Act, will operate as a general rule in connection with workers in this industry. The clause readsA person shall not, by violenceto the person or property of a person, by threat, intimidation or incitement of any kind to any person, or, without reasonable cause or excuse . . . Let us assume that that is the relevant part. It provides that a person shall not, without reasonable cause or excuseby boycott or threat of boycott of a person or property or discriminatory action, prevent, hinder or dissuade(a) a person from . . . offering for, obtaining or accepting employment: t shall not go through the list of prohibitions. Honourable members can see what is involved in that provision. It means that if there were a dispute between the union and the employers, and if members of the union were required to handle certain cargo, which in the opinion of the recognized trade union, or its council, should not be handled by union labour, and they refused to handle it, their refusal would constitute an offence under that clause. Indeed, it has been so held under similar provisions of the Crimes Act. Clause 44 (2.) also provides for a separate offence. f t readsA registered waterside worker shall not, without reasonable cause or excuse, refuse to accept employment or perform work in -stevedoring operations with another person who is a registered waterside worker or is employed as a waterside worker by virtue of section forty of this Act. If a registered waterside worker, without reasonable cause or excuse, refuses to accept employment with a person who is not registered and who is not a member of the union, he commits an offence also. The provision relating to reasonable cause or excuse has never been interpreted in this kind of case in favour of the workers. Sub-clause (3.) providesIn proceedings for an offence arising under -either of the last to preceding sub-sections, proof of reasonable cause or excuse lies upon the person charged. The old onus of proof device is brought in to make a person prove positively that he has reasonable cause for excuse. Where the offence is committed by a body corporate, the penalty is £500. The bill there refers clearly, not to a shipping company or stevedoring company, but to tbe union which, for the purposes of the clause, would no doubt be treated as a body corporate. penalty is £50. A waterside worker's conviction under the legislation would also probably endanger his registration. Proof of destroy his registered status. How is it intended to proceed in order to obtaiti evidence of these things? Perhaps the most serious aspect of all lies in clause 54, which covers the furnishing of information. The clause reads(1.) The Authority That is, the Australian .Stevedoring Industry Authoritymay require a person(a) to furnish to the Authority such information as the Authority requires, iu such form as the Authority requires; and (6) to attend to give evidence before the Authority, or before such other person as the Authority directs, with respect to any matter to which this Act applies and may require that person to produce all books, documents, papers and things whatever in his custody or control relating to any such matter. (2.) The Authority may require the information or evidence to be given on oath or affirmation and either orally or in writing, and for that purpose the Chairman of the Authority, or a person authorized by him in that behalf, may administer an oath. Then comes the penal provision(3.) A person shall not(o) refuse or fail to comply with any requirement made in pursuance of this section; or Apparently the penalty for that is £50 -o r (o) with intent to evade the provisions of this section, destroy . . . any document. . . . Then comes the crowning injustice in the administration of this provision(4.) Where a person is obliged to answer a question orally by virtue of this section, he shall not refuse to answer the question on the ground that the answer might tend to incriminate him or make him liable to a penalty, but the answer given by him shall not be admissible in any proceedings against him other than proceedings in respect of the falsity of theanswer iu respect of his refusal or failure to answer. So, he is liable to a penalty if he answers falsely. But he cannot refuse to answer on the ground that the answer might incriminate him, which is a basis o l In other cases the refusal that is recognized . 1 think in even the most searching of inquiries by royal commissions. It is generally recognized that a man has a right to an offence would automatically refuse to answer under those circumstances. So, if a man says, "" I am not going to incriminate myself "" it does not matter, but it is all right if he incriminates his mates. That is what it boils down to; that is the substance of the provision. I know of no comparable provision in other industrial legislation. There are other provisions to which intended that it should be so covered. 1 I could refer, but I need refer to only one. am referring to provocative action, such A provision relating to attendance money as an insult, by a foreman at the point is included in a Government amendwhere the cargo is being dealt with.

185,Dr. Evatt,"The Minister will notpresided over by Mr Tait, namely, that it is impossible to infer from tbe fact that rl.iere are stoppages that those stoppages are due to the waterside workers, and the committee does not find that they are due to the conduct of the registered employers. That matter is to be dealt with at a later stage of the inquiry. I think it can be fairly stated that, so far as the report has beeD completed, that is a matter about which it is silent. I do not know whether the Minister claims that that report justifies the introduction of this measure. If he does, I challenge the claim. He certainly referred very shortly to certain matters in it. The committee of inquiry, which was presided over by Mr the provision is known? The report conTait, QC., in its interim report, takes a very detached view of most of these matters and in connection with stoppages refrains from passing judgment. The report says that that matter will be dealt with later. I am referring now to page? IS and 19 of that very important document. The committee expressly says that the matter of disputes and stoppages is to be dealt with. This is one of the reasons given on page 19. Mention is made that in the Arbitration Court certain remedies are available, and t' e committee points out, the long delay iu the making of a new award. The report of the special committee of inquiry saysThe award under which the industry is working was made in 193(>, and although various ovders varying or adding to its provisions have since heen made, many of them dealing with the conditions of work are in many respects out of date and completely unreal. We include for this purpose as part of the award very numerous orders which wi""i-e made by the statutory Stevedoring Industry Commission set up 1 time and continued from 1947 to 10.49. later, really come to the actual hearing of . . .

They have never been wiped off the list urgent bus entered upon a hearing, and in of ordersThe result has been that the award and to attempt to allocate the blame for this sorry these orders are in a state of utmost constate of affairs. No doubt the parties are fusion. . . . No one was in a position both to blame to some extent, and indeed an to tell us with any certainty what was the inference should be drawn that, for its own operative provision of the award plus the purposes, one or other of them has not been orders as to numerous matters. In this in d u s t r y nobody knows w h a t the o b l i g a t i o n is so f a r as the employees That state of affairs has existed from 1950 are concernedI n course of our Inquiry the Board caused the Government. That is this Governto be prepared a consolidation of the award ment, of which the right honourable and the orders which entailed a great deal ot research, . . . but which is acknowledged to be not necessarily authoritative nor complete. Reference is made to Mr Justice Kir by and the 1947 act when he said that the most urgent need in the industry was the preparation and promulgation of a new code or awardThe Committee agrees with this view anil rinds that the fact that nothing tangible has resulted up to the present time is a ver\ serious source of trouble and inefficiency in the industry, and in particular of disputes and stoppages. How can there be any law in it unless tinues as follows:In the absence of such a code setting out the conditions for the use of registered labour on the waterfront, the Federation and its members have to found a measure of justification for all sort of demands and refusals which have led to stoppages and disputes. Ona example of this is that at many ports practices and customs have grown up and have either been accepted or alleged to have been accepted, and if they are departed from, although not authorized by the award or even contrary to its terms, the men have insisted that they are entitled to continue. . . . In many cases it has been impossible to ascertain with any certainty whether an alleged practice or custom is based upon agreement and the position ha* led to much difficulty and many disputes -As long ago as the middle of 1950, AndI emphasize thisboth the employers' organizations and the Federation filed logs of claims with the Arbitration Court. In both cases the log was most comprehensive and claimed the laying down of conditions of employment and of work on the waterfront which covered a very wide area. Since then, both logs have been in waramended and added to from time to time. The Arbitration Court has not yet, six years applications with regard to them, and as to particular matters which it has treated as some eases made orders. We do not propose always willing to expedite the hearing of the loss and the making of a new award. until to-day. The report then mentions gentleman is the Minister for Labour and National Service. It continuesThe Government and the Arbitration Court eanuot he regarded as free from res|>ousibi.i!y for this long delay in the bearing of the logs and the laying down of a new award and a comprehensive code for the industry. This delay accounts, we lind, in no small measure fur the chaotic conditions we lind existiig in the industry. The Arbitration Courth is, no doubt, been handicapped in that Judges who have accepted the task of hearing matters in respect of this industry have found themselves, by reason of urgent matters and other duties claiming their attention, unable' to complete this very necessary work. AllI can say is that that is a very strong due to the profits of the shipping comcondemnation of the position in this bines. What happened in this case was industry. It is not due to employers or that there was apparently very slow proto employees hut to the absence of any law gress.

I do not say anything further about the merits of that. I know that some case can be made for it. But that was one of the matters asked for by the shipowners at the time that the Waterside Workers federation was endeavouring to get something in the nature of an award regarding margins. And, of course, the point was taken that margins were not for the waterside workers, and that the decision of the Full Court of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court meant that the only people who could get increases of maigiii3 were fully skilled people. As a result, 60 per cent, of the workers employed under federal awards did not get the marginal increases. That was the contention in relation to the waterside workers. The result was that a great dispute arose throughout Australia and reached a point at which the matter looked most serious. At any rate, the dispute was settled and the waterside workers returned to work. On the following day, the 8th February, the Minister wrote to the chairman of committee. I want the House to understand that stevedoring profits, of which the Opposition made such a feature during the debate on the bill, had not been pronounced upon, nor have they yet hern pronounced upon. The Minister's letter saidDcnr Mr Tait, It is a matter nf public knowledge that your committee was establi-hed to report on the facts of the stevedoring industry, not only to guide the Government in formulating its own policy, but to aid the public in an understanding of the problem ! of tbe industry, and 5 any legislative measures the Government might decide on.

That is the very dispute about which the salary and wage earners are convulsed. I repeat, the Minister wroteI t is by no means certain that the dispute can be regarded as at an end nor that the Government may not still be called upon tu bring down special legislation. It was threatened by the Minister, during the dispute, that unless the waterside workers went back to work there would be a declaration of emergency and the provisions of the Crimes Act would be invoked. That was the special legislation referred to, at any rate, in the columns of the press which mentioned the Minister as the authority for the report. honourable gentleman forgotten the Chifley Government's act in 1949 to break the coal strike? I have almost finished reading the letter, which is very important, because I think that fhe proper solution of this problem is evident from the Minister's interjections and from this letter.

There was a reported last February That was February, 1954that the turn-round time for ships had improved, but that the overseas shipping combine ployers and the Australian Council of had made no compensating cut in shippingTrades Unions, and the employers agreed charges. The combine had benefited by £700,000 to give favorable consideration to all men from' the reduction of the stevedoring charge nominated by the union up to the 27th as a result of a bill introduced by the MinisNovember, 1954. ter for Labour and National Service. The Herald also stated that the shipping combine nominations were received from various charged far more than the reasonable costs of branches of the union and forwarded to -lervices, and always fixed toe maximum that the employers. In nearly all cases registhe traffic would bear. To use an Americanism, tration was recommended. that statement means the maximum that can be extorted from the consumers, primary producers and businessmen of this country. The same newspaper, on the 12th June last, 1955, set out in the sixth report of the completely contradicted the main reason that Australian Stevedoring Industry Board, is given by the shipping combine for high was made "" pending the completion of the -shipping freights.

There was a conference between the emLarge numbers of The agreement of the 17th February, by the committee of I ask the House to note that fact. That And the committee is still The arrangements agreed upon were ex(1) The Waterside Workers Federation acknowledges that once the Australian Stevedoring Industry Board, which has the statutory responsibility for determining port quotas, has workers must be registered by the hoard with a minimum of delay to the number from time to time desired by the employers (but not exceeding the quota) and that the Waterside Workers Federation will do everything possible to facilitate the registration and admission to membership of such workers. 12) In furtherance of this the Waterside Workers Federation agrees that with the quickest possible despatch after the General Secretary receives any notification that the employers desire to have registered the number of waterside workers advised, it will supply to the Australian Stevedoring Industry Board, for consideration by the employers for recommendation to the Australian Stevedoring Industry Board a sufficient number of names of prospective waterside workers to meet the required number. (3) The employers will not refuse to recommend any applicant whose name is thus submitted by the W.W.F. except for bona"" fide reasons. If the W.W.F. challenge any such refusal the merits will be considered by tbe local representative of the A.S.I.B. whose decision (taken after such joint discussion with the representatives of employers and the W.W.F. as may be necessary) is to be accepted as final. (4) If the W.W.F. complies with paragraph 2 the employers will not recommend to the A.S.I.B. the names of any persons whose names have not been submitted by the W.W.F. If tliat agreement were given effect, the union would register men as required. The report continues(5) The W.W.F. will so arrange things that, as far as practicable, consideration by Branch membership of quota increases and the admission of newmembers will be dealt with by means which do not involve interruptions to stevedoring operations. I hope honourable members see the importance of this. The very purpose of the 1954 bill was to do by the coercive processes of law what was done subsequently purely by agreement between the Waterside Workers Federation and the authorities without their proceeding to any new step. The board states in its reportThe agreement was followed by an improvement in the functioning of the recruitment system, as is indicated by tbe fact that at the close of the year under Teview, i.e., on the :!nib June. 1955, the total number of waterfixed a quota, watersi !e side workers registered at ports where quotas were set stood at 20,508, which was only 84(1 below the total of quota figures for these ports. Those were the official figures of the board. The report continuesA t some ports, including Brisbane and New castle, the deficiency was in process of being waterside marie good . . . The response by thevarious branches of the Union following the agreement was generally satisfactory. The Sydney branch, . . . adopted a rule pro viding for fortnightly admissions to keep registrations abreast of the quota figure. It is to be hoped that the practice of continuous recruitment will become universal throughout the union. Tf that is the position; is it not the practical answer to nine-tenths of the arguments about getting more men for the industry? The Waterside Workers Federation made these agreements with the authorities concerned. Yet this Government brings in a measure for the very purpose of getting men to do the work without having to join the union. correct. makes provision for it. for men engaged to join the union. join, they need not do so.

What does Mr Tait think about this matter? The agreement to which I have just referred was made only a little more than twelve months ago. Mr Tait asks, in substance: "" If it is being carried out. what is all the fuss about?"" As I interpret his observations, he takes that view. Is that not a common-sense, practical approach to the problem? Why can the Minister not make such an approach? Why does he want to get this measure through before the committee of inquiry reports about the profits of the stevedoring and shipping companies? Is it because it will be shown that the freights mentioned by him are not due to the activities of the Waterside Workers Federation? As a matter of fact, it is not sufficient to end the comment even there. Our case is that the report should come to the '",59,Suspension Of Standing Ordees

This measure and the Conciliation and Arbitratration Bill 1956 are two of the most comexamine the measure as thoroughly as plicated measures that have heen considered by this House for a generation. Honourable members, and especially those who are experienced in these matters, know that, and consider that they should not be pushed through in this way but should be properly considered. Can it be that the Minister would rush legislation through in this way simply because there may be a change in another House after the 30th June next? One cannot resist that inference. The Minister has hurried the committee and ordered, "" Give me a report within a fortnight"". It is shocking that such a demand should be made. The Tait report shows the effects of it. T. beg honourable members to read the whole report. I do not think the Minister's demand is justified. In his second reading speech, he skated over a lot of these things by saying that the bill goes along with the Tait report. Does he say now .that the provisions of this measure are in accordance with the recommendations made by the Tait committee? say that, in view of my quotations from the report? He is being reckless, and be should not have said it. I ask the House to study the recommendations of the report and to contrast them with the provisions of the bill. I ask honourable members also to consider the livelihood of the men concerned and the importance of tbe great industries involved. The Minister should not at this time join the forces arraigned against labour in this country. Turbulent though the industry is, he shouud see that the employees receive the same justice as is given Labour Government. Sub-clause (1.) of to the stevedoring companies. Above all, let us have a full report about the other relevant matters such as profits, which have been arbitrarily excluded from the present report, and which are now under consideration by the Tait committee. I apologize to the House for having taken so long. I feel very deeply over this subject. I have spent every day since the bill, was introduced trying to ascertain its precise meaning, and examining all the relevant documents I could find. I know it is almost impossible for many honourable members to they would wish to do, because of the many other matters to which they must attend. I have discharged this task to the very best of my ability. I consider that the bill is very bad and that it discriminates against trade unionism. The Minister himself may not be responsible for the attack on the trade unions, but the Government of which he is a Minister is controlled by the dark forces represented by the interstate and overseas shipping combines. for Supply) [9-27] I cannot guarantee to take as long, as the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) took. One and a half hours of the right honourable gentleman is difficult for the human frame to withstand. I cannot guarantee to take as long as he took, but I guarantee to compare more than favourably with him for accuracy. If I may begin by nailing one falsehood that he uttered, among others, I would refer to his statement early in his very long speech in relation to clause 54 of the bill. The right honourable gentleman denounced that clause, under which the proposed Australian stevedoring industry authority may require a person to supply information. He stated that that is a wicked provision and that there is nothing like it in any other legislation. Indeed, I noted the right honourable gentleman's words, which were, "" I know of no other such legislation"". Yet, clause 54, with the exception of the substitution of the word "" Authority "" for the word "" Board"" is identical, almost word for word, with section 53 of the Stevedoring Industry Act 1949, which was introduced by the clause 54 providesThe Authority may require a person(a) to furnish to the Authority such information as the Authority requires, in such form as the Authority requires; and (6) to attend to give evidence before the Authority, or before such other person as the Authority directs, with respect to any matter to which this Act applies and may require that person to produce all hooks, documents, papers and things whatever in his custody or control relating to any such matter.",61,Suspension Of Standing Ordees

And so on. I do not know whether the House requires any more of this comparison. The provision in this bill is comparable, word for word, with that of the 1949 act. Yet the Leader of the Opposition has the temerity and the gall to denounce clause 54 and to say, "" 1 know of no other such legislation "" ! He said that he had clone his best to tell the House what was the true position. If that is his best, it is a pretty poor best. [ know that the right honourable gentleman is too well informed and too intelligent a person to miss a point such as I have mentioned. SoI say that he has engaged in deliberate distortion with respect to clause 54 of the bill which can be matched again and again in other .allegations he has made. never heard from the lips of a gentleman eminence a speech which so distorted the true 'facts a.nd was so misleading to this House. The Leader of the Opposition f u l minated against the provision of supplementary labour. He would have led honourable members to suppose, had not the Minister interjected and forced him to correct himself, that the provisions concerning supplementary labour were designed to prevent those who were called in on holidays and in the evenings as supplementary labour from being able to join the union. But two clauses of the bill are very relevant to this matter. First, there is clause 43 (2.) , which provides(2.) A person registered as a waterside worker at a port by virtue of sub-section (2.) of section thirty of this Act, or a person whose name appears in a record maintained at a port by the Authority under sub-section {4.) of section forty of this Act, may, notwithstanding anything contained in the rules of the Union in relation to the port, be admitted to the membership of tlie Union for the period of his registration or for the period during which his name so appears, as the case may be. Turning back to clause 40 (4.) of the bill, I find that it is providedThe Authority may, at any port, establish and maintain a record of persons who artprepared to accept employment as watersideworkers at the port under this section. Those are the people referred to in the first-mentioned sub-clause of clause 43 who may make application to join the union. If they wish to join the union and there is a vacancy for them and there is work for them, why should they not j o in the union? Why should anybody object to their joining the union because, once they do join the union, they become normal waterside workers to whom these supplementary labour provisions do not apply? So what in j u r y is there to the regular waterside workers in a provision of that sort? In the early part of the speech of the Leader of the Opposition we were also misled as to the true facts of the so-called provision about boycott in clause 44, against which the right honourable gentleI have man fulminated. It is, in fact, the commonest provision in legislation of this of his experience and sort, and appears in a dozen different statutes. It is the provision under which an offence is created and then a defence is provided-the defence of ""reasonable cause "". As to that defence, the normal provision concerning establishing reasonable cause is that tbe onus must be on the person alleging reasonable cause. There is nothing magic or tyrannical about that. If the honourable gentleman suggests that that is an anomalous, unf a i r and unusual piece of legislation, be is not truthful, because he knows f u l l well that it has been placed in dozens and dozens of pieces of Commonwealth legislation, and State legislation, too, for that matter. There is a more important matter to which attention should be directed. For exactly one hour the Leader of the Opposition went on his way with an historical review of all the injuries and wrongs of the waterside workers, way back to the l<S90's. Nobody denies that theirs was a struggle for rights, if you like, and later on for privileges-whateve r side of the fence you are on, and according to the way in which you look at it . This was the usual, normal, continuing, struggle for increasing rights by workers. With the extension and development of ioeial conscience in the community, those rights have been granted more and more by governments of all political complexions. Nobody denies that, and nobody will say that there were not tyrannies and injustices in the past. are-bu t not in this bill. On the contrary, this bill represents an attempt to bring some order, peace and fairness into Opposition say that the report is not imthe stevedoring industry. But for exactly partial? Indeed he did, at the opening one hour the right honourable gentleman of his speech, because he said that thi went on in this way, with an historical legislation which follows the recommen -mrvey of what Mr Justice Foster said, dation of the Tait committee was partial suggesting, for instance, that there should and discriminatory.

The House will remember that when the Chifley Government was in power it enacted the Stevedoring Industry Act of 1947, which it called a bold legislative experiment. Under that 1947 legislation Mr Healy and Mr Roach were appointed members of the Stevedoring Industry Commission of the day, yet within two years the government of the day was compelled to admit that its so-called bold legislative experiment had become a howling failure because of Mr Healy. The mouthpiece of the government in that admission was the former honourable member for Corio, Mr Dedman, who moved the second reading of the 1949 bill. Mr Healy and Mr Roach had been members of the Stevedoring Industry Commission, and after two years' experience of their activities Mr Dedman had this to sayThe representatives of the Waterside interjecting, Workers Federation on the commission indicated in a clear and unmistakable manner that tlie round-table method could not succeed so long as they were members of the Commission. Mr Healy and Mr Roach, the federation's representatives, on two different occasions, incited waterside workers to strike against their own Commission's orders. The strikes had nothing whatever to do with conditions of employment of waterside workers, but followed court proceedings against Sharkey and Phillips, neither of whom had any connection with this industry. As a result of those incitements, stoppages occurred in various ports, and a state of'affairs was brought about which neither the chairman of the Commission nor the Government could tolerate. . . . The Government had no alternative but to dissolve the Stevedoring Industry Commission. Those were the admissions made by Mr Dedman in 1949, after two years' experience of Mr Healy's activities on the commission that was then in existence.

Surely it is one thing only, the running sore that is draining our economic strength, in the form of slow turn-round of ships.

We have rather modified the provisions and made them more favorable to the Waterside Workers Federation. We have very largely followed the previous disciplinary provisions, but the Labour party wants, not discipline over the waterside workers, but discipline over the employers only. Opposition members our bill, the employers can be fined but the unions cannot. as is the case with the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill,.want this bill to be onesided. That is impossible. In an industry like this there must be some form of order and discipline. We have appointed this separate and independent, authority for that purpose. We do not pretend, any more than we did when we introduced the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, that this legislation will be the last of its type. The subject with which it deals is one which is constantly developing. What we have tried to do is establish a new type of tribunalindependent and fair minded. We intend, and hope, that it will be temperate. We hope that, by this means, one step will be taken towards the achievement of peace on the waterfront-to enable management to earn its way, to enable labour to earn its way and, gradually, to enable Australia to benefit economically as a result. Members of the Government have often twitted Opposition members with advocating class warfare. If ever there were an instrument of class warfare, it is the legislation now before this Parliament. It is so vicious that I wonder at the motive of the Government in introducing it. Surely the Government does not expect that any responsible trade union in this country will be persuaded to accept legislation of this type. I believe that the Government is deliberately playing for a head-on collision with the trade union movement. No other motive could justify its action-if the word "" justify "" is appropriate-in introducing legislat i o n of this kind. The Minister has given the bill the wrong title. It should have been called the "" Shipowners B ill "" . It could not have been more favorable towards the shipowners if Mr ILaddy himself had prepared it. The bill provides for the control, of waterside workers only. I defy any Government supporter to show me one provision in it under which there is to be control of the stevedoring operainterjecting, tors or the shipping interests. Why have we before us an interim report? Was there any suggestion, in either the legislation to establish this committee of Labour supporters, inquiry or the speech of the Minister upon it, to suggest that we would be given an interim report ? . Of course, there was not. How can there be a satisfactory conclusion to the committee's work if it produces only an interim report on two items instead of the six that were referred to it? There is no doubt in the world that if the truth were divulged it would be seen that the shipowners had demanded of this Government. -thei r Government-that it produce this legislation now. What is to happen to the Waterside Workers Federation if the industrial and political Labour movement of this country accepts this legislation? Instead of a militant organization standing up for the rights of its members, it will become what the late Mr Ben Chifley warned us about just before his deatha "" tame cat union "". That is what this Government is trying to make out of the Waterside Workers Federation. I am sure that, because of the efforts of the trade union movement and the political Labour party, the Government will fail. Its intentions will be plain to every one. If ever we have had a fascist authority it will be that which is to control the stevedoring industry under this bill. There is nothing that it will not be able to do. I ask the Minister whether, in speaking to another measure, he described arbitration as a "" shield for the workers "". Under this bill the Authority will be given the power even to get around an award. Merely by conferring with the proposed arbitration commission it will be able to force new provisions into an award without first giving the matter proper consideration or investigation.",66,Suspension Of Standing Ordees

They decided that their force the Waterside Workers Federation records, if placed before the committee, to take into its ranks any person whom When witnesses are being when trade union representatives are present, they refer to the stevedoring Let me pass to tbe question of striken The Minister said that this was a turbulent industry. In view of what thp Minister for Supply( Mr Beale) haiAccording to the Minister, the Waterthe authority determines shall be admitted. So the union will lose control over the admission of members. Therefore, no matter what kind of men the employers or the Government will want to be admitted to the Waterside Workers Federation, when this legislation becomes effective the federation will have no power to prevent the entry of ihose men to its ranks. The Minister for -the Army( Mr Cramer) asks, ""Why should it ? "" Not so very long ago, the honourable gentleman and his colleagues were protesting about what they termed compulsory unionism, but now, because it j uits them to do so, in order to destroy the effectiveness of the Waterside Workers Federation, they want any individual recruited by the authority to become a fully fledged member of the federation. I ask the Minister for Labour and National Service whether it is the intention of the Government that these part-time waterside workers who are to be admitted to membership for periods of six months or less-thes e people who are to be forced upon the union-ar e to have full voting rights in the organization. There is no doubt that the Government, by flooding the ranks of the federation -with part-time members, intends to try TO destroy its effectiveness. Let us have a look at the position on the waterfront at the moment. It is intended that the authority shall fix iiuotas. Everybody knows that there is not full employment on the Australian waterfront to-day. In the port of Sydney, during the last week, 1,800 to 2,000 men, on an average, have been unemployed each day. Is there anything in the legislation, or is there any undertaking by the Minister, to suggest that the quota for the port of Sydney will be kept even at its present level? 1 understand that the quota is 6,500 men. No doubt the shipowners, who have been urging a reduction of the quota, will a3k tlie new authority-the new authority will be their authority, representing them -to reduce the figure to 5,000. The authority will be able to do that by the use of supplementary labour. It is going to depend upon the people who will -register for week-end work or for night work-the people who will be the strikebreakers, the people who will be put there to make sure that the waterside workers by economic pressure are compelled to obey the rulings and the dictates of the authority. The Minister for Supply said that the Government had followed the recommendations of the Tait committee in drafting this legislation. But the Tail committee reported against the use of supplementary labour. On page 11 of its report it statedTlie evidence on behalf of the Board is that, in general, the use of supplementary labour is unsatisfactory. This is based to a large extent on the Board's experience of the few occasion* when the Board has attempted to use supple ineutary labour in some of the main ports Some of the objections referred to in evidence are the difficulty of obtaining it when required, its inexperience and lack of discipline. The Waterside Workers Federation, naturally, is opposed to the use of such labour. When Mr Haddy was giving evidence for the shipowners before the Tait committee, he was asked from where the supplementary labour was to be obtained. He replied, "" Well, there are the newsboys and the men who work the turnstiles at the various sporting arenas "". That is the type of labour that Mr Haddy suggested would be recruited to do the most arduous toil possible on the waterfront. Further, the Government proposes to give this authority the right to alter the rules of the Waterside Workers Federation. The authority will be able to demand that the rules of the federation be altered so that its orders can he complied with. Let us take, for example, overtime on the waterfront. It is interesting to note that many of the matters upon which the Government is passing judgment in this legislation are matters which at present are before the arbitration authority. They are contained in the log of claims submitted by the employers-the shipowners. This Government, which claims to believe in arbitration, has taken those matters out of the hands of the arbitration authority and, by legislation, proposes to give effect to all that the shipowners have asked in the log of claims that they have submitted to the court. The court has already rejected an application to extend the eleven-hour shift. According to my Teading and interpretation of the legislation, the authority will whether the adoption of the principle have power to lengthen the working dayto extend overtime-withou t reference to the court. ""Why should not the union oppose the extension of overtime? From what has been said, anybody would imagine that the waterside workers are employed full-time, but, on an average, only 31 hours are worked each week by waterside workers in Australian ports. Of that period, approximately one-third represents overtime. In New Zealand, however, the average working week for a waterside worker is 40 hours. So we see that, by proper regulation of work by the stevedoring operators themselves, overtime can be largely eliminated and employment at regular hours provided for the men. In New Zealand the ports are compelled to cease operations at 10 p.m. from Mondays to Fridays, and at 5 p.m. on Saturdays. There is no work on Sundays. In Australia, because of the lack of proper regulation of employment on the waterfront, waterside workers are required to be available for work 24 hours a day on every day of the year. The Tait committee dealt with the question of transfer. This authority will have power to order transfers, without reference to an arbitration tribunal. The Tait committeeI criticize it for this, despite what has been said about its impartiality-recommende d that transfers from one job to another and from one employer to another be permitted. The union had certain objections to the adoption of that principle, but, because it had been operating in Adelaide and Brisbane, the committee said that it ought to operate in every port in Australia, although conditions vary from port to port. So we see that the committee did not make a realistic approach to that matter. Let me turn to the question of the press extraordinary position operates at present that and radio pick-up which the shipowners for so very long have wanted to be adopted generally in Australia. It has been said that the waterside workers are afraid that tlie adoption of that principle would mean tbe elimination of attendance money. I refer honourable gentlemen opposite to what Mr Haddy had to say about this matter.'When he was giving evidence to the committee he was asked, directly, generally in Australia would mean that the shipowners' attitude to' the payment of attendance money would change. Mr Haddy said he believed that if there were no obligation for the waterside workers to report, there ought to be no obligation to pay them attendance money. That is the attitude of the shipowners. It is useless for the Government to say it does not believe that the shipowners would cease to pay attendance money, because, when this legislation has been passed, the authority will do whatever the shipowners desire. Let me pass to one or two other matters which I regard as of great importance. What is the Government doing in this legislation to ensure efficient stevedoring operations on the waterfront? The union has been trying for many years to have adopted changes which would mean more efficient working and operation in the discharge and loading of vessels, but the report makes only passing reference to the matter of rain and interference with operations on the waterfront. Yet this is a very substantial factor in bringing about a slow turn-round of shipping. If the Government, the committee and the shipowners were particularly anxious to speed the turn-round of ships, they would do something to overcome the difficulty associated with cessation of activities when rain occurs during the course of employment of waterside workers. According to the records, 4^ per cent, of working time, that is, paid labour time, is lost because of the occurrence of rain. The committee merely directed the attention of stevedoring operators to this important matter, and in doing so it made a most strange pronouncement. The committee said, Associated with the problem of ceasing work during rain is that of covering hatches. The the foremen have to anticipate whether it is going to rain or not, and if they consider it is, call on the men to cover the hatches before rain commences because otherwise the men would cease work and leave the hatches uncovered OB soon as rain commenced. That is what the committee had to say, but in actual fact the Sydney branch of the Waterside Workers Federation has entered into an arrangement whereby the men are prepared to cover hatches, and have covered hatches after rain commenced in instances where the stevedore or shipowner has provided suitable protective clothing. Let me now .refer to what are called restrictive practices. The Minister made reference to the subject of sling loads, and he applauded Mr Justice Ashburner, who said that these restrictive provisions were imposed merely at the whim of the waterside workers, without any uniformity as between ports. The waterside workers asked the court -to determine the sling loads for the various ports, but instead of Mr Justice Ashburner so deciding, he rejected the union's application, and it is now possible for the shipowners themselves to determine virtually by their own action the sling load to be applicable at a particular port. The committee stated that there had been go-slow activities, that workers had extended their smoko period and that they had been spelling unnecessarily. The federation has admitted that in certain The statutory authority is to be restricted circumstances there has been laxity on the to directing attention to the matter of waterfront throughout Australia, but who those responsible for this wastage in manis responsible for the laxity? It is not power. That is all that the Government the Waterside Workers Federation. In proposes to do about it. Let me give one any great organization, where there is or two illustrations of the tremendous lax supervision and lax control by the powers over the workers which are conoperator, it is possible that such things tained in this legislation. No provision do occur, but the Waterside Workers is made for any consultation with the Federation has always set its face trade unions. If one looks through the against such practices and has established bill, one finds that the authority is given its own system for disciplining its mempower to confer with anybody associbers when they defy its authority. Let ated with the industry of whom it me make one or two references to the approves, but not particularly the officials damaging provisions of this legislation. of the union; they can be completely The Government and the Arbitration disregarded. As a matter of fact, if the Court cannot be regarded as free from authority does not wish to confer at all responsibility for the long delay which with the union, it may refrain from doing has occurred in respect of the inquiry so, because clause 55 of the bill provideswhich I have mentioned. The committee goes on to deal with the subject of disrelation cipline, and disregards entirely what the or done by the Authority, required to confederation has itself done to penalize sult with any representative, association. members for being late in reporting for Union, branch of a Union or any other person, work, for being drunk on the job and for body being abusive. All such matters ar« consulting, that failure does not invalidate thedealt with by tbe federation. The comact or tiling performed or done. mittee and the Minister said something about the time lost waiting for cargo and That means that the authority need not the congestion which occurs continually confer with any representative of the on the wharfs because cargo is not taken union at all. Let me give only one other expeditiously to its destination. The illustration, because time will not permit legislation does not contain provision to compel a stevedoring operator to do anything about this problem. The legislation provides in this regard only that the authority shallinvestigate means of improving, and . . . encourage employers to introduce methods and practices that will improve the expedition, safety and efficiency with which stevedoring operations are performed. Why is the authority not vested with power to direct stevedoring operators to do something about the changes that are -necessary on the waterfront to eliminate this great waste of labour, that is adding to the slow turn-round of shipping? The committee reportedA substantial item was the time lost wait ing for cargo to arrive at tlie wharfs and, at times, congestion of cargo on the wharfs. . . In the view of tlie committee these are matters for the attention of the management, and in the report we do no mure than record the fact that there has been a considerable loss of efficiency in stevedoring operations by reason of these matters. Where, under this Act, the Authority is, in to any act or tiling to be performed or authority, and the Authority performs or does that act or thing without so me to give any more, of the great power of the proposed authority. Mention has been made in the Minister's speech of attendance money, and we assume that he knows something about it. Later, h<> said that if an offence is committed by a section of waterside workers in a port,, maybe in operating one vessel, the .authority may immediately cancel the payment of attendance money for every waterside worker at that port, although -i>nly .a minority may be involved in the particular dispute, and if the union -desires that' the payment of attendance money be restored, it must make application and the authority may, at its discretion, restore the payment of attendance -money, not from the date when it was discontinued, but from the date when -application was made for its restoration. This is the sort of legislation which the -Government wishes these men to accept. Let me say finally to the Government: t.he Waterside Workers Federation is a powerful trade union, but it does not. -<tand alone in this particular fight because period of investigation into the industry T feel certain that the trade unions -generally will, realize that all that is happening at the moment is that the Waterside Workers Federation has been --.selected for the immediate attention of this Government, but if the Government -succeeds in creating a tame-cat union where a militant organization exists on the waterfront to-day it will turn its -attention to other trade unions in the country. That is why the Australian Labour party rejects this legislation. We -<ay that it is totalitarian in character. We believe that it is designed to smash the trade union movement, to destroy -the effectiveness of trade unionism, and the Australian Labour party politically -stands with the trade union movement in rejecting it. If the Government desires -a head-on collision, not with one industrial union but with the industrial movement generally backed and supported by the political Labour movement;-if that is the type of conflict it desires-the Opposition will welcome it. I rise to support the bill, which has been introduced, after much thought, as a constructive and reasonable set of proposals for improving the efficiency of the waterfront industry. 1 think we should all realize the tremendous importance of this industry to Australia. I have spoken in this House on many occasions about the importance of increasing our overseas trade, but that objective cannot oe achieved while waterfront costs remain at their present high level. Every effort must be made to achieve a greater degree of efficiency. As the Minister for Supply (Air. Beale) has already stated, Australia, as an island continent, depend more than does any other country on efficient shipping operations between the various capital cities. Therefore, wat°rfrout costs occupy a key position in on: cost structure. As I have indicated, this bill has been designed to increase efficiency on the waterfront. As the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Holt) indicated in his second-reading speech, the bill has not been introduced hastily or without dU"" consideration. There has been a lona dating back to the Basten report of 1952. Legislation was introduced in 1954, and later, at the request of the Au.* tralian Council of Trades Unions, a com mittee presided over by Mr Tait wa appointed. That committee has worked solidly for twelve months, and has pro duced a. unanimous interim report. Mem bers of the committee included nominee -of the shipowners and the Australian Council of Trades Unions. The bill now before the House is based to a great degree on the report of the committee. It has the support, therefore, of the committee and, by implication, of the Australian Council of Trades Unions. In principle, it also has the support of the shipowners, and I am certain that it should be supported by the mass of righi thinking people in this country. The bill also, as the Minister has stated, represents an important step towards the provision of permanent employment, and in that respect is in line with the report oi Mr Basten. The Minister has also stated that, during the inquiries of the Tan committee, the shipowners have learned a number of lessons and that they artworking together with a view to providing, in due course, a scheme for permanent employment on the waterfront.",67,Suspension Of Standing Ordees
230,Mr Howson (Fawkner) [10.20],"Until such a scheme is formulated, we shall uot have on the waterfront that intimate employer-employee relationship which is the basis of friendly operations in any industry. In spite of what Opposition members have said to-night, the powers of control that have been exercised by the Australian Stevedoring Industry Board in the past have been reduced, and a greater onus has been thrown onto the employers TO perform their duties and to increase their efficiency. An opportunity is provided, therefore, to shipowners and stevedoring ' -ompanies to shoulder the obligations and responsibilities that fall upon them. We have heard a lot of criticism from Opposition members to-night, but so far they have not dealt with any of the constructive bill discriminates against the trade unions. proposals that are contained in the bill. All that Opposition speakers have done <o far has been to read, in certain detail, submitting a unanimous report dealing the brief that was prepared for them, by Mr Healy, tbe secretary of the Waterside Workers Federation, an avowed Communist and a member of the executive of the Communist party. I have before me a report, signed by Jim Healy, which was circulated to every member '>f the federal parliamentary Labour party. In it are passages that have been quoted verbatim by both the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) and the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr great extent by members of the Opposition Ward). So it will be noted that without vloubt Opposition members have been told what to do by that avowed Communist. Mr Healy. We have also listened to threats of strikes in the near future if the legislation is implemented. How much longer is a body of people dominated by a handful of Communists to hold the people of Australia up to ransom ? Let us contrast the views of the Australian Council of Trades Unions as impressed by Mr Shortell, one of the members of the Tait committee, with the views that have been expressed to-night by leading members of the Australian Labour party. Each member of the committee subscribed to the report, and I feel certain that the large majority of moderate trade unionists will agree with its findings. The Leader of the Opposition stated that the committee's report did not furnish sufficient evidence on which to base such a measure as the one now before the .House. I point out that the committee set out a list of matters with which it would deal in its report, and that every person who gave evidence was given an opportunity to state a case on those issues. Surely we can assume, therefore, that all the evidence that was needed was furnished, and that the committee had every reason to submit a report on those matters. A properly constituted committee would uot submit, a unanimous report unless each member of it was satisfied that he had heard sufficien evidence on the matters in question. It has been stated that, to a degree, the Again, surely, we have evidence that an impartially constituted committee was. with each of the matters that had been brought forward. No one on either side of the House wants to return to the con ditions that existed on the waterfront in 1939, and this bill is designed to improvt employer-employee relations and to throw the obligations and responsibilities on t<> those people whose duty it is to bear them. I turn now to the parts of the bill which have not yet been touched to any to-night. The first point is the setting up of the statutory authority. The chief powers of that authority are the recruiting of waterfront labour if the Waterside Workers Federation is unable or unwilling to do so, the registering of waterside workers, and their allocation to definite tasks. The powers of the authority are limited and defined. There will be a commission, part of the conciliation and arbitration commission, whose powers also are defined to a great extent. Now there will be. as there has not been in the past, a clear definition of the powers and responsibilities of these two bodies. No longer should there be the opportunities for passing the buck between one and the other that have occurred in the past, and the period that has been taken to deal with industrial disputes should be shortened. That is one of the chief ways of reducing the waste of time that has occurred on the waterfront during the past few years on industrial disputes. The second point that needs detailed consideration is the recruitment of shortterm labour in ports such as Hobart during the fruit season and in Queensland ports during the sugar season, and the provision for supplementary labour during times of peaks and flushes. The bill makes perfectly clear that supplementary labour is needed only at a time when an emergency exists. It is not to be used permanently throughout the industry. Already in certain details it bas had the support of various sections of the Australian Council of Trades Unions. Everybody is anxious to see a greater degree of rationalization and efficiency in the handling of peak demands and surely every effort should be made to make this supplementary labour scheme work. The honourable member for East Sydney referred to this scheme and stated that the Tait Committee had found against such supplementary labour in regard to its efficiency. He read only the first part of section 33 of the Tait report. the Waterside Workers Federation would He did not read a later passage where it is stated that it would be efficient so long as certain safeguards were provided. Those very safeguards have been placed in the bill, so that supplementary labour which has not worked for various reasons in the past will now be able to be made to work in the future. The proper safeguards that are necessary have been incorporated in the bill. As I see it, here is a means of providing permanent employment for members of the Waterside Workers Federation who are normally employed throughout the year on stevedoring operation, with a supplementary labour force to deal with peaks and flushes in times of emergency. This is one way of taking another step towards the eventual aim of permanent employment, which surely is desired by the majority of workers in this industry and also by a majority of employers. The next matter that has been dealt towards making the most use of the with is transfers. Again, this was relabour available on the waterfront. ferred to by the honourable member for Opposition members have not given East Sydney who stated that this scheme thought to, or discussed the constructive had been found to be efficient only in measures in this bill, yet these are the Brisbane and Adelaide and would not things that are designed to get at the work in any other port in the Commonvery root of the problem of increasing wealth. I refer him'to section 41 on page 12 of the Tait report, which statesThe Committee finds that a use of such transfers generally would contribute to the efficiency of stevedoring operations. Surely there is every indication that everything possible should bo done to encourage this system of transfers, which has proved so desirable in Adelaide and Brisbane and which, if properly safeguarded and carried out in the terms of the bill, will achieve a substantial improvement in efficiency in many other ports of the Commonwealth. The next matter is the question of press and radio pick-ups, which was referred to by the Leader of the Opposition. AllI can say, first of all, is that this system has worked with tremendous efficiency in Melbourne and Newcastle and that the great majority of waterfront workers in Melbourne desire to sec it continued. As an example of that, I challenge any member of the Opposition to state that it is not so desired. Opposition members know perfectly well that office-bearers of lose their jobs at the next election if they removed the press and radio pick-up system from the Melbourne waterfront. Not one person is prepared to answer me on that one. honourable member is listening for once to the ruling of Mr Deputy Speaker. The press and radio pick-up system is desired by the great majority of those people who have operated under such a system, and it should receive the wholehearted support of the great majority of waterside workers when it is extended to other ports of the Commonwealth. There has been no reference by members of the Opposition to the terms of the bill dealing with short gangs for beams and lialches and for the rotation of hatches. They are generally constructive efforts",72,Suspension Of Standing Ordees

So, we reach the third phase ing a log of claims, the matter would come of the industrial dispute. Wheni t gets before the commission.

Tremendous confusion could arise out because it w ill allow for the division of authority in award making. If the president so Let me outline a particular case that I binding in respect of the whole of this I believe that is the sort of thing that w ill happen as a result of the application Indeed, I believe that this arbitration as it has been developed in Australia over the years. The machinery will finally divide awards into sections, and I am intensely opposed to the centralization of authority in regard to margins or any other parts of awards that are of importance to the workers. I say that particularly in view of the fact that since the Metal Trades case there is a tendency on the part of the court to put margins apart in a pocket, and regard the metal trades decision as a principle to be followed by the court in determining margins, whereas the real basis of determination should be skill and responsibility. I should like to know what the conciliator will do. What will be his powers, under sub-section (3.) of proposed section 16P, in relation to subsection (6.) of proposed 16T? How far does the Minister think we can tolerate, in award-making, a situation in which a reference is made through this series of steps, and in which portion of a dispute can be held back, while part is referred back to the commissioner by the proposed Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, and then an attempt made finally to bring the two parts together ? The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ( Mr Bowden) -Order! The honourable member's time has expired. ter for Labour and National Service and Minister for Immigration) [11.1] I feel that the honourable member for Blaxland( Mr E. James Harrison) has created all sorts of hypothetical difficulties which he thinks may develop in. this jurisdiction. Of course, if we assume that we are dealing with completely unreasonable men, we can get quite unreasonable results. But I think we can rely upon the good sense of the men who will be appointed to the proposed Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission to see to it that these things work out quite satisfactorily in practice. I do not see any inconsistency between the responsibilities thrown upon a conciliator under proposed section 16P, to which the honourable member has referred, and his responsibilities under other provisions. It is true that, under subsection (3.) of proposed section 16P, a conciliator will not furnish a report unless the parties to the industrial dispute consent and agree upon its terms, but surely we must relate that to the preceding sub-sections of the proposed section. I do not find any inconsistency, if that is done, with the role to be given to a conciliator under proposed section 16T, under which the commission may, for the purposes of that proposed section, which relates to the reference process, direct u commissioner or a conciliator to make a report. commission can direct him only in accordance with the function allocated to him under proposed section 16P. That is his only function. His function is clearly defined in that proposed section, but proposed section 16T makes different provision. provided for in proposed section 16P will not by any means be a conciliator's exclusive function. I shall consider the point, but I personally cannot see any inconsistency. Since the honourable gentleman has raised it, I shall discuss it with the draftsman to see how the matter will work out. We can recommit the clause later, if need be. The honourable member has made a general criticism of the system of reference in practice, and I take it that the matter to which I have just referred is a substantial part of the case made by the Opposition against proposed section 16T. I do not intend to labour the discussion on this point. We have included the provision quite deliberately, with our eyes open, as being, at any rate in our view, a useful one. Although it may operate in a cumbersome manner in a particular ease, we believe it should have the effect of short-circuiting some of the processes that have operated in the past. Instead of having a full hearing by a commissioner, and, later, an appeal to the commission, we shall be able to short-circuit the procedure where it is reasonably obvious that the matter is a more important one than should be dealt with by a commissioner, that it raises some industrial principle, or that its influence will extend well beyond the range of the particular industry in which the point arises.

241,Mr Harold Holt,"The functionmight very usefully avoid some of the more protracted hearings and subsequent appeal processes that have arisen in the past. We can judge only by the working of the system whether the experiment proves a success. We believe it is worth H trial, and we present the proposal to the committee for its endorsement. Opposition is opposed to proposed section 16T, and will certainly vote against it. T hoped that tbe Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Harold Holt) would indicate why he considers this system of reference necessary. So far as the Commonwealth arbitration system is concerned, until the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act was amended in 1951, there was no provision in respect of either references or appeals. From 1904 to 1951, the act functioned on the basis that once a decision was made it was effective, and that tbe only appeal against it was on a question of law. But, for some reason or other, the act was amended in 1951 and an appeal system and a system somewhat akin to references were put into operation. I can find no justification for them. I listened very carefully to the Minister's remarks, but he gave no indication of past experience or even probable future events which might justify this system of reference. One must bear in mind that, as the bill is drafted, it provides for, first, a Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission in presidential session, which will deal with hours, wages and long-service leave. These matters, which are the three major matters that affect all industry, will be taken entirely out of the hands of the senior commissioner and the other commissioners, and will be dealt with solely by the commission in what is called presidential session. The relatively minor matters in industry, such as times of starting and finishing work, overtime rates, the number of boys, juniors or apprentices that may be employed, the rates to be paid to men doing a particular class of work, sick pay, and annual leave, all can, and very often do, vary according to the industry concerned. From 1947, until the act was amended I am sure that if the honourable member in 1951, the commissioners, who, in the looks at the report of the speech that be Minister's own words, we assume are permade on Thursday night, he will find that sons of good sense, made decisions, which, so far as I can learn, sometimes failed to satisfy employers and at other times failed to satisfy employees. At the appropriate time, if one side or the other wanted an award altered, it applied for a variation and had the matter re-heard on that application. This system gave satisfaction. It at least settled disputes and gave the parties a decision on the matter about which they were at variance. But it is proposed now that, instead of a commissioner being able to go ahead and make decisions on these minor matters, one party will be able to delay proceedings by the simple process of requesting that a reference be made to the commission. One of the extraordinary features of this measure is the various kinds of members of the commission. There will be, first, the presidential members, who will sit in presidential session. Proposed section 16T will create a new kind of commission which will consist, as provided in sub-section (1.), of not less than three members of the commission, at least one of whom will be a presidential member, and one of whom will be, where practicable, the commissioner concerned with the reference. I shall refer later to a third kind of commission that is to be created. honourable member will agree 'that the provision in sub-section (1.) will be very useful. is a useful arrangement. I think it is a time-wasting arrangement. It causes delay and frustration, and it does not help the parties to get a matter determined quickly. When we were discussing this subject of delay the other night-and I suggest that delays will occur under the proposed procedureI can well remember that the Opposition asked that a conciliation commissioner, as a matter of right, should be brought into every dispute, and my good friend the honourable member for Forrest( Mr Freeth) objected to the proposal on the grounds that it would mean delay.",78,Conciliation And Arbitrationbill 1956

244,Mr Clarey,"No, I do not think ithe was emphatic that there should he no delay in settling disputes and that the sooner a settlement was reached the better. I can understand perfectly well why big matters such.as the basic wage for males and females, hours and long service leave, should be in the hands of a commission of three. The reason is that every industry will ultimately be affected by them. But in relatively minor matters of industry, to require that a case should be referred from one person to another person who may send part of a dispute back to the commissioner himself, would -esult in the making of two awards instead of one. One award would be made by the commission concerning part of the problem and the other by a commissioner, separately from the commission itself. This would result in further confusion in the settlement of a dispute. On top of that, delay would result if the matter went from one person to another. When three people hear a case, a longer period of time elapses before it is decided than when one person hears it. This delay and frustration are not good for industry, and this legislation should not include any provision that will bring about that sort of thing. I suggest that our main objective in regard to this legislation should be to find some uniformity, again in the public out how we can achieve a speedy settlement of disputes between employer and employee. It is not our aim to try to find ways and means whereby the dispute may be kept alive and passed from one hand to another with varying decisions being made, perhaps, and with two judgments being given to the parties instead of one judgment. I suggest that because those factors are contained in this proposed section, it is not desirable to adopt it. The Opposition will certainly vote against the provision because it is not in the best interests of industrial peace. had not intended to intervene in this debate, but I was provoked by the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Clarey). The honourable member referred to my idea that delay should be cut out, as far as possible, in arbitration procedures. I repeat that I am wholly in favour of that principle but, as far as I am aware, nobody has yet mentioned that part of the effect of this proposed section, as I see it, will be to prevent delay in connection with a system of appeals. If a short out can be made in connection with a knotty problem, which concerns a matter of public interest and which will almost certainly be the subject of appeal by one party or the other, then a considerable amount of time could be saved by having it referred directly to a commission of three members. member would be in favour of the omission of appeals from the bill if proposed section 16T were adopted? that argument. I say that this is a short cut in connection with a system of appeals. I realize that, from that statement, the honourable member for Bendigo can draw the inference that I would favour the abolition of appeals. I do not favour that. is in favour of delays? member be fair. I listened to him in silence. There are the two conflicting principles with which I dealt the other night. Provision is made for a system giving interest, which I place very high in regard to the objectives of conciliation and arbitration. Here we have a system of pseudo-law and the parties should know where they stand before they embark on a case before any commissioner. In the absence of a system of appeals and in the absence of the application of some general principles by a commission, there, would be no uniformity. There would be a tendency for the parties to have a shot at something because a conciliation commissioner might give them what they want, and they would hope for the best. I believe that there should be a system of appeals. I believe that that is necessary in the public interest for the prevention of industrial disputes. Having arrived at that conclusion, I support this proposed section which will prevent an undue multiplicity of appeals and enable a short cut to be taken because the commissioners who would normally constitute",79,Conciliation And Arbitrationbill 1956

I know that the Minister has the numbers to force his proposals through the committee, but I put this proposition to h i m : Under proposed subsection (2.) it is only necessary for one of the parties to make a request for the matter to go to the commission. In an interstate award to which there are four or five parties, one party may not be prepared to conciliate and may demand arbitration. conciliator can do nothing but report back to the commissioner. Margins case, a classic example occurred of one party out of four requesting that the case should go back to the court, which would be the equivalent of the commission under this bill. provides that, merely on the "" say-so "" of one of four applicants, the case shall go to the f u l l commission. If the case went there and stopped at that point, that would be bad enough. to go to the commission. MrE .

But as a consequence of his opinion as to what may be in the public interest he w ill decide whether the case should be considered by the commission MrE . JAMES HARRISON -Yes, but let us short-circuit the procedure, and provide that once the president has decided that there is an ingredient of public interest in the award, the whole award must be dealt with by the commission. If we do not insert such a condition as this, when a case concerning an interstate award to which there arc three or four parties is being heard, the argument w ill be put forward which the employers have put forward in almost every hearing in which I have been concerned over a long period of years, and that is that, in making an award, margins must be considered at the same time as conditions. I put it to the Minister, that this division of power w ill create untold difficulties because, if .the presidential commission is going to take unto itself, as I believe it w ill , the right to determine margins on a national basis, as in the metal trades award, it w ill mean that we w ill have a division of award making as between margins and conditions. If the Minister himself, and those advising him, had had any experience at all of awards making in difficult situations, they would Then, under this bill, a understand that there could not be a more difficult set of conditions than w ill obtain In the as a result of this division of power.

253,Mr Harol Dholt,"O r not.and. that it wants to tie down the trade union movement to one common standard in respect of margins, without regard to skill and degree of responsibility. The bill provides for the adoption of a common rule by the commission in respect of margins, and no union will be able to get past it if the president holds that, because there is a margins ingredient in the case, it has a public interest content. If the Minister allows this clause to stand, he will live to realize the truth of what I have been telling him. think it is becoming apparent that, in relation to appeals from the decisions of the commissioner, the Government's attitude is that it wants to see a pattern for the division of authority applied from the top, and imposed throughout the system. Here, again, the term ""public interest"" occurs. authority applied from the top within the arbitration system is, in respect of this clause, to depend upon public interest. Several times in the history of arbitration, the Parliament has imposed upon the court, or a section of the court, the duty of deciding the meaning of particular words in the act. One of those cases was a very early one, in which Mr Justice Higgins was asked to determine the meaning of the term "" fair and reasonable"". In giving his decision in connection with the Harvester award, he pointed out that it was not fair and reasonable to impose upon the court the duty of deciding the meaning of terms used in the act. The phrase "" public interest"" has occurred several times this evening, and it occurs in this clause. As so much might turn on the meaning of the phrase in an application before the court, the Government should consider including in the legislation a guide as to what should be taken into consideration by the commission or by the court when it is endeavouring to determine the question of public interest. has followed the course that was adopted by tlie Labour government. Ministers ceased to make that kind of answer. barrassing one.. effect, that the Government is doing what Labour did when it was in office. Perhaps the Labour government did make mistakes from time to time, but honourable members on this side have been a good deal more ready to admit those mistakes than is the Government to admit its shortcomings. It is not sufficient for the Minister, in answer to a reasonable question, simply to toss over the table the retort, ""We are doing the same as you did"". I think it is about time that the words "" public interest"" were given a definite meaning, so that the court can be guided in this critical matter by the Parliament, which is responsible to the people. I again urge the Minister to consider this matter, and to make clear This division of in the bill the intention of the Parliament.

This commission shall have not less than three members, of whom at least two must be presidential members of the commission. In this measure, so f a r as we have dealt w i th it , it is proposed to create three different kinds of commissions, all of which apparently are to have different functions. If that does not bring the whole matter of the commission into absurdity, I should like to know what would. It is obvious that when the second kind of commission, envisaged by proposed section 16T, is sitting, there can be no sitting of the Commission in Presidential Session. Likewise, when the appeals commission is constituted, neither tlie first nor the second kind of commission can sit. It seems to me to be difficult to explain why it is necessary to establish this kind of commission to deal w i th minor matters that may be the subject of appeal. I suggest that with legislation of this kind the Government is bringing the whole matter of federal conciliation and arbitration into disrepute. Proposed section 16T provides that the commission may refer back to a commissioner a certain section of an industrial dispute. Under the proposed section now before the committee it w ill be possible for the award then made by the commissioner to be the subject of appeal to the appeals' commission.

261,Mr Clarey (Bendigo) [11.35],"Until 1951 there was no provision for an appeal in the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act. The arbitration machinery worked very satisfactorily in thuse days. Since provision has been maciij for appeals, employers and employees have lodged them. A number of those lodged by the employers have been upheld, but on every occasion when a unon has sought to lodge an appeal, either leave to appeal has been refused or the appeal itself has been rejected. ""When the decisions of the court are found to favour the employers so overwhelmingly, it is obvious that the employees can have no faith in the court or in the legislation. We have recently had some debate in this place on the question of providing permanent employment for those persons now engaged in industry in a casual capacity. I shall repeat to the committee some remarks that I made during the second-reading stage of this bill, concernvisions in our arbitration legislation. ing a union that had tried for years to change a system under which hundreds of men and women had to hang around the doors of canning factories during the fruit ascertain them because we indicated them season in the hope of obtaining a few hours' work, for which they were paid by the hour. Finally, after a good deal of struggling, we were successful in having the weekly wage introduced. Eventually, we got rid of the obnoxious spectacle of men and women hanging around factory doors day after day, morning and afternoon, seeking a few hours' work. Then, a newly appointed commissioner who had very little experience in industry introduced a provision for casual work to be done at a low rate of pay giving an inducement to enable certain types of operaon principle. tions to be carried out in fruit-preserving factories on hourly labour. Both the employers and the employees objected to it and the union appealed. Although one of the grounds of appeal was that it was desirable that permanent rather than, casual work should obtain in industry, the judge before whom the application was made refused the union the right to appeal. When we see that type of thing happening, we ask what useful purpose these appeal provisions serve in industry. The right of appeal serves no real purpose. It was going to do to the trade union movemerely causes delay both in the hearing of cases and in the giving of decisions, with consequent promotion of a feeling of frustration and discontent among the workers in industry. I say quite candidly to the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Harold Holt) that this type of legislation damages the whole system of conciliation and arbitration. It causes resentment in industry and can only result in embittering industrial relations. A provision such as this can convert a measure designed to bring about industrial peace into one calculated to create greater unrest in industry. The Opposition is not prepared to have anything to do with this clause, and we shall vote against it. ter for Labour and National Service and Minister for Immigration) [11.43] I do not propose to enter into any lengthy discussion of the basis for the appeal proThose honourable members who care to take the time to study the views of the Government on this matter can readily in detail when the appeals system was first introduced. I find it a little hard to be persuaded that honourable members opposite sincerely object to the appeal system, because I recall that although it was attacked in no less vehement terms by honourable members opposite when we introduced it in or about 1951, it was first made use of by the Labour Government, of Queensland. That being so, I cannot be convinced that honourable members opposite have any deep-seated objection to it. that the trade union movement has a very strong objection to it. able member for Bendigo( Mr Clarey) has not always faithfully represented, although he may have intended to do so, the thinking of the trade union movement, about industrial legislation brought down by this Government.

264,Mr Harold Holt,"The honorcreation of the "" tame cat"" unions aboui which we have heard to-night. In point of fact, the trade union movement generally welcomed the provisions we inserted then and has made very extensive use of them. I suggest that, again, we are demonstrating in this legislation that we artmore in touch at least with the rank and file trade union opinion if not with some of the official opinion of the movement than are some honourable members opposite who claim to be the spokesmen for it. We believe that this will be a practical matters justice delayed means suffering system provided the parties come to it in a spirit of goodwill and work together. The appeal phase is an important onu because nothing is more creative of industrial trouble than differing decisions on virtually the same issues in various parts of industry. Awards which give differing rulings on the same matters without some system of co-ordination on important questions of industrial principle are themselves productive of trouble as time goes on. I have already indicated that on other occasions we have stated in more detail our reasons for introducing the appeal system. The manner in which it has worked has done nothing to shake our confidence in it, and we are maintaining it in the legislation before the committee. think the words uttered by the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr struggle between the owners and tbe Harold Holt) in respect of the secret ballot fall very lightly from the lips of members of the Liberal party who are more inclined not to give people votes at all if they can help it. Turning to this bill and its relation to the those people who do not happen to own trade union movement and the average worker, the question is really a simple one. There are two parties to what is, in effect, a struggle for higher living standards. They are the active and inactive parties. In the ordinary course of events, the people who own things are the inactive parties. They have only to stand fast and look as if they are in the right and they can put up what looks like a good case; and they have adequate opportunities under this measure to put up a case. On the active side we have the men who actually have to struggle for their conditions. Consistently during these debates, honourable members on the Government side have admitted that those who have had to struggle over the last 50 or 60 years have been the workers, the ordinary members of the trade union movement. The question of an appeal with relation to any increase or improvement in wages is important to trade union members and their families. Whereas we can say ordinarily that justice delayed is justice denied, we can. say that in industrial and want on the part of the workers, their wives and families. We oppose the appeals provision because, statistically, it is quite apparent that it reacts against members of the trade union movement. It just cannot be coincidence that the cases put by the trade union movement are always wrong. It cannot be just accident that union advocates who fight the cases for the workers have always lost. Furthermore, the Government cannot say in this instance that this is what the Labour party did when it was in office. reflections upon the impartiality of the tribunals. demonstrated a capacity for thought in these matters, and he should be able to see that it is simply a question of the people who ordinarily work in industry. It is simply a question of the continual struggle throughout the whole of society, and I do not think.that this legislation will in any way relieve the burden upon the means of production, distribution and so on. It is not a matter of impartiality; it is simply a matter of interpretation and of the duty that is consistently imposed upon arbitrators in these matters by use of the term "" public interest"". Every time an arbitrator or conciliator makes a decision, he has laid upon him the burden of not making a decision which may react unfavorably to the whole nation. That is written into the whole structure of the bill. Every time he makes a decision, he has to accept this responsibility, which lays heavily upon",84,Conciliation And Arbitrationbill 1956

267,Mr Bryant,"The Minister hashim. The final result is that he acts with caution, and just as delayed justice reacts commissioners themselves. Apparently unfavorably upon the workers and their dependants, so does caution produce the same result in the living standards of the worker. Where an appeal delays an increase or improvement in the living standards of the members of the trade union movement it causes frustration and incites further agitation by trade union members. We on this side have been accused of being inflamatory to the trade union movement, but we speak as we do because we are firmly convinced that an attack is being made upon the living conditions and rights of the workers. I wain the Government that it is on the way to a head-on collision with the trade union movement. That movement, and the Labour party, will not be denied justice. If the Government accepts our advice, it will treat this matter with the caution with which its arbitrators ordinarily treat the demands of the workers for better living conditions. J£r.

Ceaseless interruptions in hearings will occur and there will be heavy legal costs and all the other evil characteristics of the system which operated bofore 1947. I point out that though one can cite a number of cases showing that before the introduction of the appeal system in 1952 both employer and employee expressed disapproval of verdicts, the right of appeal has not caused any abatement of that dissatisfaction. Appeals frequently go against those who have lodged them. The Government apparently reasoned that because there had been H number of disputes over conciliation commissioners' decisions this could be remedied by a right of appeal. That has not worked out in actual practice; Though the original decisions of conciliation commissioners have often caused perturbation",85,Conciliation And Arbitrationbill 1956
268,Mr E. James Harrison (Blaxland),"What the Minister said regarding the first appeal taken was right. In the first fifteen months of the operation of the right of appeal not one was lodged in respect of wages or conditions fixed by conciliation commissioners. Moreover, there has never been an appeal on the ground of lack of uniformity against an award made hy a conciliation commissioner. Then we got the reverse position. We have been speaking about speeding up decisions. Let us recall the case of the South Australian tramways, which is becoming well known. On the 2nd May, 1955, Mr Tonkin, one of the conciliation commissioners, made a decision in regard to the South Australian tramway employees and an appeal was lodged. Three judges took it upon themselves to hear the case again. They sat for two weeks-afte r the whole field of the award had been covered by the conciliation commissioner-and then, without handing down a judgment, they announced in court that they would refer the matter back to the conciliation commissioner. This is where I throw this matter of uniformity right back at the Minister. AH the railway and tramway awards of Australia have until now been uniform in providing double time for Sundays, time and a half for Saturdays, and a day off in lieu, or double pay, for holidays. The court reduced double time for Sundays to time and a half, and reduced time and a half for Saturdays to time and a quarter. It thereby created, for the first time in many years, a lack of uniformity in award-making in Australia. Further, it reduced the day off in lieu, or double pay, for work on holidays, to time and a half. As I have said, the court did not follow the usual practice of making the award, but referred the matter back to the conciliation commissioner so that he could get the parties together and ascertain whether they would agree to the new principles laid down. The matter was then to be referred back to the. court for a final decision. The case has already cost the unions almost £6,000 in legal expenses. Although the conciliation commissioner gave his original decision on the 2nd May, 1955, finality has not yet been reached. This bill will perpetuate situations of that kind. An analysis of the bill reveals that an appeal will lie to the commission from an award made by a commissioner. That was the position in the award of which I am speaking. Then the bill provides that the appeal shall not lie unless, in the opinion of the commission, the matter is of such importance as to warrant it in the public interest. appeals under the State Wages Board system in Victoria than under this system. is right, but we have reached the point now when this Government is trying to centralize control of margins and all the other factors that go to make up the workers' pay. The appeals system that is operating at present is intended to serve the public interest, but, despite that, in the South Australian case the court has suggested something that is the reverse of the conditions prescribed in awards of a similar character made by courts in every other State of Australia. Let me be quite frank. We believe that this is being done deliberately. The South Australian case, when it comes bask from Mr Commissioner Tonkin, possibly will be the first matter to come before the new presidential commission that is to be established under this measure. The new commission-whic h will operate under a system that provides for appeals and other matters that we oppose-wil l lay down principles. The South Australian case will be referred back to that commission. That case has been dealt with already by three of the judges who will constitute the new presidential commission. Their suggestion was that double time for Sundays should be reduced to time and a half, that Saturday time should be reduced from time and a half to time and a quarter, and 'that what has been the recognizod standard for holiday pay in Australia, for at least 50 years should be cut down. If the new commission adopts that decision, will (lie Minister contend that this Government is in touch with the workers of Australia ? If that is to be the norm for the standards that will be set by the presidential commission in appeals under this legislation, I say that the Government has lost, touch completely with ""the workers.",86,Conciliation And Arbitrationbill 1956

For an industrial dispute not to be settled because it was held by the person hearing the dispute that it was not necessary or desirable in the public interest to settle the dispute would seem to me to be in contravention of the very principles on which the commission is being constituted. If a dispute occurs and it comes to the notice of the commission, it is the duty of the commission, as is laid down in this measure, to see that that dispute is either prevented or settled. To provide that no further proceedings need take place, and thus leave disputes unsettled, seems to be a denial of the very principles upon which the whole system of arbitration is founded. One has to bear in mind that the powers of the commission are exercisable because of the provision in the Constitution for the making of laws for the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes which extend beyond the limits of any one State. That being so, there should be no power in this legislation to enable a person charged with responsibility either to prevent or settle a dispute, to escape the obligations of his office by merely stating that, in his opinion, it is not in the public interest for the dispute to be settled. The deletion of sub-paragraph ( i i i ) of of the dispute in the court itself, instead paragraph (d) is therefore desired. The Opposition believes that the insertion of the words "" but in no case shall the Commission in relation to any industrial dispute refuse to hear the dispute or any part thereof merely because of a stoppage, a cessation or reduction of work in the industry or any part thereof"" is essential if the real functions of the commission are to be carried out. I know of various occasions when the court has decided that a dispute has taken place during the hearing of a case, and the commissioners have said that, while there is a dispute in progress, they will not permit any proceedings to take place before the court. They seem to be unmindful of the fact that their taskwhich is laid down in the act, and in the Constitution itself through which the court is constituted-is to prevent or settle disputes. By adopting the attitude that they will not permit further proceedings because an industrial dispute is in progress, they wash their hands of all responsibility for public inconvenience and loss of production, whether the dispute be large or small. They disregard the stoppage in industry, and the unemployment of people who are innocent parties, and they do so for this reason alone: They believe there has been some affront to their prestige. What is the result? The dispute goes on, the court no longer discharges its functions, the industry concerned is hampered for the time being, at least, and some portion of it is stopped, and the responsibility is thrown upon other parties, who are not equipped with appropriate powers, to do all they can, in the interests of the community, to ensure that a settlement is reached. I know that in such cases the disputes committees of the various trades and labour councils and the Australian Council of Trade9 Unions, and other persons get to work to try to find a settlement. In the end, although the persons concerned are on strike, a round table conference has to take place, and then some terms of settlement are reached. There is no reason why the arbitration court should not use its powers of conciliation and arbitration to keep control of allowing control to be assumed by the organized forces of the Associated Chambers of Manufactures, the Employers Federation or the trade union movement. Therefore, the Opposition asks that these words should go into the bill, because it is essential that the court should not be able to escape the responsibilities and the obligations that are placed upon it, first, by the Constitution and, secondly, by the legislation which the Parliament has passed. The settlement of a dispute should receive the attention of the commission, as it will be called, immediately the dispute takes place. It should be the function of the president of the court to take steps immediately to bring about a settlement by assigning either a commissioner or a conciliator to bring the parties together. If a case is before the court, there is no reason why conciliation should not proceed. The general argument is has been stated by the honourable member that the court "" is not going to be overfor Bendigo( Mr Clarey). I remind awed "". The court is never over-awed the Minister of a dispute that took place by a dispute. It may be very annoyed, in Victoria.

We want to get it out of the measure. change of heart. the foolishness of the section. it undesirable to make it mandatory that the commission shall exercise its powers, notwithstanding the fact that there may be a strike in progress. There is nothing to prevent the commission from exercising its powers should it, in its judgment, so decide, but we do not think that it helps the system to make it mandatory to adopt this line when the commission believes that it is not necessary in the public interest. The honourable member for Bendigo has said that, although this provision was in the legislation of 1947, it could have been wrong. Despite his statement, we believe that it was more probably right, and that it should be retained in this bill. [12.52 a.m.] I believe that the Minister for .Labour and National Service( Mr they said the men were on strike. That Harold Holt) will recall a particular case which has led the Opposition to believe that the 1947 legislation was wrong, as concerned in connection with what was not worked in the framework of a shift by men who were principally in the running staff. The conciliation commissioner, parties. The unions then prepared an agreement within the framework of the act, and took it back to the commissioner. Again he said, at that point, that it was against the public interest and, so far as he was concerned, if anybody was going to endorse the agreement, it would be some other authority than he as conciliation commissioner. We then took legal advice on the matter-and this is why the 1947 legislation is wrong-and had a memorandum of agreement properly drawn up by legal officers, which carried the seal of the railway commissioners as well as the seal of the unions. The reference was accepted by the registrar, and it went before the Full Court of the Arbitration Court. At that stage, the Full Court, -with the agreement before it, took the view that it had no authority to deal with the matter because ""it came rightly within the functions of the conciliation commissioner. Arising out of that disagreement between the authorities as to what was meant by public interest and the like, there was a stoppage of almost two months in the Victorian railways. Neither the conciliation commissioner nor the court would hear argument because is why we say that this matter should be corrected now.

277,Mr E. James Harrison (Blaxland),"situation that arose between the Victorian railways commissioners, the unions concerned, the conciliation commissioner and the Arbitration Court should no longer be possible. On the second phase of this matter, what happens when the point is reached where the disputants decide that the only way for the workers to achieve their object is to stop work? Somebody has to do something about it and who could do something better than the authority in charge of the industry? Some provision is made in the Stevedoring Industry Bill 1956 to permit an approach to he made to the court, or to the commission a3 it now is, for the restoration of appearance money if the appearance money is stopped by the authority because of a dispute at a port. We believe that the time has arrived when the best and quickest way of settling a dispute, even if there has been a stoppage of work, is to get the parties together before those who control the industry. Mi-. BRYANT (Wills) [12.56 a.m.] L want to raise the point briefly, in support of the amendment that the insistence in many cases on the parties returning to work before a dispute is heard reacts against the union. A stoppage of work is usually a strike against the status quo. and it is very exasperating to see the sort of struggle that went on in the case quoted by the honourable member for Blaxland( Mr E. James Harrison) where neither party will surrender until the financial means of one are exhausted. That is reacting unfavorably on the union. The union is expected to surrender its position before the arbitration proceedings take place. I recommend to the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Osborne. F . M . Harold Holt) that he accept this amendment because of the frustration that is caused and the challenge to the trade union movement to use all its strength to achieve its point. The actual return to work means that the union has conceded the point in the first place and surrendered the position for which it was fighting. The status quo favours the emoloyers, and conciliation cannot be Minister for Labour and National Serachieved in that atmosphere.

The proposed section as it appears in the bill makes it mandatory, under certain circumstances, that the award shall not have effect until 21 days after it has been made. In the opinion of the Opposition it is unwise to bind tbe commission, when constituted by a commissioner, by an express provision that the award shall have effect only after the expiration of 21 days from the date of its making. In view of the delay which is inevitable as a consequence of proceedings before a commissioner, which involves the possibility of reference to a commission and of further references or appeals to another commission, and, after the hearing of a case, which has probably involved visits to one or more States for inspections and in order to take evidence, and after a general inquiry that may last some weeks or months, we feel that it is unfair when the award is finally made, for its operaCLARET'S amendment) stand part of the clause. tion to be delayed for a period of 21 days. Our amendment is framed so that the latest date upon which an award will come into operation is the date on which it is made. It will be possible for the parties to consent to its coming into operation from an earlier date. It will be possible for a commissioner to decide that it shall come into operation at an earlier date; but we feel that, in the interests of fairness to the employees and in justice to their claims, the latest date from which an award should commence to operate is the date on which it is made.

There is only a change of emphasis, and he is laying the emphasis on the immediate operation of the award whereas in the provision as it into operation 21 days after the decision in relation to it, subject to some variation with the consent of the parties or by direction of the commission. But there is a practical problem here, that once a decision is given, then, in acase of any consequence affecting a number of respondents, notification is to go out through the length and breadth of the Commonwealth. It has been found in practice that the 21 days is a reasonable working interval for the people to be suitably circularized, and so on; and in view of the fact that a discretion is left to the commission to reduce that waiting time, and the consent of the parties can also have the effect of reducing it, we do not feel that anything of consequence would be gained by accepting the amendment. Indeed, it might make it far less reasonably practicable to get these notifications to the respondents so that they would be aware of what had been provided.

I oppose the proposed section as drafted, fourthly, because court proceedings are prolonged when the legal giants battle it, out day after day. In fact, the whole system of arbitration, in my humble opinion, has arrived at a stage at which we could very well consider abolishing the federal arbitration system altogether and handing arbitration over entirely to the States. One system is opposed to the other. Men who are working side by side and doing the same type of work are earning different wages. framers of the arbitration system had envisaged the system that exists to-day, with Federal and State systems at variance, they would never have considered a federal arbitration system at all. They would have left arbitration in the hands of the States. ""We must decide either to bring arbitration into the federal sphere and have no State system of arbitration, or abolish federal arbitration, and bring arbitration into the State sphere where it would be simpler for the workers to see what was happening and the present variations in wages and awards would not occur. In my opinion, every industrial bill that comes into this Parliament does nothing at all to streamline arbitration. I compare the situation with a ship that has barnacles on it. Every alteration of the arbitration legislation that has heen made since I have been in this Parliament has only added another barnacle to arbitration.

Then again, they go further than some, or perhaps most, trade unionists and trade union officials desire them to go. But undoubtedly the working of the system can be assisted by the presence of counsel in suitable cases. We do leave some discretion in the commission to determine which are suitable cases for the presence of counsel, and the Government believes that this provision represents a fair judgment between the conflicting claims which arise in relation to this If the problem.

If ever this Government should keep its nose out of anything, it should keep it out of the Snowy Mountains hydro-electric scheme. I mean that. Let us first look at the authority that has heen established by the Government to do something about federal awards. Away back in 1951, the Government decided to move in on this scheme, which underlines what I have said consistently during this debate, that all that this Government wants to do is to centralize wages control in Australia. The success Evatt, Dr. H. V. of schemes such as the Snowy MounWatkins, D. O. tains scheme clearly demonstrates the Stewart, F. B. f u t i l it y and the danger of adopting such Daly. F. M. a policy in a growing country. The Cameron, Clyde Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Power Eraser, Allan Act 1951 received the Royal Assent on Morgan, C. A. A. the 8th December, 1951, and came into operation as from the 5th January, 1952. negatived. It amended the 1949 legislation by, amongst other things, inserting section 24o, which provided that the court had together and agreed to. power to prevent or settle, by conciliation or arbitration, disputes in relation 2 -Industrial Matters-Maritime to the salaries, wages, rates of pay or other terms or conditions of service or employment of employees, and to determine matters relating to the employment of employees. That provision is interesting because the rate of progress of the Snowy Mountains scheme"" has demonstrated to the world that, given proper conditions of employment, Australian workmen arc equal to, if not better than, any other workmen in the world. On this project, they have broken world records. Indeed, after breaking a world record for tunnelling through solid granite, they then broke their own record. When we realize that the Commonwealth administration has kept out of that scheme, we understand why it has been so successful. The court has had authority to deal with matters connected with the Snowy Mountains scheme-matter s relating to wages and. conditions-sinc e the date I have mentioned in 1951. It is interesting to look back over what has happened. The court did not visit the project at all in 1951-52. It appeared there for two days in 1952-53, seven days in 1953-54, and one day in 1955. It is evident, therefore, that so long as the court kept away and matters relating to wages and conditions were arranged between the employers and the employees, watched over by a New South Wales conciliation commissioner, great, progress was made with the project. Honourable members on this side of the chamber know that, during the course of the next few weeks, great progress w ill probably be made w i th the laying of concrete. Prior to the introduction of what might be regarded as an incentive scheme, the maximum rate of tunnelling on this project in the deep tunnel",96,Pairs
295,Mr Harold Holt (Higgins,Minis,97,Pairs
296,Mr E. James Harrison (Blaxland),"was 153 feet a week. The company then decided-and I think that this is worthy of note-that if a better performance could be achieved, it would be worth its while to pay an additional £6 per foot beyond 114 feet in a week, to be divided between the 31 workers inside and approximately twenty outside. The management itself worked out this arrangement, which has operated very well. As a result of that agreement, which was completely contrary to federal wage principles and contrary to the way that the court has operated down the years, the men broke their own record in tunnelling through solid granite. Now, the Australian Workers Union and the management are in the process of working out a scheme that will result in retaining their best artisans on the concreting work. I am prepared to say this: The moment that this Government attempts to bring the Snowy Mountains scheme under a central authority controlled by the Government, there will be nothing but strikes and stoppages on the project. This is-a special organization, built around a special project, and it underlines, let me repeat, the danger that will arise from this legislation. As soon as the Government centralizes control, it will destroy first, the value of wage levels, and secondly, it will destroy responsibility, initiative, and incentive. Finally, it will destroy the understanding that goes to make a job really efficient. As the principle that has operated from 1951 to the present time has been successful, why should the Government interfere with it ? During the next few weeks, this company proposes to start work on a tunnel extending for 30 miles, and it has worked out a programme on. the basis of arrangements which have worked very successfully during the time that it has been left alone. I remind honourable members opposite that the Snowy Mountains scheme was commenced by a Labour government, and we want to see it brought to a successful conclusion. Therefore, the Opposition contends that the Government should not proceed with this provision. the reasons that I have just mentioned. By this measure, the Government is trying to centralize the control of wages and conditions in Australia. It will fail to do so, because the court had a look at this matter at one stage and suggested that some of the conditions provided in federal awards might well be applied to a great section of the workers. We know, and the Australian Workers Union knows,, that the hour that the Government attempts to apply this condition, not one workman will be left on the Snowy Mountains scheme. As I have said, since 1951, the court has devoted a total of only about twelve days to the project. Why should the Government persist in introducing in a great project like this, something that it has been shown cannot function? Since we on this side of the chamber were the founders of the Snowy Mountains hydro-electric scheme, we believe that it should be proceeded with. We agree with management that it should be carried out with the least overhead expense possible. We know that under the present arrangement, with the Electricity Commission of New South Wales merely watching the agreements between employees and management, the scheme will go through to completion. We, therefore, ask the Minister to examine carefully the probable results of the Government's actions in this regard. If the Government believes that the Snowy Mountains scheme should be stultified or written down, then it should go ahead with this proposal. Buti f the Government is nationally minded and believes that the scheme should be finished at the earliest possible moment, and that the work should be performed in such a way as to give satisfaction to workers as well as management, then it will withdraw the proposed sections.

James Harrison) has put to the committee has been most enthusiastically received by honourable members on this side of the chamber.

299,Mr Harold Holt (Higgins,"implication, on the department administered by my colleague, the Minister for National Development (Senator Spooner), all made very welcome hearing for honourable members on this side of the chamber, even at this' late hour. But when tbe honourable member proposes that we should exclude from the ambit of industrial arbitrament in this project our own federal authorities, I really wonder whether I am listening to a spokesman for the Labour party. I always thought that the Labour party stood for the strengthening of federal powers. I assumed that it believed that the Federal Parliament should have some responsibility in relation to the employment of its own employees. But here we are told that we should reject any responsibility for our own employees who are working on our own great national project. That suggestion may appear logical to the honourable member for Blaxland and those who sit behind him, but to honourable members on this side of the chamber it does not make sense. We believe that the provisions in the bill should stand. I cannot imagine that those who have managed to negotiate successful arrangements between employer and employee on this project will not continue to be able to do so. It is hardly credible that an -experienced commissioner, whether he be one of the presidential members or one of the lay members, who may be assigned to this industry in the federal sphere, would in any way interfere, in a restrictive sense, with the splendid record of performance that is being achieved on the Snowy Mountains project at present. We ask the committee to accept what is a proper responsibility for a federal parliament in relation to its own employees, that is, the creation of arbitral jurisdiction over 'their industrial problems. wish to answer a comment made by the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Harold Holt). progress with this Government? The situation seems to me to be completely different from that outlined by the Minister. The people under federal authority are subject to our sovereign powers, and there is no need for us to be concerning ourselves with the kind of administration that is being created under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, which provides restrictive powers, as we all know. It is quite proper and possible for this Parliament to lay down conditions of employment and wages for the people under its authority, and, as far as I can see, the people in the Commonwealth territories and in Commonwealth employment are in an entirely different, position from those to whom it is sought to apply federal awards that result from disputes extending beyond the bounds of any one State. Therefore, the Minister's remarks in that connection seem to be irrelevant to the points raised by the honourable member for Blaxland. [2 a.m.] -The Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Harold Holt) has -placed on record what he interprets to.be the viewpoint expressed by me on behalf of the Labour party. He suggested that the Labour party was opposed to federal control of its own employees. That was a completely incorrect interpretation to place on my speech. like. we have said all along, -with regard to this legislation, which we have consistently opposed, is that control of wages and conditions of employment in Australia cannot be centralized. That is where the difference lies between the Minister's point of view and ours. I suggest quite frankly that if the 1947 legislation were in force, and a conciliation commissioner with unfettered powers were given control of industrial conditions applying to the Snowy Mountains scheme, the position would be entirely different. But in this legislation the Government is trying to establish a commission vested with powers to consider the public interest and other things. Having done that, it will say to the commission, "" One portion of thi= commission shall consider this special piece of work known as the Snowy Mountains scheme, and shall bring it, within the framework of the common policy laid down by the whole commission "".
