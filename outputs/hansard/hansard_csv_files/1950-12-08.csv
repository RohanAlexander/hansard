However, T shall see what can be done about it.

It is a difficult one. There is no control of oats other than the general control of exports of oats and certain other grains. The policy that is being pursued by the Government is designed to ensure that Australia shall not be drained of oats for stock feed and human consumption merely because attractive prices are being paid overseas, but it is not the policy of the Government to restrict exports of oats to such a degree as to cause an artificial surplus here and, consequently, a depression of prices. The Government is endeavouring to strike a balance between the two extremes. I announced recently that tentative export quotas had been worked out on a State basis which had regard to the quantity of oats available in a State and the requirements of that State for oats, and that export permits would be granted accordingly. The export quota for each State is based upon present estimates of the stocks of oats that will be available and the local demand. The quotas will be reviewed from time to time in an endeavour to maintain the balance to which I have referred. in the constituency represented by the Postmaster-General, where a post office to serve the needs of 13,000 people is being erected at a cost of over £100,000.

Does he know that these differences extend from tbe qualifications of authorized witnesses to the nature and form of admissible vote? Although this matter has frequently been brought to the notice of the State authorities, no State appears to be willing to take the initiative in removing the differences.

The necessary acceleration of our defence programme has, however, led the Government to reconsider the necessity for some control of this kind. Serving as they do to assist in preventing the dissipation of resources necessary to defence on activities which do not fulfil defence purposes, these regulations contribute to the defence of Australia. In accordance with the intimation recently given by me of the Government's intention to re-institute a system of capital issues control, the regulegislation of the war of 1939-45.

There are, of course, no new regulations in question.

65,"Regulations, National Dr. Evatt (Barton","Deputy LeaderAs a result of a number of court decisions given in June, 1949, the power of the Parliament to continue this procedure was successfully challenged. J refer specifically to litigation about petrol rationing and tbe war service moraI n the light of that situation, the necessity torium. The opinion was tben widely entertained that it would not be possible to continue any of the economic regulations on the ground that problems arising out of the war had not entirely disappeared. This legislation gives a new turn to the position, and the Minister has frankly claimed that the international situation is such that the commitments of Australia, as a member of the British Commonwealth and of the United Nations, are growing, and that that state of affairs directs to the Australian Parliament more of the powers which are exercised during war. As the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) announced in his broadcast of the 5th October, and as this legislation indicates, capital issues will be controlled. We take it that that means that an administrative control will now be introduced and that, in the future, it will not be merely a matter of giving formal approval to applications for capital issues. The reasons for this measure, as announced by the Prime Minister, are that the procedures of issuing additional capital, bonus shares and the like, might give a further impetus to the inflationary trends affecting our economy. This is one of the important remedies of the Government. It is not introduced by permanent legislation under the companies or corporations power, which is not thought by tbe legal profession to be a very secure foundation, but by reestablishing or reinstating the capital issues control. This legislation, does just that. point, a broader issue is raised. That is, why, in this situation, should that particular control be reinstated and why should the Government fail to give its authority under such legislation for the reinstatement of prices long-continued existence of economic control ? Price control was one of the features party should support these regulations, of war-time legislation which was conbecause they are its own brain-child. tinued until the courts came to the conMost of these regulations were necessary clusion that it could no longer be conduring the war, but to-day, when there Dr. Evatt. tinued because of the contraction of the defence power of the Australian Government. Now the argument is that the defence power is about to expand, and capital issues control can be made good. which is believed to exist for having referendum approval for prices control seems to be disappearing, because that is measured by the same principle. That is one feature of the legislation that calls for comment. Economic controls of a very important character are being brought into existence to stop capital issues. Therefore, the Government is proclaiming that it believes that it has such a power to stop inflationary trends. The Opposition points out to the Government that if that is so tbe Government could assume powers on economic matters which would enable it, supported by Parliament, to make an attack upon inflation on a broader front. In such an attack prices control would be a supremely important element. The only case against prices control suggested by the Government is that by itself it is inadequate. Now, according to the proclamation that the Government is making in introducing this legislation, that argument disappears. If this proposed action is believed by the Government's advisers to be within the power of the Government there is no reason why the same basis of power, the defence power, should not be utilized in the purpose of restoring prices control, which, in the opinion of the Opposition, is absolutely essential on an Australia-wide basis. The State Premiers have asked for it, and the action now taken by the Government seems to afford an opportunity for its introduction. [11.25] I record my disapproval of this bill to extend the national security regulations for another year. I feel that one of the real reasons why this country is in such economic difficulty is because of the controls such as those involved in this bill. It is quite natural that the Labour",22,Defence Transitional Provisions Bill 1950 Second Reading
66,Having Established That Mr Charles Russell (Maranoa),"is no war, their re-introduction should at least be put in some legislative form so that the Parliament, and the public, may them. That was strongly borne in upon me when this bill was being considered by the Senate. I asked certain senators about it, but they could not tell me anything. The bill was passed by the Senate without discussion. If these regulations were in proper legislative form everybody would have known about them, whereas now few members really understand what the bill means. After making some inquiries, I finally obtained from a Minister the information that I sought. continues the existing regulations. that. I commend to the Government certain speeches on this matter that have been made by its own supporters when the regulations were last extended and when the Government was in opposition. It is true that this bill merely extends the existing law. I am reminded of a statement by the late Lord Keynes that one of our difficulties to-day was not so much tbe acceptance of new ideas as ridding ourselves of old ones. That, I believe, is our trouble with these regulations. As I have said, they were quite justified in war-time, but their retention in peacetime means that we are moving closer towards socialism. They are part of the whole scheme of socialistic planning. Speaking on this subject some time ago, the Treasurer ( Mr Eadden) said that the first casualty of war was civil liberty. We are not involved in a war to-day. There will always be wars somewhere in the world. We might become involved in a war; but we might not, and I suggest that, until we are in fact at war we should not bog ourselves down in more controls at the risk of ruining our free economy. present Government parties advocated in their speeches during the last election campaign tbe freeing of our economy from controls. I too, urged such action when speaking from election platforms. Apparently, however, in most instances those utterances were merely expressions of good intentions. I remind the Government that the road to hell is paved with good intentions. Regulations such as those now under discussion will do more to ruin the Government than understand would the implementation of it3 election policy by firm action to deal with inflation in the proper manner. The continuance of controls is only tinkering at the real problem. The Government's election proposals were right. That is to say, we should aim to return to a condition of normal free economy as soon as possible. The enforcement of these economic regulations will naturally require administrative staff, but in addition to that it will require inspectorial staff which will be very expensive to maintain. As the need for the regulations decreases and as they become less popular, more inspectorial staff has to be added. The result of that will be that more valuable manpower will be drained away from our limited man-power resources. The cause, of our trouble to-day, aa I have pointed out before, is that we have a condition of over-employment. The Government has to play a very important part in overcoming that problem insofar as its own public service is concerned. It should aim to try to pare down the Commonwealth Public Service and also to ensure, by means of tariff reform and other instruments, that the demand for manpower in various industries will be cut down so that there will not be so much pressure on prices brought about by competition for man-power between the Government and industry generally. Let me assure the Government, and also the Opposition, that I am not advocating a pool of unemployed persons. Ear be it from me to do so. I advocate a condition of full employment and of balance in cur economy, rather than a condition in which there are half a dozen jobs for Members of the every man available. We are trying to do too much, a fact which has been stated many times by other people, including the chairman of the National Bank of Australasia Limited who recently pointed this out. I suggest that in the regulations covered by the bill, which are the brain children of the former socialist Administration, we are dealing with effects and iLot with causes.",23,Defence Transitional Provisions Bill 1950 Second Reading
67,Mr Mcmahon,This measure only,24,Defence Transitional Provisions Bill 1950 Second Reading
68,Mr Ohables Russell,"I knowI n his second-reading speech the Minister soft-pedalled the regulations governing capital issues control which are the most important of the regulations affected by the measure. He dealt with them only incidentally among references to regulations governing such authorities as apple and pear boards. I suggest that the bill itself will do nothing to stop the inflationary trend in this country. All those controls mean suppressed inflation, and experience has always shown that when we suppress inflation in one way it will burst out in another. If we suppress it in one place il: will come out in another place and then we shall have to put more and more people on the Government pay-roll to try to hold it in check. The alternative to it is open inflation. If we had that, we should at least know where we were going and could aim to cause a certain amount of dis-era ploy ment. However, the Government refuses to deal with this very urgent problem of inflation and I urge it to grapple with the problem intelligently before more of the value runs out of the Australian £1. Another aspect of regulations of this kind is that when they are unpopular they will be disregarded, and thus will bring governmental authority into contempt. That is what we talked so much about prior to the last general election and I still talk about it, because unpopular laws will not be obeyed. That was very evident when we had more regulations in force than we now have. Very few people took the regulations that governed the transfer of land seriously. The same thing happened in regard to the sale of second-hand motor cars at pegged prices. Astute people found a way round the regulations governing these matters. Another important point about regulations governing capital issues is that each State controls its own company laws. Regulations for the control of capital issues are, therefore, to some degree, an infringement of State rights and I suggest that we have already had enough Commonwealth infringement of the sovereign powers of the States. There is already too much centralization, which results in more and more bureaucracy. One of the very unsavoury things about controls Mr Charles Russell. of this kind is that they result in patronage, which, in turn, ultimately leads to corruption. Also the people who administer the regulations make mistakes and are not accountable for them. Such controls as capital issues controls obviously deter the establishment of industries. That, fact bas particular application to Queensland, which has lagged behind the rest of the Commonwealth in the development of secondary industries because its taxing laws prior to the unification of taxation, tended to hunt industry from Queensland. The result is that in order to keep pace with the rest of Australia, Queensland needs to expand its industry as rapidly as possible. Expanding industry may be described as the life blood of a free economy. Every"" free "" industry that, has expanded successfully has bestowed more benefits upon, and made a. greater contribution to, the living conditions of the people than have "" controlled"" industries. I remind the House of the great efforts of the Ford Company of America, which gave the world cheap motor cars, and forced its competitors to manufacture cheap motor cars. The International Harvester Company and the .Singer Sewing Machine Company are other examples. The controls under consideration may be described as the brain-child of a. socialist administration, and I regret that the Government is continuing them, because they do not provide the solution of the economic problem. Proof of that may be found in what has happened to Australian and British industries under Labour administrations. British industries, which once were supreme in tbe world, have yielded pride of place to those of other countries, due entirely to socialist management and control. The half-hearted attempts to remedy the economic situation by the continuation of war-time controls, will not meet with any success. The recent boom in new issues of companies' capital has not in many cases been due to the expansion of their activities. Whilst the Government has been discussing for many months the advisability of re-imposing control of capital issues, some companies have seized the opportunity to get additional money to take care of rising stock values, &c. Now those companies wbich did not take this opportunity may be penalized. I hope that that will not happen. Had tbe Government announced that those controls would be abolished, half the boom in capital issues would not have occurred. One of the reasons why companies need additional issues is to enable them to finance the increased costs of tbe machinery that they require for their production and success. The Government is dealing, not with a cause, but with an effect. The Government has now been in office for twelve months, and must take the responsibility for the increases of prices since it was elected. It is of no use blaming the economic policy of the Chifley Administration. That Government was at fault, but the present Government is continuing various economic controls wbich I , and other Government supporters, condemned very strongly some time ago. I realize that this bill deals with a fait accompli, but I urge the Government, with all sincerity, to endeavour to abolish those controls as soon as possible and use the only effective methods that can arrest the spiralling of prices, which is destroying our Australian economy. adjourned. Minister) -by leave-This is not the occasion for making a lengthy statement on the problems which arise out of the Korean campaign. These problems are under close consideration between governments and in particular are at present the subject of close, friendly and mutually understanding discussions between Mr them. All I need say is that our own Attlee and President Truman. The very fi;ct that tbey are conferring in this spirit isolating the Korean campaign and is the best indication to the world that the international co-operation which produced resistance to aggression in Korea is not going to be dissipated because that resistance has, in recent weeks, become uncommonly difficult. All that I can tell the House about the campaign is that the latest reports are more encouraging and that, while the difficulties are real, there is certainly no reason for defeatism of any kind. It is perhaps worthwhile reminding ourselves that the campaign in Korea is not national but international. The many nations involved in the resistance to North Korean aggression did not become so involved because they believed that Korea possessed some special strategic importance. The considerations that moved them were not military. They acted under a resolution of the Security Council of the United Nations for the sole purpose of resisting international aggression and of demonstrating their firm intention to make the United Nations an effective instrument against such aggression in the future. This international task has not been completed, nor can it, in the nature of things, be voluntarily abandoned. The entry into the contest of something like 250,000 Chinese Communist troops has presented new and tremendous problems of a military kind. It has, in fact, among other things, served as a timely reminder to us that even great superiority in tbe air and in ground weapons can be matched by large numerical superiority in point of trained manpower. The military problems will, of course, be dealt with by a very distinguished military commander. It would be difficult to run an effective campaign by committee. But I confidently anticipate that no military decision which might have international political implications will be made without full consultation between the governments concerned. Above and beyond the purely military considerations, there are political implications in the Chinese intervention which are of great magnitude and delicacy. I would not assist in their determination by provoking any premature discussion about best endeavours will be in the direction of making it abundantly clear to the Chinese people that the participating countries of the United Nations have no desire to inflict injury upon Chinese lives or property but are engaged in a military operation in which Chinese citizens can become involved only by their own choice.

My remarks are intended to stress a factor that I consider is of supreme importance. A military operation is proceeding in Korea, and forces of many nations are engaged on behalf of the United Nations organization. One of those forces has been provided by Australia. Therefore, I put to the Prime Minister and the Government the viewand I am sure that every one will agree with it-that the first thing to emphasize is that no political considerations should be introduced which might embarrass the protection, security and safety of the troops actually fighting. We read in the newspapers reports of proposals for evacuation or partial evacuation of the troops engaged in Korea, and we are unable to form any considered judgment of those reports. The first thing to insist upon, and I consider that Australia can insist upon it, is that the servicemen of all the countries involved should be safeguarded and their interests not subordinated to mere considerations of political policy. I consider that that is axiomatic. Unfortunately, however, many things that are axiomatic are forgotten in a difficult situation such as the Korean campaign. Lieutenant-General Sir Horace Robertson recently complained that, because of the absence of military censorship, the safety of certain troops might be jeopardized. I put that to the Government as the first matter to be considered. It is all very well to say that the Chinese Government should not extend this conflict into a world of America as authentic, because he exwar, but the fact is that hundreds of thousands of Chinese are actually engaged in the conflict. Their participation gives rise to a situation of acute difficulty. I entirely agree with the Prime Minister's final statement to the effect that every possible step should be taken in order to avert the extension of the campaign into a world conflict. Honourable members of the Opposition have supported in the House, and will continue to support, the action of the United Nations organization in intervening in Korea. That action was justified because it was repelling unlawful aggression by means of lawful aggression. Honourable members on this side of the statement House have frequently suggested that it be heard at the point of military command and also at the point where the political decisions are being taken. While I agree with the statement of the Prime Minister that command by a committee cannot be substituted for military command, I do not suppose that the right honourable gentleman would contend for a moment that in making crucial military decisions a country such as Australia, which is making an important contribution to the fighting forces, should not make an equally important contribution to the general conduct of the campaign. I consider that that point has not been sufficiently attended to in the past. A stage has been reached where the Government should make every endeavour, both on the military and on the political side, to have the voice of this country heard. The Prime Minister has referred to the vitally important conversations that have taken place between Mr Attlee and President Truman. There, again, honourable members of the Opposition fear that, unless the Government insists upon a voice in the conduct of the Korean campaign and takes every step to secure it, it may be too late for Australia to play a part in the decisions that are taken. Mr Reston, of the New York Times, has been telling the world what is actually taking place between President Truman and Mr Attlee. I point out that what that gentleman says in the New York Times is invariably regarded in the United States presses the views of the State Department of the United States of America. the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) may have no fear that Australia's voice is not well known to both of those distinguished members of the conference.",26,Korea

80,Mr Menzies,"I suggest that tbeing out that arising directly out of the Korean situation is the necessity for the fullest information to be made available to this House, and for consultation. The statement made by the Prime Minister to-day is no doubt as comprehensive as possible, but it really gives us no information concerning the Government's policy, beyond the statement that it does not desire the conflagration in Korea to extend into a general world war. We and the people of Australia want something more than that. I have made a practical suggestion in relation to international affairs and defence which I ask the Government to consider or, if it has already made a decision, to reconsider in the light of recent events. This is all closely related to the problem of Korea. matters should affect in any way the disposition of our forces. That is of supreme importance not only to Australia but also to all other members of the United Nations that have forces engaged in Korea. Debate resumed (vide page 4079). -The honourable member for Maranoa( Mr Charles Russell) has said, from his place on the Government benches the Government benches! Honourable members cannot change that physical fact. The honourable member for Maranoa sits behind the Government on the Government benches. Though members of the Liberal party and the Australian Country party may not like the proffered support of the honourable member, the fact is that what he has said to-day is identical with the statements that were made by supporters of the present Government, when they were in opposition, from 1947 onwards about legislation of the same character as this bill. Everything that the honourable member has said in I am not. I am pointcriticism to-day was said by those honourable gentlemen then. But now, having presented a bill precisely the same as others that were introduced by tbe Chifley Government, they try to convince the House that it is good legislation notwithstanding all the evil features that they attributed to it in other years. occasion. gentleman and his colleagues supported it by not opposing it, if that can be described as support. They criticized it trenchantly but did not vote on the matter. The honourable member for Maranoa has told the Government that it is reNo international political sponsible for the prices increases that have occurred during the last twelve months. It must accept the full responsibility for them. I thought that the honourable gentleman's speech was delightfully informative and interesting, and I think that it will have a powerful influence upon the minds of the Australian people. It was like a breath of fresh air blowing across this chamber from the Government benches. I do not agree with all that the honourable member has said, of course. For instance, he said that the whole programme of controls was a brain child of socialist administration. That is not correct. vernment certainly believed in controls, but this legislation was not placed upon the statute-book in the first instance by a Labour administration. Controls were introduced by the Menzies Administration. legislation is the brain child of any political organization, it is the brain child of the semi-socialist Liberal party. Nearly all of the. controls that we had to accept, in time of war were imposed",28,Korea

We believed in the controls because they were necessary in the public interest, and we think that controls are necessary to-day because of the awful mess that this Government has made over inflation. The Australian people should be given an opportunity to vote prices control permanently into the Constitution. But, if the recitals in the preamble to the bill to the effect that we are in a state of war and, therefore, that the defence power can be invoked, are correct, there is no necessity to conduct a referenhave been operating during the last dum upon prices control.

In the second broadcast, the Prime Minister said, on the subject of capital issues controlWe propose to reinstitute capital issues control. We think this should be done so that the absorption of capital and, therefore, of labour and materials into industries of minor importance, at the expense of those of major importance, may be restrained. But all that the Government proposes to do is reinstitute the controls that twelve months.

That is a very desirable aim. gentleman reading from? honourable member for Henty( Mr Why did it allow the position to get so Gullett) is still a member of the Liberal party I am reading from a publication issued under the authority of D. M . Cleland, 30 Ash-street, Sydney. tion. honourable gentleman has realized that I am quoting from a publication issued by his own party. There is hope for him still. If the Prime Minister wanted to give effect to that policy, he would introduce a measure with more blood in it than this piece of legislation. The ineffectiveness of the capital issues regulations under the administration of the present Government is proved by the abuses that have occurred during the last twelve months, and we have no assurance that conditions will be any better in the next twelve months. If the Government wants to ensure that materials will be properly used in the best interests of this country, it should introduce a special bill for that purpose, and not content itself with presenting a measure to continue in force regulations that were issued during the war years under the authority of the National Security Act. On several occasions, I invited the Treasurer ( Mr into the £1 than the Government has. Fadden) to say definitely whether the Parliament would be given an opportunity this session to discuss an excess profits tax bill and a capital issues control hill. This measure is not a fulfilment of the promise that the Treasurer made in his budget speech. In order that there shall be no doubt about what happened in this Parliament on this matter, I remind the House that on the 8th NovemberI asked the Treasurer whether it was his intention to introduce those two bills this session. The right honourable gentleman's reply was both laconic and informative. It was simply "" Yes "". We have not seen the capital issues control bill, although the Treasurer promised to introduce it. Government power to control capital issues. not the Government use the capital issues regulations in the last twelve months?' much out of hand that"" the Prime Ministerhad to make a special broadcast to the nation in which he said that the Government was going to establish a National' Security Resources Board and examine our material and man-power potentials in order that we could make the best possible use of them ? Why did the Prime Minister have to deplore the existence of a situation which he said was creating, to use the title of the publication to which I have referred, a threat of inflation. Inflation was more than a threat at that time; it was a very real disaster. The Government should have introduced better and more effective legislation than this. We have no assurance that, even if we pass this measure, conditions between now and when the Parliament meets again will be better than they have been during the last twelve months. The honourable membeT fox Watson( Mr Curtin) has reminded me that there is such an issue before the peopleas putting value back into the £1. The Government parties raised that issue inDecember of last year, and we are maintaining interest in it in December of this year. The Opposition has more interest now in the issue of putting value back If there is one slogan that the Government wishes to forget, it is the -slogan in relation to putting value back into the £1. Unless value is put back into the £1 and some effective controls are introduced during the next twelve months, the plight of the Australian people will become desperate.

Tbe notice-paper contains notice of the intention of the Leader of the Opposition to introduce a bill to amend the Constitution for the purpose of conferring on the Commonwealth permanent power to deal with capital issues. However, in the absence of the right honourable gentleman, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) has stated very definitely that in his opinion there is no need to institute permanent controls, and that they are entirely unnecessary. The right honourable gentleman contends that the occurrence of a state of emergency automatically confers on the Commonwealth power to control capital issues, f have never heard of a more treacherous attack upon a man in his absence than the implied attack that has been made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, with the support of members of the Australian Labour party, on the right honorChifley). That attack affords a commentary on the political morality of members of the Labour party. They have tried to "" make a guy "" of their leader during his absence from the House. They have said, in effect, that his proposal is entirely unnecessary, and that it is a work of supererogation. I return to the basic point that the Opposition is insincere in its attitude towards this measure. Of course, the major difference between tbe point of view of the Government and that of the Opposition on this matter of economic controls is that whilst the non-Labour parties favour the introduction of these controls only as a temporary measure for the present state of international emergency, the Opposition desires to have a permanently controlled, socialized, regimented state. As one who recognizes our duty to do unpleasant things in the present state or emergency in order to ensure our survival in the f uture, I express my sincere hope that the international situation will clear sufficiently to enable the principles enunciated by the honorahle member for Maranoa to become practicable.

The object of the bill is to effect two amendments to the Interim Forces Benefits Act. The purposes of the act are to express the two following principles: First, tbe provisions of the legislation for members of the forces, 1939-45 war, viz., the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act and the Re-establishment and Employment Act, relating to war pensions, repatriation benefits, re-establishment, &c, apply to members of the forces who enlisted before the lst July, 1947; and, secondly, the benefits available to members who enlisted after the 30th June, 1947, shall be those expressed in the Interim Forces Benefits Act. The position in respect of the second principle is that war pension, medical treatment, and a fair range of other general benefits are available to members who enlisted at any time during the period from the lst July, 1947, to the 30th June, 1949, for a period of not more than two years. For the purposes of the act, this class is designated "" Interim Forces"" and the definition reads as follows:"" Member of the Interim Forces"" means a person who, after the thirtieth day of June, One thousand nine hundred and forty-seven, and prior to a date fixed by the Minister by notice in the Gazette, enlists or re-engages in, should be covered for the purposes of such or is appointed or re-appointed to, the Naval, Military or Air Forces of the Commonwealth for a term not exceeding two years. The date was fixed by the Minister as the lst July, 1949, and it was proclaimed in the Gazette on the 20th June, 1949. The first amendment arises in respect of that definition. The definition covers not only members of the permanent forces, but also members of the Citizen Military Forces. Comparing it with the definitions of "" member of the forces "" in the Interim Forces [REPRESENTATIVES.] Benefits Bill 1950. Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act and the Re-establishment and Employment Act, it will be seen that for a member of the Citizen Military Forces to be covered by that legislation he must be one who was "" enlisted or appointed or called up for continuous service for the duration of, but the condition of continuous service does not appear in the definition of ""member of the Interim Forces"" and therefore, as it now stands it includes members of the Citizen Military Forces enlisted for "" part-time "" service. This was not intended. Therefore, it is proposed to amend the definition by inserting after the word "" Commonwealth "" the words "" for continuous service "". The second amendment arises in respect of section 4 of the act which expresses the principle that in respect of members who enlist, or re-engage, after the 30th June, 1947, the benefits which shall accrue to those members by reason of that service shall be those provided in the Interim Forces Benefits Act. It is faulty, however, in that the words that describe the service read "" by reason of their service after that date"", that is, after the 30th June, 1947. The intention of the act can be accurately expressed by inserting in section 4 the following words, "" by reason of their service after the date of that enlistment, re-engagement, appointment or re-appointment, as the case may be"". This amendment is necessary in order to protect the interests of the class of member who enlisted before the 30th June, 1947, say, in 1942, continued that service after the 30th June, 1947, and in say, 1948, was discharged, but re-enlisted for further service. The service from 1942 to the date of discharge in 1948 legislation by the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act, and the Re-establishment and Employment Act. For example, the member, during the period from the 30th June, 1947, to the date of discharge from his war-time service, might have suffered incapacity from a happening due to service, and that should be covered under the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act for pension and medical treatment. The bill is designed to effect these two amendments.",34,Assent To Bills

All honourable members who have been here for a great number of years will agree with me that 1950 has been a very heavy parliamentary year, not only in terms of days of sitting and a substantial volume of legislative work, but also because during the course of the year there have been international problems of a very important, sometimes very dangerous, and always very heavy, kind. It is to the credit of the Parliament that these events have always inspired in this House a sense of responsibility all round. It is the weight of respdnsibility as .well as the ordinary physical and mental labour of a session that produces, in the end, some weariness. I daresay we are all going home tired, some of us, I hope, to have a holiday, and some to have the best of all holidays. I am sure that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) will be seeing a cricket test match or two. I shall not be privileged to view the test matches, because it is necessary for me to journey abroad. The Government is indebted to honourable members opposite for their co-operation in dealing with the business of the House.

The larger Parliament becomes, the less becomes the opportunity for private members to express their own views. On the whole, perhaps a private member of an Opposition, though he may not believe it, has a rather better chance than has a private member of the Government. In the first place, mathematically his chances are greater because he belongs to the less numerous section, and in the second place, to a leader of an Opposition is always willing to hear a back-bencher speak, bement and it has been no less difficult for cause at least he knows that the backbencher will give a "" crack "" at the Government.

""When they agree with the Government, the Government Whip comes to them and says, "" I l is all right, we want to get this one through. Don't you speak"". On the other hand, when they disagree with the Government, the head of the Government becomes most infuriated and asks, "" Did thatchap come into Parliament to disagree or to support ?"" Thank Heaven, this is a free country, and, thereof the Opposition ( Mr Chifley), confore, honourable members of this House may speak their minds. It would be a very ill day for the country if they were prevented from speaking their minds.

I also cordially endorse the right honourable gentleman's accurate and witty remarks about the Hansard staff. I extend the best wishes of the Opposition to the Clerk of the House, who, I am sure, came back to work before he had fully recovered from his illness. I hope be will take advantage of the parliamentary recess to regain full health and strength. His assistance is a tower of strength to all honourable members. I join with the Prime Minister in the good wishes that he extended all honourable members. This has been a difficult year for the Governthe Opposition. I also appreciate tbe Prime Minister's implied tribute to the independence of the honourable member for Henty( Mr Gullett). The only thing that worries honourable members of the Opposition occasionally is the possibility that the honourable member to whom he has referred and an honourable member on this side of the House may constitute a new dictatorship of two which it will be necessary to examine closely in the future. However, honourable members owe a good deal to the Opposition Whip and to the co-operation of the Government Whip. I am sure that honourable members will be pleased to hear that the Leader cerning whom I have had many inquiries, is slowly improving in health and strength. I deeply regret his absence at this time when we are expressing so felicitously the views that we have concerning Parliament. This Parliament of the Commonwealth, with all its difficulties and struggles between the parties, stands for something in the life of this community, the value of which cannot be expressed in words. It is at the end of a strenuous year that I wish the Prime Minister, on his visit abroad, a safe journey, a successful mission, and a happy return.

Minister representing the Minister for Social Services, upon notice1.. Is an aged pensioner permitted to earn £78 per year without affecting taxation benefits? 2. Is the term "" year "" based on the preceding twelve months from any date that a departmental form of inquisition is sent out to any pensioner without regard to the date thepension payment originally commenced? 3. Isi t possible to rely consistently on the other hand, work out to the disadvantage of "" year"" as having a commencing date in line with the commencing date of the pension payment? If not, will consideration be extended to the period "" year"" being the same financial ""year"" as accepted hy the Taxation Depn rtment ? Printed L. F. JOHNSTON, Commonwealth Oovernment Printer, Canberra, A.CT. Social Services has supplied the following information:1. The purport of this question is not clear. Under section 23 (fco) of the Income Tax Assessment Act, age pensions are exempt from income tax. A person without dependants is not liable for payment of income tax and social services contribution unless his annual taxable income exceeds £104. Consequently, an age pensioner who has other income (including I am having the matters earnings) up to the permissible amount of £78 per annum is not liable for payment of income' tax and social services contribution. 2. When a pension is reviewed in order to determine the pensioner's eligibility for continuance of pension, the determination is made in the light of the pensioner's income during the twelve months preceding the review. If, however, the question of an overpayment arises, the position is reviewed also in the light of the income received by the pensioner in the year corresponding to the year commencing from the date from which the pension was originally granted. The pensioner's eligibility is then determined on the basis of whichever of the two years gives the more favourable result for the pensioner. 3. The first part of this question is covered by the reply to question 2. Whilst the adoption, for the purpose 'of reviewing a pension, of a fixed period, such as the financial year accepted for taxation purposes, would simplify administration and might work out to the advantage of some pensioners, it would, on the other pensioners, depending on the particular period or periods during that year in which the pensioner was employed. It is considered that the interests -of pensioners generally are sufficiently safeguarded by the practice indicated in the reply to question 2. and Published for the GOVERNMENT of the COMMONWEALTH of AUSTRALIA by",38,Housing
