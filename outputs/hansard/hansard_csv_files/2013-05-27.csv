They have possible. outlined the problems in the sector and they I go to the first substantive point to look at have outlined the nature of the demand going where we are at the moment. What is the forward. They give a clear picture of what context in which we are debating this needs to be done. I have found that in my particular package? There are three things. discussions with my aged-care providers in The first is that we have an ageing my electorate they echo many of the population, which means that there will be problems identified in the Productivity much more demand for aged-care services. Commission's report and in the other reviews At the moment, around nine per cent of our which have occurred over the last few years. population is aged 70-plus, but this is Most recently, I had a roundtable expected to rise to 13 per cent by 2021 and discussion with many of the aged-care rise again to 20 per cent of the population by providers in my electorate, along with the 2050. Those aged over 85 years, who are the shadow minister for aged care. We discussed main users of aged-care services, will many of the issues. They all do a fantastic increase from about 400,000 people today to job under pressing circumstances, and they about 1.6 million people by 2050. We are raised three particular matters. Firstly, they going to have a huge increase in demand for talked about the amount of paperwork which aged-care services over the years and they currently have to deal with. One of the decades in front of us. providers from my sector pointed out that The second contextual point is that despite about 30 per cent of nurses' time can be filled this massive demand on the horizon we have in completing paperwork-not attending to an aged-care sector which is seriously in the residents of that facility but just doing strife at the moment. Indeed, many are paperwork. It is a ridiculous situation. struggling to stay afloat, and only about 40 Secondly, they pointed out the general per cent of aged-care providers are profitable difficulties in making ends meet and that at the moment and operating in the black. many of them are struggling and cannot This means that over half of our providers necessarily see a rosy horizon in front of are losing money today and are at risk of them.

The final contextual point is that we have had review after review of the aged-care This package of bills has been rushed into sector in the last six years under this Labor this parliament and has not had full government. There have been 20 reviews and consideration and consultation with the three Productivity Commission inquiries, but sector. There are issues within this bill which despite all of those reviews and those need to be addressed. The first is that it does inquiries we still have not had proper reform nothing about the burden of red tape and paperwork upon a sector already struggling to cope with the cost of government wage increases.

How does filling The third critique of these bills is there is out yet another form ensure that the quality a blatant attempt to unionise the aged-care of service in our aged-care facilities is workforce through the workforce improved? Again and again they say they are spending more time on red tape, and this supplement. All the aged-care sector have raised this; almost everyone you speak to is particular package just adds to the burden of aware of this tactic. Under the supplement, it. providers with 50 or more beds need to enter The second issue which aged-care into an enterprise bargaining agreement in providers have raised with me in relation to order to access the funding. Those with the package is the potential spike in labour fewer than 50 beds do not have to enter into costs which will be caused by the workforce an EBA. However, they must comply with supplement. The coalition is committed to the conditions of the supplement in order to seeing the wages of all workers rise. Under access the funding. This is a blatant attempt the Howard government, real wages by the government to force our aged-care increased by 20 per cent. However, wage workers into unions. It seems that the rises must be sustainable and they must be government cares more about boosting union affordable. At a time when only 40 per cent mates at United Voice or the ANF and the of aged-care providers are operating in the disgraced Health Services Union than it does black, one must ask the question: how will about getting genuine reform in the agedthey pay for the higher wages which the care sector.

We understand the sector needs real supplement they will need to put in an reform from a government that is fair additional $3. While the government is dinkum about the aged-care sector. It needs claiming that this is a direct government reform from a government committed not to subsidy to boost wages of low-income increasing red tape and pushing its own workers in these aged-care facilities, when it political agenda through forced unionisation comes to the crunch the government is only but to ensuring that our aged-care providers providing a quarter of the overall cost of this survive and thrive. The coalition is committed to the delivery of a high-quality, and the cooperation of a government wishing affordable and accessible aged-care scheme to see it thrive then I fear many residents will that meets the needs and preferences of older not get the aged-care services and provisions Australians. Our proposal is that for the first that they will need in the future.

No doubt, they made a commitment to that. But when the application is to the the coal mining industry very early in the minerals sector, the attitude of the opposition piece that they would 'get rid of this terrible seems somewhat different; however, I will tax'.

I wonder why. apart from the investment impact and why Every time the resource industry looks up we have seen $150 billion worth of projects there is a new tax, a new regulation and a cancelled in Australia, the assumptions on new piece of red tape. Why is it so? Firstly, which this tax are based are completely because the government spends more than it flawed. Why wouldn't the government reveal earns and, secondly, because the government the true modelling behind this tax? constantly has to bow down to its Greens This tax, the MRRT, has been a complete alliance partners to maintain its place in disaster from the outset. In true form, as we government. have seen from the Labor Party, time and In terms of the MRRT we have seen a time again, the estimates for the return from huge shock to the international investment this tax continually gets revised down. This community. That community looks at year's budget revised down those estimates Australia and wonders why we would do this yet again to $3.3 billion. When you consider to ourselves. Why in an internationally the original figure was $22 billion and in fact competitive resource industry would we the tax only raised $184 million in the March make investment here so difficult? Why quarter and $126 million in the previous would we single out the resource industry for quarter, the reality is that we know all this taxation over and above what it is already up tax is doing is damaging Australia's for? There is a misconception on the international investment profile. government side of the House that the The other part which is a major concern is resource industry is not paying enough tax. that, as is their wont, as is their record, this That industry is already paying 46c in the government always spend the money before dollar, half as much again as other they get it. We have seen a whole raft of companies in Australia. Most companies in policies rolled out which are completely Australia pay 30c in the dollar, but the unfunded. So we sit here and wonder why resource industry is already paying 46c in the we have got a $19 billion deficit this year on dollar. But along comes the Treasurer, with a top of all the other deficits we have seen, and huge hole in his budget, and who does he the reality is that it is because this turn to? The resource industry, not just government, first, cannot manage money, taxing them but vilifying them, attacking second, spends beyond its means and, third, profits in the mining sector. Profits based never gets the money that it originally taxation, Brown taxation, makes eminent budgets for. Australia relies heavily on the sense. It recognises that the world price is resources sector. We need to ensure we do not a price that is driven by the ingenuity of everything we can to maintain the miners, ingenious as they may be, but it is a investment flow in Australia. price which is driven by the demands of the If the Treasurer had been at the world for our commodities. China and India conference that the minister for resources, are demanding our coal and iron ore because energy and tourism and I were at today, he they need them to build skyscrapers for their would have heard the message that Australia industrialisation and that has driven the price is no longer the premier destination for through the roof. Yet until this government investment. No longer is it a fait accompli put in place an MRRT the Australian that people will come here and empty their taxpayer did not see an extra cent when the wallets and their bank accounts to build prices went up. They got maybe a little extra resource projects here. No longer will we see for the volume but nothing for the price. So resource companies seeing Australia as a whereas at the start of the decade mining destination of choice. Why? Because we see taxes were a dollar in three of company new taxes almost on a weekly basis, profits, by the end they had gone down to a certainly regularly. Changes to the taxation dollar in seven. system are happening which disadvantage This government decided to put in place investors here in Australia. In the last budget an MRRT, a profits based mining tax, indeed there were changes to the thin capital rule, the same mining approach which had been changes to the exploration allowances-all recommended to the Henry tax review by the of that sends one message, and that message Minerals Council of Australia. That is right: is that this government cannot manage its when the Henry review asked for money, this government puts in place taxes suggestions on how to do mining taxation, which deter investment. Those taxes do not the Minerals Council of Australia said, 'You work, but the sum result of all of that is that ought to do it through a profits based tax.'

As I have told the House before, in 2009 I initiated these awards to recognise and reward excellence and achievement and to encourage careers in local trades and small business. Four prominent local business leaders again kindly volunteered their time to sift through the nominations and select those they thought most deserving. I want to thank those four: Phil Munday of Phil Munday's Panel Works, who chaired the independent judging panel, along with Sue O'Brien of Chateau Yering, Nick Fraraccio of Stevens Glass and Clive Larkman of Larkman Nurseries. The industries represented this year included horticulture, landscaping, carpentry, electrical, glazing and hairdressing. From the applications received, the judging panel decided upon 10 finalists, and of those 10 there were two Overall Winners: 18-year-old Blake Collings from Wesburn, who is a horticulture apprentice at Oz Watergardens in Monbulk, and 17-year-old Jayden Battaglene, from Chirnside Park, who is a landscape construction apprentice at Coolabah Landscaping in Rowville. The Runner-up Award was won by 20-yearold David Graham from Monbulk, who is an apprentice electrician with Everyday Air& Electrical Solutions in Seville, and 21-year-old Ryan Adams from Mooroolbark was awarded the Encouragement Award, and he is an apprentice carpenter with MN Constructions in Warrandyte. The other finalists included Nick Distefano, a 24-year-old apprentice in carpentry and Jordan Iverach, a 20-year-old apprentice in Horticulture Turf Management. There was also Joshua Mayall, an apprentice electrician; Reece Miles, an apprentice glazier; Joshua Sperring, an apprentice horticulturist; and Nicole Van Tonder, an apprentice hairdresser. I want to pay tribute again to the committee and my congratulations to all of the finalists and to their families and friends, who all came along on the evening to celebrate the great success of all of those in the apprentice trainee of the year awards. Ballarat Volunteer Recognition Awards Ms KING (Ballarat-Minister for Road Safety, Minister for Regional Services and Local Communities and Territories) (10:32): I recently had the pleasure to spend an evening with local volunteers at the 2013 Ballarat Volunteer Recognition Awards, which were organised by United Way and Volunteering Ballarat. It was a terrific event, and I want to recognise all of the volunteers who were nominated and those who were award recipients. Volunteers are one of the best things about our community. Their service, dedication, compassion and care for their neighbours is what helps to make local communities great. There is a certain irony, however, in acknowledging the service of volunteers with an award ceremony-after all, volunteers do what they do for the sake of people around them and they do not do it for financial reward or for recognition; they do it for the sake of their local",219,Aplng And Glng Are All Currently Under Organisations Serve In Communities Across
205,The Deputy Speaker ( Mr Bc Scott) Took The Chair At 10:30.,,222,Constituency Statements
206,Mr Tony Smith (Casey) (10:30,"On1 May I hosted the 4th Annual Caseycommunity. But when you consider some of the statistics of volunteerism in Australia, it is absolutely necessary that we celebrate their contribution and that we say thanks. Thirty-six cent of the adult population in Australia are volunteer, and that is more than six million people. The volunteering sector contributes more than 730 million hours of unpaid work each year in Australia, and that is valued at around $16 billion. Whether they are providing support to families who find themselves in crisis or defending communities during floods or fires, whether they are helping our new migrants to settle in the community or recognising the work of men and women who have served their nation in wartime and peace, whether they are creating a community garden, assisting children with learning difficulties or simply serving in the local op shop, volunteers give their time, their energy and their hard work to serve a purpose beyond recognition. I also want to particularly take this opportunity to reflect on the efforts of one very special volunteer in Daylesford, who sadly passed away earlier this month. Roz Moynihan was the epitome of a volunteer-someone known by an entire community for her decades of tireless commitment to the welfare of others. I first encountered Roz and her husband Danny when they ran the Daylesford Post Office. Despite having incredibly busy working lives, they were actively involved in the community, particularly in providing training opportunities for young people. For almost 20 years at any event for any organisation in Daylesford was made brighter thanks to Roz's involvement. If you attended or were part of the speedway, the RSL, the ChillOut Festival, the art show, the urban fire brigade, the ladies auxiliary, Girl Guides or Rotary, you would find Roz there lending a hand, rattling a tin or just making you feel welcome with her wonderful smile and her laughter. Roz is remembered by her husband, Danny, her children, Justin and Natalie, and their extended family members. In fact, it was the biggest funeral we have ever seen in the Daylesford community, with almost 1,000 people lining the streets to farewell Roz. We will certainly miss her. She was someone I certainly counted as a friend. She always warmly welcomed me and my family into the community. Roz, we will sadly miss you, but it was a life well and truly lived to the full. National Disability Insurance Scheme a story that has been shared with me from a Bonner constituent. For the purposes of this speech, let us call her Mary. In a nutshell it encapsulates the true essence of the NDIS and what it will mean for people living with disabilities and for those who lovingly give their time to care for them. I think it is high time that every Australian stops and thinks but for the grace of God there go I because none of us know when we or one of our loved ones may, through no fault of their own, become severely disabled. People like Mary need a safety net and they will need to know the quality of life that remains for them. Mary became a full-time carer for her late husband when he was suddenly struck down with motor neuron disease. This is a rapidly progressive neurological disease with an average life expectancy of only two to three years from diagnosis. Every day two people die of this cruel disease. Sadly, Mary's husband progressively lost the ability to speak, swallow, walk, even to stand, grip with his hands and finally even breathe without mechanical assistance. These disabilities require a range of very specialised and expensive aids as well as physical",222,Constituency Statements
207,Mr Vasta (Bonner) (10:35,"It is with great pleasure that I bring to the House's attentionassistance with daily functions. She relied heavily on the support of the Motor Neurone Disease Association for the provision of some of these resources. She also had to make a co-payment to receive five hours per fortnight of in-home assistance provided by Anglicare. Any increased assistance was not possible due to the lack of funding available to the service providers. Her husband was assessed by disability services as eligible for 40 hours per week of in-home care but, sadly, no funds were available to actually provide it. When Mary's circumstances became quite desperate, emergency funding for a total of 40 hours was made available; however, she was able to find available staff to provide only nine hours per week. As her husband could not be left alone, she too became housebound and relied heavily on family support for their daily needs-a stark reminder of the immense load on the shoulders of carers. This story is why we must ensure that the NDIS comes to fruition as quickly as possible and to keep up the scrutiny that the scheme warrants to ensure that it will deliver where it is most needed to people like Mary and to her husband. To echo the sentiments of our shadow Treasurer, Mr Joe Hockey: … Australians want tomorrow to be better than today. Australians want their government to reflect their aspirations. And, Australians want their government to reflect the very best qualities of our people. The NDIS reflects the very best qualities of our people by providing the best quality of life for its disabled. Richmond Electorate: GP Superclinic the recently completed GP superclinic at south Tweed Heads in my electorate or, as the clinic is known as, Tweed Health for Everyone. This is a great project. We are very excited to see that it has been completed. Of course, this was an election commitment in 2010. We went to the people saying that if we were elected we would deliver $7 million to build a GP superclinic in the Tweed Heads area. Of course we did this because it is very important in this area to take the pressure off the local hospitals. Also, many people in the community called for better integrated health services in this area. It is particularly important for this area in my electorate because there is a very large proportion of older Australians who need to access health services such as these. SoI was very pleased to be making that commitment. Soon after the election, it went out to tender, and the successful applicants were a company known as Ausjendia Pty Ltd, which comprises three outstanding local GPs: Dr Di Blankensee, Dr Jenny Soden and Dr Austin Sterne. These three GPs have an extensive history within our area. They are particularly regarded for the GP services they provide but also for their GP registrar training. So an outstanding group of doctors with decades of local experience were the successful tenderers for the superclinic. We are now seeing the final project. It is great to see the vast array of services they have. The building features 22 consulting rooms for GPs, nurses, dietitians, podiatrists, physiotherapists, speech pathologists and psychologists. It has two minor procedures rooms, a four-bed emergency room, a pharmacy, a dentist, pathology, a coffee shop, conference facilities, very easy ground-floor access and, importantly, free on-site car parking, including",223,Constituency Statements
208,Mrs Elliot (Richmond) (10:38,"I am really pleased to be updating the House today onspace for motor cycles, bicycles and gophers. The whole place has been designed to make it easy for people to access and to get the health care they need. I want to take the opportunity to commend the architect, Andrew Armstrong from Fulton Trotter, who did a remarkable job in the design. I have just outlined some of the features. The design also incorporated a lot of natural light, with ventilators, water tanks and sun shading, and it reflects a lot of the environmental features of the North Coast as well. Most importantly, the design is very conducive to people coming to access health services. We are very excited we are going to have the official opening next month to celebrate what really is a great community victory. For a long time, people had called for an integrated health service like the GP superclinic. I am very proud, as the local MP, to be to be delivering that, particularly one that is going to give such an array of allied health services all in one spot, which is important for anyone accessing health care, and particularly for the older Australians within our area, who are very excited and have a lot of ownership of this local GP superclinic. We are looking forward to the official opening next month. National School Chaplaincy and Student Welfare Program organisation that does a mighty effort in communities right around Australia. I speak of our school chaplains. Last week was Chappy Week, which is an annual event held to raise awareness of school chaplains and the valuable service they provide to students, parents and teachers in our schools. Chaplains provide spiritual but, more importantly, emotional support to school communities. They work at helping students find a better way to deal with issues including family breakdown, loneliness, drug abuse, depression, anxiety and, more recently, cyberbullying. Chaplains encourage responsible behaviour based on sound and acceptable social skills. In my day, you were the odd kid out in a classroom if you did not have a mum and a dad. Today, it is the opposite. Most kids in the state schools now come from a broken family-not all, but these are problems that chaplains are now confronted with. I remember we used to ride our bikes or walk many kilometres, in a safe community environment, to get to our school. Misbehaviour in a small, tight-knit community was reported expediently back to parents. Misbehaviour on the streets of our community was not tolerated and you were quickly dealt with by a responsible parent at home if you were throwing rotten mangoes at the next-door neighbour's dogs! More than ever before, Australian children are experiencing family problems, confusing relationships, friendship issues, peer pressure, self-esteem issues, bullying and depression. School life and playground dynamics have changed enormously since we all went to school. Without getting into the psychology of it, it seems that nowadays it is much more difficult for a kid just to be a kid. This is why I am a supporter of the chaplaincy program in my community and right across the nation. In a national government school survey recently, 92.5 per cent of chaplains reported dealing with bullying and harassment, 92 per cent reported dealing with peer relationships and loneliness, 91 per cent reported dealing with family relationships and 85 per cent reported dealing with students' sense of purpose and selfesteem.",224,Constituency Statements
209,Mr Buchholz (Wright) (10:41,"I rise to advise the House of a little-knownIn my electorate, bullying, harassment and peer pressure were major issues in the schoolyard and affected the well-being of a significant number of students. Fortunately, the school chaplaincy program has been adopted across several schools and significant changes have been noted. I often use schools in my electorate of Wright as an example of where the chaplaincy program has been a success. The obvious benefits which come from the chaplaincy program confirm the need for widespread participation during Chappy Week, which raises much needed funds for the program. Almost 50 per cent of Queensland state schools have a chappy, which I am very proud of, but unfortunately that leaves 600 state schools without a chappy, and in my opinion that is 600 schools too many. Climate Change possible Abbott government will become the greatest environmental wrecker in this nation's history then the recent call to remove 'environmental propaganda material, in particular postnormal science about climate change' by extremists at the Queensland National Party conference in 2012 should be more than sufficient. Twelve months earlier Liberal-National Party President and powerbroker, Bruce McIver, accused Queensland schoolteachers of 'brainwashing' their students about climate change, yet Queensland has, as we know, experienced unprecedented weather related natural disasters that have been strongly linked to the effects of global warming. Do the members of the Liberal-National Party expect all reports of the worldwide increase in the frequency and the intensity of extreme weather events be expunged from classroom textbooks? What about the measured increase in the acidity of seawater threatening mass extinction in the oceans that has been unarguably connected to the measured increase in the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide? Do members of the Liberal-National Party believe that chemistry, physics and geography textbooks should also be removed from school libraries, since these evident works of propaganda contain materials that could lead to students forming an opinion that carbon dioxide emissions could actually be responsible for the measured increase in average global temperatures? I call upon the Leader of the Opposition to repudiate the statements of the members of the Queensland Liberal-National Party and to affirm that any government that they may form will accept that global warming is without question being driven by carbon dioxide emissions. Further, I would ask that the Leader of the Opposition state there is a direct connection between the burning of fossil fuels and the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide and that urgent measures to rapidly reduce emissions are required. Not that I have an expectation that the Leader of the Opposition will respond to these requests, but I do have one other question: why is it that the leader of the party, distinguished by his own academic prowess in a country that prides itself on the education of its people and the success of its scientists, should reject all the evidence that shows an unarguable connection between carbon dioxide emissions, global warming, climate change and ocean acidification unless his only purpose is to use public ignorance of a complex issue for crude political advantage? In early May our atmosphere crossed an important and potentially dangerous milestone. Based on readings from the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii, we reached 400 ppm of CO2 for the first time in about three million years.

Mallee Electorate: Banking of regional Victoria where some lenders have not behaved with decency and commercial common sense in addressing large debt exposure. For many years now I have been providing advocacy to many constituents where economic downturn has caused their businesses to struggle. I believe strongly in standing in the breach for enterprising constituents whose only folly is to overextend themselves in difficult economic circumstances. I have enjoyed some success in this with help from the Australian Bankers Association, and many thanks are due to their CEO, Steve Munchenburg. Members of the ABA advise that negotiating the best outcome is the most sensible commercial option in these situations. Initially this involvement of mine was in relation to primary production, but of late has now involved commercial lending. I was extremely grateful for my Victorian state colleagues for legislating for compulsory debt mediation at my urging but it is now time to consider compulsory debt mediation for commercial lending as well. Both the ABA and its members agree with me that mediation can take a lot of pain out of the process and lead to sensible and commercial settlement of these matters. It forces the lender but most particularly the borrower to accept the fragile position that has developed. Sometimes borrowers can bury their head in the sand and this can lead to the lender taking unnecessary hasty action. All 44 members of the ABA agree with me-except one bank. I am so close now to naming this bank for some of the unconscionable conduct that they perpetrated on my constituents. I have rung the CEO and advised him. An unbelievable level of arrogance at midmanagement level has developed at this bank and I am tired of it. AllI ask for is that my constituents get treated properly and in a decent manner. I do not ask banks to forsake their security. The whole financial system would break down if we did that. Borrowers enter into commercial responsibilities and banks need to be conscious of that and honour it. AllI ask for is for this bank to comply with a protocol that has been established to the ABA and behave itself and comply with it. I have seen some terrible outcomes for my constituents-tragic outcomes in fact for my constituents-as a result of the bullying process that lawyers and liquidators can create by going the big biff, and I am tired of it. I am so close to naming this bank that if they do not lift their game, I will. BeforeI retire from this place I will show up at shareholder meetings and advise shareholders that this bank and the dividend it delivers is delivered out of the blood of my constituents. Behave yourself, do what the ABA recommends you do and what I have warned you to do. Jagajaga Electorate: West Heidelberg Neighbourhood Renewal Program Ms MACKLIN (Jagajaga-Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Minister for Disability Reform) (10:51): Throughout the electorate of Jagajaga there are some fantastic people who work very, very hard together to improve their communities.

211,Mr Forrest (Mallee) (10:47,"Long have I feared circumstances developing in my partIt is true that West Heidelberg faces very high levels of disadvantage, but the people who live there recognise that it is a place that has a lot to offer. There are people there who are very, very proud and very strong. In 2005 the Victorian state Labor government acted on the needs of West Heidelberg by including it in the Neighbourhood Renewal program. One of the goals of the program has been to increase community pride and participation. As this Neighbourhood Renewal program draws to a close in West Heidelberg, I want to acknowledge and celebrate the terrific work that has been done by a large number of volunteers and staff who have really made a difference to this area. This part of Melbourne actually includes the 1956 Olympic Village and of course that celebration saw much infrastructure come to this part of Melbourne. But over time the infrastructure has really been allowed to decline and it has been seriously neglected. The Neighbourhood Renewal program has really taken on the task of giving locals the opportunity to revitalise this great area. One of the best signs has been the rejuvenation of the Olympic Village shopping strip. It is no longer the very sorry place that it used to be. Now it is a place where families can come together. There is a popular Makers Market for craft makers and musicians. One of the other areas that has been rejuvenated is the Malahang Reserve where lots of people and families come. There is a skate park. We have seen terrific play equipment and landscaping put in and, instead of just a dry paddock, it is now a place where many, many people can enjoy themselves including at the annual Eid celebration. Another space has been the new community garden. That too is a place where people develop new friendships and connections. Soon we will see a new child and family centre at the Olympic Village Primary School campus of Charles La Trobe. All of these initiatives are part of the pride and development of 3081. TodayI am wearing my 'I love 3081' T-shirt. I am not the only one. I am reliably informed that these T-shirts are selling very well and I join with everyone in celebrating the terrific work that is been done by Neighbourhood Renewal. Hasluck Electorate: Edney Primary School fundraising effort which will provide an opportunity for its students to come to Canberra this year. For the last few months, the school community of Edney Primary School in High Wycombe has been raising money to enable its students to travel to Canberra this year, during Canberra's 100th birthday. Deputy Speaker, as you would be well aware, it is a big effort for any school to be able to travel to Canberra, but it is an even more costly and difficult effort for schools from my state of Western Australia to make it all the way to Canberra, which makes this achievement even greater. The sport teacher at Edney Primary School, Ms Cathy Heyes, has organised a fundraising drive as part of the school's Keep Fit program, to encourage the students not only to have a healthy lifestyle but also to raise money for their trip to Canberra. The students-and I think this is a very innovative approach-have been running or walking laps around their school oval to collect tokens. These tokens are then converted into 'kilometres' for the flights to Canberra. On a Wednesday morning before school, students and parents have been running and walking as many laps around the school oval as possible. In their Physical Education classes, the students have also been running and walking laps around the oval, all in an effort to gain more tokens to contribute to their Canberra trip. At each assembly, an update is",227,Constituency Statements
212,Mr Wyatt (Hasluck) (10:54,"One of my local schools is today concluding aprovided to the school community on how many laps have been walked or run and a map shows the students how many 'kilometres' they have covered in their walk to Canberra. What is particularly excellent about this project is that it has brought the entire school community together to strive for an important combined goal. Not only are the students getting to take ownership of what they have achieved; they are also being rewarded through points for their school factions. The entire project has been a great way to help the students truly appreciate just how special such a trip is, and Edney Primary School should be congratulated on their efforts. All too often in life we take things for granted, but I can imagine that this experience will not be one that the students will forget any time soon. The teachers have reported back to me that the project is also helping the students to get to know more about Canberra and about Australia generally. I have no doubt that the students will learn even more when they make it to Canberra in person to visit parliament and the many other sites that our capital city has to offer, particularly with all of the information around its centenary year. I congratulate the students who have taken up this project with great enthusiasm. I also thank the parents who have taken such an active involvement in it by walking and running laps with the students to help them accrue even more tokens. I know that the Principal, Shirley Duggan, and the rest of the leadership and staff at Edney Primary School have worked extremely hard to promote a close-knit and supportive school community. Finally, I offer my special thanks and congratulations to sports teacher, Cathy Heyes, whose coordination of this project has given the students a great learning opportunity. To the students, I say: Well done. You have achieved something quite amazing. Congratulations to you all. Entry 29 Dr LEIGH (Fraser-Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (10:57): Last Wednesday, I attended the launch of Entry 29, a co-working innovation space located just on the edge of the ANU campus in Acton. The name Entry 29 has a terrific connection to Canberra's history. In the federal capital design competition to design Canberra, 137 entries were submitted and the winner was the 29th entrant. In memory of Canberra's history and with an eye to Canberra's future, the Canberra community decided to call this innovation space Entry 29. Entry 29 is a community-driven, not-for-profit company, whose aim is to provide a social and inspiring work space, where entrepreneurs can connect, create and collaborate on new and exciting opportunities. It also offers meeting facilities, access to mentors and service providers, including access to business advisers and financiers. Entry 29 has been driven by Canberra's start-up community in direct response to the need for affordable, collaborative accommodation for entrepreneurs and start-ups. It adds significantly to Canberra's track record as Australia's ideas capital-and we need to turn these ideas into business ventures. This is where Australia has great potential but has historically been weak. Canberra has a wonderful record of innovation: Wi-Fi from the CSIRO; Nobel Prize winner Brian Schmidt's work on the expanding universe at ANU; and the great public policy entrepreneurs who populate the Australian Public Service. But the success of Entry 29 will be when one sees the office spaces around the ANU precinct being taken up by new business innovators, as one sees around the campuses of MIT and Stanford in the United States. The hard work of volunteers from this community has gotten the facility ready for business. I want to thank Rory Ford, Nick McNaughton, Marcus Dawes, Craig Thomler, Anna Pino, Mick Cardew-Hall from the ANU, Peter Davison as well as my friend Andrew Barr, the Minister for Economic Development, for the ACT government's support for this vital innovation space. I have spoken many times in this parliament about the need to support innovation. It was my pleasure last year to participate in a roundtable at Government House, along with Senator Sinodinos, entrepreneurs and venture capitalists. The roundtable was organised by Brian Schmidt in order to boost innovation in Australia. I regularly hold breakfast meetings for social entrepreneurs in my electorate because I believe we need to do more to encourage startups in the not-for-profit space. Entry 29 adds to that. It fills the gap that Australia has between the creation of ideas and the commercialisation of them. I wish the team at Entry 29 every success. 193, the time for members' constituency statements has concluded. South-East Queensland: Public Transport Debate resumed on motion by Mr Perrett: That this House: (1) opposes the Queensland Government's plans to cut local bus services in South East Queensland; (2) notes that these cuts will: (a) affect many vulnerable residents that can least afford it-seniors, pensioners, part-time working mums and dads and students; and (b) have broader consequences, such as: (i) negatively impacting on timetables for remaining services; (ii) reducing access to Park'n'Rides and connecting train services; and (iii) increasing the number of vehicles using on-street parking, clogging residential streets and putting more cars on local roads; (3) strongly supports better public transport in Queensland; (4) notes the: (a) changes are geared towards cutting 'community' bus services and moving towards a more profitable commuter service; (b) changes will create confusion and significantly increase travel time for commuters, and will be a backward step towards improving South East Queensland's public transport network; and (c) Queensland Government's privatisation plans regarding other state-owned assets and government services, and condemns any move to sell-out Queensland's public transport network; (5) calls on the Queensland Government to rule out these cuts to South East Queensland's public transport system; and (6) notes: (a) the Coalition's failure to condemn these cuts despite the Federal Leader of the Opposition and Federal Shadow Treasurer recently making flying stops to Queensland;",228,Constituency Statements
213,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Bc Scott,"Order! In accordance with standing order(b) that the Leader of the Opposition of the Brisbane City Council, the largest public transport bus provider area in Queensland, moved a motion calling on the Council to support residents who oppose these bus cuts and to reject the Queensland Government's planned bus route cuts; and (c) the Brisbane City Council rejected the Queensland Government's planned local bus route cuts you spend a lot of time coming through South-East Queensland and so will be particularly interested in this motion. I have moved: That this House: (1) opposes the Queensland Government's plans to cut local bus services in South East Queensland; (2) notes that these cuts will: (a) affect many vulnerable residents that can least afford it-seniors, pensioners, part-time working mums and dads and students … They will particularly affect people who are ill and have to travel to the QE2 hospital, the PA Hospital or the Mater hospital. The motion also asks the House to support better public transport in Queensland. I put this motion to the House in the context of the announcement by the Queensland Minister for Transport and Main Roads, in July last year, of a review into TransLink's South East Queensland bus network. I flag up-front that I have a bit of a conspiracy theory about this, and that is that it is a precursor to the selling off, the privatisation, of bus transportation. The Labor Party has a long, proud history of making commitments to public transport. However, the privatisation agenda of the Newman government has to be seen to be believed. The reality is that bus networks are not super viable. During peak hours they are, but, during the off-peak times, particularly when seniors travel, or when people who are ill need to go to hospital, bus companies do not make a profit. My understanding of this review is that it will be a precursor to privatisation. I will be interested to hear the contributions of those opposite on this motion. We have already seen a bit of a north-south divide when it comes to public transport in Brisbane. The Labor government is committed to looking after trains, buses and roads, particularly on the south side of the river. One of the first things that I made sure happened, going back to 2004, was the Elizabeth Street rail crossing initiative down in Beaudesert Road, something that the member for Wright would travel through pretty regularly. There used to be a wait of up to 13 minutes. Then we secured federal government funding to make sure that the boom gates were taken off Beaudesert Road, and that freed up transport all the way down to Beaudesert and beyond so people were not sitting there waiting. We all know that if you are sitting for 13 or 14 minutes at a boom gate you are not using your time productively and it is not good for business and it is not good for environment, with cars pumping out carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide-and diesel engines running at that low speed put out more diesel particulate matter, which is carcinogenic. So it is always good to have public transport and roads working as efficiently as possible. With that in mind, I wrote to the transport minister, the Hon. Scott Emerson, who is one of the few state MPs whose electorate includes areas both north of the river and south of the river. He shares quite a few suburbs with me. I asked him: what can we do to make sure we have public transport in Brisbane operating as efficiently as possible? Obviously buses are part of the campaign, but it is also about making sure our rail crossings are safe. I have two of",230,Private Members Business
214,Mr Perrett (Moreton,"Government Whip) (11:00): Deputy Speaker Scott, I know the worse level crossing locations in Brisbane. In fact, I refer to an article in the Brisbane Times that rated the 10 worse level crossings in Queensland according to train drivers, and two of them-one is at Rocklea and one is at Coopers Plains-are in my electorate. Interestingly the one at Coopers Plains-I looked at the speech by former member for Moreton Gary Hardgrave to see if he had made any comments on this and in his first speech he said, 'I will fix this intersection'. That was back in March 1996. With that in mind, I wrote to the Hon. Scott Emerson, the Minister for Transport and Main Roads, and pointed out that two of the 10 worse Queensland crossings are in my electorate and would there be funding available. And he said: 'Yes. The state government does believe in introducing grade separations to remove level crossings.' He said, 'In fact, we're doing it at two locations in Brisbane'-both on the north side-'Robinson Road at Geebung and Telegraph Road at Bracken Ridge'. Both of these are on the north side. In fact, I quote from his letter. He said: If you would like to upgrade the level crossings in your electorate, I would welcome you securing Commonwealth government funding. It is a letter from Scott Emerson, so it is worth something. AlthoughI have seen when a letter from him does not necessarily mean that it will result in anything. I notice that he wrote to the federal government seeking money for the big public transport infrastructure that the City of Brisbane is calling out for, something that will benefit my electorate, something that will benefit the north side, the electorate of Brisbane. As we reach rail capacity at the South Brisbane Grey Street Bridge in three years time, this will impact on trains all the way to the Gold Coast, all the way to the border basically. An opposition member: There's no money. level of government, and built into that an agreement of fifty-fifty funding for the availability payment for the private sector financially for the project-just to alleviate those concerns about there not being any money available. So our transport minister, Anthony Albanese, responded saying, 'Yep; tick. We'll do all of those things.' They asked for funding principles, we agreed to every single one of the funding principles. Every single one. But then Scott Emerson went into the cabinet and was rolled by the Deputy Premier, Jeff Seeney. He was rolled by Jeff Seeney. I will quote from the letter that Scott Emerson wrote to the transport minister, Mr Albanese. He said: OnceI have your confirmation of the funding principles, it is my intention to seek cabinet approval to engage with the market to confirm the constructability and validate the business case estimates. I will also instruct my department to develop an MoU between our respective departments to detail arrangements moving forward. A direct quote from the letter from Scott Emerson saying, 'We're keen to do this.' He was saying, 'I'll be out there fighting for it'. Infrastructure Australia, that body well-respected on both sides of parliament, has said that it is its No. 1 priority. It will benefit the people in South Queensland, and South-East Queensland and my electorate of Moreton in particular. Without it we will be moving towards gridlock not just because of rail but also because of roads. Once the trains reach capacitythey cannot pull any more train seats out of the trains going all the way to the Gold Coast; you cannot have people standing for an hour or an hour and a half going to work in Brisbane. I am",231,Private Members Business
215,Mr Perrett,"It is interesting to see: Scott Emerson requested $750 million from eachnot sure if that is what those opposite are suggesting, but the federal opposition leader has said, 'No, no, we won't fund any urban public rail project. We will not fund it.' However, I thought, 'Wait a minute: in 2010 didn't the opposition leader commit to funding a rail project?' I looked into it and, sure enough, as long as it was a rail project on the north side, not the south side, he was happy to find money for it. But then, when it comes to 2013 we have a different story. Sadly, the people in my electorate are suffering because of this failure to commit to public transport, both to the bus network and to the trains. The reality is the Queensland Minister for Transport and Main Roads, Scott Emerson, could not give a quicker flick past when it came to this TransLink South-East Queensland review. We will see in the next couple of weeks how the Lord Mayor responds to these cuts to services that have already been flagged as impacting particularly the people of Acacia Ridge-a suburb that is crying out for public transport. It is an elderly suburb with a Labor councillor, so maybe it is not a voice that is being heard in the council chamber like it should. The reality is, despite Steve Griffiths great efforts, the people of Acacia Ridge are going to be shafted by the Lord Mayor and by the transport minister, Scott Emerson. Ms GAMBARO (Brisbane) (11:10): I rise to speak on the motion that has just been moved by the member for Moreton, who seems to have a bit of a chip. Every time. I go to his electorate he calls me 'that person over there who comes from the northside'. I am delighted to speak to the motion that he has moved today because we need to put a few facts on the table. As a member that represents an inner-city electorate that contains the CBD of Brisbane and numerous inner-city suburbs, I am very conscious of the importance of public transport to my electorate and to my constituents. I will start on the Cross River Rail because he mentioned the Cross River Rail. It is a cruel hoax what you did the other day announcing the Cross River Rail because these projects are normally funded 50-50. But what you and your party did was offer to provide 25 per cent of the funding and claw back the other 75 per cent through GST revenues. That is not a fair deal; that is not a good deal and that is why it was rejected. The project will cost over $4 billion. You know it; you have got no money to contribute. All you are doing is providing a cruel hoax on the people of Brisbane. Mr Perrett interjectingMs GAMBARO: The member for Moreton knows better than that. word 'you'. Address your comments through the chair. Ms GAMBARO: I will refer to the member for Moreton by his correct title. chair, I try to get people to direct their comments through the chair. Ms GAMBARO: When you go out and announce a rail project with no proper funding, that is a cruel hoax on the people of Brisbane. That is what this government does all the time: make an announcement, worry about the funding later. No one doubts that it is a good project. I am very supportive of the project if there is funding. There is no funding that is indicatedin the perilous state of the budget-to proceed with a project of this magnitude. It is important for us to discuss this topic because I have workers making the daily commute in and out of the city, students going to universities and pensioners using local services to do their shopping. The use of public transport is very wide and very varied.",232,Private Members Business

217,The Deputy Speaker,"It is a habit of many in both chambers. As the occupier of thisThe challenge for the three levels of government in our capital cities across Australia over the next 50 years will be how we manage our infrastructure challenges, how we control the congestion issues and how we find the right balance between investment in public transport and investment in road infrastructure. This motion is essentially now outdated because a lot has happened in this space since the member for Moreton submitted his motion, which is sadly something that he has not even bothered to keep up-to-date with. The motivation behind reviewing the bus network was never to cut or decrease services. As the member for Moreton well knows, the investment in new buses is not infinite and it is not unlimited. So it is really important that the buses are used efficiently and are used effectively to provide the best value for the commuters. There is nothing more frustrating than watching some buses carry two or three passengers on a consistent basis go past and then the next minute seeing some buses leaving passengers behind bus stops because they are so full. If Labor members think that those situations are okay then they should stand up here and say so. The motivation behind the bus review was not to cut services. The Newman government's bus review was announced in July last year because people were walking away from buses. As the Queensland Minister for Transport and Main Roads, Scott Emerson, said when he announced the review in the middle of 2012, the aim of the review was to eliminate service duplication, to manage the infrastructure capacity, to get more people on public transport by simplifying the network, to get better connectivity between services and models and to redirect those services to routes where there is overcrowding. Interestingly, those 10 worse performing routes cost more than $5 million a year with less than five per cent of the cost paid for through fares. As we know, the Queensland government's agency TransLink handed down the review in March and it was released for public consultation. There was immediately a massive reaction, with 40,000 website visits in the first week and a half since the report was made public and 1,700 comments were received in the first 24 hours. Many of my constituents contacted my office. There was also concern raised about the TransLink proposal by the Brisbane City Council. I think the problem with the TransLink proposal was that it tried to overhaul the whole bus system in Brisbane as opposed to just making the necessary changes. Consequently, Minister Emerson handed over the Brisbane portion of the review to the Brisbane City Council. He also made it clear that there would be no changes to bus routes in Brisbane without the full support of the Brisbane City Council. Lord Mayor Graham Quirk said: It is my view that the proposed changes represented a revolution rather than an evolution in public transport services. The BCC then conducted its own review and handed down the revised review in April. There was a four-week consultation period until 20 May, with a report back to the Queensland government due by 1 June. The Brisbane City Council's bus network review assessed 235 routes. They identified 146 routes with no changes and removed nine routes. They had 80 service changes, including 46 timetable changes, 34 route changes and three route amalgamations. Of the nine routes removed most of them had a ridiculously low number of passengers per trip. Some of them already had services available from the new BUZ or CityGlider services, which are incredibly popular with their high-frequency services. Most of the 80 changes were timetable variations. However, 19 services are to get improvements, including extra stops and rerouting as well as servicing previously underserviced areas of Doolandella, Calamvale and Drewvale. The changes that affect my electorate are as follows. There is an additional stop on the Maroon CityGlider along Macgregor Terrace to service the Bardon shops. How bad is that? It is a good thing, member for Moreton. Rerouting the 199 through the Ivory Street tunnel to improve travel timesMs GAMBARO: Hang on, we're going west now. We are off to the western suburbs now. Adding a stop on the 384 at Red Hill will provide passengers with additional city travel options in peak hours. Rerouting the 310 service through the airport link will improve travel times. Extending the P341 to service Fitzgibbon and Rogan roads will provide direct access to Chermside, the Royal Brisbane Hospital and the CBD for the very first time. There will be better access to the Royal Brisbane Hospital on the 363 by altering the route via Butterfield Street. These are some of the positive changes that have come about for my constituents from the bus network review. Following the review being handed down I received a representation from a young constituent regarding bus services from the inner west suburbs. She raised the issue of bus routes from Ashgrove, Paddington and Bardon and the fact that there is no direct link between these suburbs and the University of Queensland. How crazy is that? All of these people living in the western suburbs cannot go directly to the University of Queensland. They have to travel into the city and then they have to travel out to UQ. I bet there are a lot of UQ students who would welcome that. A huge number of students reside in these areas and attend UQ at St Lucia. Currently there are students living in these suburbs who are required to catch a bus to the CBD and transfer to a bus that goes back to the University of Queensland. That is despite the fact that there are many major roads and many links towards the University of Queensland from these suburbs without travelling back through the city and adding more travel time and more congestion for students wishing to travel directly to university to attend their classes. I have been encouraged by the particular student that contacted me and I encouraged her to make a submission to the review. I hope this issue will be addressed in future and I know that the member for Ryan will have many students in her electorate with similar issues. I would like to draw the attention of the chamber to the fact that despite the desperate politicking of the member for Moreton and many others, the Newman government actually halved the public transport fare increases of the former Bligh government-and he did not mention that today-and before losing office the Bligh Labor government announced an annual increase to public transport fares of 15 per cent. The Newman government has halved that increase to 7.5 per cent for this year and next year. That is a very positive outcome for many of the constituents that use public transport. I challenge the ALP members who follow me in this debate to say whether they agree with the fact that public transport fares were going to increase by 15 per cent had their party been re-elected in the state government in Queensland. The second positive initiative the Newman government introduced is free public transport after nine journeys, and that is very welcome thing for many people in my electorate. (Time expired)",233,Private Members Business
218,Honourable Members Interjecting,"Ms Gambaro interjectingIt fails to address one core fact in the debate in the last week in Brisbane on the provision of public transport services. She raises the question of fares. In fact, what has been floated by the Liberal National Party government through the pages of The Courier Mail in the last week is the proposal to increase train fares during peak times in order to deal with the impending crisis in Brisbane's passenger rail network. Secondly, the way of dealing with such a crisis is in fact to proceed with a project which the member has herself locally backed but which her national leader has publicly repudiated, and that is the Cross River Rail. The Cross River Rail was proposed initially with a feasibility study when I was Prime Minister of the country, with $20 million. It was put to Infrastructure Australia and subsequently with the support of the state Liberal National Party governmentand prior to that, the state Labor government-it was approved as a priority Infrastructure Australia project. The state government asked for $715 million from the federal government. It wrote a letter through state transport minister, Minister Emerson. Each of the conditions was met by the federal transport minister, Anthony Albanese. Then on budget night, they walked away from the project. Therefore, we have had the member for Brisbane jumping up and down locally saying that she sort of supports this project, but her federal leader has now repudiated it. State transport minister Emerson has gone around the place saying, 'Well, we kind of like this thing. I know that I have written to the minister about it. I know that I have asked for $715 million. I know that I have promised to actually match it but, whoops, the national leader, Mr Abbott, has said that they cannot do that because they cannot be seen to be politically cooperating with the federal Labor government.' This is just part of a broader picture. It goes to the provision of public transport services across all of Brisbane. No. 1, we have been talking about the Cross River Rail, which until budget night had bipartisan support. No. 2, we are talking about local bus services, which the Liberal National Party government took a meat axe to in their statement as a government some months ago. Members such as those supporting this motion rose up as one in support of their local communities and, as a result, the state Liberal National Party government ran a million miles, passed a $20 million hospital pass to the Liberal National Party Brisbane City Council and said, 'You find the savings but, please, don't find those savings until after the federal election.' There is absolutely no guarantee whatsoever that these bus routes will be preserved in the future once a certain electoral event occurs. This is part and parcel of a broader phenomenon that we see unfolding from the Liberal National Party in Brisbane in particular. We have had them rip the guts out of health services at our hospitals because of the cut by the state government of 4,000-plus health workers. Ms Gambaro: Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek to intervene.

Indeed, a senior Queensland Labor figure to whom I was speaking this morning said, 'My God, what are the federal members of Labor doing down there? Challenge them: when was the last time they were on a bus?'

231,Mrs Prentice,"As we heard from the member for Brisbane, what did the Labor statethe propaganda out there. Who gets the fares? The state government get the fares. Yet the Brisbane City Council put new buses on the road and put in new community services. I note with fascination the point in the motion that says: … changes are geared towards cutting 'community' bus services … It was the Brisbane City Council that introduced the Spring Hill Loop, in the member for Brisbane's area-a free service for the community, because they knew that elderly people had trouble getting up the hill to Wickham Terrace and the hospitals. We went to the Labor state government and said, 'Will you please contribute,' and their answer was a resounding no. In fact, to support the community, they even went one better! They used to have a government bus that supported their public servants travelling from Boundary Road down to the government precinct. When the council put on this free community bus service, not only did they not help us; they cancelled their own government bus and told the public servants to use the free community bus. That is the sort of support that we get from Labor when it comes to public transport. For the record, when we talk about the increase in buses, we mean the Brisbane City Council built two new depots, with a third on its way, and they built a new bus-building factory that is churning out one new bus every three days. We compare that record of over 800 buses in eight years with that of the Labor council. How many would you think they delivered in 13 years-maybe a couple of hundred at least? They averaged just 30 a year. They promised loads, just like this Federal Labor government. They promised the world. They delivered a yearly average of 30 buses in 13 years of government in the Brisbane City Council. That is the track record of Labor when it comes to public transport. They might try and talk about it-never let it be said that you would ever see a member on a bus-but the bottom line is that they never deliver. Indeed, if we are talking about patronage, despite a 24 per cent increase in population in those 13 years, patronage on the buses only increased by 10 per cent. Yet, under the LNP council, patronage increased by 66 per cent to a record 80 million patrons in 2011-12. That is because the Brisbane City Council pensioned off the old Labor buses. Every single bus is now air conditioned. Buses have disability access. Mr Perrett interjectingwas take the fares and increase them. It is a disgrace. That is the sort of interest. They helped finance itembarrassment. They do not support buses. You would never see them riding on one themselves. And yet they stand here today and try to lecture us on what to do.

They have no idea. They have failed the people of Brisbane and South-East Queensland time and time again, and it is a great embarrassment to them. him for it. It goes way beyond simply bus services in Brisbane. It talks about public transport in Queensland. It talks about the LNP state government's privatisation plans regarding state assets and government services. It condemns their sell-off of Queensland's public transport network, road, rail and ports. To confine this to simply bus services in Brisbane is a nonsense, because that is not the intention or the wording of the motion by the member for Moreton. The LNP Queensland government is an object lesson in what conservative governments do: slash, cut and demoralise the Public Service; reduce services, including bus services; and refuse to invest in the future. They abandon those most in need and let them fend for themselves. Every Queensland state LNP candidate campaigned for improved bus services, yet they are utterly silent as the LNP state government cuts, slashes and burns public transport in Queensland. How disingenuous and deceptive they were. Assets were sold to assist in funding investments in infrastructure made more urgent during the devastation of the 2011 flood. That is what the previous government did: selling assets in Queensland to make sure that we could invest in infrastructure, jobs and growth. But this LNP state government is simply slashing and burning. The LNP state members and the federal members opposite, my opponents opposite, take the blowtorch to the Public Service and would do so if they got onto the treasury bench federally. Front-line services, including bus services, are under threat in Queensland, all in the name of the right-wing ideology of economic rationalism. They claim that it is because they cannot afford them. They quoted a $100 billion debt level, a figure made up by former Treasurer Peter Costello. After campaigning in the last election against asset sales and then using rubbery figures, the LNP state government in Queensland set about slashing 2,000 full-time jobs from Transport and Main Roads, including closing down the Main Roads office in the Ipswich and West Moreton region, in the heart of Ipswich Central. They closed it down. At the time, we had major road infrastructure and public transport taking place in Ipswich. The LNP state government have abdicated their responsibilities for services not just in rail and not just in bus services but also in education and health, slashing bus services in South East Queensland and asking councils to pick up the cost. Now there are 111 bus services in South-East Queensland that are on the chopping block. It was only strong community protest in the Somerset region, led by fearless Somerset regional councillor, Jim Madden, and community groups which saved route 529 from Toogoolawah to Ipswich. This is a service that makes the people in the Brisbane Valley able to get to health, education, recreational and other services and pursuits in Ipswich. This is the only viable public transport option for the people in the Somerset region who require access for medical services in Ipswich and Brisbane. But those opposite have been silent as Campbell Newman has slashed and burned services-not just bus services. So those opposite have some things to explain. We saw the",238,Private Members Business

That is what she fails to do. She does not seriously believe that the ratepayers of Brisbane paid for those buses? They were purchased by funding from the state Labor government. SoI wonder how people in Queensland are meant to get to work if the bus services are slashed across Brisbane and the rest of South-East Queensland? To hospitals and to universities? This is the heartlessness of those opposite. This is the heartlessness and the silence; the inaction and inertia from the LNP state members opposite from Queensland. Campbell Newman claims that he wants change, but Campbell Newman wants change in Queensland for the worse. He deceived the people of Queensland; he deceived them on bus services, he deceived them on rail services and on road infrastructure. What about the rail crossing in Brisbane?

CanI also make the point, while we are talking about the blowtorch to the public service: in the last Bligh-led term of Labor's last legacy, there was an increase of 23,000 public servants. There was a mandate that was set upon by this government. Twenty-three thousand public servants: we have made a commitment that when we get in I think we will make rational cuts to the tune of around 11 or 14,000 personnel by not renewing contracts. No-one should ever dance on the grave of someone losing their job, and it is an area that I do feel uncomfortable with and would like to speak on in another debate in a different forum. CouldI also remind this House as to why we would be speaking about the public service when we have been talking about cuts to public transport services in Queensland? It is because they cannot talk about the blowout of the economy up there when it comes to putting in a water grid when not a litre has gone through? We have a desalination plant up there which has not had one litre of waterthrough. I thank the honourable members for their assistance in highlighting the devastating inefficiencies of the Labor government in Queensland. Democracy is a beautiful thing. Guess what it shows-people have had enough in Queensland. It is widespread. I do not think there is a state anywhere in Australia which saw such a widespread shift away from the inefficient, dysfunctional Labor government, which we saw up in Queensland under the direction of Campbell Newman. A recent poll, in the newspapers this weekend, has Campbell Newman at the same level of popularity as on the day he was elected to the parliament of Queensland. That is a rousing endorsement for what Campbell Newman and his government are doing up there! That is waste and mismanagement which we as the LNP will have to preside over for many years. Getting the credit rating back for Queensland is one of our priorities in doing that so that we can secure funds to build the infrastructure needed for the future. In closing, Acting Deputy Speaker, I can assure you that, when this Labor government come to this house and speak on state issues, the only reason is that they have simply run out of things to say from a federal perspective. It is an embarrassment. Hopefully democracy will rule and show the true way on 14 September in Queensland. (Time expired) Debate interrupted.

249,Mr Oakeshott (Lyne) (11:42,"I move:to the pocket of the state government-costing the average customer somewhere around $100 extra each year. This is not spending on new poles or wires or better reliability; it is just extra dividends alone to a state government. In my view, that definitely a rip-off and a rort. The concept of gold plating came from my region. One resident, a Burrell Creek farmer, took on a local electricity company on this issue and was successful despite, on the way through, being challenged legally to prove his case. He did so, the state government tentacle backed off and the term 'gold plating' is now part of the language of public policy. Unfortunately, part of the mythology that we have a national electricity law that can be changed or altered by this parliament remains to be corrected. We cannot in this parliament at this moment do anything to amend the laws known as the national electricity law. This tries to address it. Currently, the national electricity law is what is known as a 'uniform' national law, but it is only so by virtue of the adoption of a South Australian act of parliament by all other state governments and territories. The National Electricity (South Australia) Act 1996 has been adopted by other states and territories forming what is known as the national electricity market. The purpose of this bill is to adopt, as far as practicable, the existing National Electricity Law and to make the National Electricity Law actually an act of the Commonwealth-one set of laws that can be amended by agreement to the benefit of all consumers rather than being blocked to the benefit of one state government. This bill would incorporate as far as possible the existing Australian Energy Market Act 2004. The bill would adopt, in as far as possible, the Australian Energy Market Commission Establishment Act 2004, which is also a South Australian act, to make the commission a statutory body of the Commonwealth. I have brought this bill before the House because there is widespread consensus that the electricity sector has experienced a profound regulatory failure when it comes to network prices. Electricity network prices are determined by the Australian Energy Regulator under the National Electricity Rules subject to review by the Australian Competition Tribunal under the National Electricity Law. The national electricity objective seeks to balance investment with price. But in recent years that balance has been utterly lost. In a further red herring, governments are failing to deliver the national electricity objective. Some state energy ministers are now blaming the Australian Energy Regulator despite detailed independent reviews that prove them wrong. This has been acknowledged in the Council of Australian Governments communique of 25 July 2012. It was acknowledged by the Prime Minister herself in a speech on 7 August. This issue has been picked up by the Liberal National Party. Wrongly, the Leader of the Opposition on 8 August 2012 was asked: do you think there has been gold plating of the wires and cables in some states? Effectively the response was: it is a federal government regulator. It is Julia Gillard's own regulator so if there is a problem it is her fault. That is wrong. That has been proven wrong by detailed independent reviews. The Productivity Commission's report titled Electricity Network Regulatory Frameworks, which was released on 18 August, is one such example that I would encourage the opposition to consider when making further statements in this area. The key fact that we need to fix is that the National Electricity Law is a creature of state parliaments. State parliaments are reaping dividends from this market failure. We need to address it and get a uniform national set of laws. It is not a take over. It is trying to get a fair and balanced playing field in the interests of consumers, not in the interests of state governments. Mr Frydenberg: Hear, hear! concentrate on a very important issue. The government and a lot of people recognise the need to make reforms to the electricity sector, particularly with the objective of reducing the pressure on household budgets. I have no doubt this is what has motivated the member for Lyne. A lot of what he said in the House back in October-having read his speech-I have some sympathy with. That said, however, the government has indicated it cannot provide support for the bill. The reason for this isMr Oakeshott: A big stick. Through the standing Council on Energy and Resources, an energy reform agenda is being progressed, as it has for many decades, cooperatively with other jurisdictions and it has been endorsed by COAG. There are many factors contributing to rising electricity prices across Australia, particularly in my home state. The member for McMahon, who is here in the chamber with me, and also the member for Lyne hail from New South Wales. Most notably there have been concerns about what is regarded as an over investment in electricity infrastructure, the so-called gold plating of the network. In the shadows of this claim there has also been a lot of focus on the New South Wales government continuing to draw a dividend from their state owned corporations in the generation and transmission space. What has been interesting is there has no doubt been a significant shift in household usage of electricity. You can see that over a number of decades. This has been driven by airconditioners in particular being a lot more available, and by the use of electricity for hot water heating and for pool pumps. These are the big three drivers of jumps in demand, plus the fact that the size of households has increased. This has meant that networks based on previous demand profiles have been unable to keep pace with changes in demand. Since 2000, electricity generators and transmission agencies and distributors have been investing in dealing with this issue-bearing in mind that in greenfield sites households already pay for new investment to match predicted demand. A December 2010 report from the New South Wales Department of Industry and Investment, titled NSW Electricity Network and Prices Inquiry found that prices in New South Wales have increased by 43 per cent over the last three years, and they are expected to rise by about the same amount over the next three. The report went on to conclude that there are two main drivers for this. The biggest driver of network costs, as I suggested earlier-with the more than doubling of the annual capital expenditure and increased operating expenditure for New South Wales transmission and distribution businesses since 2004, driven by a growth in demand for electricity, replacing ageing networks, enhance reliability and performance standards-is the escalation of opex. This rapid rate of growth is set to continue for the remainder of the current price period. It is noted in this report that there is an 80 per cent increase in the IPART 2010 determination of regulated retail tariffs attributable to network charges. The second important driver, which has received a lot of focus recently, is the introduction and expansion of state and national government schemes that encourage the development of renewable energy sources, and the cost of these schemes being recovered from customers through electricity bills, and not funded by taxpayers. These costs are expected to jump",241,Bills

251,Mr Husic,"You keep talking about that big stick, member for Lyne. Keep it away.sharply in 2011 because of the recovery aims of New South Wales government's solar bonus scheme. Just to give you a suggestion of the impact, those, as they are passed from the retail customers in Country Energy's areas, may add 10 per cent from 1 July. In the EnergyAustralia and Integral Energy footprints, you can expect price increases of between five per cent and six per cent respectively. So, it is clear we need to have reforms to bring down prices, and we need to do this in cooperation with states and territories. Not having that cooperation would lead to further uncertainty in the market because states have their own energy laws, which I understand the member for Lyne was trying to deal with in the legislation that has been put forward to the House. I do not have as much time to speak on this issue as I would have liked, but certainly priority needs to be given to ensuring the delivery of agreed market reforms. We do not want to hinder further progress by adding another layer to the mix. We have seen new rules for the regulation of networks, and we would hope that new ways of reducing these prices can be developed. member's bill, the National Electricity Bill 2012. Australians want to see real action to reverse the huge increases in electricity prices seen across our nation since 2007. Unfortunately, this bill from the member for Lyne does nothing to address those concerns, and fails to address the real underlying issues that have caused electricity prices to rise. Prices began to rise significantly in 2007 as a result of rising charges for our energy networks, including overinvestment in infrastructure such as poles and wires, increases in wholesale energy costs, and other government policies-most notably the carbon tax. First and foremost, the member for Lyne voted to pass the world's only economy-wide carbon tax. SoI do question his genuine commitment towards lowering the cost of electricity for Australians. The carbon tax is expressly designed to make electricity more expensive, and to hurt the hip pocket of Australians. We know that higher electricity prices as a result of the carbon tax are already having a significant impact on Australians. In March a major energy company revealed that 65,000 customers a month are seeking extensions to pay their rising electricity and gas bills. In addition, there is the 14.5 per cent average increase in electricity costs for our manufacturing sector, which only adds to the pressure on jobs. Worse than that, Australia's carbon tax does nothing to help the environment. Instead of making any real difference in Australia, we have to buy almost 100,000,000 tonnes of emissions reduction from overseas at an annual cost to Australia by 2020 of approximately $3.7 billion per year, each year, rising to $57 billion per year by 2050. The Prime Minister promised last December to reduce power bills by $250 a year and to date has done nothing to further that goal. The Prime Minister noted that there had been significant overinvestment in poles and wires, but failed to point out that all of this occurred under decades of state Labor governments and has been noticeably silent on the situation in Queensland. We know that in Queensland in the five years to 2012 capital expenditure on poles and wires increased to more than $11 billion, resulting in an increased debt of more than $6 billion. This debt and consequent interest repayments are passed on to consumers. As the Newman government noted in its submission to the Senate Select Committee on the Electricity Prices, these costs have been the key driver of electricity price rises over this",243,Bills
252,Mrs Prentice (Ryan) (11:53,"I rise to speak on the member for Lyne's privateperiod of time. The federal Labor government only made this pain worse by imposing the carbon tax. While the vast majority of regulatory responsibility was transferred to the Australian Energy Regulator from 1 July 2010, this is only in relation to investment in electricity distribution. That change, therefore, does not address the many other important policies which have driven up electricity prices. Ultimately I understand that significant work is being undertaken across all levels of government in Australia to address what reforms can be implemented, a process not significantly addressed by the member for Lyne's private member's bill today, nor is that process assisted with the introduction of new taxes such as the carbon tax and the mining tax. Australians do not currently have a government that is looking after their interests. As the Leader of the Opposition highlighted in his reply to the budget, the Prime Minister guaranteed that there would be no carbon tax under a government she leads, but there is. The Prime Minister guaranteed more than 165 times that there would be a surplus, but there is not, and there never will be under this Labor government. Australia is instead now faced with seven deficits totalling $220 billion. On day one of an incoming coalition government, we will begin the process of removing the carbon tax. Legislation to scrap the carbon tax will be the first legislation to be introduced in the new parliament. The coalition will abolish the carbon tax because that is the quickest way to reduce power prices and to take pressure off the cost of living and job security. The coalition will offer hope, reward and opportunity. member's bill, the National Electricity Bill 2012, just asked me, as we were sitting here, how long it would take me to get to the real crux of this. I said that I have it in my introductory paragraph. Make no mistake: the carbon tax is the biggest driver of electricity prices. The member of Lyne knows it, the member opposite knows it, as does everyone else in this chamber. There can be no doubt that the reason electricity prices have started to climb so dramatically is the carbon pricing mechanism. Honourable member interjectingThe member for Lyne, who is sitting beside me, knows that it is a tax and certainly the public know it is a tax. The coalition signalled this before the carbon tax was implemented by the Labor government and since it came into effect on 1 July 2012 we have seen the impact it has had on power pricing. Honourable member interjectingwho are honest with their constituents-and I am sure they are all honest-if they are absolutely upfront and frank with their constituents, would be telling them that the reason their electricity prices are rising is the carbon tax. The consumer price index figures for the first quarter in which the carbon tax was applied confirmed the impact it had on the cost of electricity and on the cost of day-to-day living. Electricity prices had a 15.3 per cent rise and household gas and miscellaneous fuels had a 14.2 per cent rise. These were the largest quarterly increases on record. How the government can consider such a rise a modest increase is, quite frankly, unbelievable. How rose tinted are the glasses they are wearing?",244,Bills

255,Mr Mccormack,"There are certainly price rises in your electorate and Labor membersHowever, this bill, which seeks to make the national electricity law an act of parliament, has so far received no support from either side of the parliament. The Minister for Energy and Resources at the time this bill was introduced, the Hon. Martin Ferguson, stated: The states do not control the regulatory authorities that set prices and any suggestion that they do has no basis in fact and is a cheap shot … it is a complex reform that won't be solved by cheap front page headlines. Mr Ferguson is not the minister anymore-because the Prime Minister is running out of loyal lieutenants, quite frankly, and all the ministers are getting lumped with portfolio after portfolio. There is another one sitting opposite. The shadow minister for energy and resources, the Hon. Ian Macfarlane, has said that the coalition understands energy market reform is a long-term process and 'fragmented or political attempts to address the issue of rising power prices will have no meaningful impact on the energy sector.' In my electorate of Riverina, I have been contacted by a number of constituents, on a daily basis, about their ever-increasing power bills and especially the note printed on these power bills stating: NSW Govt estimates that the Federal carbon tax and green energy schemes add about $316 a year to a typical 7MWh household bill … Just consider that: households who are already overburdened by rising grocery and fuel costs now are copping $316 in additional costs due to the carbon tax. In December last year the Prime Minister promised to reduce power bills by $250 a year, and yet, as the member for Kooyong knows, nothing has happened. There was certainly nothing in the budget recently which would assist in bringing power bills down. Indeed, in the budget we see even further costs imposed upon families who are already struggling with household costs. A simple way to reduce power bills to some extent would be to scrap the carbon tax. It is going to be the first order, the first bill, the first priority, of, hopefully, an incoming coalition government to do just that. The coalition has promised that, should we have the good fortune to be given the faith of the Australian people to form government after 14 September.

I know he is worried about the fact that the Nationals are going to take the seat of Lyne, which they will after 14 September. I know how keen David Gillespie is to deal with the carbon tax, the tax that we were promised would never come in but which did, thanks to the government that the member for Lyne keeps maintaining a protection racket for, thanks to the cobbled-together government that he gave power to.

The motion in front of us today argues strongly that the government should reconsider its decision not to prioritise this road and indeed should match the coalition's funding commitment of $1.5 billion to go towards it. What is the East West Link, you may ask. It is an 18-kilometre stretch of road which would go from the end of the Eastern Freeway in Melbourne, tunnel underneath most of inner-city Carlton, the cemetery and Royal Parade, and join up with the Tullamarine Freeway and the Western Ring Road. As I said, the proposal is to tunnel from the end of the Eastern Freeway",246,Bills

Now this is the Victorian government's No. 1 priority project. It is also the RACV's top priority infrastructure project that it believes we should be investing in. On7 May this year, the Napthine government said that it would make this project happen if there was a federal contribution towards it. It made a commitment in its budget on 7 May of $294 million towards this particular project, and it said it would start next year and it would finish within five years. The initial stage, stage 1, which this would fund, is the most difficult and complex stage but arguably also the most important-that is, connecting the end of the Eastern Freeway to the Tullamarine Freeway. It would cost in the vicinity of $6 billion to $8 billion and, from their analyses already, most of this could in fact be funded by private contributions. But they also need a federal government contribution, and the Premier of Victoria has specifically called for a $1.5 billion contribution from the Commonwealth government, which is what Tony Abbott, on behalf of the coalition, has committed to. This would take five years to complete if this was to begin next year, as stated. This is such an important piece of infrastructure; it would be the most important road in Melbourne to be developed to ease the congestion pressures. Anybody who has been to Melbourne in recent times, or lives in Melbourne, as you do, Mr Deputy Speaker Cheeseman, or just outside it, would know the amount of congestion that is coming on to Melbourne's roads. There has been a marked difference over the past five, 10 or 20 years. Whereas previously it used to be a half-hour journey from my electorate of Aston into the city in the mornings, now it can be a 60or 90-minute journey, if not more, just to get into the CBD. The cost of this congestion is already estimated to be $2.7 billion per year in the city of Melbourne. And because Melbourne is growing so rapidly, in fact it is the fastest-growing city in Australia, the Bureau of Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Economics believes that the cost of congestion will escalate to $6.1 billion by 2020. So we are going to see a doubling of the cost of congestion by 2020 if we do not take any remedial action now. For those who live in electorates like mine and yours, Mr Deputy Speaker Cheeseman, such as the member for Kooyong and the member for Corio, congestion is one of their absolute top issues. They know that when they are spending time stuck in traffic it is time away from their families, it is time away from work, it is time away from recreation. It is just lost time that they will never get back. From a business perspective, congestion just adds to the difficulties of making ends meet. It means that, if you are a business transporting goods or a tradie trying to get from one side of the city to the other, you are just spending time on the road and you are not getting to the destination or the project that you have been engaged to do. All of those costs, the added transportation costs or the added costs to these other small businesses, then just get passed on to everyday consumers in higher prices. Mr Frydenberg: Like the carbon tax! West Link will not solve all of these problems that I have been talking about, but it will make a difference. I believe it would be the single most important road that could be built in order to address congestion in Melbourne and in Victoria. For people in the eastern suburbs, like in my electorate and like the member for Kooyong's electorate, it would give them a pathway across to the west of Melbourne. For those who are from the western side of Melbourne it",247,Private Members Business
258,Mr Tudge,"A bit like the carbon tax, as the member for Kooyong pointed out. The Eastwould make a tremendous difference, because at the moment if they are trying to get across into the city they only have one avenue and that it is through the Westgate Freeway, which we know is clogged almost every single morning and almost every single evening. What this road would do is to provide a further linkage from the west across to the east, and the east across to the west. Instead of having the one pathway from the east to the west, there would now be two broad freeways. It would have two impacts: it would make it easier for those in the eastern suburbs-particularly around the northern parts of my electorate in Bayswater, Boronia and Wantirna as well as in the electorates of Deakin, Casey and Kooyong-to get into the city along the eastern freeway and across to the other side of Melbourne. To those people who take the Monash Freeway or who rely upon Westgate to get to work it would also make a big difference to have the East West Link built, because it would take pressure off those existing assets by having a further arterial which is also linking up the east and west of Melbourne. Furthermore, by completing this road Melbourne would finally have a ring-road. We are one of the only cities of this size in the world that does not have a ring-road. If we finally connect up from the east to the west we would have a ring-road that would go all around Melbourne. As I mentioned before, the coalition has made a commitment of $1.5 billion towards the construction of this project. Should we be fortunate enough to win the election on 14 September, then this project will go ahead. It will start within a year and it will be finished within five years. It will create thousands of jobs in Melbourne, particularly construction jobs, and we know that the construction sector is struggling at the moment. It will make it better for businesses and it will make it better for the economy because it will reduce those costs of congestion. Most importantly, it would make it better for families, because people would not have to be in their cars for so long, wasting time. The member for Kooyong pointed out that it would also be good for the environment because traffic which is moving better pollutes less. There would be fewer particles going into the air and less CO2 emitted. People right across Melbourne are going to be beneficiaries of this great project and therefore it is hard to understand why the government has not even listed this project in their 20-year horizon. Perhaps they could not afford it this financial year, but it is not even listed in their 20-year infrastructure horizon which they documented in this year's budget. Through this motion I implore the government to reconsider their position in relation to the East West Link, because it is the top priority for the Victorian government; it is the top-priority project according to the RACV, and for many families and businesses it is also their top priority. We call on the government through this motion to fund the East West Link and match the coalition's commitment. do so in an amended way. I move: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""this House: (1) notes that: (a) Melbourne is suffering from a traffic congestion problem across the city which needs to be addressed in a balanced way; (b) without better infrastructure, this problem will worsen as Melbourne is experiencing the largest growth of all capital cities; (c) by 2020 it is estimated by the Bureau of Transport and Regional Economics that the cost of traffic congestion in Melbourne will be $6.1 billion, double what it is today; and",248,Private Members Business
259,Mr Marles (Corio) (12:13,"In rising to support the motion of the member for Aston, I(d) as well as being an economic cost, congestion impacts on quality of life including time spent with family; (2) recognises that: (a) Infrastructure Australia has been established to ensure a proper process around federal infrastructure investment; (b) Infrastructure Australia has identified the Melbourne Metro as ready to proceed and that it is a project of national significance; and (c) the Melbourne Metro will help reduce congestion by taking cars off roads and allow the Melbourne rail network to grow; and (3) notes that the Victorian Government needs to submit its business case for the East West tunnel to Infrastructure Australia to get it assessed and considered for funding."" The first point to make is to take up what the member for Aston said in closing about cajoling the Gillard Labor government to invest in the east-west project on infrastructure. It is astounding to have a member of the coalition to be talking about infrastructure in this place, particularly given the appalling record of the Howard government during its 11½ years in office. The fact of the matter is: $13.5 billion is being invested by this federal Labor government in Victoria's transport infrastructure alone. That more than doubles the annual infrastructure spend against what was occurring under the Howard government. Under the Howard government about $89 a year per Victorian was being spent on transport infrastructure. Today $201 per Victorian is being spent on the state's transport infrastructure. So to stand there and suggest this is a government not committed to the infrastructure and the infrastructure of the state is plainly wrong. In that respect, there are a number of infrastructure projects the government has committed to in Victoria in relation to transport which I will go through. I do want to say that, to the extent that we agree with this motion, we absolutely agree with the premise that traffic congestion in and around Melbourne is a very significant issue and is one which needs to be addressed as soon as possible. To the extent that this motion highlights the need to address the issue of traffic congestion around Melbourne, it is an important motion before this House, but it fails to address the critical process that we need to go through and the decisions that then need to be taken to address that traffic congestion. All the goodwill in the world can lead to a vey bad result if we do not get the decisions around traffic congestion right. It is in this respect that the East West Link has flawed thinking associated with it. The East West Link in its totality as a project where we are able to wave a magic wand and have it appear tomorrow is a great thing. There is no question about that. But the problem is that too often we hear from the opposition a kind of Harry Potter version of going about public policy where they imagine that there would be a magic wand that you could just wave and make things happen. We had Tony Abbott come down to Geelong about a month ago. His solution in relation to the issues of Ford was to just convince Ford to export their Territory models as though Harry Potter style you could wave a magic wand and get Detroit to do whatever you want. Actually, it does not work that way. I am not sure that Tony Abbott has ever done any advocacy on behalf of trying to change the production line in Corio to produce a left-hand drive vehicle but that is what we would like to see. In any event, what we have seen from the opposition and what we see from the state government is this waving of the magic wand. The reality of what the state government is doing has two very significant consequences and they are very adverse to the people of the Greater West of Melbourne and that very much includes Geelong in terms of our access to the Melbourne CBD. The first issue is this: it completely ignores the role of rail. Rail is a really important part of building our transport infrastructure, in terms of building a first-rate metropolitan transport system within Melbourne. That is why we have committed to Melbourne Metro because you do not have a modern train system within Melbourne without having Melbourne Metro. The state government proposal of funding a rail link to Avalon would be wonderful were we to ever see it, but nothing like that happens without the Melbourne Metro project going ahead. In the prioritising of the East West Link, there is a total ignoring of the situation in relation to rail. We have committed to Melbourne Metro in this budget and, through the regional rail link which is a $3.2 billion project, we have also committed to increasing the rail links of Victoria's major regional centres including Geelong to the Melbourne CBD by having a dedicated rail line which will see people from Geelong-and for that matter Ballarat and Bendigo-get access to Southern Cross Station without having to go through the train traffic congestion which is on the metro rail line at present. That is why the regional rail link is very important. The second issue, which is why the East West Link proposal is flawed, is that we need to see a proper process undertaken whereby Infrastructure Australia gets to examine the priority in which it is built. In other words, do you start with east or do you start with west? Again, in terms of the Harry Potter-style public policy that we see from the Liberals, we have had this vague sense from the Victorian government towards Infrastructure Australia that 'We would really like you to build the East West Link but we would like you to give us some money to do that,' without them ever going through a detailed assessment as to where the need is. Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, you know this as well anybody that, when you get on the road today and commute from Geelong to Melbourne, that commute is now 10 or 15 minutes longer than it was five years ago. The congestion that you hit at the Western Ring Road interchange is enormous. As somebody who has done this commute for the better part of 10 years, prior to entering this place, I know that doing that trip now at peak hour is about 15 minutes longer than it was five years ago. That oughtn't to be a surprise. It oughtn't to be rocket science to reach that conclusion. Why? Because the south-west of Melbourne is the fastest growing area in the country. We know that in 2012, Wyndham council, which is based in Werribee, grew at a rate of 7.6 per cent-second only to the Serpentine Jarrahdale council in Perth. In 2011, Wyndham was in fact the fastest growing local government area in the country. Through all of that growth, including growth in Geelong, in your electorate, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, the Armstrong Creek project will in the fullness of time essentially attach a city the size of Ballarat onto the southern edge of Geelong. All of this is creating enormous traffic congestion on the commute from Geelong to Melbourne and, for that matter, on the commute from any of the western suburbs-such as the member for Gellibrand's area, Werribee, into the CBD. Essentially, funding the East West project from east to west means that the traffic jam that you encounter today when you get to the Western Ring Road interchange, going from Geelong to Melbourne, will be what you will encounter for the next 10 to 20 years, because that is how long it is going to take by the time all the work is done in the east, which you have just describedaction on improving the access byroad into Melbourne. When Tony Abbott-God forbid if he is elected to govern this country-stood up in his budget reply and announced that within 12 months he would start work on the East West project, what he did at that moment was turn his back on everyone in Geelong. What he did at that moment was turn his back on the tens of thousands of commuters from Geelong who hit that traffic jam when they get to the Western Ring Road interchange. He stands to be condemned for that. That is the basis on whichminds when they seek to cast a vote in September this year. The intent of dealing with traffic congestion around Melbourne is a good intent, but the motion as it was originally put before this place by those opposite has whiskers on it. We have put in place a set of amendments which have a process around them, which would see a business case put to Infrastructure Australia so that a sensible decision could be made. for Corio, because it is outrageous. What he is doing in this chamber is denying the best interests of people in his own electorate, the best interests of people in my electorate, the best interests of the member for Aston's electorate, and the best interests of the electorates of those sitting opposite. Our motion, which was first put by my colleague and friend the member for Aston, is the right motion, because it shines a light on Tony Abbott's commitment to spending more than $1.5 billion on appropriate infrastructure for the East West Link. This money is supported by the state government, the Denis Napthine state government, which announced nearly $300 million in the last budget in order to get construction up and running by the end of 2014. Then you have those opposite. You have Julia Gillard, the Prime Minister of this country, promising $1.8 billion for WestConnex-which the member sitting opposite is happy to take-without Infrastructure Australia seeing it as a proper priority akin to the East West Link. We will get an east-west link up and running without tolls, which will support the new extension of the ports at the Port of Melbourne and in Hastings. It will allow people to spend less time in their cars, and get to the knowledge precincts in Carlton and Parkville. This motion that has been put by my friend the member for Aston is the right motion, and this amendment put by the member for Corio is the wrong motion. This motion put forward by the member for Aston supports the East-West Link, which is an 18-kilometre road. It will cost between $6 billion and $8 billion. It will take five years or more to build and it will create 3,200 jobs-important jobs for people who have lost their jobs under this Labor government. They are people who have lost their jobs because of the carbon tax, the waste, the mismanagement and more than 20,000 new regulations and nearly 30 new taxes that the government has introduced. They are people who are losing their jobs in manufacturing, losing their jobs in small business and losing their jobs in industry. These are people we can help to find a job with this major infrastructure project.",249,Private Members Business

They put out a document called Driving the agenda! ahead of the 2013 election. There are lots of names at the bottom of the document: NRMA, RACV, RACQ and RAA et cetera. They have a list of priority projects for Victoria. I go to No. 1 on that list, which is the east-west road link-from the Eastern Freeway to the Western Ring Road with a tunnel to CityLink. That is what these guys have said is their No. 1 priority. Government members interjectingParty, because under your government, which preceded John Howard in 1996, your average infrastructure spending was about 2.95 per cent of GDP. When we left office in 2010 our average spend was over five per cent of GDP. In fact, in your infrastructure spending, which was part of your response to the GFC-only 14 per cent of which went to economic infrastructure-you were preferring to spend money on pink batts and over-priced school halls than infrastructure that gets productivity going in this country. All those members on your side sitting in marginal seats, whether they be in Deakin, Chisholm or La Trobe, secretly support this motion put by the member for Aston. In fact, the member for Deakin and the member for La Trobe have said, 'You know what, we don't mind this thing. We'd like to see an east-west linkup'. They have come out and said, 'You know what? There is some merit to this project.' Only you are standing out denying the realities of this. We want families to spend more time with each other; we do not want them to spend more time on the road. We want people to access the knowledge precincts. We want small business people to get to jobs. We want people to reach the airport. We want to send fewer emissions into the atmosphere. How can we do that? By supporting the East-West Link but by supporting the state government and by allowing Tony Abbott, if he gets his chance on 14 September, to implement the East-West Link strategy. amendment. The question is that the amendment be agreed to. about transport and congestion in Melbourne in this place. I will not be supporting the motion, but it is well overdue that we had a discussion about the issue. If you look down the Eastern Freeway on any given morning during the working week you will see two things. The first thing you will see is cars backed up bumper to bumper, and you will see something very similar along Alexandra Parade or going down Hoddle Street. The second thing that you will see, Mr Deputy Speaker, is a great swathe of green land down the middle of the Eastern Freeway heading out. That land was reserved over 30 years ago for a rail line out to Doncaster. If you can get your hands on a copy of the 1980 Melway, you will find stops marked out along the route that was meant to be for a rail line out to Doncaster. That line has never been built. Successive state Labor and Liberal governments have promised it and never delivered on it. As a result, the people who live in the eastern suburbs either side of that Eastern Freeway have no real public transport option to get to work. And as a result, we see this congestion every morning in my electorate on Hoddle Street, on Alexandra Parade and on the Eastern Freeway.",252,Private Members Business

267,Mr Bandt (Melbourne) (12:29,"I am pleased that we are finally having a discussionIf we are serious about fixing congestion in Melbourne, the first step should be to build that rail line out to Doncaster, and the second step should then be to supplement that by building the Melbourne Metro rail project. What common sense and reason tell us-but also as every study that has been conducted shows-is that most of those people who are coming in from the east don't want to go west; as good as the west is, that is not where they are wanting to go. They are wanting to come into the city-to go work, to study or for other reasons. And so what do they do? They come down Hoddle Street or Alexandra Parade, or they take the rat runs through other parts of our electorate. This idea of the East West Link, and that there is somehow a massive, unmet, east-west demand from the cars that are coming in is just a furphy. People are wanting to come into the city. All that the proposal for an east-west tollway-which was first floated by the state Labor government, and now it has got legs from the federal opposition-will do is increase congestion in the inner city of Melbourne. It will turn the electorate of Melbourne into a rat's nest of on and off ramps. It will do nothing to relieve congestion and allow people to spend more time with their families or more time at home. One of the best ways that we could free up space on our roads for light commercial freight to get around is to get people out of the cars and into trains; into a train coming down the Eastern Freeway and then into a Metro train. But because of that lack of vision we now have the very real prospect that one of the things that makes Melbourne such a great place to live is about to be wrecked. I know that for many of the people sitting here in this chamber or elsewhere, the inner suburbs of Melbourne are just a place that you go through on your way somewhere else. But for us, it is where we live. People are sick of the congestion. They want to see effective public transport in Greater Melbourne, because they know that the alternative of building more roads is just building more traffic jams. We have seen that with every proposal that has come into Melbourne that has been supposed to solve some kind of congestion. Building more roads to cure congestion is like loosening your belt to cure obesity. All it will do is extend the traffic jams further and further. The people of Melbourne and those public transport advocates have been fighting this proposal for years. We first heard it floated by the Labor Party in Victoria. Then when it faced such stiff opposition it adopted some kind of middle position in the lead-up to the last state election. Now we are seeing it coming up again. I congratulate the government for committing to Melbourne Metro rail. I think it is a very good initiative and one that has been pushed for for some time-it is $3 billion, and a very worthy investment. But what I am worried about is this: if the polls are right at the moment and we have a change of government come September, there is a very real risk that the Melbourne Metro rail project-which is the number one priority identified by Infrastructure Australia; the East West Link is not does not even make the list at all because there is not even a business case for it-will not be built. And so earlier today I introduced into the House of Representatives a bill that would Abbottproof the inner-city suburbs of Melbourne and ensure that Melbourne Metro rail gets funded first-before we fund East West. AndI hope that the government, having taken the first step to build Melbourne Metro rail, also gets behind the bill. I am very worried that we are yet to find out Labor's true position on the East West Link. That the amendment be agreed to.",253,Private Members Business
268,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Bc Scott,"The question is:the original motion about an important project for the great city of Melbourne, and I will talk to the amendment as well. It is bewildering to me-and I have been in this parliament for many years-but it seems that whenever it comes to major infrastructure projects, Labor is always late to the party. We in this place would remember the extraordinary battle that coalition members had to get the Scoresby Freeway off the ground. We remember the betrayal of Labor when they promised before a state election that there would be no tolls on the Scoresby Freeway but the freeway became a fee-way under Labor. They abandoned the commitment they used to try to show the electors of the east and south-east of Melbourne that they finally got the issue in relation to a toll-free Scoresby Freeway only to betray that electorate shortly after. We have seen it again down my way. I have had to work year after year to try to get the Peninsula Link, the Frankston bypass, constructed. Labor ministers like Peter Batchelor said: 'There's no need for this. There's no case for it.' Have a look at the success of that projectone that was instigated by the Howard-Costello government. Peter Costello came down to the Dunkley electorate, stood at one of the most congested intersections on the continent of Australia in October 2007 and made a $150 million commitment to the construction of a tollfree Frankston bypass. That built the momentum of that project. Again, where was Labor? Running around saying it was completely unnecessary and would not add anything to the community. Yet we know in the Dunkley electorate and in the region what a vital carriageway that is for enterprise opportunities, for access to education, for people to access a livelihood and for the quality of the experience that many visitors to the region can have on the peninsula. It is a wonderful asset and a wonderful commitment. Again Labor was late to the party. Here we see it again when it comes to this east-west project. This is an important project critically for the east and south-eastern suburbs of Melbourne. Those against it seemingly only think that what needs to be moved around the great metropolis of Melbourne is people. Moving people is an important task, but moving freight, businesses and enterprise is equally important. You never hear that being spoken about by those who criticise the east-west link. The RACV has made it clear that it is a No. 1 priority. The state government has made it clear it is a No. 1 priority. There was chaos and mayhem when a recent truck accident on the Bolte Bridge brought much of the city to a standstill. Some of the representatives talk against the very project that would have given their constituents in that part of the community some relief and their businesses the capacity to continue to operate. They talk against it yet the evidence was enormous in people's eyes there. How could you be against that proposal? You hear some people say that it is all about moving people, but that is only part of how a city functions. You cannot get a tradesperson to park their trailer on the back of a train to get to a job. You cannot get a manufacturer from my community moving their highly transformed and high-value products to the market on a train. The future prospects of the Port of Hastings will provide enormous relief in terms of congestion in and around the city, but you cannot move a container on a passenger train. You actually need capacity, infrastructure, resources and a balanced approach to your infrastructure planning. This motion talks about that but the amendment seems to turn its back on the need to get that east-west project off the ground. Is it merely a very poor, timid effort by a dysfunctional",254,Private Members Business

Is this just a smokescreen to try to make it look like they kind of care but not really care enough to do something about it? This election will not only be a referendum about an appalling government that has mortgaged our future and future opportunities for many who rely on the smooth movement of people, equipment, assets, business and product; it will be a referendum on the east-west tunnel-whether Labor back up its talk, its weasel words, its timid head nod to what is an important project while they try to create another distraction so people do not look at this important project. For my community this project is important. It is about getting our assets, our enterprise, our business outputs and our opportunities better connected with our marketplaces wherever they might be. It is a further investment on the infrastructure strategy that we have pursued that has been opposed every step of the way by Labor. What is it about Labor? They always come late to the party on major infrastructure projects. We saw this with Scoresby. We saw it with the Frankston bypass. We are seeing it again here. At least they are consistent. (Time expired) speaks about putting a business case forward, so this is about getting the East West Link done. We just heard from the missing link that he has not even read the amendment, because he does not know what it is about. He has just come in here, blah-blah-blahed and delivered nothing. It just shows that he is full of wind but has nothing to him. He is all froth and no substance. This is a potentially good project. I say that because it is a project that is still in the early stages of planning, in that Infrastructure Australia have not received the business case. Mr Abbott promised $1.5 billion to begin building this road, saying that Infrastructure had told him that the East West Link was the No. 1 priority. He not only said that once but repeated it many times, and that is plainly untrue. It is untrue because Infrastructure Australia have not told him that. He went out and deliberately and knowingly misled the community by saying that he had taken the advice of Infrastructure Australia, when they had not received a business case. Isn't that against everything that the Liberals espouse? They say, 'Oh, you must have a proper business case.' Their hypocrisy is endless. When it comes to infrastructure, this government can stand tall because federal Labor has more than doubled the annual infrastructure spending from $89 to $201 per Victorian. We have spent an unprecedented $6.8 billion from our six-year Nation Building Program to renew states' road, rail and public transport. We are determined to try and take the politics out of infrastructure funding decisions. We have a proper process-and that is what we are asking for-where projects get assessed before funding decisions are made. You only have to look at the Victorian Liberal government to see that they could not manage a chook raffle in a pub, let alone a multibillion-dollar road project. Look at the road project history in Victoria, such as the lie that is the Kilmore bypass. The Liberals promised to build a $130 million bypass to take truck traffic off Kilmore and Wallan streets to improve traffic flow. In announcing the project, the then Liberal leader and the local MP said that if they got elected they would scrap the link road that was being proposed. The roadworks now being proposed are not a bypass but a destruction of heritage areas in Kilmore and a",255,Private Members Business
270,Mr Mitchell (Mcewen,"Government Whip) (12:39): The amendment actuallydestruction of sporting precincts, and now the proponent, who was the Liberal MP, is cutting and running, trying to distance herself from this disaster. Kilmore Racing Club chairman Lawrie Boyd said: … sports grounds used since the 1850s were at risk of being damaged or lost. ''The majority of the community are appalled by the thought of slicing up a public reserve and recreation area that's been there since 1853,'' … He said the options put forward by the Liberal government cut straight through the equine district, which is the largest employer in town. So they asked: 'Why won't the Liberal government listen to the community's voice? Why the deceit?' That is a question that is being asked of the Liberal candidate in McEwen, who was the driver behind this bypass option. And now they say that they want to deliver a tunnel road that will cost billions of dollars and cost Victorian users tolls of around $10 each way for a couple of kilometres. This eastwest road tunnel, which The Age points out has a cost-benefit ratio of 0.5, not only will not make a return for the community but will not make an economic return for private investors. The private consultants stand to gain a lot. They are going to gain about $294 million in the next two years to put together reasons why this should be built. We know that the Victorian government is desperate to be seen to be building something but not to pay for it. To promote the idea that the tunnel is not simply about facilitating access to the city for drivers, to limit the destruction of Royal Park from new exit and entrance points, unrealistic requirements are being written into the specifications. There are no off ramps into the city, which goes to say that what Mr Tudge has put forward is absolutely false. It is an appalling project, and it would be appalling if that were made into the final project. As The Age pointed out on 15 May: The east-west tunnel is a road to a loss. The only question is who will lose and by how muchwhether it is the public through taxes or motorists through tolls. Compare that to the rail project which has been put up: the Melbourne Metro. Mr Abbott went out and said that the Commonwealth government has no history of funding an urban rail and he thinks it is important that we stick to our knitting. Mr Abbott was again proven wrong, because the Commonwealth does have history in supporting rail projects. The rail projects that are being put forward, like the Melbourne Metro, will deliver an extra 24,000 passengers per day. That will take cars off the roads and ease congestion. They have shunned the northern suburbs by cutting out the funding for the Mernda rail extension, which is overdue and much needed, and also the Sunbury line. If you have a look at the cost per person and capacity per hour, the metro rail tunnel will cost $83,000 to $150,000 per person, whereas this road project will cost $416,000 to $555,000 per person.

Have a look at who is on the speaking list-the member for Melbourne, from the great coalition of Labor and the Greensand have a look at who is not there: the member for Deakin. Where is the member for Deakin? I can tell you that the member for Deakin, as he moves around his electorate, would not get through a weekend at shopping centres without people calling for the East West Link. We have the member for Melbourne teaming up with the Labor PartyMr Mitchell interjectingthe more you confirm your opposition to this sensible piece of public policy.

Mr Mitchell: I happily withdraw for you. here with a cobbled-together motion full of spelling mistakes, put together in a rush, just to avoid engaging on the subject. You have the member for Melbourne and the member for McEwen-all opposed to this. They fail to understand not only the traffic needs in Melbourne but the fact that with this motion you could link up the freeways. Who could be opposed to linking up the freeways? You have freeways that do not connect at one point near Melbourne. The member for Aston has rightly said the benefits of linking these up are obvious to all. (Time expired) Ms ROXON (Gellibrand) (12:49): There is a lot about this motion that is good; it is just that it would be even better if it were amended. That is why we are supporting the amendment. IfI were totally free, I would make a further amendment. I would call this the 'West East Link' not the East West Link, because, as the member for Corio pointed out, the most pressing pressures are coming from the west, and even the member for Aston himself made that point. Yet without this going through Infrastructure Australia or any other processes, his party is also arguing that it should start at the eastern end rather than the western end, which means that the pressures that exist at the moment in the fastest-growing part of the country are not going to be met for quite some time. I would like to make sure that Hansard recorded the member for Kooyong's commitments that this project, if the Liberals form government, will be completed in five to six years. I think there is absolutely no chance that this project would be completed in that time. A business case has not yet even been put to Infrastructure Australia, which is actually the key point that the government is trying to make. There is a lot of value in looking at the right infrastructure projects for cities across the country. The problem is, you actually have to get your mates in the state parliament, who are in government, to put together a proper business case so it can be assessed. So what you are interpreting wilfully as us not supporting the project is instead us saying: use the proper process to make sure that it stacks up to ensure that the proper work has been done. I cannot believe that the Greens would have the cheek to come in here and say, 'It's not too bad that there is $3 billion in the budget for the MelbourneMetro, but now we also want the next thing.' At least, though, they did acknowledge the project, which is the No. 1 project supported by the Victorian state government and by Infrastructure Australia as the most important for Melbourne. In a perfect world, as the member for Corio said, if you had an unlimited amount of money, this West East Link would also, hopefully, have gone through its proper business case and be on the table for expenditure. And as someone who represents the inner west of Melbourne where the tunnel would come up in my electorate-although that site is not yet determined, it would on any one of the options right in the middle of my electorate-this is of serious importance to the commuters in the area and to those who might be affected by the",258,Private Members Business

285,Mr Tony Smith,"But it is quite obvious that members on the other side have come ininfrastructure and the build, and it needs to be assessed properly and it needs to be done properly. Rather than it just being a bid for politicking in the eastern suburbs, we want it to be a proper assessment of what is needed for infrastructure across all of Melbourne. When we look at who is speaking on all of this, we have every ministerial hopeful in Victoria-and actually quite a lot of those who might be more deserving than some on the front bench-putting forward their bid and letting out their frustration. It seems to me that Mr Abbott, in refusing to put the member for Aston, the member for Casey, the member for Kooyong on his front bench, is throwing them this as a sort of political bone so they have got something to campaign on. Really, if the member for Aston was serious about what would happen in government if they were elected, he would be much more worried about getting some decent people on the front bench. I make an exception for the member for Flinders who does have some talent, so I am not criticising him. There are a few others that I think would be replaced. But the point I am trying to make is: if this project has merit, the state government should put in the business case. They should look at where the pressures are greatest, which is in the west, and they should start to build at the western end not at the eastern end. We have heard nothing about that. AlsoI think we have not had any acknowledgement about the massive amount of infrastructure that is already occurring. In fact the member for Aston suggested-and I think the member for Dunkley also-that the Labor Party had never been on the right side of any infrastructure project in Melbourne. That just shows how little they care about the more than a million people who live in the western suburbs, because it was Labor that delivered the Western Ring Road. It is Labor that has invested more and more each time, as we did again in this budget, for extensions and for other things. I have made quite clear, despite the complete distortions being made by the Liberal Party, that we are not saying this project is not a good project. We are saying that you need to get all your ducks in a row-get the business case done. Do not have Mr Abbott just pulling it out of his back pocket. Melburnians deserve better and the western suburbs should also be paid attention to whoever is in government. Gellibrand on this motion moved by the member for Aston. I support fully, completely, absolutely and unequivocally not only the project but the member for Aston's motion. I met by chance on the weekend with our candidate for Gellibrand, David McConnell, who was completely and utterly supportive of the East-West Link project. The reason why he is supportive of that project is it helps the people of the west. He viewed it as a lifeline to people from the west in reducing congestion on the streets of Williamstown in Gellibrand, in Lalor and in so many other areas. In her twilight days I can also express my respect for someone I have known for many years, the member who is opposite at the table now, the member for Gellibrand. Unprompted, without any input I asked David McConnell, our candidate for the seat of Gellibrand, what was his No. 1 issue. He said, 'The East-West Link because that is what matters to the people in my area for whom I am meant to stand up.' He was a little bit surprised that there was a great ambivalence and uncertainty on the ALP side as to whether or not they should support the project. He knew his mind. He knew the constituents.",259,Private Members Business
286,Mr Hunt (Flinders) (12:54,"It gives me great pleasure to follow the member forI stand here today not just as a representative of a parliamentary party but much more importantly as a representative of the people of Flinders. They have already had the success of the Eastern Freeway, the East Link project and the Peninsular Link project. The missing part now is the East-West Link. So whether it is the people of the west or whether it is the people of the east, this project is fundamental to quality of life. It is also fundamental to Melbourne's economic health and future. It is about productivity, it is about reduced congestion and also, as a consequence of that, it is about safety on our roads and on our neighbourhood streets. For all of these reasons, Melbourne should be allowed to proceed, Victoria should be allowed to proceed with the East-West Link project. To that end the coalition government, if we were elected, would allocate $1½ billion dollars. The Leader of the Opposition, Mr Abbott, has made it absolutely clear our commitment is not in doubt. There is no dispute. It is a projected, funded forward commitment which we will deliver. We want to work with the Napthine government. They have been tremendous in setting out both the vision and the hard reality of plans with which we can assist. We will do that. We hope that we will not be opposed either by the state ALP or the federal ALP. If there were no change of government at federal level, I would hope that there was clear bipartisan support for this project because this project is about reducing traffic in the east, in the west and also in the north where many people take the streets in order to avoid congestion. In addition, as I say, it is about jobs, not just jobs during production but, even more importantly, it is about long-term jobs in our manufacturing and logistics sectors because it will make Melbourne more attractive as a place to build, create, develop and do business. If we can work, as I have previously said, towards a network of transport hubs around our city then ultimately we will have the completion of the road quadrant. The ports, both the Docklands area and the Corio Geelong area, need support as does the Western Port area. Then we have the basis for an orbital network, which takes jobs and transport to the periphery. This unclogs the centre, and this project is part of that broader 30-year vision for Melbourne as a great manufacturing capital of the southern hemisphere. the amendment moved by the member for Corio. There is indeed a transport congestion issue for Melbourne, and we are presently growing by 200 people a day: 1,500 people a week, 75,000 people a year. It is said that we already have 2 million cars in Melbourne, but by, I think, 2036-20-odd years away-we will have an extra one million cars. That is truly mindboggling. So there is certainly a transport congestion issue. But there are better transport projects than this. The member for McEwen pointed out the proposal for rail to Mernda and there are projects that would be much better for the member for Aston's own constituents, like the rail to Doncaster link, a public transport link to the Monash University and the Melbourne Metro. I have supported road projects over the years. I have supported the Western Ring Road, I have supported CityLink, I have supported EastLink and I have supported the Craigieburn bypass. But there is always one more road to build; the problems are never solved in this way. By contrast, federal Labor's plan to keep Melbourne moving involves investing in both its road and rail infrastructure. That is why we have been working on the Melbourne Metro project. It was, after all, $40 million in funding from the federal government which enabled the Victorian government to get this project shovel ready. The Melbourne Metro project will",260,Private Members Business
287,Mr Kelvin Thomson (Wills,"Parliamentary Secretary for Trade) (13:00): I supportuntangle the inner core of the rail network and open it up for the future. The recent budget allocated $3 billion for the Melbourne Metro, and the Victorian transport minister recently said: It is our No. 1 transport priority. The fact is that it will improve existing services and allow for more and longer trains to move across the network. It will make sure an extra 20,000 people an hour can travel on the Melbourne rail network. And, as Melbourne grows, the Melbourne Metro is the core that is needed before you can start building new spurs, like a future Doncaster railway line, a new link to the Melbourne airport or the Avalon rail link. By contrast, if the Leader of the Opposition were elected he has made it clear in recent weeks that there would be no federal funding for any public transport infrastructure project, not just in Victoria but nationwide. Regrettably, such an unbalanced, roads-only approach will lead to more gridlock, worsening congestion and a poorer quality of life in our cities. Furthermore, it is a con job. The amount of money being proposed by the opposition is way short of what would actually be required in order for the East-West Link road tunnel to be completed. The opposition leader talks about $1½ billion towards construction of the tunnel. However, estimates of the tunnel talk about $5 billion, $6 billion or even $8 billion. Just as Tom Cruise said in Jerry Maguire the question here is, 'show me the money'. At present it is a con job. The question for motorists is: how exactly will the Victorian government fund this proposal? They have talked about tolling the proposed tunnel. Adam Carey reported in The Age on 15 May that a study by University College in London found that the tolls on the planned East-West Link would have been three times the current cost of an average trip on CityLink for the project's investors to make a profit. So, given that an average trip on CityLink costs $3.50, tolls would need to start at around $10.50 for a car trip of a couple of metres. There have also been reports that the Victorian government would consider selling off, tolling or privatising existing roads, such as the Eastern Freeway or the Westgate Bridge, to pay for the East-West Link tunnel. I think these are ludicrous proposals, but the coalition needs to rule them out. The public should not have to be paying tolls on roads that have been public property for decades. There is also a mountain of evidence and community feedback casting serious doubts over the viability of the proposed tunnel. Josh Gordon reported in The Age very recently that the Hoddle Street traffic nightmare would still remain, or even possibly worsen, after this tunnel was completed. We have heard concerns expressed from residents in Flemington and Travancore about how it is going to affect them. We have had the spokesperson for the Protectors of Public Lands Victoria, Julianne Bell, raising serious concerns about the tunnel's potential impact on places like Royal Park, Princes Park and Parkville. The bottom line is that the coalition stands for more gridlock, more congestion and a poorer quality of life. By contrast, Labor stands for better, more accessible public transport and more livable cities. Debate interrupted. Belmont and Tingira Heights Fire Stations Debate resumed on motion by Ms Hall: That this House: (1) acknowledges the outstanding contribution made by both full time retained fire fighters and volunteer fire fighters within our community; (2) notes with deep concern that: (a) over the course of the past month, the Belmont and Tingira Heights fire stations have been closed or 'taken off line' for a combined total of over 70 hours as result of a cost cutting exercise by the NSW Government; and (b) the practice of taking fire stations off line is wide spread throughout NSW as a result of cost cutting measures and staffing reallocations conducted by the NSW Government; (3) condemns in the strongest possible terms the: (a) ongoing closures of the Belmont and Tingira Heights fire stations; (b) NSW Government's apparent cavalier attitude towards the safety of the people within the NSW electoral division of Shortland; and (c) NSW Government's alleged attempts to threaten fire fighters who advertise the closure of the Belmont and Tingira Heights fire stations within the local community; and (4) demands that adequate staff be allocated to Belmont and Tingira Heights fire stations to ensure adequate fire protection is provided to all residents in the NSW electoral division of Shortland. Ms HALL (Shortland) (13:05): I rise to place on the record of this House my thanks to the firefighters throughout my community and for that matter throughout Australia who keep our communities safe. No matter where you live in Australia your community is protected by firefighters-be they full-time professional firefighters employed by state governments, part-time or more commonly known as retained firefighters, or volunteer firefighters. Each kind of firefighter has a very specific role to play in protecting our communities. On Sunday 19 May I attended the Volunteer Appreciation Day at Doyalson in my electorate on the Central Coast, which included the blessing of the Rural Fire Service fleet and the recognition of the service of volunteers that work for the Rural Fire Service. It was a really appropriate way to end volunteer week and I thank those rural firefighters for the service that they have given to their community, just as I thank the professional firefighters who work each and every day protecting our communities. Firefighters provide a vital service, a service that saves lives and property. That can only happen if fire crews are located in communities to protect those communities. In recent times, unfortunately, firefighters from the Belmont and Tingira fire stations within my electorate have been taken offline-their stations have been taken offline. And, for a combined loss of greater than 70 hours, those two fire stations have been closed and taken offline whilst the crews go to Swansea Fire Station. There are two issues here: one, there are not enough retained firefighters at Swansea to maintain that station and two, our professional firefighters are being taken across the bridge at Swansea-which has a history of becoming stuck-and leaving those communities unprotected. If the Belmont crew is down at Swansea, it would mean that a fire crew would have to come to Belmont from Tingira Heights, and if that fire crew was fighting a fire at one of the local shopping centres, then fire crews would have to be brought from a lot further away-and we all know that the response time is vitally important. Response time is everything when a fire takes hold. If you cannot get a fire crew there quickly, then that means that your community is at risk. That means that lives are lost. This cost-cutting practice that is taking place in New South Wales is very foolhardy. It is not the right approach. There are some things that you can cut at a bureaucratic level, but when it comes to the actual services on the ground it really is not good enough. I would like to condemn the New South Wales government for this practice and I do that in the strongest possible terms. By closing these stations, it really is placing at risk the communities that I represent in this parliament. I have had a number of people sign petitions and come and see me about this issue. I believe that the government is putting our communities at risk, simply in order to save a little bit of money on overtime or by not employing more retained or other firefighters. Even last week both Belmont and Tingira Heights fire stations were taken offline, so whilst I said 70 hours, since then it is well up over the 80 hours. This is not good enough. The people of New South Wales deserve better than that. The people of the electorate of Shortland deserve better than this and the firefighters deserve better than this. They need to know that their government, their employer, is prepared to look after and protect them and employ them in the way that they are trained and qualified to be employed. motion should be applauding the O'Farrell Stoner Liberal Nationals coalition government for its ongoing commitment to funding and prioritising firefighting services in that state. Indeed, under this New South Wales government, total expense allocations to Fire and Rescue New South Wales have increased by 11.4 per cent. Two country communities in the Riverina in particular are enormously thankful for the new fire stations opened on Friday 12 April with New South Wales Fire Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons in attendance. These will prove much needed bases when the inevitable future bush fires take hold in the areas where they have been constructed-Mandamah near Ariah Park and Tara-Bectric near Temora. In the past volunteer bush fire fighters struggled to battle blazes because of old trucks and often outdated equipment. They do not anymore, thanks to the coalition state government. The two state-of-the-art stations will each house the respective brigades' two funded tankers and associated firefighting equipment which were previously stored in farm sheds. The two new stations each boast two truck bays, a kitchenette, toilet, shower and 50,000 litre water tanks. As well, both stations are solar powered. Each was built at a cost of just over $101,000 with the New South Wales Rural Fire Service providing nearly $89,500 and the local councils of Bland and Temora shires the remainder. As you can see, this is a really good and significant investment by the New South Wales coalition. Tara-Bectric brigade was established in 1939 and Mandamah was formed in 1948. The new stations are a really welcome boost to the hard working and dedicated volunteer firefighters in those districts who have persevered with too little in the way of tankers and equipment for far too long. Whilst referring to those marvellous volunteers, I would also like to pay tribute to the 30 recipients of long service medals presented on 16 March to members of the Humula, Oberne Creek and Tarcutta fire brigades who between them tallied 1,187 years of service. William Belling and Mark Ball of Tarcutta have served for 72 and 67 years respectively. At Mandamah, 33 long service medal recipients totalled 1,165 years including Max Gordon who has contributed 56 years including a remarkable 48 years as deputy captain. Tara-Bectric's 24",261,Private Members Business
288,Mr Mccormack (Riverina) (13:10,"Far from being condemnatory, the mover of thislong service members recently honoured accumulated 1,137 years with Ray Perry having 69 years of sterling work and Bill Haddrill 61 years. Another tremendous state funded addition to Riverina's firefighting capabilities is Griffith's new rural fire service control centre on city council land in Wakaden Street. This facility which cost just under $3 million was opened on 19 April by Commissioner Fitzsimmons and the member for Murrumbidgee, Adrian Piccoli. Ironically, recent fires and floods delayed the opening but now that the official ceremony has taken place the centre will serve as the home of the Rural Fire Service and emergency control centre in times of crisis and as a training centre for services across the district. During the past summer some of the hottest temperatures and fiercest fire conditions experienced caused havoc and widespread damage across the state and elsewhere and certainly in the Riverina. It is vital that New South Wales has the very best stations and resources available when disaster strikes to complement the outstanding efforts of those magnificent people who go to douse the flames whether they are in paid or voluntary roles. The present New South Wales government is doing just that and I commend it for its efforts to improve on what the previous Labor administration provided in its 16 years of debt and deficiency. Fire and Rescue New South Wales employs a number of strategies to respond to planned and unplanned absences of firefighters and this is very relevant to this motion. This can include using overtime or relieving firefighters to staff a station. It has been standard practice for Fire and Rescue New South Wales to take fire stations offline when firefighters attend training, undertake hazard reduction burns or participate in other non-operational activities. This has been occurring for more than 100 years on a routine basis, so there is nothing new there, Member for Shortland. It has been occurring for more than a century. Under temporary offline arrangements, when nearby stations are able to provide adequate coverage, an understaffed station can be made temporarily unavailable for operational activities. The available firefighters at the station can be reassigned to other stations which are short-staffed due to unplanned absences in order to maintain minimum staffing levels for rostered shifts. Ms Hall interjectingshe knows full well the commitment being made by the New South Wales coalition government, which is very admirable. (Time expired) Ms OWENS (Parramatta) (13:15): I rise to support the member for Shortland's motion. In doing so, I must say I greatly regret that it is still necessary to have this resolution before this house. Late last year, on 26 November, I spoke on the same issue, which concerns the threat to vital emergency services in my community in Parramatta and in New South Wales more broadly. I must add that the issue is not confined to the electorate of Shortland but is statewide. Firefighting is not just about property; it is literally a matter of life and death, for the community and for the firefighters themselves. It is an essential front-line service. The responsibility of every government is to protect and fund essential services in their jurisdiction. The state government of New South Wales has failed in this duty. I say that I regret that this resolution is necessary because the danger-of which I warned in November of 2012-of taking fire stations offline persists. In fact, it has spread, and it has",264,Private Members Business
289,Mr Mccormack,"I can hear the member for Shortland arguing and carrying on, butbecome much more noticeable in my electorate of Parramatta. The practice involves standing down and closing a fire station when a firefighter is unexpectedly unable to come to work, for reasons such as illness or family emergency. The obvious alternative is to call back or call in replacement firefighters to staff the shift. However, under current New South Wales policy, to save money the whole shift is taken offline-so that overtime, or call back costs, are not paid. What disturbs me greatly is that this practice has now been extended from covering only unpredictable absences to covering absences which are not only predictable but programmed, such as firefighters taking annual leave and long service leave. The original idea of not replacing staff in the case of unplanned absence was bad enough, but the spread, from November last year, to all types of absences is simply gambling with property and with lives. When it comes to the fire brigade, response times matter, and the location of stations matters. Issues such as density, factories and types of industries must be taken into account. When a station is offline, another station, further away, with other obligations, has to step in. Such a station will not be able to match the response times of the closer station. I am also disturbed that stations are being shut down or taken offline more frequently in some areas than in others. SinceI spoke to this house in November 2012, there have been, at the fire station in Merrylands, within my electorate, no less than 56 occasions when the shift has been taken off line, or 'TOLed', as they call it. That means they were unable to be responsive to fires and emergencies in the Merrylands area. Those occasions meant that the station was closed for a range of times, for between two hours and a total 12-hour shift. That meant hundreds of hours of the lack of an emergency service which is needed 24 hours a day and relies upon a call response time measured in minutes-that is the time limit they need to meet if they are to save property and lives. No other suburb in my electorate has such a poor service availability record. The Rydalmere station, almost in my electorate, has faced it from the other side. It has been a relief station. It has been required to move up on quite a few occasions for stations as far away as Cranebrook in Penrith and Macquarie Fields when they have had units taken offline. This happened to Rydalmere 23 times between November last year and 18 May this year. We had Darlinghurst Station in King's Cross providing relief, or a move up, to the Parramatta station in November last year. That was for a whole day, and I should say that Darlinghurst station is 45 minutes to an hour away from Parramatta, through incredible traffic. We have sirens on fire trucks because response times matter. If you need a fire station in Merrylands, for example, you need it full time. Fires do not take a break when a fireman gets sick and a station is shut down, and it is madness to bring a fire truck under siren from Darlinghurst to Parramatta to respond to a fire. Travelling under siren is dangerous in its own right. I speak for every elector and citizen in the federal seat of Parramatta serviced and protected by stations such as Rydalmere, Parramatta and Merrylands when I say: this practice of station closure, of stations being taken offline, is simply dangerous and we are fearful that one day our luck will run out. My local dedicated firefighters cannot speak for themselves; the government that employs them has forbidden that they comment publicly. SoI am speaking for them. One day they will not make it in time. A fire that could have been contained will spread to a neighbouring property, and someone who could have been saved will be injured or killed. One day they will be sent to an unfamiliar urban or factory environment where they lack local knowledge and cannot respond as appropriately as they might in their own environment. They will drive far too many kilometres under siren, a dangerous process in itself. Safety is a community issue, and it works best when our local emergency services and our local councils, factory owners and residents work together to reduce risks and when firefighters know where the greatest local risks are. I strongly support the motion of the member for Shortland and I hope that other members in this House also stand up to support their local firefighters and their community. to stand up in support of the CFA volunteers and professional firefighters in my electorate of Gippsland, and I acknowledge the very first point of the member for Shortland's motion, where she encourages the House to acknowledge the outstanding contribution made by both full-time retained firefighters and volunteer firefighters within our community. I take this opportunity, particularly in the wake of the extreme conditions that the people of Gippsland endured over the past summer season, to recognise the volunteers from right across Victoria who rallied to support my community in a time of great need, particularly in relation to the Seaton and Heyfield bushfires, where tragically one life was lost. Extensive property damage was sustained across the region, and the impact on wildlife and stock throughout the Heyfield, Seaton and Glenmaggie area was very significant. SoI take this opportunity to thank the volunteers who travelled from right across Victoria to support our local crews in our time of need. The role of our CFA volunteers, in particular, in rural communities is something that deserves recognition in this place. I appreciate the words of the member for Riverina, who spoke about the important investments being made by the New South Wales state government in supporting volunteer services in his community. There has been a similar situation in Victoria, where the state coalition government has increased the investment in new services, in terms of vehicles, and in physical infrastructure, in terms of new sheds for our volunteers. At the start of this year, I encouraged Gippslanders to consider what contribution they could make to the community and whether they would be prepared to volunteer some of their time to join a community organisation. I can think of no better organisation to recommend to people in my community than the CFA. Right across Victoria, we already have about 60,000 CFA volunteers. The Country Fire Authority hierarchy would be the first to acknowledge that their workforce is quite an ageing workforce. A lot of their volunteers are getting towards the more mature stage of their volunteer life, and they are trying to encourage more younger people to participate. There is only one thing that it costs you to become a CFA volunteer, and that is your time. The CFA itself provides all the training and equipment, and that is obviously very important for the proper conduct of its roles. I would argue that your time is the most generous gift that you can give. If a millionaire came to a local CFA station and provided them with $10,000, it would be a warmly received gift, but the millionaire knows he has still got $990,000 left. When you give your time, you do not know exactly how much time you have got left. It is a great contribution that many country people make in donating their time to the CFA and to other community service organisations in my electorate. The CFA is one of the most highly respected and iconic community service organisations in our nation, and I encourage Gippslanders who have thought about perhaps donating their",265,Private Members Business
290,Mr Chester (Gippsland) (13:20,"I accept the invitation of the member for Parramattatime to any community service to consider what role they might play within the Country Fire Authority. There are roles within the Country Fire Authority which go beyond the most obvious operational ones of firefighting, accident rescue missions, crew leadership, communications, all forms of emergency response, incident controller, pump operator and so on. They are the active roles within the CFA, but there are also non-operational roles, where perhaps people who might not necessarily have originally thought of themselves as a CFA volunteer can play a very important part behind the scenes, whether it is delivering education throughout our communities, fundraising, public relations, catering for the people on the ground at times of emergency or working in the areas of management and recruitment. There really is a job for everyone in the Country Fire Authority in Victoria. But the benefits that I mentioned before, of helping to keep our community safe and protecting our region, extend beyond the feeling of doing something worthwhile for your community. Being a CFA volunteer allows the individual to also develop a range of skills which will serve them well in life. They learn leadership and other professional development skills. They receive accredited training which is recognised throughout the world. Australia's volunteer fire services are very highly regarded throughout the world and are often called upon to serve in the United States or New Zealand or in other fire grounds. It is also an opportunity for them to work as part of a team and to meet new people in regional communities, which is often very important. I commend them to point (1) of the motion which acknowledges the outstanding contribution made by full-time, retained firefighters and by the volunteer firefighters in our community. In doing so, I encourage people who are listening today, whether they be in Gippsland or throughout our nation, to consider whether they could take on a volunteer role in our firefighting services to make their own contribution, to make a difference in their local community. It is an outstanding service. It is something we should be very proud of in Australia and I know that members of this place on both sides of the House value the contribution our firefighters make. I congratulate the state governments for investing in these services. I encourage them to continue to do so in the interests of community safety. Shortland and I did so because this is an issue which we, at a federal level, should look at for a number of reasons, not just in relation to the impact on New South Wales but as a guide to what is going to happen if there is a change of government on 14 September. The motion is specific to the member's electorate, but I want to read those parts of the motion that are generic: That this House: (1) acknowledges the outstanding contribution made by both full time, retained fire fighters and volunteer fire fighters within our community; (2) notes with deep concern that: … … … (b) the practice of taking fire stations off line is wide spread throughout NSW as a result of cost cutting measures and staffing reallocations conducted by the NSW Government; On 16 May 2013, I made a speech in this House in relation to this matter. I talked about a visit that the New South Wales opposition leader John Robertson made on 6 April to the Revesby fire station in my electorate of Banks. On that day the station was closed. I also noticed on 26",267,Private Members Business
291,Mr Melham (Banks) (13:25,"I seconded the motion moved today by the member forApril that the fire station was closed and I have posted a photo of the sign on my Facebook page. To date, this has received the largest number of hits on anything I have posted a on my Facebook page. At the moment I think there are 7,000-plus interactions, which indicates that there is concern in the community about what the state government is doing. I also visited the Mortdale fire station on their open day on 18 May 2013. I have been doing that for a number of years. Mortdale fire station is also staffed by volunteers, among others. They all have a good reputation. The great tragedy is that that they should not be put in this position in terms of fire stations going off line with a question mark in relation to their jobs. The irony is that, in his first budget, the state Treasurer, Mr Baird, got his figures wrong, according to the Auditor-General, by a billion dollars. In other words, there was a billion dollars more in his budget than he thought. Sadly, that was the genesis of some of the cuts which have been foisted upon the state departments. Unfortunately, the budget cuts have a disproportionate effect on our emergency services. Firefighting, like policing and ambulance services, is very labour-intensive. While across-the board cuts to the public sector wages bill were to be 1.2 per cent, for some reason Fire and Rescue New South Wales was set at a 1.75 per cent target in relation to budget cuts. So employee related expenses were to be slashed by 7.6 million in 2012-13 and by a cumulative 64 million over the next four years. I know that members on the other side feel the same as us in relation to a lot of this. Let us be fair dinkum. At times we are putting in a position where we have to defend the governments which are on the same political persuasion as ourselves. I attacked some cuts that were made to the library and other services two budgets ago in relation to savings, because I believe some areas should be off-limits-and I believe our emergency services should be off-limits. These are essential services. They are vital to our community. And, in relation to the Rural Fire Service, there is no chance without volunteers. So it is a partnership between government and the local community, and that is true of a lot of other things. Cuts have already been made to the Rural Fire Service. In late 2012, it was revealed they were to be slashed by $12 million. Now, I argue, because it is a philosophy I hold, that these sorts of services should be quarantined; they should be protected. They should not be cut. If anything, the worse you should do is pause them, not cut them, and then you bring them back with growth figures in the good years. That is why I lend my support to this motion. I know that on both sides of the House there is enormous warmth and support for the firies, as there should be, because they do a terrific job in our community. I commend the motion to the House. Shortland and thanked the member for Riverina for drawing out some of the operational facts and realities that respond to much of the motion, which is quite specific to an area of New South Wales. I will focus my remarks primarily on the opening point of the motion: That the House: … acknowledges the outstanding contribution made by both full time, retained fire fighters and volunteer fire fighters within our community … My electorate of Dunkley is one of those 'interface' communities, where the urban sprawl starts and the magnificent Mornington Peninsula begins. It is where we have both firefighting expertise that is at its best in an urban and industrial environment, and firefighting expertise, skills and capability that are ideally suited to the rural fire and bushfire fighting task. It is",268,Private Members Business
292,Mr Billson (Dunkley) (13:30,"I want to acknowledge the motion from the member forgreat to see the MFB and the CFA interact with each other, and I want to put on the record my ongoing admiration and support for their efforts, and encourage all of our community to get behind their work. It is in that spirit that I think we should set about thinking what else we can do to get behind the work of these two great organisations. We see, from the opposition leader's fine personal example, the commitment he displays in volunteering with the Rural Fire Service. And what a magnificent example that is to all of us about staying engaged in and involved with the communities we seek to lead through our civic service. He not only talks about that; he walks that talk, and I have great admiration for that commitment. Another example I would like to draw to the House's attention comes from the Rotary Club of Frankston. Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, you may not be aware-as many are not aware-that there are actually some indigenous Australian plants that have fire-retardant properties. This is a fact that is not well known, not well appreciated and, I think, underembraced in terms of what our fire risk response strategy should be. Alan Soderlund, who has a leading and lifelong involvement in the nursery and garden industry, along with Keith Kimpton and the dedicated crew at the Rotary Club of Frankston, have approached me about a fantastic initiative called 'Fire smart plants'. Their vision is to see the fire-retardant properties of some Australian indigenous plants embraced and promoted in nurseries and at points-of-sale right across our country so that people, like members of my family, who wish to enhance their living environment can choose thoughtfully-particularly in areas where there is a heightened fire risk-between plant species that would act as an accelerant in the event of a fire and plant species that have fire-retardant properties. This could make quite a useful contribution alongside the fire response and prevention plans that are implemented throughout the municipalities on the edge of the urban sprawl like mine, and well beyond, and also support the work of our firefighters. It would help to save lives and property from bushfires, and it is a good initiative. Their idea is to have these plants tagged in such a way that they are recognised and promoted as fire smart and see some of that revenue come back to Rotary to support its important work but also back to the fire services as a way of saying, 'Thank you for your work; we are doing our bit as a property owner or homeowner by choosing plants with these fire-retardant properties uppermost in our minds.' I commend Alan and the team at the Rotary Club of Frankston for that initiative. I will continue to do what I can-maybe a bit of a shoutout to Wesfarmers and others that are known to be heavily involved in the hardware and garden supply area; they might want to embrace this as part of their engagement with the broader community and get the message about fire smart plants out more widely. Another area where I think we can do some work is around the coalition's Green Army commitment. Fifteen thousand strong, this Green Army will work in partnership with communities, with land management and Landcare groups, with friends groups and with others that have an important role in caring for our natural systems. Again in my area, we have communities that are blessed by wonderful natural bushland surrounds. But that is also a fuel source that needs to be carefully managed. I see the Green Army playing an important role in working alongside the friends groups and local councils, to work through those natural bushland reserves that are the neighbours of so many of the citizens in my community to make sure we reduce the fuel load. We have a skilled team that can be mindful of the important environmental values and the flora and fauna objectives that are part of the reason we have these reserves, and actually make that contribution to reducing the fire risk and the fuel load, improving access to those areas so our firefighters can respond if called upon. That is the kind of collaboration I would like to see more in our community-a couple of practical initiatives to support the magnificent work of our firefighters. Debate adjourned. Sitting suspended from 13:36 to 15:29 Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2013-2014 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. delivered before the next election. This budget proves that a vote for Labor at the next federal election will be a vote for chaos. The Gillard government's financial and budget management is in absolute and complete chaos. Labor's budget gives us more debt, more deficit, more taxes, more broken promises and more uncertainty-all from an incompetent, mendacious government that cannot be trusted. The Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2013-2014 and related bills highlight the contrast between Labor and the coalition when it comes to economic management. For example, the last budget delivered by a coalition government saw a $19.7 billion surplus. The word is 'surplus', Madam Deputy Speaker. The last budget delivered by Labor saw a $19.4 billion deficit-I repeat: 'deficit'. They are very similar figures; however, one is in the black and one is in the red. This highlights the complete reversal in the government's economic fortunes under this Labor government. Australia entered the global financial crisis with no public debt, a $20 billion surplus, $60 billion in the Future Fund, a $6 billion Higher Education Endowment Fund and a record low four per cent unemployment. Australia entered the global financial crisis with a wellregulated financial sector, a reformed labour market, strong public finance balance sheets and conservative fiscal and monetary policy settings-all courtesy of the former coalition government. As a consequence of the hard work and the economic discipline of the coalition, Australians saw relatively modest effects from the previous global financial crisis. Despite Labor promising to be an economic conservative during the 2007 election campaign, we saw those TV as ad nauseam with the then Leader of the Opposition, Kevin Rudd, and deputy leader Julia Gillard with hands on hearts, saying: 'We are economic conservatives.' This Labor government subsequently embarked on a massive spending spree that put the federal budget into record deficit. The spending spree included billions of dollars on pink batts, unnecessary and overpriced school halls and $900 handouts. This government failed to get value for the taxpayer's dollar. Yet every dollar the Labor government has spent in this budget is borrowed money. It will all have to be paid back by the taxpayers of the future. This money is borrowed from the earnings of future generations of Australians.",269,Private Members Business
293,Mr Baldwin (Paterson) (15:30,"Thankfully, this budget is the last Labor budget to beLabor's debt and deficit is true to Labor form. When the Labor government say that this is a Labor budget, they really mean it-a Labor budget of debt and deficit, combined with defeat. There is a member of this parliament, in the House of Representatives, the member for Longman, who has never seen Labor deliver a surplus in his entire lifetime. This Gillard government just does not understand that it is spending other people's money. Labor have not been able to balance those books since 1989. With all the talk about online betting, this mob has got form. If you were to take odds on whether they would ever post a surplus, I am pretty sure you would get very high odds. Last year, the Treasurer promised a $1.5 billion surplus, but instead he has delivered a deficit more than 12 times as big at $19.4 billion. The deficits announced by the Treasurer this year came after more than 500 promises of a surplus. My favourite line from this mendacious, deceitful government is: 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead'. But I have to say the Treasurer gets pretty close when he says: The deficit years of the global recession are behind us. The surplus years are here. An opposition member: That is last year's budget speech. Australians could not trust Labor's word last year, how can they possibly believe them going into an election year? Previous election: no carbon tax under a government I lead; this election: surpluses in the future. Each of them has about the same level of credibilitycredibility because Labor lacks credibility. Labor's legacy to Australians is more than $250 billion of debt. That equates to debt of around $10,870 for each Australian. By the way, when we left government it was just in excess of $4,000 per person in surplus. So $10,870 for each Australian in debt. A family of four would be struggling with Labor's cost-of-living increases. And not only has the mortgage gone up, but so have the Visa and MasterCard bills. But thanks to the Rudd-Gillard government, their share of Labor's debt could be up to $43,480 per household. And the problem with Labor's debt and deceit and deficits is in fact the waste, the failure to get value for the taxpayers' dollar. Labor likes to talk a lot about infrastructure, but in 2013-14 they will spend $3.5 billion on the roads. To put that into context, that is less than one per cent of the budget's $398 billion spending. In contrast, the budget papers reveal yet another blowout in the management of Australia's borders by at least $4.7 billion since last year's budget. The $13 billion interest bill that this government now faces because of Labor could have been used to deliver tax cuts or, more importantly, to fund other programs. Both the NDIS and Gonski could have been fully funded and paid for without a levy if we were not paying $13 billion in interest rates. What we have is a government complicit with debt and deficit, and Australians are paying the price for economic incompetence. Let there be no doubt: the coalition very strongly supports the NDIS. We have been asking the Prime Minister since its inception to form a joint party committee so we can take the politics out of the issue. The Prime Minister, perhaps the most partisan Prime MinisterI have ever seen, has declined that offer. Last week I met with the Mai-Wel Group, a disability service provider to the people in the Hunter Valley, just outside my electorate. It is clear to them and it is clear to me that the government still has not done all its homework on the NDIS. There are questions still on when, how, who and where still to be answered fully. The",271,Bills
294,Mr Baldwin,"Last year's speech on the budget, as my colleague here says. So ifNDIS rolls out in Newcastle in five weeks time, Lake Macquarie in 2014, Maitland in 2015, and yet service providers still have questions that need to be answered. I fear for the expectations being delivered to those with disabilities that they may be let down by this government, but the coalition is right behind the NDIS. I spoke earlier about how the Gillard government had failed to prioritise infrastructure spending. Its decision in this budget to backend fund projects in the never-never over 10 years is like a scene straight out of the TV series The Hollowmen. Like The Hollowmen: 'Let's make promises in the never-never that we know we're never-never going to have to deliver'. I note the minister for infrastructure, Mr Albanese, and Senator Thistlethwaite have been seeking praise for the budget allocation to the Bulahdelah bypass. In their press release, they talk about $300 million. It is due to open in a number of weeks. Work has been underway on that bypass for the past six years. It was actually started by the Howard government, but this government seeks to take credit for $300 million-all spin instead of the tail-end funding to complete the project in the next couple of weeks. I would like to quote from an article now that appeared in the Newcastle Herald during the 2010 federal election. It is all about funding and how magnificent local members are. It says: THE new mining tax would be used to pay for an overpass for the rail crossing on the New England Highway at Scone, in a significant election sweetener rolled out by Labor yesterday. That was about Mr Fitzgibbon, the member for Hunter. I want you to note that word: overpass. Overpass means when you build this little bridge and the traffic goes up and over the railway line and keeps going. It does not need to stop for trains. Despite originally getting only a couple of million dollars for a study, the member for Hunter has now been crowing about funds back-ended in this budget for a Scone level crossing. You do no have to be Einstein to work out that there is a lot of difference between a level crossing upgrade and an overpass. The promise originally to the people in that area was for an overpass-and what they will get is an upgraded rail crossing. The member for Hunter will go on promising that this will be delivered, like he promised at the previous election. Now he will hang his hat on the F3 extension. Straight after the 2007 election he said, 'No, it won't be built; there's no money.' It only got built when he got himself into trouble. How could anybody trust Labor to deliver on anything? It has never delivered on a surplus. It has never delivered on core funding commitments to our community. In this budget alone Labor has broken so many of its own promises, including not proceeding with the increase to Family Tax Benefit A, abolishing the promised tax cuts for 2015-16 and cancelling the company tax cuts that would have commenced in 2012-13. And who could forget the mining tax that was supposed to share the benefits of the boom that has only raised a fraction of what Labor claimed it would? It did not stop it spending the money, but it only raised a fraction. This is a government that does not understand budgets, does not understand taxation and, worse still, does not understand the expectations of the Australian people. Australian people can understand when you have to deliver bad news and tighten the belt, but the Australian people will never accept a government that breaches fundamental trust by deliberately misleading them before an election and doing something different after it. It started with 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead', it has been escalated with, 'There will be budgets surpluses into the future' and it has been delivered the final blow with the broken promises that I have just outlined. I will obviously hear members who talk about how magnificent it is that Defence spending has finally been reinstituted. I would also point out that over the last four years $25 billion has been ripped out of the portfolio-that is, projects that have not proceeded, especially small contracts. There has been no substantial planning or direction on things like submarines or the future of frigates. There is so much underspend that it has put a lot of Australian Defence support industries into chaos. Like always, it will be the coalition that has to step in, clean up the mess and deliver national security and real outcomes for our community. There are two industries in our area where ministers like to turn up, have their photos taken and talk about the great work they are doing. They are not impressed with the Defence cuts and the effects it has had on their businesses. In particular, the workers at those places who face uncertain economic times because of the mismanagement of this government. I could speak for hours about the impacts of this government on the Australian economy. There are all of the misleading statements and failure to deliver, but there is one thing that concerns me more about this budget. This government talks about the need to support Australian families, to support growth and opportunity. Their favourite catchline phrase at the moment is 'Cut to the bone.' They have not only cut to the bone but also they have cut through the artery of pride in this nation. No longer can Australian people take any resemblance of pride in their government after what they have done, creating a slow death financially for the people of Australia. I am looking forward to the budget consideration in detail, where I will focus on my portfolio area of tourism and regional development, as I hold the minister to account for the cutbacks and failure to deliver in those portfolio areas. which will authorise the expenditure in the terms contained in the recently announced budget. This budget was created to keep Australia's economy strong, making a smart investment for the future and ensuring everybody gets a fair go. There is a balanced focus on having a strong economy and creating jobs, while assisting families to meet the cost of living. Investments in infrastructure and education also form an integral part of this budget. Good infrastructure is essential to support the growing population among large projects-like the WestConnex project, which will greatly benefit residents of Western Sydney. Many local roads and dangerous intersections will also be fixed as a consequence of this appropriation. Good education is essential to secure the high-skilled jobs for our young people in the future. Our children deserve the best quality learning environments so they are not left behind in what we see now as an increasingly competitive world. As an example, every dollar the New South Wales government invests in education will be matched by two dollars from the federal government. New South Wales schools will receive an investment totalling around $5 billion over the next six years alone. Importantly, this budget does not overlook the most vulnerable members of our community, including people with disabilities. Guaranteed funding and the delivery of DisabilityCare Australia will see the National Disability Insurance Scheme become a reality and provide much-needed support for people with disabilities, their families and their carers. Care and support for a person with disabilities will no longer depend on how they acquired",272,Bills
295,Mr Hayes (Fowler) (15:45,"I stand in support of the appropriations bills before us,their disability or where they live. All Australians will be covered, including the almost 4,200 residents in my electorate that have a disability. We are also facing the challenge of investing in the future and assisting the members of our society who need additional support, all the while making responsible savings decisions. We managed to create a plan that does this while still keeping these cuts to a minimum. I think it is important in this debate that we look at the position of the other side. I think you will find it does stand in stark contrast. Those on the other side have a plan to rip out the schoolkids bonus, take away the cost of living assistance and scrap the historic pension increases. Among other cuts, they also intend to decrease the tax-free threshold, which we increased to $18,000; they are going to reduce it back to $6,000, and that will certainly hurt the lowest paid workers in this country, many of whom reside in my electorate. Labor has been trusted by the electorate to govern Australia for 20 of the last 31 years. I say that there is good reason for that. Today one of the main testaments to this government's good economic management is the interest rates, which are now lower than any other time of the previous government, with families on an average mortgage of $300,000, which is the average in my electorate, paying up to $5,500 less now in repayments. Three times over Labor's period of governing, our nation has faced an economic crisis that has arisen from factors beyond the control of a comparatively small and an internationally exposed economy such as ours. The first was in the mid-eighties when the Hawke-Keating government confronted a dramatic collapse in the terms of trade, which saw a decline in the index from 65.4 to 55.3 between 1985 and 1987, which was the sharpest two-year decline in more than 50 years. Labor responded courageously with a mid-term economic statement that saw a sharp reduction in spending, a dramatic process of deregulation and an opening up of the economy. Two important points need to be made about these initiatives. Firstly, they were certainly far-reaching when they were introduced in such a way as to protect low-paid and vulnerable workers and their families. Secondly, the then opposition fought tooth and nail against many of the key measures enacted as a necessary response to the critical economic situation. There is nothing new about the hidebound negativity of the opposition and their contrariness when it comes to opposing vital and overdue reforms. Labor faced its second economic challenge shortly after coming to office in 2007 when, in early 2008, the sub-prime crisis of the United States morphed into a near total collapse of major US financial institutions resulting in a full-blown recession across much of the developed world. Many in this country did not feel this recession, but it is one that continues to reverberate today, certainly, through the economies of the US, Japan and many of the European nations. Australia, almost alone across the developed world, escaped largely unscathed from the global financial crisis acknowledged by most economists as the worse financial crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Australia was almost unaffected because this Labor government responded quickly, courageously and effectively with a $10 billion stimulus package and a series of bank deposit guarantees. You will also recall that it was necessary for further stimulus measures, worth $47 billion, which were delivered in 2009. The effect was to defy the dire prognosis of many economists such as Chris Richardson of Access Economics, who in January 2009 predicted a halving of the corporate tax profits. As a matter of fact they grew that year by about three per cent on current prices, and he predicted a rise of 300,000 in unemployment, which was six times the actual figure. He also predicted that the New South Wales and Victorian economies would be stuck firmly in reverse. The truth is, as history will show, that both states outperformed the whole country over the period. The International Monetary Fund-hardly a hotbed of neo-Keynesian radicalism-is just one of the many organisations to acknowledge that this government got its strategy right. In 2013 it reported that the Labor governments of 2007 and 2010 had been fiscally prudent and that the Labor stimulus spending in 2008 and 2009 was appropriate to stabilise the economy. Another organisation, the OECD, also applauded the stimulus package saying that it had a strong effect in cushioning the downturn. All three of these agencies, for the first time in our history, have given the Australian economy the prodigious AAA rating. That has never occurred before. Similarly, the Reserve Bank of Australia Deputy Governor Philip Lowe, in an address to the Australian Industry Group on 19 March this year said: So over these three years we have seen growth close to trend, a stable and relatively low unemployment rate and inflation at target. By the standards of most other countries, this represents a very good outcome and a high degree of internal balance. Viewed in this light, how hollow and dishonest is the conservative's rhetoric about waste and mismanagement. The question that has to be asked is: what would they have done if they were in office during these financial challenges? The coalition's favourite economist, Judith Sloan, let the cat out of the bag on ABC's Lateline on 3 May when she said: I don't believe in this that a government should do whatever it can to keep an economy out of recession. … … … There comes a point when a recession, hopefully a mild one, actually can be quite useful and that's what should have been allowed to be done That is it in a nutshell. That is where they get their economic advice from. That is the difference between Labor and the conservatives. We on this side of the House do not believe that the lives and livelihoods of families should be a blight in the cause of fiscal rectitude whereas those on the other side in their candid moments admit that there is a price to be paid and they are prepared to pay it. Australia now faces its third economic challenge. The challenge is above all testaments the country's success in weathering the global financial crisis, and so it comes about. As one commentator describes it, the most devastating, long-lasting impact of the GFC is that it created a flight of capital to economic safe zones and in a weak global economy Australia looks very attractive to those investors. Our terms of trade, although still strong, are clearly faltering. Interest rates are low yet our currency remains high, particularly against a weak US dollar, the euro and the pound. This is hurting all our globally exposed industries and is having an especially damaging impact on tax receipts from businesses. It calls for our evenhanded fiscal approach, however, that tackles the imbalance between revenue and spending on both sides of the equation. That is precisely, quite frankly, what this government has attempted to do through its budget. We need to ask what our opponents would have done in these circumstances. Tony Abbott gave a rare insight into the approach that he would favour when he addressed the right-wing Institute of Public Affairs in Melbourne on 5 April. The IPA, in addition to being the ideological home to the climate change deniers, also favours the radical agenda of dismantling a large part of Australia's safety net as much as the regulatory frameworks that protect workplaces, households, the environment as well as privatising a wide range of iconic Australian public assets. They recently condensed their extreme agenda into a 75-point wish list, and Mr Abbott was right on board: So, ladies and gentlemen, that is a big 'yes' to many of the 75 specific policies you urged upon me … There is a very clear difference in the values held by those opposite and those of this Labor government. Our values are clearly demonstrated in this year's budget and the 10-year plan to ensure a fairer and stronger nation for the future. We will continue to invest in the future, to make responsible saving decisions that will strengthen our economy and to provide front-line services that families rely upon all whilst supporting and caring for the most vulnerable members of our society. These are the Labor values. These are the values I stand by. I am proud to support these bills and support this budget. manage to spend the full amount of time available but the vast bulk of the time he did use he simply trash talked the coalition. How remarkable. It is supposed to be a budget born out of Labor values, that he struggled to articulate, and somehow it was economically responsibleand he could not point to any real examples of that. And then he went on to talk about how helpful it would be for people in our community and he struggled to identify who those people would be. Instead we got a dissertation of trash talk and assertion, setting up to the coalition all sorts of mischief which does not reflect the coalition's position at all. And this is where we have got to these days. This government is so dysfunctional, so tired of itself that it cannot even defend its own budget. It is supposed to be the high watermark for government and government members to advocate all the virtue that is in the budget as some kind of fiscal plan to support an economic strategy to strengthen our country. What is missing is that there is no fiscal plan here. There is no clear economic strategy to restore the prospects of a nation, and there is certainly no national interest guiding that just day-to-day survival talk in an attempt to preserve their own positions in parliament rather than look after a plan for the country. It was interesting to hear that this job was badged as one about jobs and growth. This budget was supposed to be about jobs and growth. Yet remarkably, this budget forecast a reduction in the rates of economic growth in the country and an increase in the unemployment rate-so much for it being about jobs and growth. But it does put it on par with the last budget. Who can forget the opening remarks of the Treasurer when he said-and this was last year's budget: This Budget delivers a surplus this coming year, on time, as promised, and surpluses each year after that, strengthening over time. He went on to promise: The deficit years of the global recession are behind us. The surplus years are here.",274,Bills
296,Mr Billson (Dunkley) (15:59,"It was interesting that the member for Fowler did notThat is what the Treasurer said. That is what has been found to be so empty and vacuous by the numbers that are in this budget. Yet. Yet here you have Labor members harking back to their bad luck, to how everything has been cruelled by circumstances and they are really much better than the facts present. They are really very competent if only these areas of bad luck would not here. Isn't it incredible though? How come that every year Labor is in government there is bad luck? In the community where I was raised, hard work meant you were luckieryou had created your own luck-and it was remarkable how those who worked hard and applied themselves most diligently seemed to be the most lucky. That simple life lesson seems to be lost on this government. In fact rather than the four year of surplus, this budget heralds not only the most extraordinary budget broken promise about the surplus that we are supposed to have where we are now greeted with figures pointing to a $19 billion deficit, it then forecasts deficits for years to come. Nineteen billion dollars, the fifth biggest deficit in our nation's history, which next financial year will be $18 billion, the sixth biggest in our nation's history, and the year after that $11 billion. Now that is not the seventh, it is actually the eighth. Labor delivered the seventh largest budget deficit back in 1995-96. What we are expected to believe from this government is that if you elect Labor for a fourth time you will get a budget surplus. A fourth election win will enable the Australian public to get a budget surplus. We have not had one since their initial election in 2007, and none since 2010. There is not going to be any before 2013 election and Labor hopes that if they are re-elected after the 2016 election you might get a budget surplus. That is an awful lot to ask the Australian public: that after four elections Labor promises they may deliver a budget surplus-and a wafer-thin one at that. I think I share the views of many in the community that I represent and many that I speak with as I travel around representing the small business community. This crowd, Labor, just cannot be believed. There is no economic strategy to guide the nation's economic future after they have squandered and overspent the rivers of gold coming from the mining boom. There is no clear strategy to get the budget back into surplus even though we were promised that the job would not only be done this year, it would be done for evermore. There is no coherent strategy around what those sensible and prudent budget cuts will be. There is no evidence in here that the government has learnt at all from the mistake it has made over and over againtaking Herculean optimistic revenue forecasts, claiming them as locked in, spending the money like a Christmas bonus that you spend back in June, July, August, September, October and November, and then it might arrive in December, and even if it does, it looks nothing like all the money you have spent-and somehow we are supposed to take these guys for real. I am reminded of that great statement that John McEnroe made after a bad line call, 'You can't be serious!' We cannot treat this government with seriousness and these numbers certainly are not serious. They are dodgy. They are rubbery. They are indefensible and that is why you just heard the member for Fowler not even use his time available to explain the virtue of the budget so lacking is it in virtue. He could not even spend the whole amount of time trash talking the coalition. That is what is wrong with this government: they just do not have a plan. They have nothing positive to say. They have no strategy to steer the country out of the hole that they have driven this nation into because of their spending problem. And it is a spending problem. This is a spending problem this government has, not a revenue problem. The 2013-14 budget sees this government $80 billion in front of the revenue that was available when the Howard government was last in office. This government has $80 billion more but it still cannot balance the books. We are still seeing debt and deficit as far as the eye can see. Rather than have revenues savaged, what is being savaged is the nonsense Herculeanly optimistic, fantasy forecasts of revenue that the Treasurer relies upon time and time again to try and suggest he has got some capacity to balance the budget. What has been savaged is the Treasurer's credibility. That is what has been savaged, not the revenue. The revenue is growing substantially. As I travel around Australia. I know small business owners would love to have their revenue growing at over seven per cent. They would love that. They wish they could have that but they do not because the economy is tough out there. There are no sloppy profits anywhere. There are no easy margins. A lot of businesses are just running to stand still in this economy Labor has created. They would love that growth in revenue the government has got. Not only has the government spent all of that but they have spent more and driven us into this extraordinary point where Labor has now spent $192 billion more than it has raised over the last five years. We have seen expenditure as a percentage of GDP higher every year under Labor than the last years under the Howard government. They all say 'but look at revenue'. Yeah, that is a cute tactic. When you are not paying your bills, your revenues are down from where they should be. Have a look at the expenditure. Have a look at what is in this budget about some kind of credible path back to surplus. Here is a graph about the reality of the mining boom revenues. See how it is going down? But in alpine proportions the government expects that it will have this ski jump coming up the other end that will somehow salvage it from its arrangements on revenue. These are the carbon tax numbers. These are the realities of what is going on. money. He must have chilblains to try and have people believe that these alpine ski jumps are anything like reality. The one I think is extraordinary is apparently the boats are going to stop. They are not going to change any policy setting. They are not going to reinstate the Howard government policies that actually worked. But the boats are going to stop. The member for McEwen-I will forgive him for being a bit of a rookie-do you know how many people were in detention who had arrived illegally by boats when the Howard government left office? Four people. Labor used to go around saying that every boat that arrived was a policy failure. They were getting stuck into the coalition because we kept Manus Island open and there was only one person in there. What a nice problem to have. Now there are tens of thousands of people. There is no change in policy but again this budget relies on the assumption that everything is going to be back under control. We will be able to strengthen and protect our borders yet there is no evidence of that. Our VISA card limit as a nation is $300 million and is under pressure again. It has already been lifted five times by Labor as they fund their spending binge. The budget papers reveal",277,Bills
297,The Deputy Speaker,I ask the member for Dunkley to refrain from using props.,279,Bills
298,Mr Billson,"There must be some kind of frozen fingeritis as the Treasurer counts histhat it will peak again at $370.3 billion in 2016-17 yet there is no provision in here for raising that VISA card limit because the government knows it cannot face its own failure again after assuring the parliament over and over again that it would never be need to be corrected again. Then there is the Parliamentary Budget Office account of the structural deficits and surpluses. Again, another kind of ski jump-the ones that are above the line are the structural surpluses under the coalition and the ones below the line are the structural deficits under Labor. Even in here there is a very concerning warning drawn to the parliament's attention. It talks about what the government calls its signature programs. Its school improvement program actually saw $325 million pulled out of schools over the life of this government. Again, you are expected to vote for Labor four times before you see any upside. That is a lot to ask of people I would submit to you. It also talks about disability care. It says that it is nice that the structural deficits are made a little bit less worse by the government's approach to these two signature projects. Why is it saying that? It is saying that because, in here, the Parliamentary Budget Office knows that there is less money being spent on schools in the forward years of the estimates. That takes the pressure off the structural deficit Labor has created. They give the government an implied 'thank you' for taking some pressure off the budget structural deficit. But then they say, 'What happens after those years?' There is the ski jump again; the expenditure is supposed to go up. Vote for Labor four times and you might see some upside. Here is the warning saying that that will add to the structural deficit that Labor has created and inculcated into our financial system. It makes the same point about the disability program and the increase in the Medicare levy. It is making the point that more money is being raised to pay for the trials than is needed at the moment, but when the scheme is fully rolled out there is nowhere near enough money. So, even on these signature programs, the Parliamentary Budget Office is belling the cat again that Labor is incapable of managing finances, and that is causing great concern through the Australian community. We have heard some people say, 'Well, what will the coalition do?' Did you see that fantastic budget address-in-reply by the Leader of the Opposition? What a remarkably good speech. It is probably the best I have seen. I am told by people who have been involved in public life for decades longer than me that it was the best they have seen as well. It was clear and coherent. It was a plan with more fiscal detail than Labor or any opposition leader in the last 30 years has provided. It showed how you could keep what was supposed to be the compensation for the harm of the carbon tax without the hurt of the carbon tax and how that would be funded. With the budget emergency that the government has created we will all have to, as a parliament, face up to some difficult financial decisions. Whatever side of politics is elected, all will need to face up to that economic reality. Even Labor, if they are re-elected, will have to face up to the economic reality. That is why when they are making promises about spending you just have to remember all the promises that have been made already. They have less of a shelf-life than a loaf of bread; it goes off after about a week. This is the problem that we have with this government. Don Argus has warned people about the concerns and has pointed to the need for consolidation. But I am worried about what it is doing to young people who talk to me about their concerns. They do all we ask of them as a society to train, to prepare, to study to tool-up and to nurture their capacity to make a contribution, and they are wondering where that start will be. Where will that start be? There is nothing in this budget that builds confidence in the economy. There is nothing in this budget that gives some support or a game-changer to small business. There is nothing in this budget that takes the pressure off household budgets. There is nothing in this budget that gives encouragement to courageous men and women who take risks to create opportunities for themselves and their communities. There is nothing of that kind in this budget whatsoever. What is in this budget is a whole lot of short-term fixes that do not stand the test of analysis. What is in this budget is the longest confession note that they are trying to make life difficult for whomever forms government after the next election. What is in this budget is a testimonial to all the mismanagement, the waste, the debt and deficit of years of Labor, which this nation cannot afford to keep, and the people in this nation cannot bear having it hung over them as a disadvantage for their future prospects and future opportunities. I will give you an example. The debt-$7.8 billion a year will be the interest charged on Labor's debt alone. Imagine what you could do with that. Imagine what you could do with all of the spending that has gone onto non-productive and useless activities that have not improved our capacity as a nation and our prospects for the future. It is quite the opposite. For the small business men and women who are looking for a sign that Labor had the vaguest interest in their success, there have been five small-business ministers in 15 months. There is no interest in the quarter of a million jobs that have been lost in small business as a result of this government's mismanagement. Even the things they were promising such as the lost carryback, which was a proposition the coalition advocated in response to the GFC, has gone as well. The tax office is saying, 'Don't use it. Do the right thing by the nation.' (Time expired) Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2013-2014, Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 2013-2014 and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 1) 2013-2014. The bills are to appropriate money out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund for the ordinary annual services of the government and for related purposes. I do so in the context of Deputy Prime Minister Swan having delivered a budget that is committed to making our nation stronger, smarter and fairer. I do so in the context of being a proud member of the Australian Labor Party, someone who is passionate about looking after older people, especially those living on fixed incomes, Australians living with disability and the families and carers that support them, and students who take the time to put themselves through higher education or training. As you know, Deputy Speaker, education is the great equaliser in Australia. If funded appropriately, it provides great opportunities for the nation, not just in the short-term but in the next 50, 60 and 70 years as we compete with the rest of the part of the world that we are located in, which is Asia. Unlike much of the world, Australia's economy has been resilient, but I know that for many small businesses and families it has not been easy. I know that people in retail are not being swamped by shoppers pulling their wallets out. I have over 19,000 small businesses in my electorate. I know that they have been doing it a bit tough. Some of that can be traced back to the global financial crisis, some can be traced to the vagaries of an internet shopping world, with internet shopping being on the increase, and some of it obviously can be traced back to a Queensland that has seen 14,000 jobs cut, with the people in the jobs that service these employees suffering accordingly. There has been one good thing about seeing Premier",279,Bills
299,Mr Perrett (Moreton,"Government Whip) (16:14): I rise today to speak onNewman's cuts in Queensland: it has given us a glimpse of what austerity can do to families, to homes, to small businesses and to a state's economy. It certainly has given us a taste of what would happen if the Liberal and National Party were successful on 14 September. As I said, I know that not everyone in my community is having an easy time at the moment. Many modern families, working mums and dads, are finding it hard to juggle working and caring for children, managing cost-of-living pressures, and supporting ageing parents. These are tough challenges for people. It has just been announced that electricity bills under the Queensland state government are likely to go up by nearly 20 per cent in the next financial year-another cost for families in Moreton to bear. As a member of the Labor PartyI am always particularly focused on jobs, on employment. We know the benefits that come with having somebody in the household working. I was here during the global financial crisis when we voted to secure jobs because of the advice we had from Treasury about what would happen if we did not. What would the Australian community would look like if you cut 200,000 jobs? There would be 200,000 homes where the worker was on unemployment benefits. Not only would that be a big cost to the economy but there would be the social consequences flowing from that. Having grown up in a single-parent household, with my mum being a nurse, I know how horrified many Queenslanders must have been when they thought their front-line jobs were safe only to find their jobs cut by Campbell Newman. Imagine that multiplied. Imagine what we would have seen if 200,000 people extra had been on unemployment benefits. Jobs are always the federal Labor government's No. 1 priority. We are working hard to support families in coping with these cost-of-living pressures. Obviously as a government under Prime Minister Gillard we have a strong plan to strengthen the economy, to grow those jobs beyond the mining industry. Whilst the mining industry is very significant and is expanding-and there is still a pipeline of infrastructure either about to hit production or about to be assembled-the reality is there are lots of other opportunities for us in this part of the world, particularly in terms of some of those strong Queensland opportunities like tourism and the service industry, and things like education. Throughout the GFC, the Labor government focused on keeping people in jobs. We spent a lot of money creating new apprenticeships and making sure that economic growth was maintained. In the time that I have been a member of parliament, we have delivered over 900,000 jobs-at a time when nearly 30 million jobs have been lost throughout the world. We have unemployment at 5.6 per cent. Compare that to the 500 million people located in Europe, where unemployment is at 11.9 per cent. There are a few horror stories scattered throughout there. In places like Spain you have got nearly 25 per cent unemployment and some areas have 50 per cent youth unemployment. Imagine the social dislocation that comes with every second young person having no hope and having no job. Australia has AAA status for the first time ever. We are one of only eight countries in the world to have the status. This status was confirmed again by the rating agencies after Deputy Prime Minister Swan delivered his budget night speech. I know there is fear and misinformation being peddled by those opposite-this relentless jeremiah about debt, doom and gloom. We have the ridiculous situation where the Leader of the Opposition is comparing Australia to Cyprus. We are a million miles from there and we have had the independent rating agencies confirm this. We are now the 12th biggest economy in the world-up from the 15th biggest economy at the time the Labor Party took office in November 2007. Our economy has grown more than six times faster than those great powerhouse nations like Germany and the United States. This is what we need to be compared with. I am proud of the Australian Labor Party's achievements and, more importantly, our focus on the future. Look at some of the projects and policies we are rolling out. We have signed the DisabilityCare agreement, which will surely go down in history in the next 30, 40 or 50 years as one of the greatest achievements of any modern government. I was proud to be at Autism Queensland in Sunnybank when the Prime Minister and the Premier of Queensland signed the DisabilityCare agreement that locks in funding for over 2,000 people living in Moreton with a disability. It is a great comfort for them. They will have control over their lives and have support for their families and carers. It will provide certainty for all Australians in the eventhorrible as it is to contemplate-that they or their loved ones acquire a disability. They will receive the care and support they need. This policy will kick off in only 34 days time. Let us look at education, which is something I am particularly passionate about, having been an English teacher for 11 years. In my time here in this parliament-just in the 42nd and 43rd parliaments-we have doubled the investment in school education at a time when the Premier of Queensland in one year in office cut funding to every single school in Queensland. Every state school received a cut and then obviously, as anyone who understands school funding knows, that flowed on to non-government schools. That is a policy to compare and consider on 14 September. This Labor government has invested in education and the LNP government has slashed. We have upgraded facilities at every single school in Moreton. Sure, it was an economic policy, but Prime Minister Rudd at the time knew that every principal, P&C president and P&F president had a list of jobs that needed to be done and those jobs benefited the tradespeople around those schools. All 9,200 schools throughout Australia received that immediate boost and then the bigger projects were rolled out, such as the libraries, the school halls et cetera. We have provided more information to parents through the MySchool website. Having been a teacher and having worked for a teachers union, I know how tough this has been for some teachers. They are very professional people. Now we accept it as part of the communication process. It is accepted by all in the community and is one of the most accessed websites going. We are delivering the skills and training required for the jobs of the future through our $3 billion jobs and skills package. I am proud to say, as someone who only got a break in life because I could go to teachers college, we now have an additional 150,000 students attending university. Who are these people? They are people like me who grew up in rural and remote areas, people with English as a second language or Indigenous people. So we are creating opportunities rather than just catering for the privileged. Let us look at some of the other great achievements. We have raised the superannuation guarantee from nine per cent to 12 per cent, boosting the retirement savings of 8.4 million Australians. This is something that I am sad to say the Leader of the Opposition has committed to cutting. History will condemn him, whereas history has judged kindly those great leaders like Hawke and Keating who took the time to implement superannuation changes so that all Australians benefit from having managed funds. We are now seen as the Switzerland of the south in terms of having an ability to manage money. It will be a great job opportunity for children in 10, 20 and 30 years time as we move into Asia, India, China and Indonesia to show the great skills we have. One of our proudest achievements-the one you know is good because those opposite condemn it the most-is our emissions trading scheme. It would have been nice to bring it in on 2 December 2009 but unfortunately the Greens voted with the Nationals at the time and put the kibosh on it. But we do now have a price on pollution at a time when the planet more than ever needs to do it. I notice under the Keeling Curve we went past the 400 parts per million, which should be putting out an alarm bell across the planet. At least we have taken a step, but those opposite have committed to rescinding our scheme and coming up with this hair-brain scheme that will put $1,300 per household extra cost onto it. And it will not work. Their policy seems to be geared towards the low-hanging fruit-and the reality is the lowhanging fruit has already been plucked by the Labor Party's policy. We have an affordable paid parental scheme already in place, with over 2,000 local families in Moreton benefiting from Australia's paid parental scheme, proudly delivered by Jenny Macklin and the federal Labor government. It is an affordable, responsible scheme, not one that will give people struggling on $300-, $400or $500,000 a year-paid by the taxes of cleaners and the like-excessive contribution. It does not make sense. We have already had it flagged by some of those opposite. They have planned to not only increase costs, such as the increase in the GST, but also roll out austerity. I am terrified of that. In my local electorate they have made a commitment to not fund public infrastructure, particularly that great policy initiative of the Cross River Rail. I look forward to fighting, in the lead-up to 14 September, to achieve such initiatives as a new rail crossing at Coopers Plains at the Orange Grove Road intersection. It is a rail crossing that was articulated by Gary Hardgrave back in March 1996 in his first speech, yet he did nothing about it in his 12 years as a member of parliament. I will endeavour to have funding obtained for that. I am also looking at what I call a dragon crossing in my electorate at Sunnybank, between two supermarkets, to make it both an iconic piece of architecture and disability-friendly, and so will put some lifts in for people to cross the very busy main road. I am looking to bringing back koalas to Toohey Forest, working with Darryl Jones and the Griffith University, to look at the feasibility to ensure that the Toohey Forest area can support a koala population, even if it is a support population. I am committed to getting some money for the local men's shed at Sunnybank, working with the Sunnybank RSL who do great work, looking to upgrade the Acacia Ridge sporting precinct and fund some of the renovations at the Yeronga community centre, install some CCTVs at one of the nightclub areas in Sunnybank Hills and fund some of the necessary renovations at the Oxley Senior Citizens hall, the Sunnybank Special School, the Acacia Ridge community centre and the Kyabra Community Association. I am proud to be part of the Labor Party because I know that elections are important turning points for the nation. They expose some of the reasons we decide to join a political party in the first place. I know what Labor values are about. They are about supporting families, they are about giving people opportunities and they are about investing in education and providing a disability care program. I am proud of these initiatives. (Time expired) Ms KATE ELLIS (Adelaide-Minister for Employment Participation and Minister for Early Childhood and Childcare) (16:29): I proudly rise today to support the appropriation bills 2013. I support a budget that has Labor principles at its very core. I support a government that has not been afraid to make once-in-a-generation investments critical to our nation's well-being and development-investments that go far beyond political cycles and parliamentary terms. We are a government that has had the courage to make big decisions about this country's future. This is a budget that puts Australia's interests first. Most importantly, it is about jobs and it is about growth. In my ministerial portfolios, I warmly welcome record investments, yet again, in early childhood education and care and continued funding for successful job placement measures, such as job expos and local employment coordinators. Locally, as the very proud member for Adelaide, I have joined with my community to celebrate the massive funding contribution towards the much needed South Road upgrade in the city's inner north-west-something that I know the Deputy Speaker is also very supportive of. BeforeI discuss those specific measures in more detail, I want to go back to jobs and growth and to the need to make choices. Just as our government safeguarded our economy and in turn millions of households across the country from the very worse of the global financial crisis, we must maintain a responsible, steady course, because we have seen what savage austerity in Europe has created: record jobless numbers, growing poverty and business closures-all on a massive scale, all widespread. Labor made the choice when the GFC was knocking on our door not to go down that road. We framed budgets that faced those challenges head-on and insulated our economy with positive investments. As a result, since Labor came to office more than 950,000 jobs have been created. We are proud to be presiding over an unemployment rate right now that stands at 5.5 per cent-one of the lowest in the industrialised world. Our budget strategy has seen Australia achieve the gold-plated stable triple A credit rating from all three global ratings agencies for the very first time in our history-something that the Liberals could not achieve in 11½ years in office. Ultimately, the proof is in the pudding. In the worse economic conditions in 80 years, our economy is 13 per cent larger, with solid growth and contained inflation. It is in spite of these tough global economic conditions and through maintaining a strong economy, as well as achieving responsible and sensible savings measures, that we are now in a position to enter a new phase of nation-building investment. The National Plan for School Improvement is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to turn the unfair funding structure for Australian schools on its head-a funding structure that kept too many students back simply because of where they were, the size of their school or a host of other specific circumstances. In this government, we believe that all children deserve a great school, and we are looking at the decisions required to ensure that that occurs. For the first time, we link funding to each student's needs. The budget provides an additional $9.8 billion over six years. Just as Labor created Medicare, so too will we be the creators of DisabilityCare Australia-the first stable and secure funding stream for people with a disability and their carers. The significance of this move cannot be understated. For far too long, successive governments have shunned the opportunity to reform services for the profoundly disabled, leaving people with significant and permanent disabilities and their families and carers behind. Ours is a government that is changing all of that. The delivery of DisabilityCare will ensure the level of support someone receives does not depend on when or where they were born. I would like to congratulate South Australian Premier Joe Weatherill for being one of the first to enter into agreement with the Commonwealth to jointly fund and deliver disability care across South Australia. To deliver a stronger economy, this budget also commits $24 billion to vital infrastructure, bringing the government's total investment to around $60 billion from 2008-09 to 2018-19. I also want to take this this opportunity to highlight the massive investments made in my two portfolio areas, both of which are integral to the growth of the economy. Our government will once again deliver a budget with a record investment to improve access to quality, affordable child care for Australian families. More Australian parents have been supported in this budget to access child care for the first time. The strong growth in the number of children and families accessing child care reflected in this budget confirms that our policies are working. Almost 1.4 million children and over 960,000 families will access child care in 2016-17 supported by government childcare assistance. Never before have there been more children and families in Australian child care or more government assistance to subsidise their fees, something that we are incredibly proud of. That is potentially more than 960,000 people who are able to contribute and play a role in the workforce as a result of this sector which has been so strongly supported by our government. Over the next four years we will invest over $25 billion in early childhood education and care and, just to put that number in context, that is almost quadruple what was invested in the last four years of the Howard government. We are making that investment because we know how important child care is for workforce participation and the economy and because we also know that high-quality early childhood education and care gives children the best start in life and is one of the best investments any government can make. A number of specific funding measures will help to build a childcare system more responsive and suited to the needs of modern families. Firstly, we are investing $475 million over four years in childcare assistance to help more parents receive the training and skills they need to enter or re-enter the workforce. This includes an additional $27 million in this budget and $225 million in the last budget to support more families with the cost of child care with the Jobs, Education and Training Child Care Fee Assistance program so that they can get the skills that they need to get into the workforce. This budget has also delivered access to flexible child care to meet the needs of modern families. Our government understands that there has been a significant shift in the workforce in the last decade with a 25 per cent increase in the number of women in employment-a 25 per cent increase in just 10 years. Obviously, that is changing the way families are structured and it is changing the way that we go about work. We understand that for many families a little bit of flexibility would go a very long way in helping as they juggle work and child care, which is why in this budget we are investing $5.5 million to deliver childcare flexibility trials at over 50 sites across Australia to provide more flexible child care to respond to the needs of modern families. We have also delivered a $1.3 million childcare flexibility fund, a National Competitive Grants Program, to encourage those who have ideas on the way forward on new and innovative ways that they can better assist both families and children. We are interested in looking at funding those and then ensuring that those trials are backed up by an independent evaluation by the Australian Institute of Family Studies to see how they are meeting the needs of modern families and to see how they may be able to be rolled out more widely. This budget has also delivered in difficult times a commitment to our professional early childhood workforce, a commitment to our children that they deserve the best quality early childhood education led by qualified educators helping them to learn and develop. Our government understands that the professionalism of the early childhood workforce needs to be recognised on a sustainable and permanent basis across the sector moving forward. That is why we have set up the long-term pathway for early childhood educators to pursue better wages and that is why we have committed in this budget to establish a Pay Equity Unit within the Fair Work Commission. This unit will be able to do the research and collate the data to further assist appropriate resolution across the whole childcare sector in the long term. And of course it builds on the outcomes we have achieved in other feminised industries with pay equity for social and community sector workers and for the aged-care sector. Also in the interim, we have announced the Early Years Quality Fund to deliver an extra $300 million into the sector to support centres to lift the wages of early childhood educators who meet certain eligibility criteria over the next two years. This is a big step on the path to a professional early childhood workforce. It has now been recognised for the first time in this budget by our government, and I want particularly to acknowledge the work of my colleagues, both Bill Shorten, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, and Peter Garrett, the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth, for making this happen. The centrepiece of our childcare budget package is of course fee assistance, making child care affordable and manageable for families right across Australia. This is a tough budget environment but it is a testament to this government's core priorities that we have continued to make record investments in fee assistance, some $22.1 billion over the next four years. Other governments may have decided under the circumstances to target the fee assistance structure to achieve significant savings. They might have decreased the actual childcare rebate which stands at 50 per cent of costs. They might have lowered the annual cap, the maximum amount per year, that families are allowed to claim through the rebate. Other governments may have also decided to means-test the rebate or even to put a cap on the number of childcare places we fund. We are not that government. This budget continues to deliver the Labor government's support for the childcare rebate which we increased from 30 to 50 per cent. We increased the annual cap from $4,354 per child per year as it sat under those opposite to $7,500. We have made a clear decision to keep that and to not means-test the childcare rebate in this budget because we know how important it is to families with the cost of care. We will continue to deliver these record amounts, although of course we know that those opposite have pledged that all of this would be up for review and placed in jeopardy if they were to win government. Closer to home, my electorate of Adelaide can also see the significant investments in this budget for themselves. This year's budget brings $448 million to upgrade and widen South Road. I know that everyone in the inner west is aware of the dire need to undertake this work. In fact, just this year alone I have had over 16 street corner meetings in this part of Adelaide and this has been the No. 1 request and concern. This is finding that I strongly advocated for after receiving significant feedback from the local community. Improving South Road has been a strong message I have received from residents in the area and this is a real investment in a real project which I am incredibly pleased to be able to assist delivering for the people of Adelaide. Specifically, this funding will upgrade and widen South Road between Torrens Road and the River Torrens. It will include sinking 1.4 kilometres of the road below surface. It will include erecting an overpass for the Outer Harbour rail line, building three grade separated intersections at Hawker Street, at Port Road and at Grange Road, upgrading and realigning of the existing South Road to become a surface arterial road from Torrens Road to Ashman Parade and upgrading of Torrens Road intersection and the construction of an off-road shared cycling path which I know many people have requested. It will include installing a new walking trail from Torrens Road to the Torrens River. This funding will significantly ease the congestion along this section of South Road. More importantly, this funding will improve the lives of local residents who are sick and tired of being stuck in traffic, who are sick and tired of spending time bumper-to-bumper that they would much rather be spending at home with their families or in their workplaces being productive. But we also know that this is a project that you will only get from this side of the House because those opposite have made it very clear that this is a project that will be on the chopping block if they are elected to government, instead choosing to invest funding in the most marginal Liberal seat in the country in Boothby at Darlington in a project which we now is not as high a priority as this one for the local residents that I represent and that the Deputy Speaker Georganas represents to so very well. There are a number of other budget measures for Adelaide which I am really proud of including the Creative Young Stars program which will help foster the creative young minds of people in our area. Walkerville in the electorate will be eligible for competitive grounds to deliver innovative online local government services using the NBN. There will be more funds for youth cancer networks around Australia with the Royal Adelaide Hospital and the Women's and Children's Hospital in Adelaide leading this project in South Australia. All of these are incredibly important projects. This is why this budget is a good strong Labor budget and I am so pleased to be representing these significant wins for the people of Adelaide. This is why I am so proud to be part of a government that in challenging times has found a way that we can deliver the school improvements that Australian children deserve, that we can deliver DisabilityCare Australia, our first National and Disability Insurance Scheme, because we have made the hard calls to enable us to be able to adequately fund our proposals. I commend the bill to the House. 2013-2014 second reading debate. Australians have great opportunities ahead of us, many of them bestowed upon us by a country abounding in natural resources. But we also have some steep challenges. Some of them, like the high Australian dollar and vestiges of the global financial crisis, are not of our own doing. Too many, though, are incumbent upon us by a government treading through a quagmire of its own incompetence. Australians are being short-changed by a government more desperate to preserve its own power than to help this great south land to prosper. The Gippsland region puts in far more than it gets out of state and federal economies, whether it is 24 per cent of the nation's milk output, 25 per cent of Victoria's beef production, nearly 90 per cent of Victoria's power",281,Bills
300,Mr Broadbent (Mcmillan) (16:44,"I rise to speak in the Appropriation Bill (No. 1)generation or more than 60 per cent of Melbourne's fresh water. In McMillan we grow and make and power things. McMillan is the main street of Australia: it is where generations of families settled after World War II to make their homes, start their businesses, grow their farms and build their own towns and communities. WhetherI am talking to a group of kindergarten mums in Korumburra, tourism businesses in Warrigal or mechanical engineers at a power stations in the Latrobe Valley, my constituents tell me they want a government that believes in them and that will not stand in the way of their aspirations. McMillan is now broaching another chapter. With our large expanse of agricultural land, churning coalfields and rolling hills, our region is welcoming a new generation of families: young families who want to start a new life for themselves in Pakenham or Drouin and older folk who want to find a place to enjoy their twilight years. To sustain this we need new hospitals, safe roads and investment in business from government. Yet in this federal budget, despite a largess becoming of a king's ransom being delivered to marginal Labor and Independent seats around the country, not a single dollar spilled over from this pork-barrelling feast into McMillan. Not in the West Gippsland Hospital, not on the Warrigal-Korumburra Road, not on the Korumburra kindergarten, not in Leongatha, not in Wonthaggi, not in Inverloch, not in Drouin, not in Thorpdale, not in Trafalgar and not in Moe. Not even the Long Jetty. In fact, after this government had gone in for a smash and grab on the power stations in the Latrobe Valley, the very ones that provide nearly 90 per cent of the energy that keeps Victoria's lights burning, this Gillard-Swan government then gutted the Latrobe Valley transition fund. That is the fund established between Regional Development Victoria, Minister Peter Ryan and his former federal counterpart Simon Crean. Both men are passionate about regional Victoria, and both recognise the untold damage that would be unleashed on the Latrobe Valley by ripping the coal industry from under their feet. For the Latrobe Valley, the carbon tax really was arbitrary destruction of shareholder wealth in those power generation assets and the callous disinterest in the thousands of jobs that that industry sustains. The transition fund was the cushion designed to slow the fall, buying time and a buffer of support for the power stations and reliant businesses and jobs to adjust. Buried on page 37 of the Regional Australia, Local Government, Arts and Sport budget papers is confirmation that the Latrobe Valley can now expect an average of less than $2 million per year over six years in the federal government's supposed support for the region's transition to a cleaner economy. As the Latrobe Valley Express reports: Buried somewhere in the most recent federal budget papers was a figure of $15 million, to be spread over six years, for the Valley's structural adjustment as it moves to a low-carbon economy … The Express also picked up that this government was trying to squeeze itself out of the $200 million specifically set aside for regions expected to see power generators close under the government's now abandoned Contract for Closure process. This government is now trying to squeeze itself out of that obligation, and my good friend and colleague the member for Gippsland has noted this, saying that the Contract for Closure conditions were a caveat they added later just to get out of it. Rightly so, given the government's Clean Energy Future website refers to: … assistance supports workers, regions and communities that remain strongly affected by carbon pricing after other forms of assistance have been provided It does not mention Contract for Closure. If the Latrobe Valley does not fit that definition, then no region in Australia ever would. That the federal government can try to justify reducing support for Latrobe Valley by inferring that regions have not suffered unduly as a result of the carbon tax is an absolute furphy. The carbon tax has had a massive impact on the Latrobe Valley region, on the region's confidence and on the confidence of local business to make investment decisions, which, by the way, they are not making but just holding off on. The government is being dishonest with itself, with its leadership, with the numbers in this budget and with the Australian people by trying to perpetuate this furphy. There is another injustice that the government is prolonging for businesses and workers in this nation that I want to address, and that is the bludgeoning of small business away from growth, investment, ingenuity and job creation. Weekend penalty rates are being used as a blunt instrument against small businesses, particularly in the tourism industry in regional areas. My long standing view on this issue was reinforced a couple of weeks ago when I met with about a dozen small business tourism operators from across West Gippsland. These are really iconic Gippsland businesses, which are renowned for their food, wine, hospitality and uniquely exquisite views. One of these businesses, which is just outside of Warrigal, hosted the former Minister for Tourism Martin Ferguson, when, last year, he had the good grace to go there and announce a successful T-QUAL grant. Like his other former portfolio areas of energy and resources, Martin Ferguson knew and understood business and industry, and those sectors trusted and respected him for that. These small businesspeople are not mini moguls requiring a largesse of profits, as those on the other side would have you believe. They are not making huge profits. They are not seeking to pay a pittance to their workers, even though they often pay that to themselves. They are decent people who demonstrate real ingenuity towards their business operations. People visit this area for lunch or to get away for a weekend-whether to Foster, Fish Creek or Warrigal-and they come back again and again and again. These dozen or so small business and tourism operators and I met recently, and this is what they said to me: 'Russell, weekend penalty rates are killing our businesses. They stop us from putting on more staff. They create bad morale between full-time staff who work to one wage level and the staff who choose to work a couple of hours on the weekend because it is substantially more. This means we do not have enough left over to put back into the business, to make it bigger and better and more sustainable.' In Gippsland, as in many regional areas, the majority of tourism business comes at the weekend. This is great for students or even for mums or dads who may not be able to work during the week. It suits them to be able to work a couple of hours on the weekend, when they have to be at university or doing a school run from Monday to Friday. But penalty rates set up a two classes of workers-those who work from Monday to Friday and who do a full week for an award wage and those who choose to work those couple of hours on the weekend for an all together better wage. This means that a teenager working for a few hours a week can be paid up to $29 an hour to wash dishes. You can imagine how that would go down in any workplace. It shows a complete disregard not only for the needs of the business but also for the modern realities of today's communities and workplace environs, where choice and flexibility are as important for the employer as they are for the employee. There is another quintessential Gippsland industry that is being hindered, not helped, by this outdated approach to the modern workplace, and that is our dairy industry-the backbone of Gippsland's economy, where our fortunes ride more on a Jersey cow's back than on a sheep's back. These antiquated penalty rules mean that you cannot employ someone to do less than three hours of work a day, even though milking takes only an hour and a half. The Gillard government is ripping off our dairy farmers by effectively forcing them to pay twice the cost for half the output. There is a potential caveat in these penalty rules which means that, if the work being undertaken is an essential service, the three-hour rule can be overridden. For animal welfare, economic necessity and farmer well-being, dairy milking should be retitled as an essential service and be made exempt from these ridiculous penalty rules. These rules mean that a high school student who wants to squeeze in one or two hours of work between their time after school and their VCE study at the local hardware shop cannot, because Bill Shorten says that it is exploitation, not education. I have to note, though, that only last month Bill Shorten was on the ABC radio's Rafael Epstein program, and he did concede that regional tourism operators may warrant being a special case. I can only urge the minister to further develop his consideration of the tourism sector as a vital regional economy and to add to it that the dairy industry is an essential service. McMillan, as I said, is in the main street of Australia. It is at the economic heart of Victoria, and it is being sorely deprived of the realisation of its full potential by this Prime Minister. As I said to my local branch meeting last week, if the Labor Party do not change the Prime Minister in June then we will change the government in September. Australia deserves so much better. bills today and am disappointed that I only have a short amount of time to do so. Exposing the failures of this government has sadly become far too easy and its incompetence continues to undermine people's faith in this parliament. Following the non-spill initiated by the member for Hotham, Simon Crean, in March, it is apparent that Australians will have to endure this shambolic Labor government until September, despite efforts on both sides of the parliament to bring about an early election because of its dysfunction. TodayI would like to discuss some of the implications of this budget on the people of Canning. Clearly, this budget has been compiled by spinmeisters rather than economists. It is a dishonest budget and I am sure the Treasury officials despair when they see this government make a mockery of our nation's most important fiscal document. Why do I say it is dishonest? It is because when the Treasurer delivered his speech he said, 'I now say this is a budget about jobs and growth'. The budget papers said growth would be less and jobs would decrease, so it just cannot be true. On that note, it has become increasingly difficult to determine if elements of the Australian Public Service have become politicised or incompetent, as Graham Richardson pointed out on his show recently. He said someone has to be blamed for these wildly incorrect predictions. The Treasury head, Martin Parkinson, has tried to defend himself but he should learn that advice to your political masters should be frank and fearless. As we know, his predecessor, Ken Henry, not only involved himself in partisan views but also took a job in Prime Minister Gillard's office when he left. So it shows where he lined up.",288,Bills
301,Mr Randall (Canning) (16:54,"I am pleased to speak these 2013-14 appropriationLooking at some of the assumptions in this budget makes me wonder if Treasurer Wayne Swan believes Australians are fools. Wild assumptions paint a rosy picture of times ahead, despite it being clear that we are headed for tough times as a result of the mishandling of our public finances by this government. Firstly, let us look at the carbon price assumptions, which renowned economist Henry Ergas has described as garbage. The budget contained a major backflip by Minister Combet-and indeed this government-by writing down the projected carbon price for 2015-16 to $12.10. The coalition said for many years that Treasury's original prediction of a European carbon price of $29 a tonne was fanciful. After defending the indefensible for far too long the government has backed down and more than halved this predicted price. The problem is that $12.10 is still far higher than what the EU carbon price is expected to be, which is currently $5 a tonne. Most worrying is how the government has arrived at this figure of $12.10. Did they investigate the likely movements in the market based on expert advice, current trends or other meaningful analysis? No. Amazingly, the economists were apparently sent to the back of the room while the spin doctors crudely drew a straight line between where the carbon price is and where they need it to be in order to meet our emission reduction commitments. Maintaining a goal is one thing but to roll the dice with Australia's economy and base revenue forecasts on an aspiration is simply careless. Herein lies evidence of the fundamental failing of this Labor government. Rather than take a prudent approach to public finances, they spend what they do not have-in other words, they have a spending problem not a revenue problem, based on shaky predictions and wildly optimistic assumptions that never eventuate. This is a terribly irresponsible way to run a government and simply would not be tolerated in the private sector. Such foolish behaviour is not limited to the carbon tax revenue predictions. The mining tax projections have also been subjected to this government's overly optimistic manipulations. Raising just $200 million this year, the tax has raised 95 per cent less than the projected $4 billion that was originally forecast. Over the forward estimates, rather than raising the $26.5 billion that was originally forecast, the mining tax will only raise something like $5.5 billion. After this embarrassing write-down, did the government learn from its mistakes? Not likely. Despite this enormous write-down, Australians are expected to believe that the MRRT revenue will increase from $200 million this year to $2.2 billion in 2016-17-in other words, a 10-fold increase that is not validated or justified in the budget papers. It is just a prediction. Treasurer Swan blamed the lower terms of trade on the high Australian dollar for the writedown in revenue. The budget papers point to slightly lower terms of trade in the years ahead and the Australian dollar is to remain high and yet somehow we will receive a thousand per cent increase in the MRRT revenue. How does that work? Australians have now witnessed what happens to a budget when it is delivered by a treasurer with no past experience in economics or public finances. Collecting union dues clearly does not prepare a treasurer to be a competent person to run a $1½ trillion economy. I would like to take a moment to dispel a myth that has been peddled by Labor members and their apparatchiks, claiming the budget is now in structural deficit because of the policies of the Howard-Costello government. As Judith Sloan articulated in last week's Australian, the Parliamentary Budget Office report which initiated this falsehood is littered with errors and omissions. Take, for example, the fact that the stimulus spending was omitted from the calculations used to determine the structural balance-$67 billion of Commonwealth expenditure removed from the calculations was simply omitted. The PBO's report which attempted to argue that the Howard government was responsible for a structural deficit is just nonsense. The effort to try and shift the blame from the spendthrift government that has been office for almost six years and has delivered record deficits to a responsible government that delivered record surpluses is a sad and desperate ploy. Any amendments that this government deemed necessary to fix perceived structural problems could have been implemented long ago-in fact when it first got in. Only the ABC and its commentators would like to peddle the myths contained in the PBO report. Viewers watching the Insiders program yesterday would have seen Niki Savva as the voice of reason among Labor apparatchiks. Mike Seccombe tried desperately to place the blame for the parlous state of our nation's finances on the Howard government. I suggest that Mike calls one of his Labor cronies and asks them what they have done to address the problem that he attributes to existing prior to the 2007 election. Alternatively, I suggest that Mike puts his bias to one side and subjects his beloved Labor Party to adequate scrutiny, as he should as a commentator. One would expect that from a professional commentator on such a show. Better still, he can fly back to Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts and continue writing for the Vineyard Gazette and allow the ABC an opportunity to adhere to its charter on providing a balanced program. Unlike many of those at the ABC, Australians have measured this government. I am not down on the ABC; I think it is a great broadcaster and I would like to see it never being subjected to privatisation. People like Chris Uhlmann, Leigh Sales and Latika Bourke report the news and give excellent commentary, unlike predecessors such as Kerry O'Brien. People used to bail me up on the street about his adequate and balanced reporting on the ABC. We have heard that this Treasurer promised to deliver balanced budgets and we were told hundreds of times after last year's budget that he was actually going to deliver a surplus-a wafer-thin $1½ billion surplus. What Australians actually received in this budget was a $19.4 billion blow-out, larger than economists had predicted, yet Australians were not overly surprised as they have become accustomed to bad news from the Gillard government. I am told time and time again in travels across my electorate that they are simply waiting for September to let this government know what they think of their economic management. They manage their household bills and, when they see a government that cannot manage an economy, they are frightened and worried about it continuing. The old saying that they were waiting for Keating on their verandas with baseball bats has now gone in my opinion. They are now sitting with bazookas on their front verandas waiting to deal with this government. We have demonstrated that this year's budget does not help Australian families deal with the rising cost-of-living pressures. Because Labor has failed to be fiscally responsible Australian families are now paying for Labor's waste and mismanagement. In fact, data released last week by the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling underlines the fact that Australian families are paying for Labor's waste. The data shows that the cost of raising a child has risen 50 per cent in the six years of this government, while billions have been wasted on everything from pink batts, school halls and cash for clunkers to cost blowouts on border protection, the NBN and the set-top box programs. I could go on. It is Australian households that are bearing the brunt of this waste and mismanagement. Childcare fees have risen 22 per cent in just two years and our indexation of the childcare rebate is not recommended to be until 2014. Indexation of income thresholds for claiming family payments and FTB supplements are also on hold until 2017, after the next federal election, so two elections away. Increases to Family Tax Benefit PartA payments have been scrapped. This affects more than 11,000 families in the electorate of Canning. Family Tax Benefit PartA arrangements were set to increase up to $300 per eligible families with one child and $600 per families with two children and more. Slated increases to the tax-free threshold have been axed, affecting people earning up to $80,000 a year. The average income of a person living in the Canning electorate is $30,000 a year, based on the ABS figures. The abolition of the baby bonus is also going to hit expectant mothers. This budget reveals that Labor's total investment in school funding for primary and secondary schools decreases-$325 million over the next four years. In fact the budget clearly shows that over the forward estimates period new or additional money for education will only come from state and territory governments who agree to these Labor proposals and not from the Commonwealth itself. It is a cruel hoax and those advocating give a Gonski are being misled on this issue. In terms of Western Australia, analysis reveals a $229.2 million reduction over three years for school education. Labor's model essentially penalises Western Australia for investing in education over the years. I say to my constituents, 'You deserve better.' I just wish to talk about the effect of this budget on Western Australia. Many times in this chamber and the House of Representatives I have broached this subject. Anyone who spends any time in Western Australia understands the level of frustration that is felt among locals who can feel the wrath of Canberra pilfering the Western Australian wealth. Perhaps this anger would be lessened if taxpayers knew what the money is being spent on. However, six years of economic mismanagement spiralling debt and wasteful spending have eroded the faith of Western Australians in this government. Premier Barnett is often dismissed by his opponents, particularly the federal Labor Party, when he defends the right of Western Australia to receive its fair share of Commonwealth funding. I often think about the Labor Party room and the despair that they must feel and of the daylight robbery. I know how Mark McGowan must feel because he cannot wait to get out of Western Australia every time Julia Gillard comes to the state. In an article in the West Australian by Gareth Parker on 23 May this year, he pointed out in a heading, 'WA taxes carry a nation', going on to say: Almost $15 billion more in taxes leaves WA each year than flows back into the State in Commonwealth spending, a WA Treasury analysis shows. The article points out that net contribution to the other states and territories is a staggering $6,447 for each resident from Western Australia, way beyond that of the other two donor states, New South Wales and Victoria. So WA gives $6,447 per capita, New South Wales gives $301 and Victoria $235. The takers are Northern Territory, $17,058; Tasmania, $6,706; South Australia, $3,087 and Queensland, $1,325. This is in face of the fact that WA's share of the GST is 45c in the dollar. Treasury estimates that Canberra took $42 billion in taxation from WA but only spent $27 billion in the state in 2010-11. That is the most recent data. Treasury sources say the prediction was unlikely to improve as the state budget is handed down. This compares with the excessive spending on the electorates of the Independents in this House. The member for Lyne and the member for New England have been bathed in money since this government has been in place and we all know why. This government survives on their two votes. It is not fair that states like Western Australia are being milked of their resources when you have this government cravenly wasting money and then pork-barrelling their own electorates. For example, my electorate has received nothing to date from this government under the RDA. And this compares shabbily to the amount of contributions: I have the second-highest number of fly-in fly-out workers anywhere in Australia. They deserve some of their funds to be returned to them. (Time expired) Bill (No. 1) 2013-2014 and related bills. This year's budget keeps our economy strong, makes the smart investments for our future and ensures that every Australian gets a fair go. Importantly, the 2013-14 budget sets the National Disability Insurance Scheme in stone-one of the biggest social reforms our country has seen. For too long, successive governments have shunned the opportunity to reform services for the profoundly disabled, leaving behind people with significant and permanent disability, their families and their carers. The government is proud to be changing that. Delivering disability care will ensure the level of support someone receives does not depend on where they live or on the manner in which they acquired the disability. Around 1,850 people in my electorate of Bass will be eligible for support under disability care, which is fantastic. Australians have a choice in September this year: a choice between Labor protecting jobs, caring about the vulnerable and making the smart investments we need for the future, or the coalition's savage cuts to the bone, and its slash and burn. The member for Warringah's choice would be to cut to the bone so hard that he would put tens of thousands of jobs at risk and grind the economy to a standstill, stopping growth-like President Hoover. The savage cuts of Premier Campbell Newman in Queensland and the Liberals in Victoria are an entree to what will happen if the Liberals win in September. Before the election, the Leader of the Opposition wants you to believe you can have lower taxes, less savings and smaller deficits all at once. Yet we all know that after the election he will slash and burn like his mates in Queensland and Victoria. This is a mindless recipe for higher unemployment and lower growth. We on this side are governing for the future, investing in infrastructure and working to deliver the NBN. We are looking after regional Australia and thinking about what is important to local communities. For example, in the recent budget it was announced that every Broadband for Seniors kiosk would receive extra funding for a new computer and touchscreen monitor, ensuring seniors can benefit from a wider range of interactive computer applications and programs. There are many kiosks in Bass, at Invermay Bowls and Community Club, Glenara Lakes, Ainslie House in Launceston, Elphinwood Gardens, UAC, Aldersgate Village, Masonic Homes of Northern Tasmania, Fusion Home Support, PCYC Incorporated, Uniting Care Tasmania, Pilgrim Uniting Church, Ainslie House in Low Head, George Town Neighbourhood House, George Town District Hospital and Community Health Centre and Bridport Ex-Service and Community Club-all of which will benefit. I am also pleased to be able to tell seniors in my electorate of Bass that the federal government is supporting a three-year trial program to support pensioners over pension age to",291,Bills
302,Mr Lyons (Bass) (17:10,"I rise to add my remarks to the debate on the Appropriationdownsize their homes without an immediate effect on their pensions. There are over 9,600 pensioners in Bass who will take part. This is a great opportunity for them. There are also more than 12,600 local pensioners now benefiting from Labor's historic pension reforms including the biggest increase in pensions for 100 years. Since 2007, single pensioners on the maximum rate are receiving $207 a fortnight and couples on the maximum rate are receiving $236 a fortnight combined. We are also looking after families. For many modern families, with mums and dads juggling it all-working, caring for children, managing costs of living pressures and often supporting aged parents. While jobs have always been the federal Labor government's No. 1 priority, we have also had to work hard to help these families deal with the very real pressures that they face. In Bass, 990 local families are benefiting from Australia's first paid parental leave scheme, delivered by federal Labor. Around 80 local dads and their partners are already benefiting from Labor's new dad and partner pay since 1 January 2013, which provides two weeks paid leave to spend time with their new child and their family. More than 6,900 local families with 12,100 schoolkids get help with back-toschool costs each year thanks to the Labor government's Schoolkids Bonus. Eligible families will get $410 for each child in primary school and $820 for each child in high school, paid in two instalments each year. We are also looking after workers. Approximately 37,000 taxpayers in Bass received a cut on 1 July 2012 and around 31,000 taxpayers received a cut of at least $300, and 3,000 local residents will pay no tax at all, due to the tripling of the tax-free threshold. This will make a big difference to family budgets. The average wage-earner in Bass now pays approximately $2,103 less in income tax than in 2007-08 as a result of Labor's cuts for lowerand middleincome families, which is significant. It is also worth noting that recently I had a jobs expo in my electorate of Bass, where 2,400 people attended and well over 200 full time and part-time jobs were filled. Labor understands the dignity of work and the dignity that work provides. There are 311 local workers already benefiting from Labor's new Fair Entitlements Guarantee scheme. This scheme delivers on the government's 2010 election commitment to provide greater certainty for Australian workers. If their employer enters into liquidation or bankruptcy and they cannot pay their full entitlements, like annual leave and redundancy pay-the Leader of the Opposition voted against this-we will protect workers' entitlements. Labor has looked after Bass and I am very pleased with the support Labor has given to my electorate. Thousands in Bass would be left behind with a coalition government-6,900 eligible families and around 12,100 children if the schoolkids bonus is ripped out. They will cut to the bone, ignore the needs of the future and always ignore those in our community who have no voice. The Gillard government will always act responsibly to prioritise jobs so that the economy works for more people. We know that the biggest threat to the Tasmanian economy is the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition is coming under increasing pressure to change the way the GST is distributed and we have just heard from a member from Western Australia. They are into GST, don't worry about that. Let me inform the House that the Liberal candidates in Tasmania have been espousing that the only way the GST formula can be changed is by agreement with all state premiers. This is not the case. The distribution of GST is determined by the Treasurer. It is the Treasurer who signs the determination of state revenue-sharing relativities that are used to distribute the GST, under section 8 of the Federal Financial Relations Act 2009. It is not something that is agreed with by the states or requires change; only the Treasurer. There is a requirement that the states are consulted, but the Treasurer has full discretion. It is for this reason that Tasmanians and South Australians are worried. Tasmanians are worried that the GST could take away from our state, resulting in massive cuts to essential services, like hospitals and education. Treasurer Wayne Swan has assured Tasmanians that the Australian government will support the principle of horizontal fiscal equalisation. The Liberals are hopelessly divided on this issue. The Liberal premiers of Queensland and Western Australia believe they deserve a bigger piece of the pie and the Leader of the Opposition has said he is sympathetic to their concerns. In fact, he says one thing to those states and then comes to Tasmania and says something completely different. What we have to do some time or other is get it in writingbecause that is what he says you can believe. It is clear that if the member for North Sydney, Joe Hockey, becomes Treasurer he could decimate Tasmania's revenue with the stroke of a pen. Do we trust Joe? No. They have free rein to make their own decisions, and that is a $600-million risk to Tasmania's finances. Labor has worked hard to protect jobs and support families and that is what it will keep doing. The Prime Minister has a plan to strengthen our economy, to grow jobs beyond mining and support families so that no one gets left behind. Throughout the GFC, Labor focused on keeping people in jobs, creating new apprenticeships and maintaining economic growth. Australia has triple-A status for the first time, one of only eight countries in the world with a 12-biggest economy, up from 15. With Labor, our economy has grown more than six times faster than Germany and the United States. We are helping families, working hard to protect jobs and investing in the future. Those opposite have had a negative, disruptive five years in opposition and they have been too lazy to come up with a plan. Their document that was released in Tasmania this week is supposed to be a plan. It is no plan. It is all smoke and mirrors-and mostly mirrors because all they are going to do is look into it. 14. Where does one start? Perhaps we should go back to 2007. We had the economy growing strongly. We had record low unemployment. The previous coalition government had fixed the problem that we had on our borders. Our borders were secure. The budget was under control. The previous coalition government had paid back $96 billion of the previous government's debt. What often gets forgotten is that not only did they pay back that $96 billion but along the way they also paid $57 billion worth of interest. So they paid back the $96 billion in debt and $57 billion in interest repayments. On top of that, they put $45 billion in reserve in the Future Fund. It often amazes me when I come into this place and hear members from the other side saying that the Howard government never did this and never did that. They had to pay back $150 billion of Labor's past debt and deal with that first before they could put aside $45 billion in the Future Fund. That was back in 2007. Then of course we had the then opposition leader, Mr Rudd, acting as a John Howard light and convincing the Australian population that he should be given a go: 'It'll be all right. We'll continue. I'm a fiscal conservative'-I remember the words. That was",295,Bills
303,Mr Craig Kelly (Hughes) (17:20,"I rise to speak on the appropriation bills for 2013back in 2007. Here we are with the Labor government delivering five deficits in a row, the five largest deficits in our nation's history-$192 billion combined budget deficits. This year, after promising us a surplus, we end up with a $19.4 billion deficit, and we are still counting. The financial year is not over. I know there is talk about banning live odds. I would like to bet a few dollars that that $19.4 billion will blow out and be a lot more by the time the final figure is weighed in-coincidentally, after the election. Next year we are promised a deficit of $18 billion and the following year still another deficit. I remember sitting down in the House 12 months ago when the Treasurer delivered his budget speech. I have a copy of it here. The budget speech delivered on 8 May 2012. He said: I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Treasurer started: The four years of surpluses I announce tonight are a powerful … What a complete load of crock. He went on: This budget delivers a surplus this coming year, on time, as promised, and surpluses each year after that, strengthening over time. It goes on. The Treasurer also said: The deficit years of the global recession are behind us. The surplus years are here. He continued: Surpluses that provide a buffer against global uncertainty, and continue to give the Reserve Bank room to cut interest rates for familiesAnd again: … we're balancing the books. What an absolute farce! But it was not just in the budget speech. Take some of the other comments that we heard from the Treasurer and the Prime Minister. Here we have the Prime Minister on the Today show in November 2010. The Prime Minister said: The Budget will be back in the black, back in surplus, in 2012-13. Laurie Oakes said, 'Guaranteed?' The Prime Minister said, 'Yes.' Then of course we had the Treasurer on the Sunrise program on 18 August 2010. The Treasurer said: Well, we're getting back into surplus in three years, Kochie. David Koch responded: Okay, come hell or high water? The Treasurer said: Come hell or high water. And of course it goes on. Then we had the Prime Minister in a speech on 13 April 2011 when she said: My commitment to a budget surplus in 2012-13 was a promise made and it will be honoured. We saw that promise broken. It was not honoured on budget night just a few weeks ago. This language is detrimental to every elected official in our country. As politicians, we try to think that we do the right thing and have a proud reputation, but when we have a Prime Minister and a Treasurer that make statements like that time after time after time and when that is on top of the promise that there 'will be no carbon tax under the government I lead', is there any wonder that the public out there simply do not believe a word this government says? When they come in now and make all these grandiose promises, the public is simply taking them with a grain of salt. When we talk about the debt and the failure to deliver a surplus and delivering none out of five and not being able to produce a surplus and running up the deficit, what does this actually mean to the public? If you look at this year's Budget Paper No. 1, page 10/9, 'Australian Government general government sector net debt and net interest payments', it shows the cost to the community. If we go back to the last year of the Howard government, 2007-08, we actually had $45 billion in the bank. On that the country was earning $1,196 million in interest-$1,196 million was coming into the government revenue before we collected a cent of tax. If we look at that across the 150 electorates, that was $8 million for each of our 150 electorates coming into the country, that we could have done things with. Mr Deputy Speaker Symon, I am sure that in your electorate there are a lot of things that you could do with $8 million. I know I certainly could have. That money of course has all gone-spent-and of course the debt has been racked up year after year after year. In this year and the next three years there is the interest that we must repay. Forget paying off any of the principal, just the interest alone. I will go through the numbers. This year we have to pay $8,238 million in interest. Next year it is an estimated $7.8 billion. In 2014 it is estimated at $8.4 billion and in 2015-16 it is estimated at $9.7 billion. This year and for the next three we as a nation must pay back in interest only, mainly to overseas foreign interests, $34.23 billion. That is $34,230 million that has to come from the pockets of the taxpayers of this nation and we send it mainly overseas just to pay the debt that this government has racked up. That is the cost. That works out at close to $1,500 for every man, woman and child in this country. Or $6,000 for every household of four. That is what is going to have to be taken out of their pockets to pay for the waste, the mismanagement and the dysfunction of this government. That is why we go on about the debt; that is why it is important to deliver surpluses; that is why this reckless spending must come to an end. I could go on for hours and hours and hours about many objectionable things in this budget. In the remaining time, I would like to raise just a few. Firstly, the cuts to the selfeducation expenditures. The government has capped that amount at $2,000. How can we do this? How can we stand here and claim we want to be the clever country and talk about investing in skills, and yet we cut that rebate, the tax-free threshold, the tax break, down to $2,000? There are many industries where $2,000 worth of educational expenses can be spent in a day, especially in our professions. This policy is the exact opposite of what we should be doing. Secondly, we come to Labor's carbon tax: a farce and a deception from day 1. The world does not owe us a living. The only way we can maintain our standard of living and to grow our prosperity is to make sure our nation maintains and protects its competitive advantage. The carbon tax trashes our competitive advantage. Of course we know the carbon tax is ready to go up. It will go up at the end of June and it is also set to go up the following year. And then it goes back to the European ETS. When we look at the pricing assumptions, we see in 2015-16 that somehow the government forecasts that will be $12.10 and yet the current European forward price is less than $6. This is just incredible. The Treasury is basically saying-they have picked a commodity that the Treasury believe they have greater forecasting than all of the other modellers in the world, all of the other forecasters in the world, and they are telling us that the forecasting and the forward prices are actually half. If that is the case, if Treasury is so confident, we should go out and spend billions of dollars buying up these European carbon credits at $6 because our Treasury tells us it is going to go to $12. And guess what: it gets better. They say that in 2019-20, this will be more than $35. These forecasts are a farce. They make a complete farce of Treasury forecasts and they question the autonomy of our Treasury and the accuracy of their forecasts. But it is not only that way with carbon tax, it is also the same with the mining tax. All of a sudden the mining tax-that tax has hardly raised any revenue and yet we are expecting these massive increases in the mining tax-going up and up and up-contrary to every other forecast. Then we have the asylum seekers, a $400 million industry created by the Labor government. No doubt there are people smugglers throughout the world who will be cheering for a Labor victory on 14 September. We know we have had 40,000 arrivals on more than 680 boats since this Labor government reversed the Howard government policies. To put that in context: over four years we had three fleets that settled this country-the First Fleet, the Second Fleet and the Third Fleet. Those three fleets consisted of 26 ships and 4,000 people. We have had more than 10 times that arrive under this Labor government. As I said, I could go on and on and on, but one thing that does concern me is what this government has promised on the NDIS. There is no-one in this chamber who wants to see a National Disability Insurance Scheme delivered more than I do. But, when we have a look at the numbers, the spending does not actually roll in until 2016-17. In fact, for the next three years, there is even less spending than the Productivity Commission recommended. This budget is a farce. It is built on dodgy figures. The Australian people deserve better. On 14 September, there is a tsunami coming. We are going to see Labor members of this parliament wiped out from coast to coast. (Time expired) Forestry) (17:35): I really do try to be positive, but that was an absolute nonsense comment. First and foremost, I do not doubt the member's sincerity in wanting an NDIS, but without Labor you would not have one, full stop. As for Tony Abbott, he has agreed to our NDIS program and our project. I have to say in terms of the budget-on which I heard a lot of waffle emanating from the other side-that our budget was so bad that they are going to accept it! So hello, hallelujah! Talk about a load of waffle-and do not be too sure about your tsunami, cobber. You know, the old weather forecasts are not that good at times. In your arrogance, that is fine, but be it on your head when the results come in. Anyway, I am very pleased to support this budget through the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2013-2014 and related bills. It is a historic budget because it is in the Labor tradition of having a fair go-",297,Bills

'you' is inappropriate. Members should direct their remarks through the chair. correct. We are locking in a long-term funding model for the historic needs based investments in DisabilityCare Australia-locked in, over time, based on need-and the National Disability Insurance Scheme, along with the reformative National Plan for School Improvement, based on the Gonski review. The principles behind it? Fairness, equity and based on need. These are two needs based reform programs of historic proportions introduced by Labor and here to make it better for our disabled citizens, their families and those who care for them and also for our students in every one of our schools. I strongly believe in DisabilityCare Australia and the National Plan for School Improvement. This will go down in history as part and parcel of the great Labor reforms like the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, the envy of the world; the Medicare system that we have, the envy of the world; and floating the Australian dollar-well, that is not the envy of the world, but it was very important for the economic development of Australia. These are proud achievements. These are Labor government achievements. No amount of waffle emanating from the other side is ever going to be able to deny that. We have provided in our budget $14.3 billion over seven years to 2018-19 to roll out DisabilityCare Australia nationally, on top of-that is on top of-existing Commonwealth disability funding. DisabilityCare Australia requires a strong and stable funding stream to provide Australians with a disability, their families and their carers with the funding certainty they deserve, so they can have confidence that this vital reform will be locked in place. Come on board, states and territories of Australia. Do not worry about this government; worry about those governments, particularly coalition governments, Liberal governments in particular, and this so-called coalition opposition. DisabilityCare would be especially important for families with children with disability, the scheme having a very strong focus on early intervention support. We know how early intervention services like physio, speech therapy and support for learning difficulties are critical in giving children the best possible start in life. DisabilityCare will mean that children with a disability get the right support early in their lives so they can reach their full potential as adults. When the scheme is rolled out nationally in 2019-20, around 460,000 Australians with significant and permanent disability will get the support they deserve. In Tasmania, this means that around 11,000 people with disability will be supported by 2019-20. This enduring reform will greatly benefit the country and my region in particular where more than 2,100 people with a disability will be supported on an individual needs basis. This is great for the country, it is great for my state and it is great for my region but, most importantly, this will make a huge difference to individuals and families. Two local constituents of mine relayed to me their perspectives of DisabilityCare as mothers of profoundly disabled adults. I would like to share those perspectives. They see a",300,Bills

307,Mr Sidebottom,"That is novel. That is very good. Thank you. You are absolutelybetter future for the parents and carers of children with a disability. It is fantastic to hear 'a better future'. Before DisabilityCare, people would have to endure waiting lists to get equipment, indeed, sometimes for three or four or more years. There will be no more patching and making do to make something like a wheelchair last until your name finally comes up on the list for replacement. Parents and carers will not be reduced to essentially begging service clubs to assist in funding equipment and services. Indeed, how often have we seen families and friends fundraising for the disabled, trying to get funds from here and there to put towards an important piece of new or up-to-date equipment or to maintain worn out equipment? DisabilityCare will take the stress out of crisis situations. Carers, parents and disabled persons will be supported in a crisis. Parents will be given piece of mind for the future. It is common for parents and carers to have a dread that in their death or their inability to continue to care, the disabled person will not be taken care of in a suitable manner. I can only begin to imagine what it would be like as a parent or close relative caring for a disabled family member to worry about what would happen to them once the parent became too old to properly care for them or became sick or even died. Having certitude of care and funding will be an enormous relief. There will also be freedom of choice and not just that but more choices. No longer will the disabled have to accept mediocrity often because that is all there is available. Disability will also be more 'in the face' of the public. There will be more awareness, more acceptance and less social stigma. The disabled will be able to be matched to their abilities, not their disabilities, in the workplace and in social settings. I thank these two mums for their thoughts and also for the great service they do for their respective children and the community. They, like so many other parents, families, friends and supporters of the disabled have campaigned long and hard for reform. I know how hard it has been to be heard and how abandoned at times they have felt. As government members and as a parliament, all of us in this chamber have legislated and now budgeted to make their lives and their children's lives better. It is a reform that every Australian should be proud of. When it comes to the important area of school funding, the Gonski review highlighted what everyone already knew-that our school funding model needs to change. The emphasis should be and must be on needs. Too many schools and students are being left behind. Our school results have not been improving as much as they could, certainly in comparative terms. That is what the National Plan for School Improvement will change. This historic reform to school funding will create better Australian schools for generations to come, ensuring our classrooms, our teachers and our students are properly resourced. We can reach our goal of being in the top five education systems in the world by 2025. We need to keep pace with the rest of the world because investing in creating a smarter country will lead to economic opportunity and prosperity. It is not enough to be a clever country. We need to be smarter as well. Investment will increase year by year throughout the six-year period of the agreement. This is the most comprehensive reform of school funding for 40 years. The plan will establish a national schooling resource standard, which includes a benchmark for student amount and extra money through loadings for students we know need it most. Loadings will be available to students from low socioeconomic backgrounds, Indigenous students, students with limited English and students with disability and will reflect school location and size. By making every school a better school, we will help young Australians get the best possible education to seek to secure a high-wage, high-skilled job for the future. Unfortunately, in my electorate of Braddon, we have some of the highest levels of disadvantage in terms of educational indices. These programs are going to advantage my region and hopefully bring us in line with the rest of the country. This goes for all my schools in my region. The NSP will also be complemented with funding to improve and enhance teacher quality and training, expand local school decision making, and further develop high quality programs to improve literacy and numeracy as well as resource our classrooms so that all students can learn in the best of teaching and learning spaces, using the most contemporary of IT communications and research platforms. One of these, of course, is the National Broadband Network with all its unlimited potentialities and capacities. Unfortunately, those opposite not only oppose the NSP and the needs based funding and resourcing model it is premised on but they also oppose the future by opposing the NBN. The National Plan for School Improvement and DisabilityCare are not just social and educational reforms, as important as they are, but they are also significant fundamental economic reforms. Needs based funding in the Labor tradition leads to a country where noone is left behind due to where they live or their physical limitations. This leads to a country where everyone can reach their potential and be contributors to the nation's society both economically and socially. This is a better Australia, an Australia with and supportive of opportunity. The budget strengthens the foundation of Australian agriculture, contrary to the views of some of those opposite. It prepares our farmers for future challenges and lays the groundwork for the opportunities of the Asian century which was absolutely reinforced on Saturday in Brisbane by the Minister for Agriculture Joe Ludwig and our significant resourcing of something like $40 million into the National Food Plan with a whole host of national initiatives associated with it, particularly the $28.5 million investing in an Asian food market research fund and to support the whole Asian century push and thrust both of the economy and in particular in relation to the food and fibre industry of this nation. It has been well received by the National Farmers Federation and other significant agricultural and agribusiness associations and organisations. I congratulate the minister on this plan, along with the very important reforms that were announced most recently and budgeted for in the budget, particularly in terms of the National Drought Program Reform and the household allowance system that we have developed in its place and also importantly the investment in national farm assistance packages to assist those farmers and those viable organisations in our rural and regional Australia to cope with the difficulties that they are being challenged with at the moment-a whole complement of factors and influences-to allow them to try and get them through these challenges and at the same time to provide a pre-emptive tool for rural and regional Australia, particularly in relation to drought and its effects. I wish to reiterate the good work of Minister Ludwig, particularly on those programs and the National Food Plan recently announced. The budget in terms of my electorate was very supportive with something like $119.6 million towards the Tasmanian freight revitalisation program. This will improve safety, reliability and competitiveness of Tasmania's rail network including upgrades to the West Coast Melba line and particularly in anticipation of the responsible economic development of mines in our region. I was very pleased to be at a mass pro-mining rally on the weekend at Tullah on the West Coast where the community sentiment was very clear that they want and support responsible economic development along with the proper protection of the environment where it is appropriate and necessary and that they want people, particularly from the hard Green side of politics, to accept balance. Unfortunately we do not have much to look forward to on that side of things at the moment, because they are prepared to used every legal means to oppose any successful application agreed to by the Tasmanian government and the federal government. I thank Minister Burke for the fact that he did not list the entire Tarkine region on the national estate, but certainly significant Aboriginal sites and culture were recognised and for his acceptance of the application for Shree Minerals. I look forward to further applications from venture minerals on the west coast being successful. At the same time we can be assured that we will protect our very important environment. (Time expired) the Hasluck community do not claim to be wealthy nor do they cry poor. People in the community are quiet achievers, getting on with the business of life without too much complaint and fuss. The community is not particularly vocal about government policy and usually just adjusts to the changes that affect their lives without too much drama. But as I have been out door-knocking in my community and meeting people at local events, I am hearing more and more stories about individuals and families who are struggling under this government. I am hearing stories about families who are struggling to pay the ever increasing costs of private health insurance, struggling to pay for their weekly grocery bill which seems to be forever rising and struggling to pay for the electricity bills which have gone up directly due to the carbon tax. Essentially they are struggling because the decisions of this government are making it difficult for them to get on with their lives. They are facing additional pressure because this government is putting in place more plans which are costing their families. This budget has provided more of the same that this government has been serving up since its election in 2007. This budget has yet again shown this government's true colours-taking a direct hit to the people of my electorate and around Australia, making it more difficult for families to make ends meet. Not only does this budget do nothing to help families deal with the rising cost-of-living pressures, it adds further uncertainty to their future outlook, making it even more difficult to plan ahead. What we knew before and was evidenced again in this year's budget was that this Labor government's financial and budget management is in complete chaos. This year's budget offering delivers more debt, more deficits, more taxes, more broken promises and more uncertainty. If we did not think that this could get much worse after the previous six years of chaos, debt and spin, it could. What this government seems to have failed to realise is that Australians are desperately seeking stable and competent economic management. They are seeking an end to the perpetual chaos they are experiencing at the hands of this government and they are instead looking for a government they trust to manage the economy. Above all, they are seeking for hope, reward and opportunity. For the last five years this Labor government has been unable to deliver a budget surplus. It has been unable to deliver any kind of credible economic plan. This government wants us to believe that they will deliver a plan for the next decade. Deputy Speaker, forgive me if I seem somewhat cynical about this prospect. With the announcement of the fifth record budget",301,Bills
308,Mr Wyatt (Hasluck) (17:50,"I rise to speak on Appropriation Bill No. 1. The people ofdeficit in five years and an increasing record level of net debt-now at $192 billion-it is laughable to suggest that this government is able to provide sound economic judgement about the decade ahead. The positive news for the people of the community of Hasluck and all around Australia is that the coalition does have a strong, positive plan for the future and one that we will deliver economic stability and one that will provide hope, reward and opportunity. The coalition has a plan that will offer immediate relief to the many families in my electorate who have gradually been experiencing the squeeze of the rising cost of living that is a direct result of the actions of this government. To my colleague on the other side, to begin with our mindset is completely different to this Labor government. We do not believe that governments have money of their own. We believe that government money is the people's money. Today's spending is tomorrow's borrowing and next year's repayment. Governments have a responsibility to spend money wisely. Just as families and businesses need to live within their means, governments also have to live within their means. This is a vital lesson that it would seem this government has missed. The coalition does not take money for granted and we do not believe any government should. I am concerned that with this budget and those before it it is clear that this government has taken the budget and the economy for granted. Year after year it would seem that this government is adding to the mortgage simply to pay the grocery bill. This reckless and wasteful approach to the budget needs to stop and responsible government needsHonourable member interjectingintroduce a mining tax and a carbon tax, yet it was unable to get the figures right. So bad was this government's prediction about the budget that we saw this year's supposed revenue shortfall go from $6 billion to $12 billion, to $17 billion, and this all happened within the space of a mere few weeks-record Labor debt. The budget papers reveal that Australia's gross debt will breach Labor's $300 billion debt ceiling within the forward estimates. The budget papers foreshadow a further increase in the debt ceiling stating that: The government will legislate to increase the limit as it becomes necessary. At the last election, Prime Minister Julia Gillard promised that Australia's net debt would peak at less than 90 billion. This budget reveals that the net debt will now peak at over $191 billion, more than double what was promised by the Prime Minister. The Treasurer has delivered his fifth record deficit in five years, with at least two more years of deficits to follow. This will be Labor's 12th deficit from its last 12 budgets. The last Labor surplus was in 1989. Last year the Treasurer promised a surplus of 1.5 million, but instead he has delivered a deficit of more than 12 times as big at 19.4 billion. This Labor government is addicted to spending, contrary to what Labor is claiming. Mr Champion interjectingRevenue in 2013-14 is projected to be $80 billion higher than at the end of the Howard government, yet the Treasurer plans to deliver his sixth deficit in a row because spending in 2013-14 will be at $120 billion higher than at the end of the Howard government. In his budget speech, the Treasurer blames the high Australian dollar for having savaged revenues, yet this was one assumption in last year's budget which was actually right. With Australia's",304,Bills

Expenditure as a percentage of GDP has been higher every year under Labor compared to the last years of the Howard government. Labor's planned return to surplus is not credible and presents a potential black hole for future budgets. The claim of surpluses in the two out years relies on virtually no further deterioration in the terms of trade in the next two years. This is a heroic assumption and puts at risk the projected small surpluses in the two out years. It assumes that the terms of trade will remain far higher than in any year of the previous coalition government. The great big disappointing mining tax has become problematic. The forecast revenues for the mining tax personally and secretly negotiated by the Prime Minister in June 2010 have collapsed from $22.5 billion to $3.3 billion over its first four years. Mining tax revenue in 2012-13 is a staggering 95 per cent below the Treasurer's original MRRT revenue forecast and the spreading benefits of the boom package, which was the centrepiece of the Treasurer's last three budgets, seem to have been deleted altogether from the budget papers. Despite the comprehensive failure of the mining tax to raise any meaningful revenue so far, the Treasurer's 2016-17 surplus promises rely on mining tax revenue increasing by more than 10 times from its level this year. This government is clearly out of its depth when it comes to the budget. Australia needs to get back on track and it cannot afford another term under a Labor government. This year there is a clear choice for Australians to make. On one hand, under Labor there is more chaos, more confusion, more instability and greater spending. On the other hand, under a coalition government there will be stability, security and confidence in Australia. There will be hope, reward and opportunity. The coalition has a plan with practical, real solutions to get Australia back on track. We will take pressure off families and deal with Labor's budget emergency, building a stronger, more prosperous economy. The coalition has practical solutions to help families of my electorate and across Australia cope with the ever-increasing cost-of-living pressures they are facing. The coalition will continue with the current income tax thresholds as well as the current pension and fortnightly benefit rates. We will do this by getting rid of the carbon tax to provide an instant relief to household budgets. We will also require the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to make sure that prices do not remain artificially raised when we abolish the carbon tax, ensuring that households are the ones to benefit from the removal of the carbon tax. Since this Labor government came to power in 2007, electricity prices have risen by 94 per cent and gas has gone up by 62 per cent. This is an incredible burden, contributing to the costof-living pressures on families, made much worse by the carbon tax. Unlike this Labor government, we in the coalition want to ensure that families and individuals are able to get ahead in life. I want to see my community, a community full of hard working families and individuals, have every opportunity available to them. I want to see a stronger, more connected, more sustainable local community. That is why I am pleased to be able to support the many coalition initiatives, which stand in stark contrast to what this Labor government has shown us in this year's budget. One example of this is internet connectivity. In my community, there are many families, students and businesses who are disadvantaged by their inability to access broadband internet. There are black spots in areas that the government has not serviced through the NBN. Despite the promises of the former Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, to provide fast broadband for all Australians by this year at a cost of $4.7 billion, there are many residents who are missing out while the government's NBN languishes behind schedule and is dramatically over cost, with predictions it will cost up to $90 billion all told. The residents of the black spot areas in my community include those in the suburbs of Thornlie, Southern River, Huntingdale and Gooseberry Hill. They should not be missing out on the internet because it is simply not politically convenient for this government. Only the coalition will deliver an NBN to these black-spot areas as a matter of priority, because we understand the importance of families and local businesses being able to access broadband internet. We will deliver broadband to all households by 2016, doubling the speed by the end of 2019. This will make a practical, positive difference to the lives of members of my community. Another way that the coalition will make a real and practical difference is through investing in key infrastructure for Australia's future. For too long, there has been no plan for future growth and no plan to encourage investment in Australian infrastructure. Even now, this government has failed to address the problem. The Property Council of Australia has identified: Yet again, the government is making it harder to attract capital to Australia on the basis of Treasury's inadequate, cherry-picked analysis of global regimes. In my community, which is experiencing significant growth due to the mining sector, infrastructure investment is not only desirable; it is necessary to ensure a future of sustainability. very important matter concerning the Yaralla Estate, in the heart of my electorate of Reid, at Concord. The estate was vested in the Crown under the Walker Trusts Act 1938 in a magnificent act of philanthropy by the late Dame Eadith Walker. The New South Wales Office of Environment and Heritage acknowledges that the Yaralla Estate at Concord is the largest community bequest of its era, being of circa 37 hectares, to survive in an intact form in New South Wales. The New South Wales Ministry of Health Sydney South West Area Health Service, the administration of the property. In an attempt to move the New South Wales Mounted Police Unit from their Redfern base, the New South Wales O'Farrell government, through the Ministry of Health, had entered into a sweetheart deal to relocate the New South Wales Mounted Police here and evict the current horse owners and assessment lessee from the site. No tender process was entered into. Only now, after the howls of understandable protest from local residents, has the New South Wales Liberal government backed down, but only to quash the previous decision in favour of a tender process which the local community has no confidence in. This does not go far enough, and the O'Farrell government should cancel the notice of eviction and allow the people and the horses to stay on this beautiful environmental oasis. This site was intended to remain for the use and benefit of the people and, quite frankly, this plan goes against the philanthropic acts of Dame Eadith Walker.",305,Bills
311,Mr Murphy (Reid) (18:03,"I wish to bring to the attention of the parliament today aYesterday, I attended a very emotionally charged rally of hundreds of local residents, who are campaigning to save Yaralla and, in particular, allow the horses and their owners to have access to this beautiful land. The rally was held on the site, complete with horses and owners. I wish to read out the very heartfelt address delivered to the people attending the rally by one of my constituents, Ms Alex Gavel. Alex is a local schoolteacher who, here in Canberra, captured the mood of the local people that I represent about the future of the Yaralla Estate. These are Alex's magnificent words: On behalf of the Yaralla Horses, their owners, and the greater community let us express how thankful we are for the many faces that are here today. It is your passion and encouragement for this plight that inspires us to keep pushing forward in our cause, on your behalf. And it truly is OUR cause. We believe that this issue affects everyone. Some of you live next door, some agist horses, some walk their dogs, bike ride through the grounds or bring their children to visit the horses. Yaralla belongs to all of us. There are many who have felt the need to question our integrity or motivations, claiming that we are just a small 'self-interest group'. Today we would like to set the record straight and tell you some of our story. My name is Alexandra Gavel. I agist a horse at Yaralla, and consider myself, first and foremost, a member of this amazing community. I was born in the inner-west, I have grown up in the inner west, and I still live and work in the inner west. Anyone that has had the opportunity to keep their horse at Yaralla, both in the past and present, have always considered it a privilege. But we are by no means a 'privileged' group. We are fellow members of your community, ordinary people!. I am a school teacher at a local high school. There are teenagers that ride their bikes after school to care for their horses, Uni students, parents, a child care worker, health care workers, air craft pilots, government workers, life long residents of Concord West and even the local dog groomer. I was a 10 year old girl, absolutely obsessed with horses. Every Christmas, every birthday, in fact every day, I pleaded with my parents to buy me a horse. Yet the closest I would ever get was an occasional excursion to a trail riding establishment. Horses were all I ever thought about. As an adult, I actually feel bad for the guilt trips that I put on my parents who were raising three kids, struggling with the expenses of daily living and completely unable to afford the upkeep and care of a horse. In 1996 a compromise was made and I will never forget the day that I discovered Yaralla Estate. My Dad had heard through a friend about the paddocks at Concord and so he told me we could have a look. Most people here today know the feeling that the 10 year old me was struck by when we drove through the top gates. The disbelief that a place so beautiful existed so close to home, the joy in seeing horses grazing and people riding, and the immediate respect for a very special person who left her property to the people to continue to enjoy as she had.... Thank You Dame Edith Walker for your gift thus far. We barely made it through the gates when, under direct instruction, we pulled over. The very first horse that I met was Seamus, who still resides at Yaralla, though long retired now. I am sure I petted every horse there that day; Annie, Amber, Buddy, another Buddy, Romeo and Mikail just to name a few. But the most special pony that I met that day was Willie, otherwise known as 'Yaralla's Captain Willie'. Willie had been one of the first horses on the property and had begun his time at Concord sharing a paddock with cattle. Willie had taught numerous children how to ride and care for horses including me. My dreams were starting to come true. The opportunity presented itself to lease Willie on weekends. I am sure my parents only consented to this as it was the perfect way for me to learn just how time consuming and difficult it is to care for a horse... Unfortunately for them, this arrangement made me even more committed to my life goal of owning a horse. Willie passed away 2 years ago in his paddock at Yaralla at the impressive age of 37.... it was a sad day for the Yaralla horse community. When I finished school the first thing I did was get a job, then a horse. At 17 years old I got my first horse Wiskey, who is here today. Not only has Wiskey taught me so many lessons in the 11 years that we have been together, he has had the privilege of teaching many local kids and adults how to ride. I cannot explain to you how perceptive Wiskey is. WheneverI am dealing with a lot and feeling completely lost and overwhelmed, it still amazes me how he is able to clear my mindoften best done with a game of hide and seek. These horses are our best friends, our children in some respects. This community has always respected and valued their place in the Inner West. Many residents know the horses by their names, some have even made up their own names for them. But it seems that SLHD think that a 'horse is a horse' and that they can be replaced... according to our critics we need to 'accept change and move on'. Many of you will agree that Yaralla isn't just about the horses, and that is true for the horse owners as well. Many of us have other ties to the estate that make it so precious. One of the horse owners, a life long resident of concord has shared this unique place with her family. She spent much of her youth around the estate, has raised her 3 kids there, supported her mother through her dialysis treatment at the main house and shared her father's last moments when he suddenly passed away on the estate. Yaralla has always held a special place in my heart too as a place that I have shared over the years with my dad, and as of December my connection to the estate has become even stronger as my fiancé proposed to me at the stairs to the main house. I have no doubt that every person here today has some special memory of Yaralla that they hold dear. We have finally been given the 'report' that was the basis of our eviction. As a school teacher, let me just state that to call it a 'professional report' is a stretch of the imagination. SLHD have expressed to us that it was written by supposed 'experts' in the field. However, the truth is that it was produced by a project management consultancy with political links to the State Govrenment and SLHD and nowhere in the report are any references made to expert opinions, best practice guidelines or research evidence. The report also discusses the Mounted Police Unit as a preferred tenant, proving that the very purpose of the report was to install the Mounted Police at Yaralla. The decision was already made to evict the current horse owners and the report was commissioned and carried out by SLHD to serve that very purpose. BlueVisions was provided with their briefing … Out with the community and their horses! Let us make it clear, the purpose of our campaign is not, and never will be, a vendetta against the Mounted Police, nor are we insensitive to the important role this unit fulfills. We respect and commend the Mounted Police for their service to the wider community. However, we fail to see how this nullifies the wishes of Dame Edith Walker to leave the grounds to the people of NSW for the purpose of housing local horses, for Health services and for public space. This is exactly how the grounds have been used for more than 3 decades. In addition, the Mounted Police, whilst proposing to house horses on the grounds, are a government department none the less. A number of attempts have already been made in years gone by to develop the site. Should another attempt be made, we fear that a fellow government department is far less likely to put up as much of a fight to preserve the site as we have and that this invaluable community resource would be lost forever. The fact is that Sydney Local Health Districtthat is, SLHDis a trustee of the land, without ownership of it. Their reasons for eviction are unfounded, biased and in some cases unsubstantiated and completely unfair. Whether lawful or not, their actions are not in the interests of the community and at very least contravene the philanthropist intentions of the Walker Estate when the property was bequeath to the people of NSW. Do we have a vested interest in the property continuing to function as it has? Yes we do. Indeed, it is our argument that the entire community shares this interest …Yaralla should stay as it is and be used as it is for many generations to come. So where do we stand now? SLHD have cancelled their dodgy deal with the Mounted Police Unit and will be putting the Yaralla paddocks out to 'open tender', with the Mounted Police still being identified in a recent Risk assessent report commissioned by the SLHD as the unanimous preferred candidates. Not quite a step forward, merely an attempt to undo their most obvious wrong doing that this community held them accountable for. However, there is still no certainty that the communities concerns will be considered. How can we be sure that the criteria set by SLHD does not favour a certain applicant such as the MPU? How can we know that the Mounted Police Unit won't just happen to be the 'most ideal' and preferred applicant identified by an O'Farrel government/ SLHD panel. Regardless of the change in process, the agenda remains unchanged. The Mounted Police were the favoured tenant all along and no one in the community should trust that this will be a fair and open process. Speaking of fair, open and honest …Everyone would have passed the barrier fencing along the Yaralla Driveway today … I ask … how many of you have walked across that land in the last 5 years?? How many of you witnessed in shock as I did the men in masks and suits digging up the dirt?? It has been noted by SLHD that ""hazardous"" and contaminated waste was identified and subsequently removed from this site within the last 3 days. Workcover has visited the site and informed some residents of the Estate concerned with the acitivities, that it was indeed asbestos that the SLHD had commissioned to move, and it states as such on the workcover applications submitted by contractors. Why were was there no community announcement, why were the people who access Yaralla not told of the immenent danger or risk and at least provided with a request to avoid the area during the decontamination phase? … Shame on you SLHD … You continue to cling to your excuses, and your blazae fair regard for the degraded state of the Yaralla paddocks … You state it is due to your expert focus on the provision of Health Care services that you have overlooked our beloved Yaralla… You state you are not experts in management of horse paddocks … Well, I am pretty sure that failure to notify the community and neighbours of Yaralla of asbestos removal on this crown land accessible to the public is a direct and intolerable breach of your duty of care as elite public health care providers!!! Despite all the opposition that we face, we still believe a solution does exist that will benefit the entire community. SLHD have continually reminded us throughout our campaign that they 'don't do horses', their priority is local health. Well guess what-NSW mounted police have a priority too-policing. There is absolutely no guarantee that they have the resources to ensure the upkeep of Yaralla. In fact, if the state of their other spelling facilities around the state is evidence of anything, it is that they are NOT ideal tenants for Yaralla. Solution-our very own Canada Bay Council IS in the business of managing community spaces. The most obvious way to ensure that the Yaralla paddocks remain a public space is for the Canada Bay Council to manage an interim licence and to apply for the public tender. They can oversee its maintenance and use where the SLHD fell well short of their responsibilities. Of course, this is easier said than done. The Mayor Angelo Tsirekas has strongly committed to exploring this option, but we, as the community, need to communicate how important this is to us that council support this community campaign for Yaralla. There is still a bigger issue at hand. As a community we cannot just overlook the gross negligence that SLHD have demonstrated over the past 17 years. As trustees of the Estate there is simply no excuse for the poor dilapidated condition that they allowed the main estate building fall into, regardless of their very recent attempts to prepare it for its new purpose. There is absolutely no excuse for the lack of care, lack of inspections and lack of support for the condition of the paddocks. Someone needs to be held accountable for this Dr. Anderson CE of the SLHD and Chairman of the Board Ron Phillips. There is absolutely no excuse for putting the health of the community at risk by dumping hazardous waste on the property. As mentioned previously it has come to our attention late this week that 'hazardous waste' that was dumped as landfill on the estate approximately 4 years ago, known to volunteer members of the Local Heritage society, contains Asbestos. Community members it is time for us all to be outraged with the SLHD. What they have done is completely illegal, completely dishonest and absolutely disgusting! We must hold the trustees accountable for their gross negligence by pushing that the Yaralla Estate be taken away from SLHD and be put in the hands of a body, such as council, that are better equipped with the resources to maintain a higher standard of upkeep and care. We need everyone here today to be writing letters to Barry O'Farrell to identify your disillusionment and distrust of the current state government and to the Mayor identifying your support, make phone calls, make your voice be heard. We will continue to fight for this beloved resource, but we need your help. To truly exercise people power we need you, the people. There is still more work to do and we are still a long way from the result we are all working towards. We thank you for your attendance today and for your continued support … We must make a call for action … We must enforce a change … the horses have 6 days until eviction … This is the thin edge of the wedge … Make your voice be heard!

313,Mr Bandt (Melbourne) (18:31,"In the lead-up to the budget there were a lot of peoplepeople who were looking forward to an investment in our higher education sector and perhaps some relief for the tens of hundreds of thousands of students around the country who were suffering under significant debt burdens and who do not have an income that is enough to make ends meet. Instead, on 13 April, the newly appointed Minister for Tertiary Education, Dr Craig Emerson, announced $2.3 billion in cuts to universities and their students. The cuts mean a $900 million efficiency dividend of two per cent in 2014 and 1.25 per cent in 2015, which will mean less funding per student-an amount of about five per cent less public funding per student, according to the National Tertiary Education Union. There will be a $1.2 billion saving from scrapping Student Start-Up scholarships and replacing them with loans, putting even more debt onto students, and further savings from removing the HECs discount for upfront payments. These cuts come to a sector that was already under significant pressure. They come on the back of last year's cuts to the university sector that totalled around $1 billion, including the abolition of university facilitation funding of $270 million, reductions to the Sustainable Research Excellence, the SRE program, of just on half-a-billion dollars as well as savings in relation to student income support and scholarships of $250 million. The University of Melbourne, in my electorate, faces cuts of $52 million, with Victorian universities generally facing cuts of almost $200 million over two years. These cuts contradict the advice that has been given to the government. As the NTEU points out, in 2008 the then education minister, Julia Gillard, asked Professor Denise Bradley to undertake a comprehensive review of Australian higher education. It was for universities what the Gonski review was for schools. One of the key recommendations of the Bradley review was the need for an immediate 10 per cent increase in funding per government supported student to ensure universities had the necessary resources to provide high quality and internationally competitive education. These findings were reaffirmed by the Base Funding Review, chaired by Dr Jane Lomax-Smith, and released in October 2011, which found that universities were significantly under-resourced to provide the teaching and basic research capability expected of them. Bill Scales, who is not only Chancellor of Swinburne University of Technology but also served on both the Bradley review of higher education and the Gonski review of school education, has described Labor's funding cuts as 'not only incoherent but schizophrenic'. In 2010, Prime Minister Julia Gillard said: We know that Australia's universities have a critical part to play in making this country smarter, fairer and more prosperous. In order to meet our economic and social ambitions we need to make sure that our universities are properly resourced and able to tackle the problems, and teach the workforce, of the future. But now the Prime Minister is presiding over cuts which will harm our universities. Labor's cuts to universities, research and student support will harm students, our education system and the economy. We are going to need an economy when the rest of the world tells us to stop digging. That point may come sooner rather than later and that economy is going to be based on our minds, not our mines. We cannot have a smarter country if we cut funds to universities, we cannot have a fairer society if we do not support students from low-income families to go to university and we cannot have a strong economy if we cut back universities and research. Taking money from universities to fund schools is robbing Peter to pay Pauland it just does not add up. Instead of a cash grab to fund an election commitment on schools, Labor should have the guts to stand up to the big miners and put in place a proper mining tax and then we could fund the education we need from child care, to kindergarten, to schools through to universities. What this shows is that the old parties cannot be trusted to look after education. If we were serious about preparing Australia for the challenges of the 21st century, if we were serious about having a government that cares for its people and its students, we would be investing in higher education. We would not be threatening 1,500 jobs in my electorate of Melbourne, which will go because of the cumulative effects of these cuts. We would be putting more money into universities. member's motion condemning the government's cuts to the university sector. I do so not only because of the importance of the education sector as a whole to my electorate of McPherson on the Gold Coast but also because of the significance of education as an export industry and to the future of our nation. The university sector produces so much economic and social good for Australia, and ripping funding away from such a significant sector has the potential to kill the goose that laid the golden egg. I say this in a very sincere way because education is a growth industry for the future and provides us with an enormous and much needed opportunity to grow our exports and to expand our trading base. This is essential for us as a nation and critical for the Gold Coast, where our major industries of tourism and construction have suffered year after year from economic downturn. I will come back to speak more about specific Gold Coast and education issues shortly. This Labor government has been unable to demonstrate its support for such a crucial sector and has embarked on one cut after another. The 2012-13 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook included the following cuts: a freeze to the Sustainable Research Excellence program-$498.8 million; the ending of the facilitation performance funding from 2014$270.1 million; the deferral of student support for masters by research degrees-$167 million; and a freeze on student start-up scholarships-$82.3 million. Those cuts alone will have a significant negative impact on the sector, but those cuts have been followed with more cuts. The 2013-14 budget handed down only a fortnight ago confirmed previously announced cuts to higher education of the efficiency dividend on universities of two per cent for 2014 and 1.25 per cent for 2015-$902.7 million; the conversion of student start-up scholarships to HELP loans-$1.186 billion; the removal of the 10 per cent discount for the upfront payment of university fees and the five per cent bonus for the voluntary repayment of HECS-HELP debts-$267.7 million; and an annual cap to tax deductions for self-education to $2,000 per person-$514.3 million. It is just beyond belief that, at a time of economic pressure, this government cuts one of the sectors that is well placed to provide economic growth. And we should not forget that university places were uncapped in 2012 to increase participation rates, but with the government's cuts it will be more expensive and more difficult for students to study. It is such a contradiction that funding cuts are being imposed at a time when universities are being encouraged to take on more students. This is also happening at a time when universities are",311,Private Members Business
314,Mrs Andrews (Mcpherson) (18:36,"I welcome the opportunity to speak on this privateunder pressure to provide an approximate four per cent annual wage increase to staff. Australia ranks 25th out of 29 advanced economies that invest in universities. These cuts will only serve to lower our ranking and reputation overseas even more. On the Gold Coast, only about 18 per cent of the population aged 25 to 34 are degree qualified. We are working hard on the Gold Coast to ensure more students take on university education. Each of our universities-Southern Cross, Bond and Griffith-are working with our local schools to promote tertiary education and opportunities on the Gold Coast. The funding cuts of this government are making it so much more difficult for universities and students. The Gold Coast, in particular, is likely to be hit hard by these cuts, as higher education is a significant contributor to the local economy and employs thousands of people. It injects more than $1 billion into our economy and employs more than 7,000 people. Higher education is one of our city's major industries, with the three universities and over 400 education and training providers located there-and with more expressing interest in investigating, relocating or expanding their operations to the Gold Coast. Southern Cross University has invested $100 million in its Bilinga campus and Bond University has recently announced a collaboration with the engineering faculty of the US Ivy League university Dartmouth to introduce a master of energy management qualification, which will be the first of its kind in Australia in the field of energy sustainability. These measures will not only help create jobs in the area but will add to our growing international higher education reputation. This government must stop damaging such a crucial sector. member for Melbourne. This government is investing in education. Labor believes that every Australian, no matter where they live or what their background, should be able to go to university if they have the ability. University funding has grown by 50 per cent since Labor came to office and will continue to grow over the next three years. Let us be clear: the decision we made was not to cut funding but to introduce an efficiency dividend of two per cent in 2014 and of 1.2 per cent in 2015. Real funding per student will continue to rise even with the efficiency dividend. In 2007, real funding per student was $16,147. In 2012, it was $17,659. After the efficiency dividend is taken into account, real funding per student is projected to exceed $18,000 in 2017. The government is retaining the Higher Education Grants Index on an ongoing basis, so there will be no return to the Howard government's practice of growing funding for universities at a far lower rate than costs were increasing. The government would have preferred not to have had to make these savings. However, we have an obligation to ensure the sustainability of the budget and to fund our schools properly, as well as the national disability insurance scheme. The government remains committed to a strong university system in Australia as well as to a world-class school system. The Labor government has significantly increased investment in education since coming to office. The savings in this budget will allow the government to better target its spending on education, including funding for the National Plan for School Improvement. The government will provide $29.7 billion in total education funding from 2013-14, compared with $18.4 billion in 2007-08-a real increase of 35 per cent. In total, over five years from 2007-08 to 2012-13, the government has provided $165.5 billion for education spending. This included $6.5 billion for the Education Investment Fund, $16 billion for the Building the Education Revolution and $2 billion for the Digital Education Revolution.

315,Mr Lyons (Bass) (18:41,"I rise to speak on the motion proposed by Mr Bandt, theBER created employment opportunities, kept the economy strong and was a boost to business confidence, yet those opposite continue to espouse the view that it was not needed. Despite the savings in this budget, the government is still providing record investment in education, significantly increasing funding in real terms since coming to office. The government is making historic investments in Australian schools, with up to $9.8 billion in extra Commonwealth funding over the next six years from 2014-15 available if the states agree to provide 35 per cent of the required investment and to sign up to the National Plan for School Improvement. To do this, we have $2.37 billion in savings from spending on higher education. The savings measures in this budget do not impact on the key reform of uncapping funding for undergraduate places, which means that more people continue to have the opportunity to participate in higher education. We know that education provides opportunities and, unlike those opposite, we believe that people from all backgrounds with the ability to study at university should get the opportunity, not just those who can afford it. Furthermore the government is expanding investment in student places by providing an additional $97 million from 2014 to 2017 for additional Commonwealth supported places for bachelor and postgraduate courses. To be clear, what you get under Labor is increased funding for universities and increased funding for better schools. This government has a really strong record on higher education, skills and education more generally. Australians have a choice between Labor protecting jobs, investing in skills and making smart investments we need for the future, or the coalition whose savage slashes will cut to the bone. The coalition passionately argue for cuts. It is in their DNA to always cut too hard and always cut in the wrong places like education. When will they commit to writing that, if they are elected in September, they will resign if they do not increase funding to universities and do not stop the boats. The savage cuts that Premier Campbell Newman has made in Queensland and the Liberals in Victoria are an entree to would happen if the federal Liberals win government at the next election. Before the election they want us to believe that you can have lower taxes, less savings and smaller deficits all at once. After the election we all know that they will slash and burn like their mates in Queensland and Victoria. That is a mindless recipe for higher unemployment and lower growth. The Gillard government will always act responsibly to prioritise jobs so that the economy works for more people. Melbourne which condemns the Labor government's $2.3 billion in funding cuts to Australian universities and student support services. On 14 May this year the Treasurer confirmed that this Labor government continues to lay ruin to the nation's finances. As a result of their incompetence, despite government revenue increasing more than six per cent, the Labor government has delivered yet another deficit of $19 billion this year. Over the forward estimates gross debt will breach the $300 billion debt ceiling. Labor's incompetence means more debt, more deficits and more uncertainty and, worse, more bad news for the research and university sector in Australia. The 2013-14 budget confirmed previously announced cuts to higher education including $900 million in cuts in the form of efficiency dividends and more than $1 billion in cuts by converting student start-up scholarships to HELP lines. The Labor government also removed the 10 per cent discount for the upfront payment of university fees and the five per cent bonus for the voluntary repayment of HECS-HELP debts, and it announced an annual cap to tax",314,Private Members Business

These cuts are in addition to the cuts announced to the 2012-13 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook when they froze almost $500 million for the Sustainable Research Excellence program among other cuts and deferrals. Ultimately world-class research at Australian universities has practical outcomes for Australians. Research is one of the key drivers of future economic activity in this country. It leads to innovations and a more productive economy as well as significant advancements in health solutions for all Australians. I have previously spoken in the House on the groundbreaking research being undertaken at the University of Queensland in my electorate. It is a university which demonstrates amazing depth and diversity across many faculties from architecture to engineering, quantum physics to biomedical, and molecular research. I have highlighted the outstanding work by Professor Maree Smith, who is internationally renowned for her excellence in pain research and who pioneered Australia's first integrated preclinical drug development facility, TetraQ. Professor Smith has now successfully seen two of her drugs commercialised by UniQuest, which will address significant unmet clinical need in markets that will grow to be worth approximately $35 billion by 2017. This will be one of the most significant advancements by any Australian researcher in the field of drug development and, following the success of the Gardasil vaccine, has positioned UQ as an international leader in commercialisation and transfer of research outcomes. Furthermore, UniQuest has also facilitated the commercialisation of several other University of Queensland biomedical inventions, such as the Nanopatch and Dendright technologies, with subsequent multimillion dollar investments from international venture funds and companies. These are just some examples of significant developments occurring at the University of Queensland, and some of this work has been made possible only because UQ has been able to attract the best international researchers to Australia while at the same time ensuring that our own home-grown talent stays here. In order for universities such as UQ to attract this talent and to keep these people in the country, the sector requires stability and certainty from the government of the day. The Australian Research Committee has identified long-term funding as a key to retaining specialist expertise in Australia. I hear similar feedback from the University of Queensland. Furthermore, because research projects require funding commitments over many years, if not decades in some instances, universities simply cannot plan for the long term when they are faced with the short-term political whims of this Labor government. Yet that is exactly the situation in which they now find themselves-with a Labor government that has failed to provide the long-term research funding that our researchers desperately need. In April this year Nobel laureate Peter Doherty, who went to Indooroopilly State High School in Ryan, labelled the Labor government's changes as 'politically inept' because 'universities are the last thing you should raid if you want to send a consistent message on education.' These comments reflect the real ongoing concerns about this Labor government's approach to universities. The coalition remains committed to the university and research sector by delivering its Real Solutions plan to build a stronger, more productive economy through lower taxes, more efficient government and more productive businesses. The coalition will restore the bonds of trust that once existed between government and Australian universities. We will restore hope, reward and opportunity for all Australians. Ms O'NEILL (Robertson) (18:51): I find myself in a rather peculiar situation as I consider the comments of the member for McPherson and the member for Ryan. My understanding of the budget reply speech, and the press I have seen since then, indicates that those on the other side reserve the right to adopt all of these changes that are mooted and yet they decry them. It is a very different position perhaps for the member for Melbourne, who has proposed this debate on university funding-I am sure he is very sincere, but let us get a few of the facts on the table. I will draw to a degree on my own personal experience at one of the local universities at which I taught before I entered parliament. I did work during the Howard era, which according to those opposite was an era of great enlightenment and incredible spending in the sector. CanI say how incorrect that is. The manifestation of the Howard years of investment in the Ourimbah Central Coast campus of the University of Newcastle is represented in the shape of one large demountable building that cooks in the summer and is freezing in the winter. That was the investment in capital that went into my local university. In contrast, since a Labor government has been in power over $12 million has been invested in new infrastructure in that university. There is a new library with 24-hour access to deal with the needs of people trying to return to study while working, and balance that with their family responsibilities. They need to access the university safely at any time. There is a new teaching and nursing building, there is a new psychology building, there is a new sports science building-there is a new feel of passion for what higher education genuinely offers that has been inspired and has had life breathed into it by the dollars invested by this Labor government in tertiary education. So let us not for a second believe the mythology that has been perpetrated by those opposite. The facts are that this government has absolutely committed to a strong university system. We have announced, in the budget just a couple of weeks ago, a two per cent efficiency dividend in 2014 and a 1.25 per cent efficiency dividend in 2015 on university funding. Would it not be wonderful if in this world there was always every resource that you needed, but the reality is that we have made a call-and I deeply understand this from my years as a teacher-that to ask for this from a sector that has received a 75 per cent increase in funding since 2007, from $3.5 billion to over $6.1 billion under this government, is to ask for a small thing, from a sector that has seen its assets and opportunities grow, in order that money might go to schools which we can no longer deny are sites of terrible inequity in this country. Ten years ago, children in this country started school in kindergarten. Now those children who are from low-SES backgrounds, are Aboriginal or are in remote areas or who had language from another country in their background as they were approaching school are far too often hitting grade 9 but performing at year 6 or 7 level, behind their friends, behind kids who have had advantages that they were just unfortunate enough not to be born into. The reality is that we need to address that need right at the very early part of school education. The fact is that there are children in classrooms where teachers can absolutely diagnose, where parents can diagnose, where kids can diagnose, that they need assistance but who are currently unable to get it. In the last seven years, we have looked over a new golden age, a Labor government inspired golden age, for the tertiary sector. We have invested money and grown the sector, grown the opportunities, massively increased participation, with 190,000 more places open, 190,000 young Australians who are studying. The reality is, though, that behind them is a group of students whose literacy, numeracy and capacity to end up getting into university is so compromised by underfunding that is only going to get worse and worse as the old Howard broken model continues. We have made a decision for two years to ask for the big brother, the big sister, the university sector, to forgo a two per cent and then a 1.25 per cent dividend while its fees are still increasing to allow us to make sure that young Australians starting school will be guaranteed a decent education no matter what school they go to. It is the Labor way. It is fairness. It is stronger. And it is smarter. we have, where we are ripping money out of universities, the future of this nation! The only way this is a golden age is if it is once again the government playing the role of King Midas in reverse, because everything they touch seems to go the opposite way to gold. What absolute hypocrisy from the government in these efficiency dividends, as they call them, in the typical parlance of bureaucratic speak, at the same time criticising state governments for making cuts-cuts that at least they are up-front to the public about. With this one, they are still trying to claim that there is going to be no problem here. But I have to tell you that there is a problem, particularly for rural and regional universities. I can go to universities in my electorate such as the CQUniversity-my alma mater, in fact. This was the headline in the Daily Mercury this week: '200 CQU jobs in the firing line'. The university's vice-chancellor and president, Professor Scott Bowman, is quoted in the article as saying: … the university would suffer a significant financial hit over the next two years, with the Federal Government's ""efficiency dividend"" reducing fundingas has been saidby 2% in 2014 and 1.25% in 2015. Far from it being an insignificant amount, the university estimates that that is $5 million out of its coffers-a university, like many in rural and regional Australia, which runs on a very, very tight bottom line. As a result of these cuts, along with other added pressures, it has had to sack 200 teaching staff from the university. That is the impact of this decision from this government somehow cutting funds out of tertiary education to give it to this grand plan for schools. As has been said before, that is simply robbing Peter to pay Paul. I have as well a letter from Scott Bowman, the Vice-Chancellor of CQUniversity, sent to me on 22 May, where he again says that this financial repositioning that the university is going to have to do-basically, major cutbacks-has been done because of a number of impacts that he lists, but one of them is the upcoming efficiency dividends that the federal government is claiming. It is not the only university in my area to be impacted by this. James Cook University also provides services into the Mackay region and into the northern part of my electorate. The vice-chancellor there, Sandra Harding, has been very critical. She has said that the university is going to have to take a long hard look at its budget for the next financial year because of this. I will quote her at length here. She says: Most of the money that comes to us from the Federal Government goes in to teaching programs and research so we will have to look at those. We will, of course, look at minimising the impacts on students but we will have to look at the whole budget and yes, courses may be affected.",315,Private Members Business
317,Mr Christensen (Dawson) (18:56,"And what a Labor way it is! What a golden ageYou can't take two per cent out of any business model and not expect it to hurt. It will be felt right across the university. It is just a great shame that that is going to impact on courses. One of those courses is probably going to be education, the thing that the government wants to improve. Because of an efficiency dividend, or a savage cut that this government is making, this university is going to have to cut back on its courses and the quality of those courses. That caused James Cook University Student Association President, Jesse Cook-a student union which is not normally critical of Labor governments I suppose-to say: How can the Prime Minister claim we are providing young Australians with 'a flying start in life' when we are sending them into under-funded Universities? A flying start to where? I agree with his sentiments. This is just a savage cut at a time when it really is not needed. I notice the National Tertiary Education Union has come out as well against this saying that this will mean a write-down of $154 million in research support funding. It will be $7 million a year less in Indigenous support, disability support and participation and partnership funding. It is cutting funding to the most needy people in the community who we want to actually get into university education to better their lives. This is an insidious cut from this government and it really does need to be repealed. I am very glad to speak on this motion condemning the government. I hope that they see sense, restore the funding and stop being such hypocrites about this. Debate interrupted. Phelan McDermid Syndrome Debate resumed on the motion by Mr Hayes: That this House: (1) notes that: (a) Phelan McDermid Syndrome is a rare and debilitating disease that affects about 30 people in Australia; and (b) the condition is most commonly caused by the novo chromosomal deletion which results in a syndrome that is autism related; (2) recognises the important role the Phelan McDermid Syndrome Foundation has in providing support to families; and (3) acknowledges the: (a) physical, emotional and financial impact on families where a child is diagnosed with Phelan McDermid Syndrome; and (b) efforts of Megan Toole in raising awareness of this rare disease and supporting the affected families. the House to a very rare form of disability known as the Phelan McDermid Syndrome. I only became aware of this disability late last November when I met up with a long-time friend of mine, Julie O'Keefe. Her daughter Megan and Megan's husband, Andrew, are sitting in the gallery here. They have a daughter with Phelan McDermid Syndrome. This is a family I have known for a long while. Megan went to school with my youngest son, Jonathan, at St Thomas More's in Ruse, so there is a strong family connection.",318,Private Members Business
318,Mr Hayes (Fowler,"Chief Government Whip) (19:02): I rise to bring the attention ofAs members of parliament we get to hear about many things and many conditions but here is one I had never heard of and one that affects someone close to my family and close to our community. I thought it was incumbent on me to at least bring this to the attention of this parliament. I will fast-forward a couple of years. Megan and her husband, Andrew, found themselves as parents of a child with a disability. Their beautiful daughter Olivia was diagnosed back in 2011 with this extremely rare genetic disorder called Phelan McDermid Syndrome. The disability arises because of a genetic disorder at chromosome 22 in the human genome. This gene is understood to play an important role in the brain development of infants, so an individual with this condition often displays the same sorts of behaviours you would ordinarily expect to see of children on the autistic spectrum. Diagnosis of this disorder was only possible back in 1999. Genetic screening was insufficient to detect this micro deletion of chromosome 22 prior to that. As parents of children with such a rare disability, Megan and Andrew have taken a very proactive role in raising awareness and advocating on behalf of other sufferers and families with children with Phelan McDermid Syndrome. Megan Toole is the regional representative for a body that is addressing the issue of Phelan McDermid Syndrome throughout Australia, New Zealand and Indonesia. In that role and in a very voluntary capacity, Megan puts in a lot of time educating, communicating with and, importantly, supporting those families and those parents with such a rare disability as Phelan McDermid Syndrome. Her deeds in this cannot be underestimated or overappreciated. They are very great endeavours to inform and help other parents, and they have to be regarded by us here in this place as absolutely admirable. This kind of effort and dedication can only come from someone who not only cares but also has actually been through the same challenges. So she is able to offer not simply sympathy to other parents, but genuine empathy, genuine compassion and genuine support. Olivia is now almost three years of age. Unfortunately she has not acquired any speech, and she suffers from severe seizures and pneumonic episodes. She has been admitted to hospital well over 30 times in her young life. When Megan brought Olivia to my office the other day, the child was just so frightened-probably because I was dressed like this, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I probably seemed to be another doctor in another surgery. It is regrettable that, in my case, this is something that I had just not heard of, and I therefore did not have an appreciation of the effect it has on parents. It is important to understand that the symptoms of Phelan McDermid Syndrome are very similar, as I said earlier, to those of children on the autism spectrum. In fact, all but one of the sufferers of Phelan McDermid Syndrome are also diagnosed on the autism spectrum-with that one exception being little Olivia Toole. There are only 30 known sufferers of this disability in Australia. I think that puts in perspective that people are falling through the cracks and that, because we have been specific about who gets support, those children on the autism spectrum qualify for that support but a child such Olivia-one in 30-who is the only one who has not been diagnosed does not. (Time expired) Fowler, who I know is a passionate person and a staunch advocate for this cause. He spoke of having not just sympathy but genuine empathy, and I know that he is certainly one person in this place who has genuine empathy not only for people with this syndrome but also for",319,Private Members Business
319,Mr Mccormack (Riverina) (19:07,"May I from the outset commend the member forpeople afflicted with other diseases. I commend him for bringing this motion to parliament. It is a very important medical condition but not one that is well known about. Phelan McDermid Syndrome is an extremely rare condition which affects about 600 people worldwide. Of these, only about 30 are in Australia. The condition is named after Dr Katy Phelan and Dr Heather McDermid who first identified the condition, which is a genetic disorder caused by deletions or rearrangements on chromosome 22. Dr Phelan is credited with identifying the 22q13 chromosome deletion in 1988 while studying DNA analysis on a newborn who suffered from poor muscle tone. Due to the deletion of this chromosome the condition is also known as 22q13 deletion syndrome. All of those diagnosed with Phelan McDermid Syndrome have global development delays and almost all have absent or severely delayed speech. The condition also causes physical issues such as immature muscles, hypotonia and visual perception as well as neurological issues which affect nerve control and mental processing times. Treatment of the condition varies from child to child and from family to family. Currently the condition cannot be cured. Instead, symptoms are addressed with different medications and other therapies including physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy and vision therapy. The Phelan McDermid Syndrome Foundation, which is based in the United States of America, plays an important role in providing support to families across the globe. The foundation holds a biannual conference which allows families from around the world the opportunity to meet each other and build support networks. Furthermore, a number of professionals also attend and this allows families to meet with specialists in this rare disorder. Newsletters and the website help families keep in touch with each other and with medical professionals who specialise in this condition or who are researching how to understand the condition better. The foundation also has regional representatives around the world who are the go-to people for families in their particular area. Megan Toole is one of the Regional8 representatives, a region which includes Australia, New Caledonia, New Zealand and India. Megan plays an important role in raising awareness of this rare disease and in supporting families who have a family member with this rare condition. I commend Megan for her wonderful efforts. In addition to providing support for families, the foundation focuses research on initiatives which are expected to get the greatest benefit. The foundation has built a web patient registry, which is the largest collection of phenotypic and genetic data from patients with Phelan McDermid Syndrome, which can be used to by those researching the condition. Furthermore, the foundation offers scholarships which will hasten the development of effective therapeutics to assist those affected. My hometown of Wagga Wagga in the Riverina is home to the Harmer family. They are good people. Chris and Carol Harmer are the parents of three children. Their eldest daughter, Lauren, is 21. Their other two children, Emily, 20, and Tom, 16 have Phelan McDermid Syndrome. Carol is the full-time carer of Emily, who has never spoken a word, and of Tom who is affected but not as severely as his sister. I have met and spoken to Carol and Chris on a number of occasions and understand the physical, emotional and financial strain having children with this condition has placed on them. Only recently Carol contacted me to explain the medicine Emily requires to assist with her anxiety and behaviour issues, which are a result of having Phelan McDermid Syndrome, is not covered by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and was leaving them with an expensive medicine bill each month. Unfortunately, without the drug company applying to have this particular medicine on the PBS scheme, the Harmers must continue to find the money to be able to afford this necessary treatment for their daughter. Chris recently had to give up his long-haul transport duties with Burkinshaws Transport. He used to drive the Sydney to Melbourne route taking wool to both capital cities and general freight on the way home so he could spend more time with his family. That has also caused a strain on his family, but Ian Burkinshaw, his boss, has been very kind and given him full-time work at the transport company depot, which has obviously helped. It is important that Chris has been able to spend more time with his family. The Kooringal Rotary Club were very good to offer to part-sponsor the Harmers to go to the US to go to a Phelan McDermid Syndrome conference, but the kids are not well enough to do so. I do thank Kooringal Rotary for their generosity. I again commend the member for Fowler for moving this motion in parliament. Ms HALL (Shortland) (19:12): I rise to support the motion moved by the member for Fowler. The member for Riverina has also spoken passionately about it. Both members understand the issues that surround parents that have a child that has a rare disease such as Phelan McDermid Syndrome. I think one of the key factors is that there are only 600 people worldwide, all children I understand, and 30 here in Australia that have PMS as it is often referred to. It is one of those diseases that is a genetic disorder. It is characterised by global developmental delay as has already been mentioned. Most sufferers have no speech or are severely speech delayed. We have talked a little bit in this debate about how it is caused by the deletion or rearrangement of chromosome 22. SHANK3 is often deleted in people with PMS. It has also been associated with autism spectrum. But it has also been shown that there is a connection with schizophrenia through SHANK3. I would like to acknowledge the role of the PMS foundation in providing both financial and emotional support for families to deal with the impact that this disorder has. The member for Fowler and the member for Riverina both referred to the role that Megan Toole has played. The real issue is that PMS is a very rare disease. Very few people suffer from this disease and because of that it is really hard to attract money for research. It is really hard to have drugs that will actually assist those people who have PMS. Consequently with such a small number of people suffering from this disorder, it makes life really hard and it makes it very hard to bring about change. PMS is one of many rare diseases that fit into this void where you cannot get the money for research, where you cannot get the drugs, all because just not enough people have it. But if you put together the number of people that have rare diseases globally there are actually 70 million people and that is quite significant. There are two million people in Australia living with rare diseases and 10 per cent of the Australian population is directly affected by one or more of the 8,000 diseases. When you put it into that sort of parameter you can see that there may not be a lot of people affected but when you join together all those people in Australia that are suffering from rare diseases it shows that we need to adopt a different approach to dealing with people whose lives are impacted incredibly by having a child with, or themselves, having a rare disease. Julie and Andrew, I know how hard it must be for you with your little daughter. I think that going to see Chris was one of those really courageous things that can happen that can bring about changes. I have been doing some work with Rare Voices Australia. They are trying to be an umbrella group for all of these rare diseases. People with rare diseases face enormous challenges each and every day just struggle to keep their lives together. It is through the organisations such as Rare Voices Australia that they can actually move things forward. Then you get people coming together and with numbers you can make your voice heard a bit better. My thoughts are with you. Thank you, Chris. I thank you member for Fowler and member for Riverina. Your contributions were very moving. additional contribution. Leave granted. Syndrome. It has a significance in terms of delayed developmental stages in a child and the absence of language skills but also feeding and growing difficulties, sleep disturbances and intellectual disabilities. Therefore, parents with a child with Phelan McDermid Syndrome need to pay regular visits to paediatricians such as Rick Dunstan-a good friend who is Olivia's treating physician-but also to access various medications. This is where I talk about falling through the cracks. The applications of these therapies and medicines certainly are not cheap on families. Unfortunately, because Olivia is the only sufferer of Phelan McDermid Syndrome in Australia who is not diagnosed on the autism spectrum, her parents are the only parents of a Phelan McDermid sufferer who do not get the benefit of the early intervention facilities and finances available through the Commonwealth. It does not mean that their costs are any cheaper, it does not mean that their visits to the paediatrician are any fewer. It does mean that the difficulties are very much shouldered by them as the parents. As I say, this is a very rare disease. There are only 30 known sufferers in Australia at the moment and of those children, imagine Megan's surprise to find that there was another child only recently diagnosed at age 3 living in the same postcode also suffering from Phelan McDermid Syndrome. But in his case he is diagnosed on the autism spectrum as well. Megan has taken upon herself to meet with every family affected by Phelan McDermid Syndrome and understands that these families, like her and Andrew, are also going through some very tough times in coming to terms with the syndrome and with the impact on their child, but also with the significant medical expenses involved. DisabilityCare Australia and the National Disability Insurance Scheme will hopefully provide much-needed assistance and support to these families to enhance the quality of life and to increase the economic and social participation for all people with disabilities including young people as they grow up, like Olivia. However, there remains a significant level of unmet demand for disability services and, unfortunately, Phelan McDermid Syndrome falls through the cracks and currently there is no recognisable government assistance available for these families or their carers. As you know, my electorate is the second most disadvantaged electorate in the country. Probably because of that and the lower land values there, my electorate is overrepresented by people and family living with disabilities. I have had a long association with various groups",320,Private Members Business
320,Mr Hayes (Fowler,Chief Government Whip) (19:17): I seek leave to make an,323,Private Members Business
321,Mr Hayes,"As I was saying, it is very rare for children to have Phelan McDermidthat offer relief and support for families dealing with disabilities and, like them, I have expressed my concern on this matter before the House as we all believe in the need for greater support and care for these families. I have nothing but admiration for the courage and determination of Megan and Andrew. What they are doing not only to support their beautiful daughter, Olivia, but also what they are doing as the advocates of Phelan McDermid Syndrome throughout Australia is absolutely commendable. I commend this to the House. Debate adjourned. Chemotherapy Drugs Debate resumed on the motion by Mr Dutton: That the House: (1) notes the concerns of key stakeholders in relation to the price reduction of chemotherapy drug Docetaxel and its potential broader impact on the treatment of cancer patients; (2) calls on the Government to: (a) negotiate with relevant bodies regarding the cost of dispensing chemotherapy drugs; and (b) ensure that the result of these negotiations will allow pharmacists to continue dispensing the drug, and other chemotherapy drugs, without disrupting patients; and (3) welcomes the policy of price disclosure of items on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, however calls on the Government to ensure that further disruptions to patients do not occur. relevant bodies regarding the cost of dispensing chemotherapy drugs and to ensure that dispensing can continue to occur without disrupting patients. This has been another disastrously handled policy by this government. We are now six months on from when I gave notice of this motion. We have had a Senate inquiry which clearly identified there were problems, and stakeholders have provided compelling evidence, and I thank them very much for that. Indeed, the Clinical Oncology Society of Australia said: If there is no longer an income stream to maintain the clinical pharmacy services associated with the supply of chemotherapy, this is likely to affect the cost of care and patient access. Centres will close or pass on the additional costs to patients in order to remain viable. The Pharmacy Guild of Australia stated: Ongoing care for all Australian cancer patients, regardless of their type of cancer, is being put at risk by the current arrangements. Other evidence to the committee found: The service of preparing chemotherapy medication is highly complex, expensive and labourintensive, and demands an environment and investment does not compromise on quality. The government gave an undertaking last November to examine the 'cost of delivering vital chemotherapy services'. Incredibly, there is still no long-term solution. Earlier this month, on the eve of the Senate inquiry's report, the government rushed out an announcement. The supposed funding 'boost' is to start in July, but will cease in December 2013, providing no long-term certainty for patients, clinicians or providers, and smacks more of politics than it does of pragmatic solution. The government knew a potential issue existed with the cost of dispensing well before I gave notice of this motion, but failed to act. The inability to resolve",323,Private Members Business
322,Mr Dutton (Dickson) (19:22,"The House calls on the government to negotiate withor make a decision on funding for chemotherapy services is typical of the chaos and dysfunction of the Gillard government. As stated in the inquiry's report: 1.12 The latest review follows a previous commitment given six months prior to this latest announcement to examine the 'cost of delivering vital chemotherapy services'. 1.13 The latest announcement prolongs uncertainty and undermines the effective and efficient delivery of treatments for cancer patients and their families. It points to a lack of appreciation for the critical implications being felt by chemotherapy services … 1.14 Despite the announcement, the Government is still unable to detail for providers of chemotherapy services and their patients any definitive long-term funding solution. Vulnerable patients requiring these services do not need the stress of being caught in a disagreement over funding that continues to drag on. This should have been a priority for the government and it should have been resolved last year. Minister Plibersek needs to explain what the government has been doing in its negotiations and why patients and clinicians now have to wait for another review. I gave notice of this motion, as I say, last November. The government was not able to negotiate an outcome over the Christmas and New Year period, so the minister needs to explain how negotiations will be undertaken when the interim funding ceases at the end of this December. I would like to make clear that the coalition does support price disclosure. The coalition's reforms were negotiated cooperatively with the sector in 2007 and are estimated to provide up to $5.8 billion in savings over a 10-year period. This has helped to support the sustainability of the PBS. But where broader anomalies arise from time to time with dispensing pharmaceuticals, particularly where there is a risk to patient services, it should be properly and transparently reviewed by the government and responded to. The issue here is a government that has deliberately dragged its feet on a very, very important issue. Only due to parliamentary pressure, including the Senate inquiry and this motion, did the government belatedly announce a review. However, this is a government with a chequered history, to say the least, and it is certainly chequered when it comes to pharmaceutical policy. Labor signed a memorandum of understanding with Medicines Australia in May 2010 to provide 'policy certainty', in its own words, to the sector in return for additional savings of $1.9 billion over five years. Yet, within months, Labor effectively broke its promise and changed the convention on how governments list medicines on the PBS. Indeed, in February 2011, the Gillard government refused to list a number of medicines on the PBS that had been recommended by the independent Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee, blaming its 'fiscal circumstances'. It was a case in point on the consequences of this Labor government's economic mismanagement and fiscal recklessness. The move denied patients timely access to new medicines that had been independently assessed by the PBAC. Again, after substantial political pressure and a Senate inquiry initiated by the coalition, the government agreed to list the deferred medicines in September 2011. However, this matter still has not been resolved and there remains a great deal of policy uncertainty around the listing process. Similarly, the chemotherapy issue remains another unresolved issue for this government. Six months from the giving of notice of the motion we are considering today, the government has failed to provide a genuine, long-term solution. In closing, it is obvious from all of the government's actions that they pushed this out to December 2013, trying again, in their expectation of not having the competence to win the next election, to create some difficulty for an incoming government. It is a cruel political hoax being perpetrated on those chemotherapy patients as well as the providers around the country. To play politics in this area is completely unacceptable. I call on the government to provide a more long-term resolution to this very important issue. That necessitated us taking the action we did in the Senate inquiry and also in this motion. Yet again, the government stand condemned. Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General) (19:28): It is not us on this side of the House who are playing politics and it is not our motion before the chamber. It is their motion before the chamber, so they are the ones playing politics on this issue. That is the reality. Do not blame us for something that you are trying to play politics on. The models in relation to funding for chemotherapy is actually quite a complex area of policy. There are arrangements, including the efficient funding of chemotherapy, which was put in place to ensure patients can continue to get access to vital cancer drugs at a price that is affordable for themselves and for the government. These arrangements were developed in parallel with the expanded and accelerated price disclosure measure and the Fifth Community Pharmacy Agreement. In fact, in relation to the expanded and accelerated price disclosure measure, the coalition have had more positions than you could poke a stick at. At times, they have said that they support it; at other times, they have voted against it. Now the shadow minister comes to this chamber and says he now supports it. I would like to see some consistency from those opposite in relation to that measure. There are no suggestions, by the way, from any stakeholders that the efficiencies generated for taxpayers by the EFC and the EAPD are inappropriate. The situation is that in late 2012, as a consequence of the expected impact of upcoming price reductions in a certain drug, known as Docetaxel, and another range of drugs in relation to chemotherapy, the industry raised some concerns in relation to the sustainability of chemotherapy infusion preparation services. There are about 100 dispensers, through pharmacists, of this particular drug and other chemotherapy drugs around the country. There are about 5,000 pharmacists in total and about 100 who do this particularly complex form of administration of a chemotherapy drug in terms of preparation. Without the cross-subsidy available from the high price that the government was paying for these drugs, stakeholders associated with this, including some of the pharmacists, actually said that services would shift from private to public hospitals and that there was a threat of services closing. In fact what the Minister for Health did was act appropriately, and expeditiously requested that DoHA visit organisations, investigate the issue and listen to stakeholders. Senior members of staff from DoHA visited a number of chemotherapy suppliers and third-party chemotherapy compounders in private hospitals to discuss this issue. The matter came before the Senate Community Affairs Committee for inquiry and report. The shadow minister was selective in his quoting, so I will quote what the single recommendation of that committee said on 10 May 2013 at paragraph 3.41. It said:",324,Private Members Business
323,Mr Neumann (Blair,"Parliamentary Secretary for Health and Ageing andThe committee recommends that the government and industry parties, through the review, continue the examination of issues in chemotherapy drug pricing to ensure that existing funds under the Fifth Community Pharmacy Agreement as already agreed are appropriately directed to reflect the costs and benefits of the supply of chemotherapy drugs, and to ensure the ongoing supply of these drugs across all services, particularly in rural and regional areas. In fact, on 5 May, the minister appropriately announced a review of funding arrangements for chemotherapy services. We are going to support this motion with amendments that reflect what the government are doing in announcing a review, which will operate until later this year. It will be undertaken independently with transparency and stakeholders will be consulted. We provided $29.7 million in the 2013-14 budget to pay providers an additional $60 for each chemotherapy infusion on an interim basis for a period of six months. That funding will cover the review period from 1 July 2013 until end December 2013 and will be provided in addition to the current $76.37. I want to make it clear because if you listen to the shadow minister you would think that, somehow, there was absolute chaos in relation to this issue. Throughout this whole process the price paid by patients for chemotherapy drugs has not changed, and it will not change. The most paid for the drugs for a whole course of treatment is currently $5.90 for a concession patient or $36.10 for a general patient. The review will be consumer focused and will provide opportunities for patients, stakeholders and providers who are involved in this industry to engage and provide suggestions on the future long-term approach. As I said, the review will be transparent and independent of government. The government want to identify and find a long-term solution in relation to this issue. It wants to make sure that cross-subsidisation is not required to support the viability of chemotherapy services across the country. We have undertaken this action because we want a long-term solution and long-term arrangements put in place. This government can be very proud of what we have done in relation to cancer treatment. We have provided 30 new drugs in relation to the PBS. We have provided and approved those drugs for 15 different cancers at an additional cost of $1.3 billion to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme since 2007. We have also welcomed the policy of the accelerated and expanded price disclosure of items on the PBS. We have had a consistent position in relation to that, unlike those opposite. We are very proud of what we have done to improve cancer services across the country. In addition to the new PBS cancer treatments I have outlined, we have committed $3.5 billion since 2007 to improve the prevention, detection and treatment of cancer. This includes in the recent budget $226 million over four years to deliver the Gillard government's world-leading cancer care package. That involves cancer prevention, detection, support and research. Critically ill patients waiting for bone marrow transplants will have a better chance to get lifesaving help through this initiative, with around 280 critically ill patients expected to be approved for the bone marrow transplant program in 2013-14. This initiative also provides new funding for CanTeen, the Australian organisation for young people living with cancer, to support a national network of specialist services for 12to 24-year-olds who are living with cancer, a group often felt to be left out in terms of cancer treatment, identification and publicity. We have also provided funding for the successful McGrath Foundation to continue to expand the foundation's Breast Care Nurses initiative, expanding the number of government funded nurses from the current 44 to 57. In addition, we have provided in this budget $55.7 million to expand the BreastScreen Australia Program, increasing participation by women aged 70 to 74, ensuring more women are tested for breast cancer as they get older, because we know the risk is higher as women age. We have also provided an additional $18.5 million for the Australian Prostate Cancer Research centre's program, including in my home state of Queensland an amount of $6.2 million at the Princess Alexandra Hospital in Brisbane, about 40 or 50 kilometres down the road from where I live. This will mean improved testing, diagnosis and treatment for people with prostate cancer. I outline some of these initiatives, including the initiatives that we have undertaken in the budget, the National Bowel Cancer Screening Program and additional help in relation to lung cancer, because I think it is necessary to put on the public record that we are really determined to make sure we deal with this issue. When we say we are involved in world-leading cancer care, we are making those investments, including in relation to breast, cervical, prostate and bowel cancer, to make sure we achieve an international benchmark. If you listened to the shadow minister in relation to this issue, you would think it is chaos, tragedy and despair. It is not. In fact, we are investing a massive amount of money to make sure this scourge, which affects every Australian family, is dealt with as best we can. Unlike those opposite, who want to close down Medicare Locals and strip funding to health services, as their state colleagues in Queensland and Victoria have done, we are determined to make sure that our health services, including breast cancer treatment and prostate cancer treatment, are rolled out in such a way that Australian people, whether they live in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria or any other state or territory, can get the help they want. We are investing for the future in terms of health services, while those opposite will cut, cut and cut. price reduction of chemotherapy drug docetaxel. The Parliamentary Secretary for Health and Ageing has put forward a blizzard of irrelevant considerations, because the motion before the House this evening deals with the specific circumstances in which the price reduction for chemotherapy drug docetaxel was imposed on the healthcare sector. This price reduction occurred at very short notice and generated very substantial concern amongst the providers of chemotherapy care. Concerns were raised with me by a major private hospital in my electorate, the Sydney Adventist Hospital. In a letter written to me late last year, the chief executive of the hospital informed me of his concerns that this cut in the funding available under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme for docetaxel would put at risk the current system for the preparation and supply of chemotherapy drugs through private hospitals and private clinics. He made the point that the cut in funding was of the order of 72 per cent-by any measure an extremely substantial reduction. He made the point that at his hospital there is an expectation of providing approximately 5,181 treatment sessions for chemotherapy patients in that year. He also pointed out that private hospitals and oncology clinics provide 60 per cent of all lifesaving chemotherapy services in Australia. Accordingly, what we have here is an episode by which the current government has imposed, at short notice, a very dramatic reduction in the funding available under the PBS for docetaxel, which will have substantial flow-through effects on the capacity of the private hospital sector and private oncology clinics to provide life-saving chemotherapy services.",326,Private Members Business
324,Mr Fletcher (Bradfield) (19:38,"I am pleased to speak on this motion concerning theThe concerns raised with me by the Sydney Adventist Hospital were also raised by a number of constituents. Families blighted by cancer, who are working through a treatment program, are now very anxious about the impacts on their treatment program of this very sharp reduction in the funding made available under the PBS for docetaxel. Let me quote from a letter I received from Debbie Quirk of St Ives who had this to say: My family is touched by cancer with my husband having bowel cancer and undergoing a number of operations and chemotherapy treatments, which he is still receiving. We are concerned at the long-term implications of the federal government's 1 December ongoing changes to the PBS and the future funding of chemotherapy drugs. This concern is adding to the already significant impact that cancer has had on our lives. There could be no more articulate statement of the reasoning behind the motion moved by the shadow minister and which we are debating this evening because that motion is underpinned by the opposition's concern for the impact on so many patients of this very dramatic reduction at very short notice in the funding available under the PBS. If patients are to be served in the most efficient way, if their treatment is to be carried out in a way which is most responsive to their clinical needs, it is very important that the funding arrangements which lie behind that treatment are managed in a consistent and long-term fashion. Unfortunately, we have seen precisely the opposite from this government. Indeed, it is surprising to learn that significant changes to the funding model were proposed as long ago as 2009 by pharmacists, oncologists and private hospitals. Unfortunately the government's response at that time was to introduce a short-term solution and what we have now seen is that that short-term solution has played out in ways that are causing great anxiety and stress to patients. I call upon the government, in the terms of this motion, to immediately resolve this very serious issue. Ms O'NEILL (Robertson) (19:43): I rise to speak on this motion concerning the funding of chemotherapy drugs. I note the opening remarks of my colleague who spoke first for the government in this debate that it is indeed a motion brought to the House by the opposition, one that might well have been much better handle more quietly and with less alarm for those who are, with their families, facing the very significant challenge of managing a diagnosis of cancer and then the treatment of cancer. The fearmongering which has become part of the methodology of those opposite, the generation of headlines over more judicious and more careful and more responsible management of key policy issues for this country, is seen on display here today. Nonetheless, I would like to put on the record a few of the important facts with regard to the issue before the chair. The reality is that, since the initial concerns were raised in 2012 about the price reduction of Docetaxel and the potential impact on patient services, the Department of Health and Ageing has been undertaking some pretty detailed investigations into chemotherapy and the funding arrangements to make sure that these can be continued in a safe and stable way. Some chemotherapy providers were using the inflated price the government paid them to crosssubsidise the cost of delivery. I do not think we can underestimate the complexity of some of these chemotherapy drugs being produced, distributed and administered to patients. But, with the price drop of several of the chemotherapy drugs-because the generic drug became available and entered the market-some providers complained that they could not continue to use that model. They could not continue to use that model because, instead of the government paying an excessive price for a drug which was now generic and available at a reasonable price, the government decided to get good value for money for Australian taxpayers-while continuing to provide for the highest standard of medical care for Australian people. So this broken model needed review. I note that, in the period between this private member's matter being brought before us and now, we had, very importantly, the outcome of the Senate Community Affairs References Committee inquiry into chemotherapy funding. The report was tabled as recently as 10 May. It recommended that the government and industry parties, through the review-they had proposed a review-continue the examination of issues in chemotherapy drug pricing to ensure that existing funds under the Fifth Community Pharmacy Agreement are appropriately directed to reflect the costs and benefits of the supply of chemotherapy drugs and to ensure the ongoing supply of these drugs across all services, particularly in rural and regional areas. That is exactly what is going on and I am pleased to note that the member for Dickson put on the record that there is agreement between the government and the opposition with regard to the Expanded and Accelerated Price Disclosure policy. This policy continues to work the way it was intended-bringing the price the government pays for the drugs into line with the market price of those drugs. That is transparency and that is fairness. It also saves taxpayers' money and that money has allowed and will allow the government to make investments in critical treatments for consumers and for sufferers of cancers other than the one the Docetaxel drug-which seems to have been the real stimulus for this conversation-is intended for. Since 2007, this government has committed $1.5 billion for cancer medicines. I know, from my own family and personal experience, that the provision of these drugs is vital. I hope that, as things move forward, some of the unnecessary vitriol in this debate dissipates and that a quieter, more thoughtful and careful conversation proceeds to achieve the best outcomes for the Australian population. (Time expired) speech on this issue of chemotherapy drugs. I will start by going back to 28 November 2012, when this issue was first raised. It was raised by the shadow minister for health in the House, but it is worth noting, when it comes to thoughtful consideration, that it was first raised by Independent Senator Nick Xenophon in the Senate. So this went across party lines because there was real concern about the government's incompetent handling of this issue. It was not an issue that anyone wants to be raising but it was an issue that we felt compelled to raise. The motion was not hysterical. It was a very calm, considered motion that had been put through, calling on the government to negotiate with stakeholders-hardly alarming-to ensure the continued delivery of chemotherapy drugs without disruption to patients by resolving dispensing cost issues and avoiding further unintended consequences. That last bit is one of the keys to this motion, because this is the government of unintended consequences. Everything that it does, it fails to have a proper process for. It fails to think what might be the scenarios that their actions might lead to. What we see time and time again is unintended consequence after unintended consequence. That is why we are here tonight to try and get the government to solve these unintended consequences. What is the greatest of those unintended consequences at the moment? It is the fact that we still do not have a long term solution to this problem. This is not something that we have just raised. As I referred to",328,Private Members Business
325,Mr Tehan (Wannon) (19:49,"I rise tonight to give a very considered and thoughtfulat the very start, this was something raised on 28 November. Yet still we have speakers from the government here tonight unable to say what the solution will be. As a matter of fact, they have outsourced it. They have said, 'We don't know what to do. We don't know how to handle this issue. We can't deal with it. It is too complicated for us.' They are putting their hands up and saying, 'We're going to defer it till after the election.' Now that might be a very simple solution for the government but it is not a simple solution for those cancer patients who need this chemotherapy issue resolved and they need it resolved now. They do not want to see it postponed into the future. They want to see the government say, 'We have the wherewithal to be able to deal with this issue. It is not hard. It is not complicated. We have a bureaucracy behind us. We can solve this issue.' If the government fails to act quickly, many of the most vulnerable patients may be forced into the public hospital system. In and of itself, you would think, okay, that is not great because we are going to put more pressure on the public health system. But what has the government done in the cut funding to the public health system. In Victoria they cut $104 million. An honourable member: That is a misrepresentation. patients into the public health system and then you cut funding to it. What type of incompetence is this? Where does the logic flow that you would put more pressure on your public health system and then cut funding to it-illogical? It is hard to fathom that we could get this type of incompetence, yet here we are tonight. All of us here on both sides would like to see this issue resolved. We have offered on this side to work with the government to help you to resolve it but we do not get any admitting: 'We can't do our job. Please could you come over and give us a hand and allow us to do it.' There is nothing along those lines. None of us want to be here tonight, but we once again call on the government to do what they should be doing: govern the country and fix this problem. Honourable members: Hear! Hear! Dickson regarding chemotherapy drugs. Since 2007, the government has invested $3.7 billion to improve cancer prevention, detection, treatment, research and infrastructure. Since this time, with an additional $1.3 billion, the Labor government has listed 30 new medicines to treat 15 different types of cancers on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, saving many more patients over $5,000 per treatment. The government acknowledges that there has been community concern with regard to the impact of price disclosure on funding for chemotherapy infusion medicines. On5 May this year Minister Plibersek announced a major review into the way chemotherapy is funded, and provided a way for ensuring cancer patients have continued access to quality, affordable treatment. I note the support of shadow minister Dutton for the policy of price disclosure and the aim that Australian taxpayers should pay the market price for PBS medicines, including chemo infusions. In terms of point 3 of the member for Dickson's motion, the Gillard government wants to ensure that cancer patients do not experience any interruption in their treatment",330,Private Members Business
326,Mr Tehan,It is not a misrepresentation. You come up with a short-term solution to put,331,Myefo Not Only Are They Pushing These Patients Into The Public Health System But They Then
327,Mr Lyons (Bass) (19:54,"I rise to speak on this motion proposed by the member forwhile we closely examine how much we should be paying to support the ongoing viability of chemotherapy providers. The review followed talks between the federal government and the Pharmacy Guild of Australia over appropriate subsidies for dispensing chemotherapy after the reduction in price the government pays for a key chemotherapy drug, docetaxel. For many years the government has been paying 20 per cent to 75 per cent above the market price for this drug. These inflated prices have meant the government has paid, in some instances, $2,800 above the market price. I strongly believe that taxpayers should not be paying inflated prices for medicines that are no longer covered by the patient and are being sold to pharmacies at much lower prices. To bring the price the government pays into line with the market price, on 1 December 2012 the price the government paid for this cancer drug dropped by 76 per cent. I note that in the 2013-14 budget the federal Labor government increased support for young people living with cancer. Young people who are diagnosed with cancer will better be able to get the care and support they need under this government's funding boost. The Gillard government is providing an additional $18.3 million over four years for youth cancer networks around Australia, building on the $15 million already provided for the networks. I am pleased to say that the Launceston General Hospital in Bass is a partner in this project. We have expanded the breast cancer screening for women, which is very important. And we know that detecting cancer early means better outcomes for patients. The 2013 federal budget included $55.7 million to expand the breast cancer target screening program for women aged between 70 and 74. This means that 70,000 more women will now receive a mammogramreminder letter from BreastScreen Australia. The Commonwealth Department of Health and Ageing has investigated these issues, including with site visits to regional hospitals, and has an ongoing contact with the Pharmacy Guild of Australia. The government continues to discuss the issues with the Pharmacy Guild, with a view to ensuring sustainability of the supply and dispensing of chemotherapy medicines. The government accepts that the dispensing of cancer treatments is more complex than other types of treatments. This is why oncology pharmacists are paid $77 in preparation fees plus mark-ups for chemotherapy infusions. In closing, I am proud of the government's record in improving cancer services. In addition to listing 30 new cancer treatments since 2007 the government has also committed around $2.5 billion to improve the detection and treatment of cancer. Recently, the Minister for Health, the Hon. Tanya Plibersek came to my electorate of Bass to officially open the Northern Cancer Support Centre, which is proving to be an important place, where sufferers and their families, friends and carers can go for support. We are supporting patients in regional areas through the construction of regional cancer centres and associated accommodation facilities. These achievements demonstrate that this government is committed to providing cancer patients with the best treatments and services, no matter where they live. Australian cancer patients now have the best overall survival rates in the world, and our new cancer packages will continue to improve the lives of all Australians touched by cancer. Dickson, the shadow minister for health and ageing. In doing so I want to note that the government members opposite seem to be avoiding the central issue of the motion, and that is",331,Myefo Not Only Are They Pushing These Patients Into The Public Health System But They Then
328,Mr Hawke (Mitchell) (19:58,"I rise to support the motion of the federal member for the concerns of key stakeholders in relation to the price reduction of the chemotherapy drug docetaxel and its potential broad impact on the treatment of cancer patients. Members opposite have failed to understand that this is a concern of the sector, including the private sector, which provides up to 50 per cent of all cancer care in Australia. More than 13,000 lifesaving infusions are prepared and dispensed by community and private hospital pharmacies for cancer patients each week. Central to this issue is cross-subsidisation. The member for Robertson mentioned the report of the Senate Community Affairs References Committee, and I want to refer to the additional comments from coalition senators-the member for Robertson should read them. Their comments noted that there is not a good understanding of cross-subsidisation, which is what is at the centre of this motion today. Nobody is saying that cross-subsidisation is the best system possible but continually this government interferes in an area, it ignores the advice of a sector, it blunders on through with a noble objective and it ends up doing a lot of damage to everybody. That is exactly what has happened here. We are hearing that from the sector itself. The sector says, quite clearly: The largest provider of private day oncology services on the North Shore and north-west Sydneynear my electoratethe Sydney Adventist Hospital, said the funding approach could lead to ""cessation of all chemotherapy infusions, provision of a limited range of treatments and pharmacy staff reductions"". Nobody would want to see that. If the sector is telling us that if cross-subsidisation is removed and we do not have anything better to replace it with that could lead to the cessation of treatment, then obviously you have to do something about it. Of course we do not want to be here today discussing a motion in relation to cancer treatment and chemotherapy drugsnobody wants to politicise these issues. These are not political footballs. But the sector is saying they cannot convince the government, and they cannot convince the member for Robertson, about this issue-that they have a problem. So we have put forward a reasonable and measured motion that calls on the government to consult with the sector, that says to negotiate on the price about this. If the government do have a noble and objective intention of saving taxpayers' moneythey will not get any argument from me about saving taxpayers' money-they must have something to replace it with that is better. You must have a better alternative. It is not right to leave people in serious health situations in the lurch. That is what we have seen here. Last year, in November, we saw Senator Nick Xenophon, an Independent-no friend of the opposition's-side with the shadow minister for health to say what an issue this is. Even the Greens offered their support. Maybe the government could have a look at that and say that if all these people are saying there is a concern, there might be a concern. The government itself has basically acknowledged the problem. In its recent announcement on 5 May 2013 it said it would initiate a funding review into chemotherapy and provide $29.7 million in the 2013-14 budget to provide an additional $60 for each chemotherapy infusion for only six months. This was basically an admission of failure that what it attempted to do last year was never going to work, that the patients in the sector are saying this is not going to work, and it took the government six months to respond. That is the criticism we have of this government-it is not rigorous with the detail; it is not across the detail. When those opposite attempt to do something with the highest and most noble of intentions, they never have any understanding of what it is they are trying to do-of the follow-through that is necessary and how to ameliorate the impact it will have on people on the way through. In other words, they are not good change managers and they certainly cannot manage change effectively to deliver competent government policy across a range of sectors. The opposition senators, who examined this issue rigorously, said that the failure to satisfactorily resolve this issue early was a demonstration of policy ineptitude and laziness in the government. It does not matter whether you are listening to the Pharmacy Guild or the Clinical Oncology Society or the San hospital in Sydney, or any of the constituents of mine, whether it is Kay from West Pennant Hills, Bronwyn from Castle Hill or Christina from Castle Hill-I have dozens of letters-they all express serious concerns about what the federal government was doing late last year with the future funding of chemotherapy drugs. How is that a good situation? Of course we acknowledge that cross-subsidisation may not be the best outcome but, if you are going to replace it with something, have something better to replace it with before you go and make the lives of people demonstrably worse. Ms HALL (Shortland) (20:04): This motion on chemotherapy drugs is one of the most disappointing motions I have debated in this parliament. I believe that members on both sides of this House want to ensure that patients who are living with cancer, are being treated for cancer, get the best possible medications available. I believe that members of this parliament want to see the list of available drugs expanded, and I believe that people who are undergoing cancer treatment do not want to see members of parliament politicising an issue as important as this. Both sides of this House have done many things that they can be proud of in relation to cancer treatment and the ongoing research that provides cutting-edge treatments for people who are living with cancer or who have just been diagnosed with cancer. All members would be well aware of the proud history that we have here, in Australia. We have the best cancer survival rate in the world. That does not come about because the government is shirking its responsibility; rather, it comes about because the government is committed to ensuring that cancer patients receive the best possible treatment and that there is investment in cancer services. Members on this side of the House have already stated that, since 2007, the government has committed $3.5 billion to improve the detection, prevention and treatment of cancer. It includes an extra $226 million in this year's budget over four years to deliver the government's World Leading Cancer Care package to improve cancer prevention, detection, support and research. Critically ill patients waiting for bone marrow transplants will have a better chance to get life saving help under this initiative. In addition, it will provide new funding for CanTeen, the Australian organisation for young people living with cancer. It will also provide extended funding for the McGrath Foundation, which I think every member of this House would acknowledge has been very successful. In my own electorate, many constituents have spoken to me about the need to expand cancer treatment and detection and then later they have come back to me saying, 'Thank you very much for what the government has done in this area.' Today we are looking at chemotherapy drugs-and here I would like to turn to the motion moved by the member for Dickson and say that what he should be doing is working with the government. He has given some initial cooperation. He has indicated his cooperation but when you see this sort of motion before the House you know exactly where the member for Dickson is coming from. On5 May this year, the minister announced a review into the funding of chemotherapy services, because we know how important it is that people receiving treatment continue to get that treatment. We know how important it is to ensure that new treatments come on line. We know how important it is to ensure that, as a government, we pay the correct amount of money for the drugs that people are using, and we need to know that the people who are receiving the treatment are paying the amount of money that they need to. The broad aim of this review is to gain a detailed understanding of all aspects of chemotherapy funding. It is not an ad hoc approach, as those on the other side are suggesting. The broad aim of the review is to ensure that there will be consultation with all stakeholders. It is a very inclusive review and, as members have previously mentioned, there was also a review undertaken by the Senate committee. It is time that those on the other side of this House stopped playing politics. They should stop trying to prey on people who look to government for support. They should stop trying to create fear and uncertainty. They should stop trying to prey on people whom they should be supporting and looking after. I think there has been enough of this. It just says to me that, if this opposition were ever allowed to become the government of this country, there would be much more of this and the people of Australia could be well and truly let down. (Time expired) minister for health, for moving this important private member's motion. I note that the member submitted this motion in November last year and that his concerns have also been investigated by the Senate Community Affairs References Committee, which released its report earlier this month. I support the member for Dickson's call for the government to negotiate with stakeholders and to ensure that, as a result, pharmacists can continue to dispense chemotherapy drugs without disrupting patients. Earlier today I was honoured to host another Parliamentary Friends of Medicines event and to welcome senior members of the Pharmacy Guild as they launched a paper about reducing financial burden on society. We are all aware that our health budget comprises a large part of our nation's expenditure and all would agree that these costs need to be managed in the most efficient and prudent way. However, the key difference with this budget item is that we are talking about the health of our constituents, and thereby the health of our nation. This government's failure to administer a reliable funding framework for the delivery of chemotherapy services to Australia's cancer sufferers is a perfect example of how not to manage health related budgetary matters. To add weight to this saga, the government's failure to resolve this issue in a timely fashion is, and I quote from the Senate report, 'a demonstration of its policy ineptitude and laziness. According to evidence of many witnesses, this lack of a timely resolution may put at risk affordable and quality care and access to treatment for cancer patients'. The array of critics of this government's management of this issue was seemingly endless. The Clinical Oncology Society of Australia said: 'If there is no longer an income stream to maintain the clinical pharmacy services associated with the supply of chemotherapy, this is likely to affect the cost of care and patient access.' The Pharmacy Guild of Australia said: 'Ongoing care for all Australian cancer patients, regardless of their type of cancer, is being put",332,Myefo Not Only Are They Pushing These Patients Into The Public Health System But They Then
329,Mr Alexander (Bennelong) (20:09,"I thank the member for Dickson, the shadowat risk by the current arrangements.' Sydney Adventist Hospital, the largest provider of private day oncology services on the North Shore and the north-west of Sydney said the funding approach could lead to a 'cessation of all chemotherapy infusions, provision of a limited range of treatments and pharmacy staff reductions'. The Medical Oncology Group of Australia and Private Cancer Physicians of Australia said 'The current remuneration model for chemotherapy does not reflect how contemporary cancer services are delivered.' The key result of the Senate committee report is that the current chemotherapy funding model is neither transparent nor sustainable. And so finally, just a few weeks ago, the government admitted to its own mess and announced it will provide an additional $60 for each chemotherapy infusion-but only for six months. How this short-term announcement provides any stability to the industry or certainty to cancer patients and their families is beyond me. All it does is get them past the September election. How convenient. It is clear that this government is still unable to detail for providers of chemotherapy services and their patients any definitive long-term funding solution. This is not a debate about price disclosure. The patented medicine in question was developed by Bennelong based company Sanofi. Companies like Sanofi are very willing to participate in a conversation on the important role that they can play as part of this process and the important savings that are derived after their patent period has expired. This is an issue about cancer sufferers and chemotherapy providers, both of whom are wholly dependent on a viable long-term funding solution for the sustainable provision of cancer treatment services. The government's delay on this matter has forced many private chemotherapy providers to absorb huge costs. The Sydney Adventist Hospital Pharmacy that services my electorate has estimated a $1.6 million financial shortfall as a result of the government's changes to the PBS since April 2010. It is clear that the government must, at the earliest opportunity, commence a genuine negotiation with stakeholders to effect a sustainable solution to this crisis in our health-care system. As the Member for Dickson said earlier, vulnerable cancer patients do not need the stress of the uncertainty created by this government to add even more pressure on top of the challenges they are already facing. I congratulate the member on this motion and commend it in the strongest possible terms to the House. (Time expired) forward by the shadow minister for health with amendments; however, I note with concern that, as usual, the opposition distorts the facts and attempts to frighten the sick, as it infers the government's drug-price disclosure policy will somehow disrupt the delivery of life-saving drugs to cancer patients. The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme that pays for these drugs is a Commonwealth government scheme which gives Australians affordable access to necessary medicines and, interestingly, the PBS was started in 1948 as an initiative of the Chifley Labor government with free medicines for pensioners and a list of 139 'life-saving and disease preventing' medicines that were free of charge for others in the community. Today Labor's PBS scheme is available to all Australian residents who hold a current Medicare card and the government subsidises the cost of medicine for most medical",335,Myefo Not Only Are They Pushing These Patients Into The Public Health System But They Then
330,Mr Murphy (Reid) (20:14,"The government is willing to support the motion putconditions, in particular for expensive drugs such as Docetaxel that are used to treat cancers. It is evident that the shadow minister for health is arguing not for the rights of cancer patients or the taxpayers but for the chemotherapy providers who were, it appeared, benefiting from the continuation of the previously high price that the government was paying for patented drugs like Docetaxel that have subsequently seen a drop in price following the expiry of their patent. Docetaxel is a derivative of Taxol, an anti-cancer drug that was first isolated in 1967 from the bark of the Pacific yew tree by scientists at the National Cancer Institute, an agency of the United States government that is funded by United States taxpayers. Given that most of the important discoveries of medical science have been made in universities and public institutions, I would argue that, instead of simply paying endless sums to the companies that commercially exploit these findings, more funds should be made available to the university and research institute scientists and workers who actually find drugs like Taxol and similar substances. The most profound discovery in biology, that of the structure of DNA or deoxyribonucleic acid, was made 60 years by the Cambridge University scientists Francis Crick and James Watson yet, as far as I know, no member of the opposition has made any mention of the importance of this finding that is key to the development of treatment of cancers, diseases that are fundamentally disorders of the genes, themselves structures composed of molecules of DNA. I have no doubt that, if Crick and Watson had applied for research funding from an Abbott government, they would have been refused support on the grounds that such work had no commercial benefit and would not produce products useful for industry. Is that fanciful? Perhaps not given that Dr Brendan Nelson, the then Howard government's minister, set up a Robb Pierre style committee of public safety to overlook research funding applications. That committee was composed of individuals who had neither training nor expertise in the proposals that they were vetting yet there was great concern that research grants may have been disallowed by ignorant individuals whose only qualifications were loyalty to the Liberal Party. I have no doubt that an Abbott government would hasten to re-establish such a committee, given the evident hostility to science and rational policy-making shown by the opposition. Of course, the opposition will, if given the chance, slash funding for medical research given its profound hostility to scientists and their work as exemplified by the denial of the reality of climate change and the attacks on research funding under the failed Howard government. In contrast, our government, determined to support medical research, has committed $3.7 billion since 2007 to improve the detection, prevention and treatment of cancer. The government's policy of an expanded and accelerated price disclosure for the cost of drugs is working to bring the price that the government pays for these substances into line with the prevailing market price. In concluding, although some may seek the assistance of the shadow minister for health to complain that the monetary advantage that they previously enjoyed has been diminished, in the end the taxpayers and the patients will benefit from the reduction in outlays for particular drugs and, after all, it is for the patients that these policy changes have been introduced by our government. Debate adjourned. Marriage Equality Amendment Bill 2012 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. Dr LEIGH (Fraser-Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (20:19): This is the fourth occasion on which I have risen in this place to speak on the topic of same-sex marriage so I do not intend to recite the arguments and the cases that I have spoken about in previous speeches nor my respect for those who have a different viewpoint on this. WhatI do want to do in the short time available to me is to broaden the philosophical basis for same-sex marriage. The case has, I believe, been made on the basis of equality-a value which many Australians hold dear and which is fundamental to our unique Antipodean notion of egalitarianism. People have spoken about same-sex marriage in the context of social justice and the recognition and protection of fundamental political and civil rights. But in my view the equality case is equally matched by a small 'l' liberal case for same-sex marriage and by a conservative case for same-sex marriage. Recently, conservative leaders in the United Kingdom and New Zealand have moved to allow conscience votes on the floors of their parliaments to take place on same-sex marriage-a marker as to how quickly attitudes are changing on this critical issue. Prime Minister Cameron has said that he supports same-sex marriage not in spite of his conservatism but because of it. He says: I think marriage is a great institution I think it helps people to commit, it helps people to say that they're going to care and love for another person. 'It helps people to put aside their selfish interests and think of the union that they're forming. 'It's something I feel passionately about and I think if its good enough for straight people like me, its good enough for everybody and that's why we should have gay marriage and we will.' New Zealand conservative Prime Minister John Key said: 'My view has been that if two gay people want to get married then I can't see why it would undermine my marriage'. In New Zealand's parliamentary debate over the Marriage (Definition of Marriage) Amendment Bill earlier this year, conservative MP Maurice Williamson delivered a rousing speech that went viral on the internet. He spoke from what I would regard as a small 'l' liberal perspective when he said: … all we are doing with this bill is allowing two people who love each other to have that love recognised by way of marriage. That is all we are doing. We are not declaring nuclear war on a foreign state. We are not bringing a virus in that could wipe out our agricultural sector for ever. We are allowing two people who love each other to have that recognised, and I cannot see what is wrong with that for neither love nor money. I just cannot. I cannot understand why someone would be opposed. I understand why people do not like what it is that others do. That is fine. We are all in that category. But I give a promise to those people who are opposed to this bill right now. I give you a watertight guaranteed promise. The sun will still rise tomorrow. Your teenage daughter will still argue back to you as if she knows everything. Your mortgage will not grow. You will not have skin diseases or rashes, or toads in your bed. The world will just carry on. This bill is fantastic for the people it affects, but for the rest of us, life will go on. So do not make this into a big deal. This bill is fantastic for the people it affects, but for the rest of us, life will go on. That is a beautiful exposition of the small 'l' liberal case for same-sex marriage. I want to speak briefly about the personal experience of Reverend JanisR Huggett, a constituent of mine who wrote to me last year and said: I am a retired Uniting Church ordained minister who would certainly have experienced both personal joy and legal benefit from being able to marry my partner before she died three years ago. Instead, I had to cope with her brother challenging her will and being forced to continue to declare my legal as 'never married' rather than 'widowed'. After all our years together, that is so unjust. The church has been much more supportive than the government, in case you are wondering about Christian views on this subject. I would like to recognise many of those on the other side of the house who would like to vote for same-sex marriage if a conscience vote were allowed, including the member for Longman, the member for Higgins, the member for Wentworth, Senator Sue Boyce, Senator Simon Birmingham, and New South Wales Premier Barry O'Farrell. I come to this from a perspective of equality. I acknowledge the hard work of Rainbow Labor, of activists such as Matthew Donovan, who worked as an intern in my office and helped prepare these remarks. But I hope that others will recognise that there are many good philosophical bases on which to ground same-sex marriage. It is not a battle between gay and straight, conservative and progressive, or left and right. It is an issue which ought to allow all of us to speak for our own electorates, and I hope the Leader of the Opposition will allow his party to do just that-a value that is in the spirit of his party. Dr JENSEN (Tangney) (20:24): This bill, the Marriage Equality Amendment Bill 2013, is an attack on marriage. Marriage is not just a word but an institution, and institutions exist because there is a common need for them and they serve a common purpose. The bearing and rearing of children is the fundamental purpose of marriage. There are those that see marriage as a simple expression of love. It is that, but far more, and the far more is the reason that same-sex marriage does not make sense. There are many avenues that people can and do use to express love, devotion and commitment to each other. Marriage is one of those, but it is far more than that. Marriage is about family. To those that attempt Orwellian doublespeak in calling this 'marriage equality', I say: you already have marriage equality. Anyone-gay, bi, heterosexual-can marry a partner of the opposite sex. There is no discrimination here. This bill is a piece of enabling legislation: it enables the dismantling of society as we know it. In essence, this bill is the apotheosis of a movement bent on legislating a social experiment. Gay marriage is a social experiment. Social experiments have poor results when viewed historically. One need only think of phrenology and eugenics, both of which, thankfully, have been consigned to the dustbins of history but not before having damaging social consequences. We have not yet seen the fallout from this social experiment where it has been undertaken in other jurisdictions. There simply has not been the time. Let us make haste slowly. The poison of this bill is that it replaces absolutism with relativism. This leads to crises of confidence and moral drift. Moral drift has social and economic consequences. Certainty is the most precarious and most precious commodity in the world. The social experiment proposed here today is too risky. The biggest risk is the unknown effect of normalising and legalising these types of microsocial compacts. It all pivots on the unknown and unintended consequences. How can a child be brought into such a union? Certainly not as a natural result of that union. Is it not difficult enough to educate our children on reproduction facts without the added complication of a child with two mothers or two fathers? Yes, there are marriages where the relationship between the parents does damage the children. Yes, there are loving same-sex and single parents, just as with heterosexuals. But, just because bad parenting by natural parents can be pointed to, is that any reason to accept suboptimal parenting more generally? Clearly, all things being equal, it is preferable for a child to be raised by its natural parents, followed by a heterosexual adoptive couple. I can state, having my own children, that children need role models of both sexes, and it is far better that those role models are parents. I now put forward the voices of the vast majority of the people of Tangney on the record for posterity. The following are arguments I have heard from my electors back in Perth: samesex couples are not the optimal environment in which to raise children; gay marriage violates the sacred institution of marriage; same-sex marriage would threaten the institution of marriage; we shouldn't alter heterosexual marriage, which is a traditional institution that goes back to the dawn of time. What will we be debating next? It is incumbent on all members of this place to step back and seek the counsel of time and good sense. We must not cave in to popular trends or fancies. Are we leaders or followers? Only two decades ago or less, the same groups of people pushing for gay marriage today were decrying the institution of marriage as obsolete. So what has changed? There is no discrimination in the area of superannuation or life insurance for gay couples. Where would the next cut-off point be if this bill were to get up? These are the questions that gay marriage advocates cannot answer. Until such answers can be given to married people as to why they should accept such a fundamental change to their current status, I cannot as a representative of the people of Tangney support the member for Melbourne's bill. bill, the Marriage Equality Amendment Bill 2012, having previously spoken in favour of the member for Throsby's bill in relation to same-sex marriage. I start by saying that this issue represents the first conscience vote in which I have participated as a member of parliament, and I want to place on record, as I did previously, the wonderful way in which I believe this debate has been carried out in this parliament but also within my electorate. I have tried to make myself as available as possible to everyone, of all views, in relation to this issue-views which are deeply held. Really the way in which those views have been expressed to me, with a deep respect for people who hold different positions, stands in my view as a model for how debate should be conducted in this place. I want to make that very clear. I particularly want to say to those people who hold a different view to me in relation to this that the way in which they have engaged with me has always been with the utmost respectfulness and politeness.",336,Myefo Not Only Are They Pushing These Patients Into The Public Health System But They Then
331,Mr Marles (Corio) (20:29,"I rise to speak in favour of the member for Melbourne'sAn argument has been put to me-one that I have empathy for-that a number of churches in my electorate feel a concern that pressure will be created by virtue of the passage of this legislation, were it to occur, that would require them to conduct services in relation to samesex couples, which they do not want to do. So in supporting same-sex marriage, as I do tonight, I do so very much with a renewed expression of the importance of the freedom of religious expression and the need for us all to defend that right. For me, this has been something of an unexpected journey in the course of this debate. There are many who feel that their rights to express their religious beliefs need defending within our community. SoI very much say that for me, in supporting same-sex marriage in the context of this bill, the other side of that coin is a renewed commitment to defend the right of freedom of expression of churches, including those churches that would see marriage as being only between a man and a woman and would conduct marriage ceremonies only on that basis. There has also been an argument put to me that allowing same-sex marriages represents the beginning of a slippery slope which will see other forms of relationship given legal sanction under our civil law. I do not agree with that argument. I do not see that we are putting ourselves on a slippery slope. In any event, all we can do in assessing this piece of legislation is to look at the proposition which is before us, which is about allowing the union of same-sex couples. In that sense, for me the arguments are very clear. There were 85 separate pieces of legislation in the last parliament which were amended to remove discrimination against same-sex couples in the areas of property, superannuation and life insurance. This was a non-controversial step to take, and it removed discrimination across the board and was rightly regarded as an unambiguous good. I understand that for some marriage is seen as being deeply connected to the issue of faith, but for many others it is not. Marriage is first and foremost a statement between a couple of their commitment to each other and then a statement by that couple to their community and their friends about their commitment to each other. The ability to convey that to their community is part of the commitment that they make to each other. In my view, to deny a couple the opportunity to make that statement of their love to their community is for them a denial of a human right, and to remove the denial of that right is, in my view, just another removal of an act of discrimination, which we did without controversy in the last parliament. So it is for that reason that I think it is very important that we provide for same-sex marriage to be a part of our civil law so that people are able to make that commitment to themselves, to their friends, to their society and ultimately to their country and so that it can be recognised as such. In doing so, I very much defend the right of individual churches to conduct marriages as they see fit as an expression of their freedom of religion. you would expect, I canvass the views of the Riverina electorate, which I serve, on a daily basis. I receive feedback on a variety of issues. I have received an enormous amount of correspondence on the issue of same-sex marriage, almost all of it from outside the electorate. The correspondence I have received, most of it in email form, has presented a range of different positions. I recognise that there are passionately held views on both sides of this debate. I have met with members of the national Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays and a number of local advocates for same-sex marriages as well as with members of the community who staunchly",340,Bills
332,Mr Mccormack (Riverina) (20:35,"I am opposed to this private member's bill. Asoppose same-sex marriage. I should add that overwhelmingly in all of the Riverina correspondence I have received, as well as an electorate-wide survey mid-last year, the level of opinion has been in favour of the retention of the Marriage Act in its current form. Indeed, of the 1,700 respondents to the survey collated thus far, the results were: 78.3 per cent against same-sex marriage; 17.7 percentage favour; and 3.9 per cent uncertain. On September 19 last year the lower House of the Australian parliament voted down the member for Throsby's private member's bill regarding sex same-sex marriage, 98 to 42. Whilst obviously I always consider the views of Riverina constituents expressed in letters, conversations and many other forms of communication, it is my personal view that marriage is a union between a man and a woman. As it stands today, I do not support any change to Commonwealth law which would diminish this institution. I believe that people are entitled to freedom of religion, respect, dignity, and the opportunity to participate in society and receive the protection of the law regardless of their sexuality. I remain committed to the Australian tradition of tolerance and respect. I therefore support the recognition of legal rights within same-sex relationships. In the past, the coalition has supported the passage of the government's same sex reform legislation, which has provided equality to all relationships on the condition that nothing in its terms affected the status and centrality of traditional marriage between a man and a woman. I intend to continue to participate in the public debate in a moderate and respectful manner and I am hopeful that issue will not become unnecessarily divisive in the community. I am certainly not opposed to having a conscience vote. I do feel that it is a pity this issue is not being dealt with by way of a referendum. I will conclude my remarks with comments by Bill Muehlenberg, who is a commentator of contemporary issues and who lectures on ethics and philosophy. He has reviewed a book by WilliamB May called Getting the Marriage Conversation Right in the National Civic Council's News Weekly edition of 25 May. He writes: He shows us what the real nature of marriage is, why it is so important for children, and how it fundamentally differs from non-heterosexual relationships. The most important aspect to this entire debate is to get a proper understanding of just what exactly marriage is. A faulty understanding of marriage will simply provide fodder to those who seek to deconstruct it for their radical purposes. Marriage is not the mere public recognition of adults who are in a relationship for the sake of personal fulfilment. Any number of combinations could be called marriage if that were the only definition. He continues: Marriage, properly understood, has always been about that which unites a man and a woman with each other and any children who may come from this union. Ms PLIBERSEK (Sydney-Minister for Health) (20:39): Last year I was proud to vote in support of the member for Throsby's private member's bill on marriage equality along with 37 of my Labor colleagues in the House of Representatives, three Independents and the member for Melbourne. I speak in support of his bill, the Marriage Equality Amendment Bill 2012 today. Since last year's third we have seen the pace of change continue to quicken as laws reflect the aspiration for equality in our community. Maine, Maryland and Washington became the first US states to legalise marriage equality through a popular vote. The New Zealand parliament passed marriage equality in April this year, with observers and MPs breaking into a traditional Maori love song. France's National Assembly passed their 'marriage for all' bill despite death threats being sent to parliamentary supporters in a divisive national debate. As fast as laws across the world change, in Australia our parliament lags behind the community we represent. Many Australians remember a time when homosexuality was illegal and formal discrimination provided shelter for so many other acts of violence and bigotry against gay men and lesbians. The path to greater equality has been difficult, and at times has been halting as successive governments have worked to reduce the shadow cast by this kind of discrimination: from decriminalisation to protections against workplace discrimination to de facto relationship rights. I am proud of the role that the Labor Party has played in that journey, and the 85 laws which we changed in 2008 to remove discrimination against same-sex de facto couples. As complex as the task of removing discrimination can be, at its heart is one simple idea: that we should all be equal under the law. The conviction which drove us to amend those 85 laws discriminating against same-sex de facto couples should energise us now to complete the task ahead. Once we accept that heterosexual and same-sex couples should be equal before the law, how can we reserve marriage for one group and deny it to the other? Marriage is both a religious and a civil institution. Other speakers have said that they would not expect churches to be forced to undertake marriage ceremonies for same-sex couples, and I agree that. Churches should not be forced to do that. But we are all members of a civil society as well. Many people enter the institution of marriage with no particular religious beliefs, but they still enjoy the rights and responsibilities that go with marriage. People often speak about the role of children in marriage, and as a married mother of three I know that marriage is a wonderful institution. But I have to say that I have gay and lesbian friends who have children too, and they would like to offer their children the security that marriage might bring to their relationship. There are also many couples who marry without ever intending to have children or, indeed, without being able to have children. They may marry later in life for the second or a third time, with no ability or intention to have children. Do we say that their marriages are worth less because they enter with no intention or ability to have children? All Australians should have the right to legal recognition of their relationships and the advantages and responsibilities that such legal recognition brings with it. All Australians deserve the full social acceptance that removing discrimination symbolises. Often our attention is drawn by the battles in courts and parliaments around the world, but the measure of what is at stake is found in those places where marriage equality has been introduced. On those days when marriage equality becomes real you see men and women who have loved each other for decades surrounded by their friends and family making a declaration of their commitment to one another. You see the truth that same-sex couples are no less loving and their commitment to one another is no less moving or affirming. All they have been waiting for is for the law to acknowledge that. I look forward to seeing those same scenes of love celebrated here in Australia. Debate adjourned. Debate resumed. That grievances be noted. Budget messages from Bonner residents about the failure of the Labor budget. Email after email, phone call after phone call; at every community event people are telling me just how tired they are of hearing this government blaming 2008 for the ills of our economy. This Labor government wants to blame anything and anyone else for the budget mess. Bonner residents are simply tired of the rhetoric from this government. All they want is answers and certainty. The residents and small businesses of Bonner continually tell me how they are suffering from the pressures of the high cost of living. I know that despite being very disappointed with this government in the past, they were hoping, against all odds, that something was going to change. Yet after six years they were again bitterly disappointed that this budget does very little to help Australian families deal with the financial strain that they are under. My constituents, especially pensioners, are very worried about the ever-increasing $300 billion debt. They have worked very hard for many years to support their families and to secure their families' future. They constantly tell me about how they worry that this massive debt will blight their grandchildren's future. They feel betrayed by the Labor government, and they have every right to feel that way. After six years, we have seen nothing but total disappointment from the Labor government. Their poor and reckless financial mismanagement of this country, in the middle of the biggest boom in 150 years, is truly shameful. Yet Labor are once again turning blue, by holding their breath and hoping against hope that the people of Australia will not catch on to the fact that they are, once again, peddling their hollow rhetoric, empty promises and economic deceptions. But, from what I am hearing out and about in the community, the residents of my electorate are not deceived. They are fully aware that this budget promises them, their families and their businesses very little hope for a better and brighter future. The only thing they can be sure of is debt, debt and more debt. The most inexcusable fact is that Labor has not detailed any credible path back to a surplus. This government has never run a surplus and it now seems sure, as our side of the chamber has been saying for four years, that it never will. Many Bonner residents have lost all trust in the government and its continued empty promises, especially considering that all of Labor's promised surpluses have turned into deficits. It is a disgraceful fact that this Labor government will go on record as having delivered nine consecutive deficits and a record deficit of $18 billion. What a truly shameful feat. Labor's continued poor and reckless financial mismanagement of this budget is yet further evidence of a government in deep crisis-of a government that cannot and must not be trusted to manage our great nation. My constituents tell me they are trying to live within their means, but how difficult it has become just paying for the basics. Yet what kind of example is this Labor government showing the people of Australia? If the government does not live within its means, how can we ask the",341,Bills
333,The Deputy Speaker (Ms Hall,The question is:,344,Grievance Debate
334,Mr Vasta (Bonner) (20:43,"I rise tonight in the hope of adequately conveying the Australian people to live within their means? This Labor government has to actually deliver on its words. We must consider that the revenue this year is $80 billion greater than that of the last year of the Howard government, yet spending this year is $120 billion greater than that of the last year of the Howard government. That really sums it up. This government does not have a revenue problem-revenue is going up seven per cent-it has a monstrous spending problem. The bottom line is that Labor has been shockingly cavalier with public money. The government seem to fail to comprehend and appreciate that the 'government's' money is in fact taxpayers' money. Labor's focus is always on how to spend other people's money, never on how to save it and certainly not on how to build a better future for Australians. I would like to see any household that would not be happy with a seven per cent year-onyear increase in revenue. I would like to see any business that would not be happy with a seven per cent increase in revenue. The reality is that this is a budget disaster of the government's own making. They have no-one to blame but themselves. Business sector representatives from my constituency regularly tell me that they are doing it toughheartbreakingly so for many businesses have been forced to close their doors. They feel betrayed by the government and further let down by Labor's pathetic budget. Businesses see this budget as a budget which embodies no coherent strategy to create jobs and growth or to provide certainty. They see nothing in it to restore an appetite for risk and investment and nothing to restore consumer and investor confidence. I have been contacted regularly by local builders and tradesmen in my electorate, who have shared with me their serious concerns for the shrinking building and construction industry. Their jobs and livelihoods are in jeopardy and now they are given even worse news, with a budget that takes a cleaver to infrastructure investment. While the small business community in Bonner was hoping for a 'game changer' to kick-start recovery in the small-business economy, the Labor government has chosen to make things harder for the engine room of our economy. How much more can they take? Single-income families in Bonner are nervous, too, as they see under Labor 243,000 jobs that have been lost already in the small-business industry. This budget delivers anything but jobs and growth. All it delivers is high unemployment and low growth. After six years, my constituents are desperately seeking stable and competent economic management. Mr Tanner from Carindale, a father of two, is a constituent of mine in Bonner and has contacted me regarding health care and the changes to Medicare. He is appalled that Labor has cut over $1.8 billion from Medicare rebates, the extended Medicare safety net and the net medical expenses tax offset. These cuts, which follow years of waste and mismanagement across all areas of government, will hit the sickest and most vulnerable the hardest. They will force up out-of-pocket costs for families already struggling with costof-living pressures. This just adds insult to injury for my constituents of Bonner, already under pressure after Labor's previous attacks have forced up the cost of private health insurance and cut Medicare funding for dental services. There will be no increase to Medicare rebates between November 2012 and July 2014, despite continued growth in the cost of delivering health care. This means the costs are likely to be passed on to patients directly, particularly in general practice, where there is a high volume of pensioners and concession card holders. To make matters worse, out of the pockets of honest, hard working Bonner residents is the government's health advertising campaign in the lead-up to the election, costing $10 million. This is a government that has failed to deliver on key promises in health, has forced up the cost of health care for millions of Australians and has diverted much needed resources into growing a bigger bureaucracy. Only the coalition has the plan, experience and discipline to return the budget to sustainable surpluses, reduce debt and provide real support to Australian families to help them get ahead again. Only the coalition can build a strong, prosperous economy and a safe, secure Australia and restore the hope, reward and opportunity that all Australians deserve. Human Rights spoken about human rights abuses in Vietnam and other areas around the globe. It is a matter that I am particularly passionate about, as I believe in a society where people's fundamental human rights are respected. Unfortunately, I am painfully aware of violations of human rights in other parts of the world, where millions of people live under constant fear and oppression. This includes Cambodia, one of the poorest countries in our region, with a population of 15 million people who live under the tight control of the governing political administration. When I think about Cambodia, the word 'tragedy' springs to mind as I think of the astronomical price its people have had to pay in the war for leadership over the years. We saw the impact of the Khmer Rouge regime led by the murderous Pol Pot throughout the 1970s. It resulted in the genocide of eight million people, through starvation, overwork and executions. This was the darkest time in Cambodia's history and probably one of the darkest times in the history of mankind. Unfortunately, Cambodia's tragedy does not seem to have ended there. The country is now facing growing criticism, both internally and from international sources, about its ongoing poor record of human rights abuses. Reports from Human Rights Watch note a marked deterioration in the situation, where protesters are being attacked, harassed and prosecuted by the country's security forces. Freedom of speech is virtually non-existent, with the government suppressing all forms of media and communication. This applies not only to the general public but also the international community. I met with Mr Sam Rainsy, the opposition leader and Leader of the Cambodia National Rescue Party, during his visit to Australia last week. Mr Rainsy has been in self-imposed exile since 2009, living in France after charges were laid against him following his criticism of corruption and human rights abuses by Cambodia's ruling party. The opposition leader has been unable to return to Cambodia to contest the election in July because of fears that he would be jailed on arrival. When I met with Mr Rainsy in Sydney he explained the effect of flawed governance under the current regime and outlined his concerns for the future of Cambodia. Various international human rights reports and, indeed, the UN itself speak of the political influence being exerted by state security forces as well as land grabs by influential and powerful people and corruption in business practices generally. It would appear that within Cambodia judicial officers seem to have been compromised through their political patronage and indeed it would also appear that the essence of leadership in Cambodia is one of exploitation rather than service. As the national election approaches in July this year, the",344,Grievance Debate
335,Mr Hayes (Fowler,"Chief Government Whip) (20:51): I have on various occasionsinternational community anticipates, regrettably, a surge in violent incidents, a crackdown on protesters and an escalation of human rights abuses. As the member for FowlerI have the privilege of representing the most multicultural electorate in the whole of Australia. Australia is known to be a country that is generous. Indeed, we welcomed over 20,000 Cambodian refugees following the regime of Pol Pot. More than 5,000 of those refugees actually live in my electorate. I have seen the wonderful contribution they have brought to our community through their culture, their religion and their capacity for hard work. They still care about the welfare and well-being of Cambodia and its people, and so should we. Cambodia's citizens continue to fight for their fundamental human rights, the freedom to speak their mind and the freedom to practise their religion-rights we take for granted here in Australia. Laos is a country that is very close geographically to Cambodia and Vietnam. It also has very strong ties in my electorate of Fowler. Its citizens too suffered the denial of basic human rights. I recently met with Reverend Sam Kounthapanya, one of the leaders of the local Laos community in my electorate. Reverend Kounthapanya approached me to raise his concerns regarding the political situation in his homeland. He expressed to me that, since the communist Lao People's Revolution Party took control of the country from the monarchy in 1975, freedom of speech and freedom of religion have been heavily curtailed. In order to minimise the chance of a challenge to the ruling party the government has maintained tight control over its population and even with multi-party elections I understand that the ruling party vets and pre-approves candidates. This is certainly contrary to the values of freedom and democracy. The Lao community in my electorate and across Australia have initiated a campaign to assist their homeland citizens to promote freedom of speech and democracy. They have initiated a petition to raise these issues and demonstrate that Australians of Lao descent stand strongly against human right abuses. There are currently 12,000 people with Lao ancestry in Australia. Happily, 2,500 of those people live in my electorate of Fowler. They are all very active members of the community. They make a great contribution. They are very strong and passionate in advocating on behalf of the citizens of Laos who are suffering human rights abuses at the hands of their government. On many occasions in this place I have spoken about the gross human rights violations against Christians and other minorities, including the Assyrians and followers of the Mandaean faith in the Middle East. Many who fled the atrocities in Iraq in 2003 have found themselves seeking refuge in Syria, Jordan, Egypt and surrounding countries. I recently attended a memorial service of a young 15-year-old boy-Adam Ghalib Al-Zuhairi. He was killed by a bomb during the shelling of Jerrmana in Syria. His 22-year-old brother was also injured. I met with their father, a refugee and resident of Liverpool in my electorate. Over a thousand local people attended the memorial service. Adam's father managed to relocate to Australia 18 months ago and was granted refugee status. The mother, two daughters and three sons, including Adam, applied for settlement in Australia and were awaiting the processing of their applications. The family fled Iraq in 2005. They fled the tyranny that existed there, only to find themselves in an equally dire situation in Syria. The reason they fled Iraq in the first place was their faith. This is the fate of a large number of Mandaeans, Syrians and various Christian minorities who were forced to move from their home in Iraq since the war started in 2003. This is certainly an issue that concerns all of us because we were part of the coalition of the willing. These people are the collateral damage of what occurred in an effort to get rid of Sadam Hussein but they should not be expected to pay the price. Burma the situation in Burma. I know that there is a feeling here in the parliament and particularly in the government that great progress has been made. The recognition of the Thein Sein regime's preferred nation name of Myanmar and the lifting of sanctions against that country demonstrate that the government has normalised relations. It is my view that everything is not okay and that the same problems that existed before the release from house arrest of Aung San Suu Kyi still exist today. I stress that if we delude ourselves and ignore the situation of the ethnic nationalities which make up as much as 70 per cent of the population in many of their own conflict-ridden states, we risk facing a situation similar to what happened in the Balkans or recently in the Middle East. The ethnic nationalities of Burma must not be sidelined in the engagement process. This evening, together with Dean Smith, I hosted a gathering of community leaders from some of the ethnic nationalities of Burma. We also had Colonel Nerdah of the Karen National Union and he is also a representative of the UNFC, coming from the border region of Thailand. Also present was Scott Johnson, a lawyer from Western Australia who frequently visits Burma and supports those ethnic nationalities that still struggle for freedom. The impression of those who attended this briefing was not anywhere near as positive or hopeful as is often made out. TonightI will outline the reality of what does take place in Burma. On the positive side, as we know, Aung San Suu Kyi has been released, along with around 400 political prisoners. Media censorship has been relaxed a little and the NLB party was allowed to resume 43 parliamentary seats in 2012-a positive step forward. However, these changes have taken place under the larger shadow of military abuses. There is a conflict in the northern Kachin state, there are severe problems in Arakan state and against that backdrop there has also been an interference in the delivery of aid to thousands of refugees. In Karen state there are over 300 Burmese military bases or outposts which have been reinforced with troops and armed at an alarming rate. To emphasise the reality, I quote the Human Rights Watch Deputy Director Asia who condemned Burma's human rights situation in the World Report 2013. Phil Robertson said: Burma's reforms over the past year are hindered, not helped, by international oversell and hasty praise in the face of continued serious human rights abuses. At the time when the Australian government recognises the country as Myanmar and abandoned sanctions the ethnic Arakanese Buddhists have been facing almost daily attacks from an Islamist terrorism base from across the border in Bangladesh, while still be persecuted by the Burmese government. Clearly this is not a record that anyone can be proud of and instead casts doubt on any acclamation from the international community. In Washington two weeks ago Thein Sein met with President Obama and both spoke of the changes that have taken place. Last Monday however the reality was made abundantly clear when the US State Department published its annual review of religious freedom around the world. The Buddhist majority country of Myanmar appeared on the State Department's list",346,Grievance Debate
336,Mr Simpkins (Cowan) (21:02,"I rise tonight to provide the House with an update onwith eight other countries where discrimination against ethnic groups was amongst the worse. In Chin state, the poorest state of Burma, the people have long been subjected to religious persecution and denied the right to build churches on their own land. Unfortunately it gets no better when we hear of the escalating fighting by the army to, literally, a war in Kachin state against the Kachin Independence Organisation and its military arm, the KIA. This year has seen the regime employ helicopter gunships, jets and heavy artillery with bombardment in Kachin. Civilian deaths have occurred. The fighting has resulted in the displacement of more than 90,000 civilians, and within the KIA territory humanitarian aid has effectively been blockaded. We must also remember that the National Human Rights Commission reported, in mid 2012, claims of abuses against civilians in Kachin. The report documented the systematic use of rape by the army. Unfortunately the commission has generally failed to challenge the government on such sensitive issues, its lack of transparency in reporting and the lack of real action it has taken. The commission is also strongly criticised for its recent report on human rights violations by the military which stated: The commission does not wish to make any comment on the interrogation of the suspects by security forces for security reasons and on their prosecution in accordance with the law. That is a weak response by them. Special Rapporteur for the UN, Tomas Quintana, has also weighed in on what is actually going on. Just two months ago he noted the seriousness of the situation in ethnic areas. He highlighted what are ongoing abuses such as attacks against civilians, extrajudicial killings, arbitrary arrest, torture and sexual and gender based violence. The report also noted the large gap between the form at the top and the implementation on the ground. For the Karen people, with 140,000 living in nine refugee camps on the Thailand side of the border, a war continues. The war began in 1949 and continues to this day. What started out as something like an autonomous movement now continues because of human rights abuses and atrocities. As I found out when I visited the Karen National Union leadership in Mae Sot in Thailand a few years ago, they want democracy in Burma but in a federalist framework. In April, in Shan state, Burma's military stands accused of massive human rights abuses as President Thein Sein was awarded a peace prize. While peace talks take place with the Shan state army, Burma's military has launched a new wave of attacks on Tang Yan leading to civilian casualties. The latest attacks apparently began on 15 April during the New Year Water Festival when Burmese troops launched new offensives in civilian areas. Mortar shells aimed at two villages injured two children and damaged a school and several houses. Army patrols are accused of detaining and beating civilians in at least nine villages and causing serious injury. This included children who were allegedly beaten with rifle butts. It is understood by media sources that a group of about 50 young men and women travelled to celebrate their water festival. They were taken by the Burmese army and forced to walk in front of them as human shields. The Shan leadership says that the Burma army attacks are in direct contravention of the ceasefire and calls into question the viability of the ongoing peace process between the government and the ethnic armed groups. If accurate, the report clearly undermines the decision by the EU to lift a raft of economic sanctions on the country. Many believe that the lifting of sanctions has the potential to line the pockets of cronies aligned to the military. I mentioned before that some 400 political prisoners have been released from prison yet, at the same time, laws still exist and are being used that allow the imprisonment of peaceful activists, lawyers and journalists. Ominous sounding names such as the unlawful associations act, the electronics act, the state protection act and the emergency provisions continue to allow the abuse of human rights by the regime that is being lauded by too many governments, including this one. We should also not forget the extensive use of landmines by the regime inside Burma. I have spoken of the reality and the clear differences between what is happening and the views of many Western governments. No-one should forget that Burma is made up of ethnic Burmese and a number of people of other ethnicities that amount to almost 70 per cent of the total population. This cannot be ignored and should not be ignored. Australia should not side with President Thein Sein when he says that his government does not need to support nonBurmese who are 'not of our ethnicity'. The 2008 change to the Constitution of Burma saw a quarter of all seats in the People's Assembly and the National Assembly reserved for the military. This meant that 110 military men sit in the 410-member People's Assembly while 56 military men sit in the 224-member National Assembly. Providing such a voting bloc to an unelected group shows that democracy remains nothing but a sham in Burma. I had also cast doubt on the bizarre reason why the International Crisis Group last month granted Burmese President Thein Sein its annual chairman's award and its mention of 'transformational leadership to bring democracy and peace to the people of Myanmar'. I would say there is no peace and there is no democracy. While it may seem appropriate and somewhat pragmatic to try to counter China's influence in the country by embracing the Thein Sein regime, democracy and peace remain illusions. In conclusion, what I have spoken about tonight is a reality. We must be on guard against romantic delusional or politically opportunistic notions that are not good for Burma. The problems are deep, they are long-held and they remain. Oppression and persecution of ethnic groups continue in Burma. The news reports demonstrate that the problems remain and that Aung San Suu Kyi's election in 2012 has not achieved any great improvements for the situation of the ethnic nationalities in the country. Given the undemocratic sham that is the 2008 Constitution, the abuses and persecutions against the Arakanese, Chin, Shan, Karen, Mon, Lahu, Palaung and Kachin ethnic nationalities continues. It is my view that the sanctions against Burma should be reinstated and that aid should be linked to human rights benchmarks. Department of Health and Ageing Ms BRODTMANN (Canberra) (21:12): I rise tonight to speak about the important work done by the public servants in the Department of Health and Ageing. The Leader of the Opposition would have Australians believe that we do not need a Department of Health and Ageing. That Leader of the Opposition has questioned repeatedly whether the Department of Health and Ageing needs all of its staff considering-in his words-they do not run a single hospital or nursing home, dispense a single prescription or provide a single medical service. I believe that the work of the Department of Health and Ageing is vital to the health and well-being of our nation. TonightI would like to talk about the range of services that the department provides. I will start by talking about the National Human Papillomavirus Vaccination Program. As we know, our own Ian Fraser from the University of Queensland, Companion of the Order of Australia and 2006 Australian of the Year was a pioneer in the development of this globally significant vaccine. Since 2007 this vaccine has been rolled out via a school based vaccination program administered by the Immunise Australia Program-an initiative of the Department of Health and Ageing. The vaccine protects young women against HPV infections that can lead to cancer and disease later in life. Widespread vaccination has the potential to reduce cervical cancer deaths around the world by as much as two-thirds if all women were to be vaccinated and if the protection turns out to be long-term. The vaccine can also reduce the need for medical care, biopsies and invasive procedures associated with the follow-up from abnormal Pap tests thus helping to reduce healthcare costs and anxieties related to abnormal Pap smears, Pap tests and follow-up procedures. Studies have shown a substantial drop in HPV related infection among the vaccinated group in Australia since 2007. Earlier this year the Minister for Health announced that from 2013 the current school based program for females aged between 12 and 13 years will be extended to offer HPV vaccination free to males aged 12 to 13 years with the catch up program in 2013 and 2014 for males aged 14 to 15 years. In addition from to protecting males from HPV related cancers and disease, vaccinating males will also help protect females from cervical cancer and from HPV related disease by reducing the spread of the virus. The HPV vaccine is just one of 16 vaccination programs administered by the Immunise Australia Program, and the Immunise Australia Program is just one example of how the important work of the Department of Health and Ageing improves our lives every day. Today is the start of Kidney Health Week and, along with many of my parliamentary colleagues, I attended the launch of Kidney Health Week in Parliament House this morning. Deputy Speaker, I am not sure whether you have, but I have been to dialysis units; I know many people on dialysis and so I know the importance of kidney health. I particularly know the importance of kidney health through all of the volunteer work I have done in raising awareness on organ and tissue donation. At the launch today, the Minister for Health and the Parliamentary Secretary for Health and Ageing announced that a kidney function test will be added to the minimum requirements of the annual cycle of care under the Medicare Practice Incentives Program, a program to encourage GPs to identify chronic kidney disease in patients with diabetes. People with type II diabetes are at a particularly high risk of chronic kidney disease. Through the PIP diabetes incentive, payments are given to general practitioners who complete an annual cycle of care to support patients with diabetes. This includes eye examinations, body mass and blood glucose monitoring, self-care, education, and reviews of diet, smoking and physical activity. The PIP is another initiative of the Department of Health and Ageing. According to Diabetes Australia, an estimated 280 Australians develop diabetes every day. The 2005 Australian AusDiab Follow-up Study showed that 1.7 million Australians have diabetes, but that up to half of those cases of type II diabetes remain undiagnosed. It is estimated that by 2031, 3.3 million Australians will have type II diabetes. Diabetes Australia estimates that the total financial cost of type II diabetes is about $10 billion. Of this, carer costs are estimated at $4.4 billion, productivity losses at $4.1 billion, health system costs at $1.1 billion, and an estimated cost of $1.1 billion was due to obesity. A reduction in the prevalence of type II diabetes will not only result in cost savings in the health budget but also result in increased participation and productivity in the workforce, which is so important and, most importantly, in better health outcomes and quality of life for Australians. There is no doubt diabetes is a serious health issue facing our nation but it is not all bad news. Up to 60 per cent of cases of type II diabetes can be prevented by healthy living and informed lifestyle choices. We also know that good blood glucose control and maintaining healthy lifestyle can significant improve the complications associated with diabetes. The Department of Health and Ageing-the department that the Leader of the Opposition wants to dismantle-runs important awareness campaigns relating to the lifestyle factors that can cause type II diabetes and other chronic diseases. Campaigns such as Measure Up, Swap it, Don't Stop it, and Quit, the National Tobacco Campaign are addressing the rising prevalence of lifestyle-related chronic disease. These campaigns lay the foundations for healthy behaviours in the daily lives of Australians. I have spoken tonight about just a couple of the areas in which Department of Health and Ageing does incredibly important work. The department also manages mental health policy and primary mental health care, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health programs and policies, and health promotion and disease prevention, to name but a few. Should the coalition be elected in September, the Leader of the Opposition wants to cut 20,000 public service jobs, 5,000 of them from the Department of Health and Ageing.. The coalition's proposed cuts will undo so much of the important work that is currently being done by the department. It will undo the considerable good that is being done in terms of changing attitudes to lifestyle risk factors for chronic disease, and it will without a doubt be detrimental to the future health of our nation. These cuts will also hurt my electorate of Canberra. In 1996, following the election of the Howard government, 30,000 public service jobs were cut across the nation, and 15,000 of those were here in the ACT-and one of those jobs was mine. SoI know first hand the implications of mass public service sackings. Not only did I lose my job but I witnessed the economic downturn in Canberra that followed. I witnessed the shops that closed down. I witnessed the businesses that went bankrupt. I witnessed the fact that people left town and our population slumped. I witnessed the fact that house prices plummeted. I witnessed a great deal of tragedy that flowed to not only the people who lost their jobs but also their families-I experienced it first hand as a result of being sacked myself. Just as I believe we must protect the economy of Canberra, I also believe we must protect the future health of our nation. While the coalition may not value the work of the Department of Health and Ageing, I do. While the coalition may not value the jobs of its public servants, these servants of democracy, I do. The coalition is promising nothing but pain and suffering for Canberra and, through it, for our nation. Remember 1996, Canberra. Aston Electorate: Manufacturing Postal Services Community Safety make some remarks in relation to three important local issues in my electorate. The first of those relates to manufacturing. As everyone across Australia knows, Ford will stop producing cars in 2016 and this once mighty car company, which has been in operation in Australia since 1925, will come to a halt. Our immediate thoughts are of course with the 1,200 people who will be losing their jobs as a result of Ford's decision. However, the impacts are broader than just the Ford workers. First, there are suppliers across Melbourne who will suffer, including businesses in my electorate who rely upon the car industry as their primary customer. Second, it delivers a very significant blow to manufacturing confidence. There is no single thing which has led to Ford closing, but the government has made things harder than they need be. First of all, the government introduced the carbon tax, which put up the price of electricity for Ford and for other motor vehicle manufacturers and other manufacturers. That is estimated to equate to an amount of $400 per Australian made car. Second, the Labor has added 20,000 new regulations over the last six years and has only taken out about 200 in that time. Thirdly, it has re-empowered the unions, particularly in the automotive industry but also across all manufacturing. Fourthly, it has driven down business confidence through its reckless spending, massive budget deficits and constant change to policies without proper consultation. Manufacturing today is in crisis and we need to rebuild confidence. If Germany and Japan and New Zealand can have strong manufacturing sectors, there is no reason why we here in Australia cannot also. I have a particular interest in this because my electorate has such a large manufacturing presence. There are about 1,000 manufacturers located in my electorate, employing about 10,000 people. Many are struggling. We recently had GlaxoSmithKline announce the closing down of its tablet-packaging business, which meant that 120 jobs from Boronia in my electorate would be lost. A factory from the Hastie Group has had to close down in my electorate, another prominent example, and many others have closed down in recent times. Many others that I speak to on a regular basis say that are struggling and that this is one of the worse years that they have ever had. We have to give hope to these manufacturers that times can be better. We have to give hope to the people who work in these manufacturing businesses that their jobs can be secure and that there are future growth prospects on the horizon. There are a number of things that we as policy makers can do-and that we will do should the coalition win government in September. Firstly, we can make energy cheaper for the manufacturers by getting rid of the carbon tax. Energy is one of the major input costs into manufacturing. The carbon tax itself adds between 10 and 20 per cent on top of everyday electricity prices. That makes things so much harder for those manufacturers. It operates like a reverse tariff because their competitor businesses from overseas do not have to pay those taxes. Secondly, we must get rid of some of the red and green tape. We have announced already that we will get rid of a billion dollars worth of red tape, and we will have a one-stop shop in relation to environmental approvals. Thirdly, we can provide some more flexibility in the",348,Grievance Debate
337,Mr Tudge (Aston) (21:20,"In the time that I have available this evening, I would like toindustrial relations space-and we have already announced our policy in this area-as well as, equally importantly, stamping down on union militancy. Fourthly, we must build some of the economic infrastructure which our manufacturers rely upon. Our manufacturers are often exporting, or they are selling their wares across the nation. Therefore the roads need to be in place and the rails need to be in place. Importantly for manufacturers in my electorate, the East West Link must be built so that they can quickly get from the eastern side of Melbourne across to the western side of Melbourne without being stuck in traffic. That would make it cheaper as well. All of these things would make a difference in reducing costs for local manufacturers and manufacturers across Australia. In addition to this, if the budget allowed, I would like to see accelerated depreciation of capital assets to take advantage of the high Aussie dollar so that they can purchase capital assets, capital equipment, today, frequently from overseas, quickly accelerate that and therefore set their businesses up for the future. Most of all, we have to give businesses confidence that they can invest, knowing that a government supports them. The second issue I would like to raise concerns Australian postal services. Australia Post is one of those services which are respected and valued across Australia. But in parts of my electorate people have difficulties accessing Australian postal services because of the tremendous growth in the Rowville and Lysterfield areas. They have traditionally relied upon the post office in Stud Park in Rowville. It is still there and it still does a fantastic job, but because of the growth in the area, particularly the eastern part of Rowville and into Lysterfield, they are now finding that that post office is always busy. They cannot access it. The shopping centre itself is busy, and there are always queues, particularly in the busy lunchtime period. Residents are telling me that they would like to see a post office at Wellington Village in Rowville. That is one of the new shopping precincts. It is a fantastic shopping precinct. I have been working with the owner of Wellington Village and some of the traders there to see what might be possible. One of the complications is that there is a licensing agreement with the Stud Park post office in relation to post offices not being set up within a certain radius, so we need to work through that. I can report that we have had some very constructive meetings with senior Australia Post officials, and we continue to have constructive meetings. I am hopeful that at some stage we will get some additional postal services at Wellington Village, and that would make a real difference to residents in that area. Finally, in the last couple of minutes I have remaining, I would like to talk about community safety. I recently did a survey of my electorate and had almost 2½ thousand responses to the survey. One of the issues which people consistently raised was community safety. In fact, of those 2½ thousand people, one in 10 respondents said that they did not feel safe in the Knox area, which I think is an extraordinarily high number, and many said particularly that they did not feel safe around the train stations or around the major shopping precincts, particularly at night. There are many things that we can do to assist in that, and I have been working with some of the community groups, particularly Mountain Gate, to develop community safety plans for their particular shopping precincts. Some security cameras have been installed in Boronia, and they are already making a difference, particularly when they are working in concert with the protective services officers who are now operating at the railway stations. But we can do more. I would like to see security cameras extended in Boronia. I would like to see security cameras in Mountain Gate and also, if they are required, in the Bayswater area-and possibly also in Wantirna Mall. If we had cameras there, we would see the same results that we are seeing in Boronia, where crime is reducing, police are reporting a much safer environment and people are feeling generally that they live in a safer community. That is one of my priorities-to have an impact on community safety; to work with my state colleagues who run the police services and support them whenever we can. Collectively I think we can make a real difference in that area. Automotive Industry Geelong, and my heart certainly goes out to the 1,200 workers in Broadmeadows and Geelong who will lose their jobs. Facing redundancy is a terrible thing-I saw it many times as a union official. It is a very hard process to go through and there is a great deal of uncertainty about where you will end up and what you will end up doing. It is important that the government packages that are put together deliver services to workers on the ground and make sure they have a future in some alternative career. We do not want to see any worker who is in that situation fall through the cracks. It is because of this issue that I rise to talk about the car industry tonight and to place some facts on the record. Whatever Ford's business issues, whatever the problems with their business model-which were plainly caused by the lack of an export model, and perhaps some decisions by Ford in Detroit prevented the production of an export model-it is important for us to acknowledge that any car maker in the Australian domestic market faces a hypercompetitive situation. It is an unusually competitive market where there are many different brands from all over the world coming into what is the freest car market in the world for a car making country. The problem has been exacerbated over the past few years by our currency-by the fact that the Australian dollar has been high, at first because of commodity prices and now because it is regarded as a safeguard currency. It is important to note that some 19 central banks, as well as many other foreign investors, are investing in Australia because they see it as a safe economy in a world which is awash with uncertainty, with debt, with low growth and with unemployment, and in a world awash with unemployment Australia stands as an island of economic growth, of economic certainty and of low unemployment. Paradoxically, our success is working against us-it is keeping our dollar high even as commodity prices trend lower. This is the first time that our country has faced this situation, and it is certainly an unpleasant fact that as our currency is stuck at a higher value than the fundamentals would suggest it should be at, our competitor countries, whether they be European countries or Japan or the US, either by accident or by design have currencies that are notably weaker than they otherwise might be. In the case of the United States and Japan, it is because they are printing money, trying to stimulate their domestic economies. Of course this has the additional effect of making their exports cheaper and so Japanese cars and United States cars are cheaper on the Australian market because not only is our dollar high but also their currencies are low. Of course Europe's currency, and this affects German cars in particular, are artificially low because even though Germany is not suffering a recession they have almost made certain that",353,Grievance Debate
338,Mr Champion (Wakefield) (21:30,"The member for Aston spoke about Ford in the Eurozone is and so the Euro currency is now very low compared to Germany's fundamentals. Unsurprisingly, we are getting a lot of German-made cars in the marketplace. This is likely to be a temporary situation. It is not likely to persist indefinitely, but we need to make sure that we provide our car industry with as much assistance as can possibly be given during this time to make sure that we retain the car industry and do not see more tragedies like what happened at Ford Broadmeadows and Ford Geelong. I certainly do not want to see it in my home state with Holden. Holden is of critical importance to the South Australian state economy. In a report prepared for the state government on 4 February 2011, Barry Burgan, who is with the University of Adelaide, pointed out that Holden's operations were estimated to provide at that time $1.1 billion in gross state product, or about 1.3 per cent of gross state product, and about 11,700 jobs, or 1.5 per cent of employment, and to directly contribute $65 million a year to state taxation. That is a critical figure, and it is important to know that he also had a look at what would happen if Holden were not there. The conclusion he came to was that, if Holden suddenly absented itself from the South Australian economy, we would lose in the order of $1.3 billion in gross state product, 16,000 jobs and $83 million per year to the state taxation base. It is pretty obvious that, without Holden in the state economy, South Australia would suffer from, in effect, a recession. It would be a brutal blow to my state, and I certainly do not want to see Holden go. Holden have issued a statement on the withdrawal of Ford. It was very unfortunate that Ford made their announcement on the same day that Holden were launching the VF Commodore, which is a really great car. But Holden's statement made it clear that they have a 10-year manufacturing plan that was agreed with the Australian government in 2012, based on the economic and marketing conditions at that time. The plan sees Holden investing $1 billion in the country and producing two all-new global vehicles, which will take production out to 2022. That is an absolutely critical thing for South Australia. Most importantly, one of the things that Holden's statement on 23 May 2013 said is: The industry needs swift action to make Australia's automotive policy settings clear, consistent and globally competitive as quickly as possible. It then goes on to say Holden is working closely with the Australian Government, Federal Coalition and the State Governments to ensure the viability of the industry … What Holden is begging for in that statement is a bipartisan commitment to secure this critical billion-dollar investment to South Australia and to the country. The most important thing about this investment is that it maintains an Australian choice once we are past these issues with the dollar, which will affect whatever government sits on the Treasury bench in this place. The high dollar is not a Labor-only issue, although some future government may be the beneficiary of the fundamentals changing around the world. But Holden are begging for a bipartisan commitment. I wish I could tell the House that we had that bipartisan commitment, but unfortunately we do not, because the Leader of the Opposition persists in maintaining the rhetoric. You would have heard him, on the closure of Ford, saying, 'We will keep the Howard government's plan.' I know people love being nostalgic in this building. More people on the other side of the aisle like being nostalgic about that period, and I understand why. Sometimes I get nostalgic for the easier times before the global financial crisis. But the problem is that that plan in effect will cut $500 million from automotive assistance, and Holden have made it very clear that, if that were to happen, it would jeopardise $1 billion worth of investment. If an incoming coalition government were to abandon in effect what has been a bipartisan commitment to the car industry in this country and jeopardise that investment or see it not happen, leading to the same situation that has happened at Ford, that would be a very great tragedy indeed, because it would plunge southern Australia-not just South Australia but Victoria as well-into a recession. We would suffer a localised recession. It might well have a very detrimental impact on consumer and economic confidence in Australia. So my plea to the coalition-and it is a plea-is to rethink that $500 million cut, rethink the nostalgia of the past, meet with Holden and give them the guarantees that they need to invest. Debate adjourned. Federation Chamber adjourned at 21:40 Football Federation Australia: Television Rights (Question No. 1362) Mr Hartsuyker asked the Minister representing the Minister for Sport, in writing, on 12 March 2013: Further to the Minister's answer to question in writing No. 1315 (House Hansard,6 February 2013, page 154), can he indicate why the Chairman of Football Federation Australia (FFA) thanked the Minister for Sport and the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy for their assistance in finalising the FFA television rights deal at the 2012 Australian Football Awards on 21 November 2012. Mr Albanese: The Minister for Sport has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: While the Minister for Sport did not play a role in negotiating the television rights broadcast deal, Mr Lowy may well have been acknowledging her broader support for football in Australia. Fair Work Australia (Question No. 1368) Mr John Cobb asked the Minister for Community Services, in writing, on 13 March 2013: Is it a fact that full supplementation is not being provided (by the Government) to organisations delivering Commonwealth-funded programs that are affected by Fair Work Australia's decision on the Social and Community Services Equal Remuneration Order; if so, (a) is she aware that this is contrary to the Government's agreement to meet its share of the cost over the eight year implementation period, and (b) from what Government department can these organisations now seek funding to cover the shortfall in order to continue services. Ms Collins: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) and (b) The Australian Government is committed to paying its share of the cost to organisations delivering in-scope programs in implementing the Equal Remuneration Order (ERO). This has been done by providing supplementation funding to service providers delivering these programs, generally through a variation to current funding agreements. Supplementation was calculated based on the current funding received, the wage-cost component of the in-scope program delivered and the ERO percentage increase for the relevant state/territory. All Commonwealth agencies issued offers of supplementation to eligible service providers in November and December 2012. If organisations considered their supplementation was insufficient, they were able to request a review from the department through which they receive their funding. Tropical Cyclones (Question No. 1372) Mr Craig Kelly asked the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, in writing, on 13 March 2013: In respect of the graph on the Bureau of Meteorology website showing the number of severe and nonsevere tropical cyclones from 1970 to 2005, (a) why has it not been updated since 2005, and (b) when will it be updated. Mr Burke: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: This is one of many pages on the Bureau of Meteorology website that show general background information about meteorological phenomena. Medical Services Advisory Committee (Question No. 1376) Mr Alexander asked the Minister for Health, in writing, on 14 March 2013: (1) For the calendar years (a) 2005, (b) 2006, (c) 2007, (d) 2008, (e) 2009, (f) 2010, (g) 2011, (h) 2012, and (i) 2013 (to date), what was the average length of time between the (i) Medical Services Advisory Committee's (MSAC's), and (ii) Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee's (PBAC's) first application to Cabinet for funding, and the commencement of funding (for approved applications). No. 155-14 March 2013 91 (2) Has she identified and attempted to enforce an appropriate length of time for cost effective medical technologies and treatments to be made available to Australians through the MSAC and PBAC approval processes; if so, what is the length of time. (3) Can she outline the reasons for the difference in time taken between MSAC and PBAC approval processes. Ms Plibersek: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (i) The Medical Services Advisory Committee (MSAC) is an advisory body and does not apply to Cabinet for listing or funding of medical services on the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS). Prior to 2010, the then Minister for Health and Ageing held a delegation to approve new items with a financial impact on the MBS of less than $10 million without having to go through Cabinet. As a result there are several measures that were not required to go to Cabinet. For those applications that were required to go to Cabinet the following assumptions were made to calculate the average length of time (in months) between a Cabinet meeting and the commencement of funding (implementation):  From 2008 to 2013 Budget announcement dates were used. For example if the measure was included in the 2009-10 Budget the Cabinet meeting date was estimated as May 2009; and  From 2011-12 to 2013 if it was able to be identified where a measure appeared in another Cabinet submission, the month of that submission was used. (a), (b) and (c) Previous Governments' Cabinet records are not available. (d) 2008 – 17.1 months (e) 2009 – 2.8 months (f) 2010 – 3.3 months (g) 2011 – 6.1 months (h) 2012 – 2 months (i) 2013 (to date) None (ii) The Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) is an advisory body and does not apply to Cabinet for listing or funding of medicines on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS). I, as the Minister for Health, bring forward submissions to Cabinet on the listing of medicines on the PBS. The average length of time, by calendar years, between the Cabinet meeting to the commencement of funding for all PBS medicines (considered by Cabinet) are the following: (a), (b) and (c) – This information is not available as it relates to deliberations of the previous Government. (d) 2008 2.7 months (e) 2009 3 months (f) 2010 not applicable (no PBS listing considered by Cabinet that were listed in 2010) (g) 2011 3.7 months (h) 2012 2.7 months (i) 2013 (to date) 3.4 months (2) Since 2009, in response to stakeholder concerns about lengthy, cumbersome health technology processes identified through the HTA Review, the Australian Government has undertaken a comprehensive overhaul of the management and governance processes relating to the MBS. This was done to improve not only the quality of MSAC's advice to government, but also the transparency, timeliness, efficiency and effectiveness of the processes that inform MSAC's advice. A medicine cannot be included on the PBS unless the PBAC recommends to the Australian Government that it be listed. Therefore, a positive PBAC recommendation is a very important step in the listing process. However, other steps generally need to be taken before a listing is achieved, such as pricing negotiations with the product's sponsor, finalisation of the conditions for listing, quality and availability checks and consideration by Cabinet. The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between Medicines Australian and the Government commits the Government to use its best endeavours to implement a maximum time frame of six months for consideration and decision by Cabinet. Cabinet consideration of PBS submissions within six months of the finalisation of price negotiations has been on schedule and applies to PBAC recommendations from July 2010. The Government has continued to meet all its commitments under the MoU. All high cost medicines subject to the MoU have been considered by the Cabinet within the agreed six month timeframe. All minor cost PBS listings continue to be listed within the usual timeframes, generally about four months. (3) In 2010 MSAC reforms were introduced to address timeframes for implementation of new medical services and to establish an alignment between the MSAC and PBAC processes where appropriate. The reforms have resulted in significant decreases in the length of time taken from MSAC consideration to implementation on the MBS. T-QUAL Accreditation (Question No. 1449) Mr Baldwin asked the Minister for Tourism, in writing, on 20 March 2013: What number of businesses in (a) Qld., (b) NSW, (c) Vic., (d) Tas., (e) SA, (f) WA, and the (g) NT, and (h) ACT, are T-QUAL accredited. Mr Gray: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: On 20 March 2013, the number of businesses that were T-QUAL Accredited were: (a) Qld 1780, (b) NSW 2421, (c) Vic. 1678, (d) Tas. 1056, (e) SA 1063, (f) WA 1206, (g) NT 360 and (h) ACT 114. Please note, the figures provided reflect the number of individual businesses that were T-QUAL Accredited and do not include those businesses that were accredited through more than one program, or those businesses that had more than one tourism product accredited. Tourism (Question No. 1451) Mr Baldwin asked the Minister for Tourism, in writing, on 20 March 2013: In 2012-13 (to date), what has his department done to: (a) facilitate the growth of domestic and international tourism; (b) address regulatory barriers to tourism, and with what partners; (c) support adequate planning and management of border security, transport linkages and safety to enhance tourism security, and with what government agencies; (d) ensure that infrastructure development contributes to the competitiveness of the tourism sector, and with what government agencies; (e) support promoting the development of innovative products, services or systems within the tourism industry to improve the quality of Australia's tourism products and services; and (f) actively engage with government agencies to ensure that the Australian Government's labour and skills policies contribute to a sustainable and productive tourism industry, and with what government agencies. Mr Gray: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) Under Tourism 2020, the Australian and State and Territory Governments are working in partnership to achieve Australia's tourism potential by addressing supply-side barriers to growth.

The Pharmaceutical Policy Branch took advice from a range of sources including other Divisions within the Department and related agencies when developing the comprehensive list of stakeholders to contact directly. All stakeholders were notified of the diabetes review on 4 October 2012, via the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) website. On 16 October 2012 the Department wrote to key stakeholders via email and postal mail inviting them to provide submissions.

Ms Plibersek: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) Anticoagulation Review The Terms of Reference did not change once the Review commenced. The deadline for public submissions did change. The original deadline for the open public submission stage was 21 February 2013. Following representations by two of the key stakeholders that more time was required to finalise their input for the review, the deadline was extended by 48 hours to close on 23 February 2012. (i) The extension was broadcast in a Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) website update, and by direct email to the stakeholders who requested the extension. (ii) A full public consultation was undertaken. Additionally, individual sponsor companies had the opportunity to meet with the Reviewer and the Department of Health and Ageing, and were also provided several opportunities to comment throughout the review. An open stakeholder forum was also held. (b) Statins Review The Terms of Reference did not change once the Review commenced. (i) The deadline for submissions by sponsors was changed following a request by sponsors. Sponsors were notified by a letter from my Department. (ii) On2 December 2011, my Department provided relevant companies with a copy of the preliminary Report of the Statins Review. In light of the size and complexity of the preliminary Report, the consultation period in relation to the preliminary Report was extended from 16 December 2011 to 1 March 2012. An information session for affected sponsors was held on 8 December 2011. As per usual practice, the report for the Statins Review was sent to the affected sponsors in May 2012. The report was considered by the sub-committees of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) (Drug Utilisation Sub-Committee (DUSC) and Economics Sub-Committee (ESC)) in June 2012. It was then provided to the companies for comment prior to consideration by the PBAC in July 2012 with the recommendations of the PBAC provided to Government thereafter. The report was not made public, but a public summary document agreed between sponsors and PBAC is available, as per usual practice, on the PBS website at http://www.pbs.gov.au/info/industry/listing/elements/pbacmeetings/psd (c) Anti-Dementia Review The Terms of Reference did not change once the Review commenced. The deadlines for submissions did not change. (d) Diabetes Review The Terms of Reference have not changed since the Review commenced. The deadline for public submissions did change. The original deadline for the open public submission stage for Phase1 (Blood glucose test strips) was extended by two weeks, following a request by key stakeholders. The deadline for the open public submission stage for Phase2 (insulin pumps) was not extended. However a longer period was allowed due to the Christmas break. Stakeholders had a total of eight weeks to provide a submission for Phase 2. (i) Stakeholders were notified of the submission deadlines via email and the deadlines were provided on the PBS website. (ii) A full public consultation was undertaken for Phases1 and 2 of this review. An open stakeholder forum was also held for Phase 1.

Health: Reviews (Question No. 1477) Mr Alexander asked the Minister for Health, in writing, on 21 March 2013: During the (a) Anticoagulation Review, (b) Statins Review, (c) Anti Dementia Review, and (d) Diabetes Review, (i) what data has been solicited from sponsor companies, (ii) how long were sponsor companies given to provide this data, and (iii) how does this timeframe compare with the time taken by the Pharmaceutical Benefit Advisory Committee to evaluate a submission for listing a new medicine on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Ms Plibersek: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) process is a 17 week cycle from receipt of submission, to PBAC consideration. To date post-market reviews have taken anywhere between seven to 12 months, including multiple periods of public consultation. Submissions for new or extended listings on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme are initiated by sponsors, not by the PBAC or the Department of Health and Ageing. Major submissions must be submitted 17 weeks prior to the PBAC meeting, with companies provided one week to provide additional information or comment in response to the Drug Utilisation Sub-Committee (DuSC) and Economic Sub-Committee (ESC) processes, before provision to the PBAC for final consideration. In respect to post-market reviews, it is a matter for individual sponsors as to the data they provide in their submissions to a review. Post-market reviews to date have followed a process of initial public call for submissions of between six and nine weeks depending on the time of year. Additionally, all reviews have provided for a period of subsequent comment on the draft report, for a period of between two and six weeks, again depending on the time of year.",355,Grievance Debate
