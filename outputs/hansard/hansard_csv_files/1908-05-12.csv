2,Mr Deaki N (Ballarat,"Minister ofyears. The duties that we have recently been called upon to discharge must have too often recalled to our minds' the absence of that right honourable gentleman to make much reference necessary to one who has held so high a place in our judgment and so near a place in our hearts. I rely upon the recollections of honourable . members far more than upon any imperfect observations that can be offered to. present a fitting Tecognition of the public work and worth of the late Mr Kingston. Among the unforgettable incidents in this House was that in which, when speaking from the Ministerial corner, the right honourable member-whos e clearness, cogency, and masterfulness gave him at all times the attention of honourable members-firs t discovered to us unmistakable evidence of the extreme debility to which he was being reduced. After that our hopes for his return to health rose, flickered, and fell from time to time when he paid occasional visits, though they, were far between, to this House. When, nevertheless, at the close of the last Parliament his constituents returned him unopposed they honoured themselves in honouring him in the sight of all Australia. with one of the most memorable personalities revealed in the history of this young country. We knew him in the politics of his own State, distinguished and f r u it f u l in achievement, in the Federal campaign, among the most earnest and able advocates of union; in the early years of the Com' monwealth, one of its most conspicuous and commanding figures. . He was a great Parliamentarian, exceptionally endowed with the capacity for shaping legislation, and a great administrator, imtiring, and consumed by a devouring zeal for the work of his Department. power in this House, by speech and act, exercising a constant and potent influence' on behalf of the principles that he obeyed. So powerful, so notable, so strong a figure-such a force of will, of intellect, of character, and physique-ha s been rarely given to us, endowed though the earliest years of this' Continent were with many remarkable men. I venture to think that he and the late Mr Seddon stand together as two tribunes of the people. We knew him in private life a loyal comrade and staunch friend, with a warmth of affection which attracted and bound us to h i m ; a man who, though accused of dominance, was-^as we found in our private intercourse with him-gentle , patient, [393]2 and considerate. He was also a true Australian from the first to the last days of his long public career. He gave himself unreservedly to public service, standing from his earliest to his latest years as the spokesman of a clear, bold, comprehensive policy for his native country. No man more enjoyed the confidence of the masses, and no man more deserved it, for he was wholesouled in their cause. I beg to move That this House places upon record its deep appreciation of the great public services of the late member for Adelaide, the Right Honourable Charles Cameron Kingston, and its profound regret at his untimely decease. take leave to second die motion which has been moved by the Prime Minister, and to concur in the tribute which he has just offered to the memory of our departed friend. In years gone by, the late Mr Kingston and I , as brother Premiers, had manv opportunities of meeting and of conferring upon Australian affairs I soon recognised his good qualities as a representative of South Australia, and a loval champion of Australian, interests. In all the stages of Federation, Mr Kingston We have now finally parted played a conspicuous and distinguished part, and when the Union was proclaimed, and he became a Minister of State for the Commonwealth, his abilities became even more conspicuous. I believe that he has fallen a victim to his unstinted labours in the .public interest-that his intense zeal and devotion to duty laid upon his strength burdens so excessive that even his magnificent constitution, in its prime, could no longer sustain them. Hence the tragic breakdown to which the Prime Minister has referred-henc e those prolonged sufferWe knew him as a great ston threw all the power j f his massive brain-al l his splendid energy-int o the cause of reform. Mistakes he made-h e must have made mistakes-but , like all his good qualities, his mistakes were of the open and fearless kind. The attractions of a professional career appealed to him in vain. He preferred to ease and opulence, a life of pubiic servicea life of strife ancl poverty. He made sacrifices which were not made in vain, because he helped to lay the many foundations on which the destinies of this young Commonwealth will safely rest in days to come. Standing, as we dd here to-day, sorrowfully in the shadow of a great bereavement, political antagonisms vanish for ever. We, and all Australia with us, mourn his loss-",14,Death Of The Right

He treated me as I would wish if I had a father to be treated. watched his political career, having been in correspondence'with him since the early nineties. His was the first voice raised firmly and decisively in advocacy of the policy of a White Australia. He showed clearly, by returns prepared in 1892-3, the way in which aliens were admitted at the ports around Australia. He should also be gratefully remembered because of an act of statesmanship which -placed him upon the highest pinnacle attained by any Australian in this regard. I refer to his action when the second Chamber in the South Australian Parliament .objected to a certain course pursued by the House of Assembly. He appealed over that Chamber to the sovereign power of the people. He showed that it dominated any second Chamber and that its creators, the people, could not be controlled by that section of Parliament. Mr Kingston certainly overworked himself. As a true, brave fighter who never spared himself he certainly shortened his life, because his constitution was such that he might have been expected to live much longer. The fates have ruled otherwise, and I say now that Australia will ever remember this great man for two achievements-hi s fight for the White Australia policy and for the sovereign right of the people to dominate any Legislature. No man did more to show that the people .possessed such a right. I desire to express my personal obligations to the deceased statesman, because when, he was physically too ill to appear on the platform to assist me. in mv big fight, he helped me by his brain and his pen. No document evor published in the Melbourne election influenced so many people as did the leaflet which circulated through the length and breadth of the city to which was appended the signature of Charles Cameron Kingston.

I have keenly tralia in making it one of the most advanced of the group, but also the great services he rendered to the Commonwealth.
