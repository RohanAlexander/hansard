It being 10.59The following answers to questions were circulated: Immigration: Asylum Seekers (Question No. 644) Ms Gillard asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, upon notice, on 19 August 2002: (1) Has an arrangement been reached between the Australian and US governments for Australia to accept Haitian and Cuban asylum seekers processed by the US at its offshore locations of Puerto Rico and Guantanamo Bay in return for the US accepting Iraqi and Afghan asylum seekers processed on Manus Island and Nauru; if so, what are its terms. (2) Does this undermine the commonly accepted principle that refugees should, where possible, be resettled near countries of origin. (1) In June this year I responded to similar questions put to me by Mr Andren. My response then, as it is now, is that there is no ongoing arrangement or agreement with the US government to resettle Cuban or Haitian nationals. In line with our commitment to international responsibility-sharing, Australia agreed to resettle one Haitian family and one Cuban family who had been intercepted in waters off the United States and found by the US authorities to be in need of protection. The Government has no plans at present to resettle in Australia more people who have sought asylum in the United States, although we would consider further requests in the spirit of international responsibility-sharing. Australia’s obligations under the Refugees Convention are geographically limited to refugees in Australian territory. Our resettlement program goes beyond any international obligations and reflects Australia’s desire to assist refugees who are in greatest need of resettlement as a durable solution to their plight. (2) A commonly accepted principle is that asylum seekers should take the first opportunity to seek refuge and not move on to other countries in search of a better resettlement outcome. This position should not be confused as a principle that refugees should be resettled near countries of origin. Transport: Roads to Recovery Program (Question No. 690) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 19 August 2002: (1) Of all Roads to Recovery funding granted over the life of the program, how many applications specifically identified bicycle tracks and bicycle provisions as part of the planned upgrade to local roads. (2) Which local councils were granted funding for such upgrades. (3) What improvements did these local councils identify to be carried out with the funding. (4) Are funding applications that include planned improvements for bicycle tracks and bicycle provisions assessed differently from those without bicycle provisions; if so, why. (1) 153 projects have been nominated by 53 councils specifically including cycle or dual-use paths.

236,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Environment: Kyoto Protocol (Question No. 786) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, upon notice, on 20 August 2002: What are the full reasons for the Howard Government refusing to ratify the Kyoto Protocol on greenhouse gas emissions. The Government has consistently stressed that to be effective, a global response to climate change that includes participation by all major emitters of greenhouse gases is needed. The Kyoto Protocol will make only a modest contribution – around 1% to reducing the growth of global emissions. Even as a first step it does not provide a clear path towards developing countries’ commitments and the US has indicated that it will not ratify. Together, these countries already produce most of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions. If Australia were to abandon our long expressed and clearly articulated requirement for a more comprehensive global response it would send a signal to investors that Australia was prepared to expose itself to binding legal commitments that could in the future impose costs not faced by neighbouring regional economies. For Australia this is not a trivial matter, given the significance to our economy of investment in greenhouse intensive industries such as natural gas, alumina and aluminium production, coal, paper and metals processing. The Government will continue to develop and invest in domestic programs to meet the target agreed to at Kyoto of limiting greenhouse emissions to 108% of 1990 levels over the period 2008 – 2012. Australia is within striking distance of achieving this target. The Government has recently announced a climate change agenda that will focus upon the longer term, covering not just the next few years, but a twenty to thirty year time horizon. The strategy is intended to ensure that Australia can continue to cut greenhouse emissions, while maintaining a strong, competitive economy. It will be developed over the coming months working with all levels of government, business and the community.

(2) Were there considerable delays in processing the visas of many of the other participants in the Conference, forcing them to withdraw. (3) Was human rights activist and keynote speaker for the Townsville 2002 Network of Women Students Australia Conference, Dita Sari, one of those excluded. (4) Were any women from countries other than Asia, Africa and the Middle East denied visas. (1) No. Advice from Australian overseas posts is that from a significant number of visa applicants intending to attend the Townsville International Women’s Conference, a total of 12 people registered to attend the conference had their visa applications refused. These refusals were based on a range of factors including, in some instances, the presentation of false documentation, an inability to demonstrate any business or personal link to the conference, and a lack of capacity of some applicants to be able to financially support themselves while in Australia. (2) There were no unreasonable delays in processing the visa applications of people registered to attend the Townsville 2002 International Women’s Conference. The temporary evacuation of most visa processing functions from the Islamabad and New Delhi offices to Bangkok during June and July resulted in greater work pressures, but processing was conducted within standard timeframes. (3) Ms Dita Sari applied for a visa at the Australian Embassy in Jakarta, on 25 June 2002. She was granted a visa on 1 July, before the conference started. Ms Sari was notified of the grant of visa on 1 July, but did not collect her passport until after the conference had ended. (4) There is no indication that any participants from countries other than in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East were refused visas.

240,Dr Kemp,The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:,91,Questions On Notice
241,Mr Costello,"The Minister for Finance and Administration has supplied the following anAustralian legislation does not use the term “people smuggling”. However, Subdivision A of Division 12 of Part2 of the Migration Act 1958 contains various offences relating to bringing, or organising to bring, groups of non-citizens into Australia. (3) The figure of $1,237 million represents the additional amount provided over the five years 2001-02 to 2005-06 to fund the Government's comprehensive and integrated strategy to fight people smuggling and illegal migration. The strategy involves a coordinated response by several agencies including Defence, Customs, Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. The additional funding package includes the cost of reception and processing of unauthorised boat arrivals; construction and administration of immigration reception and processing centers; regional cooperation funding; increased coastal surveillance; and funding for reintegration assistance for asylum seekers who return to their country of origin. All the specific measures are set out in the 2002-03 Budget papers. (Refer Budget Paper 2, Budget Measures pages 132143 for all relevant expense measures. Capital measures are set out in portfolio order from page 173.) (4) The 2002-03 Budget Measure ‘Additional funding for the War Against Terrorism’ provided additional funding to support Australia’s contributions to the US led War Against Terrorism in Afghanistan and the Persian Gulf. The deployments include a special forces task group and other personnel in Afghanistan and a naval task group supporting the Multinational Interception Force implementing UN security council resolutions in the Persian Gulf and other activities in the War Against Terrorism.",91,Questions On Notice
